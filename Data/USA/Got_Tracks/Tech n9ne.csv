Worldwide Choppers,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada, diktafonuna tak
Kağıt, kalem bir de ilham alınacak
Tam gaz choppers, havada düşman avına çıkalım
Akalım, haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım

We started in the Midwest
Now we 'bout to take it all over the world, baby
This is the pinnacle, yeah, Tech N9ne

Follow me all around the planet, I run the gamut on Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with no apology
Pick 'em off the panic, a little manic, ‘cause I gotta be
Frantic, I’ma jam it, ‘cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at Mama Nakas
I can pop at you proper ‘cause I’m partners with Waka Flocka
Give me the top of hip-hop
And watch him make 'em rock
 
with a show-stopper
Chakras poppin' off the (Worldwide Choppers)
If you anybody, you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul is it
Loaded, cold as the polar get
Wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo, it exploded, the flow, behold it, ‘cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a
, never to get free of the real
Better get just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and I’ma chop
He came and he went tomorrow
But I’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up
I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up
, I be the ish when I split 'em up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backin' up in the gut
Everybody be knowin' I be actin' up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss? Fuck anybody! Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust ain't nobody tough when I'm standin' up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin' he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killin' everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developin'
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but lovin' every second of this

De vil alle tjekke, når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det, beatet - jeg vækker det
I ved hva', der kommer ud af min mund
Hænger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om, vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle ""vild fucking chopper""

What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playin' Hamlet
Syllable burnin', that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree like I was peelin' pecans
But instead I'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sand-a-wich
Pick up a .22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fuckin' beat and I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne, twist up the pine
And smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes? Well sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
With an alien probe

I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces
Of my enemies ‘cause of cannibalism
Breakin' them off into particles
They get in a predicament that be never reversible
‘Cause a nigga be too versatile, 
makin' you nervous
You could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly, 
then I'ma give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy
Hoppin', I don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up shoulda stayed home
My alien knowledge be makin' other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'ma be shinin' on them haters
I'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us, ‘cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm—

I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

See, now they ask when I'ma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it and when I'ma drop it, my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'ma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “What in the world is you provin'
When you were already the best?” and “What the hell is he doin'?”
Well, I'ma be choppin' and cuttin'
And breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
And fuckin' everything up 'til I make no further mistake and
Bustin' everything up 
like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shuttin' everything up, especially the ones who be hatin'
They lovin' everything until I got 'em stutterin' stupid
You hear 'em now? 
“D-d-d-d-don’t do-do-do-do it!
P-p-p-please, wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest”
And now I'ma come and kill 'em
Get 'em, hit 'em and finish 'em
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them
And then I'll hit 'em again at a minimum
Repeat it, comin' to killin' 'em
Then he be gotta be drillin' 'em
Thinkin', “They gotta be feelin' him!”
Spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em
And gettin' 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin' him
Hopin' you're listenin' and you're payin' attention
And you're witnessin' the way that I be christenin' in the mic
And gettin' in the zone, I be flattenin' and packin' in
People from the front to the back and
They got me actin' a fool,
 
I'm black and, nigga, now I’m home!

I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
I’m choppin' ‘em: call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killin' 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical

I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend 'em and send 'em and you can feel me
Diggin' up in your brain and bringin' the pain
They often wanna kill me
Fillin' 'em with that fury, get up and hurry
You can feel the real me
Comin' up with that shit, I'm havin' a fit
And you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And poppin' often, hit ‘em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathin'
You’re fiendin' and dreamin' to find a demon, name insane
I’m a worldwide (Chopper)",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-worldwide-choppers-lyrics
Speedom (Worldwide Choppers 2),Special Effects,2015.0,"I get to bustin' like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him purty hot (Uh)
'Cause he knowin' that Tecca Nina's a dirty chopper (Uh)
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though?
I said to Seven, ""Richie Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinkin' Eminem was a gamble (uh)
Guess not, 'cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""What we doin'?"" – I said to him, ""Let's chop!""
So now the people finally get three of the best locked (Uh)
Never be another chopper's comin' so let's rock, nigga! (Uh)
You're on, people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer makin' a tour strong
If you thinkin' of battlin'—uh, you're gone!

Nobody can catch him, he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if you got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em, and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
This is it, man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And if fans will lift hands, we'll get dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands up movin' the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em
I beat 'em, I burn 'em (
Then I let 'em melt
)
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up (Uh)
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton, make 'em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine (Okay)
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm livin' in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast, or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half-ass deliverin' I'ma eat your dinner (Yum)
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys (Okay)
I jump around, so do that mean that I'm rubberized? (Okay)
Me and N9ne master, meaning we murderize
We'll bleed 'em, beat 'em 'til they be gone, feed 'em!

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills
Of ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled
Or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink (You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in Vics
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after tonight
I'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like, and attackin' it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pent-up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver
Screwed up my limo, collided with the center divider
I went through the window
And ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
'Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You've been yellin' dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate,
 
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious
Of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity that I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
To make 'em picket, I pick a day to be a prick
Then I'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level, incredible
Head full of Red Bull, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away? Uh-uh, not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake, eatin' lobster, steak
And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take, like Kanye walkin' up on the stage
For Beyoncé, like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher
With his gun insured, hundred words
In a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the—

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you trippin' to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's havin' to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we givin' the light, a lot of energy
We reppin', beat checkin' he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Running you down, in front of your town
You ever makin' fun of the clown, I'm gunnin' you down
We doin' it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch!
Would never be choppin' without Slick Rick
I got it from the record ""Lick the Balls"" and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, 'cause every time I be droppin' I get bit
I'm hearin' a lot of rappers, they tryin' to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em and we kill 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista rule it—and this it

Fragile,Something Else,2013.0,"You said you'd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...

We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...

Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
N9na be givin the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'ma look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real - I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit,
 yes I'm

We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...

Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop...
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music

We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change

Am I a Psycho?,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"I see you looking at me
(Psst, hahaha, over here)
Looking at me, so I ask

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho

You’re crazy! I like you, but you’re crazy
My tours paid me, so I used that dough to allure ladies
To manure bathe me
Never that, my mind's for sure shady
Pure Hades,
 
Rev X said that he couldn’t endure to save me
Why do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row?
When I felt that burn,
 I palm the clitoris, I'ma get her wet
Sorry to get carried away
I feel stupid 'cause I ain’t did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
I get vexed so N9ne bit her neck
Open! I try to contain it, but that dame thang’s soakin'
Alter ego say: ""Why you let them gangbang folk in?""
Strange Lane
 hopin' I can maintain copin'
But ain’t nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I’m sufferin', I’m stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin', hollerin', I'm a dog
Afterwards I like really hot scaldin' water on my balls

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho

Mom? Dad? I’m no longer the boy you're used to seein'
I’ve changed a lot, plus I’ve grown to hate every human bein'
My mood swings have now turned
My dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I’m doin' things I don’t normally do when illusion seem
To be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would've put down the mic
And said, ""Fuck it, I'll never rise to fame.""
But with the wicked wreckage I contain
I could probably jeopardize your name
No lovey-dovey, let’s ignite the flame
If you’re lucky you'll survive the pain
Sorry, that ain't very merry to say
Why is this game so scary to play?
Well, let me think, 'cause every day
My balls are gettin' too hairy to shave
Pause a minute, I'm stressin' again
If I go to Hell, then Heaven's to blame
I don’t mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think I’m hella deranged
When I was seven years old
I fell on my head and I severed my brain
You think I’m lyin'? Then ask my mama
Nigga, she'll go tell you the same—
Should I be ashamed? No
I’m livin' my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent out of shape
My nigga, let me ask you this

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho

I stab you with this mic, and rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
Matter of fact, I’m rappin' through you
Never say my motherfuckin' name
Unless you absolutely have to
I am not no fuckin' jacket with no matchin' shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Can’t even see you niggas, y'all wish I was rappin' to you
Matter of fact, act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion to use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes; it's just like old-fashion voodoo
Y'all ain’t even the shit, no, y'all ain’t even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my two boots
So I’m slappin' you fools with wooden paddles, you stupid
Babysittin'
 
little bastards
 like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic, but it’s more like schizophrenic
And I can't sleep, can anyone tell me
Just where my medicine is?
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man, I swear I'm all about my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here, give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look
If I were to peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma feel it crack when I hit it
Then I'ma split it back when you heal it
Damn it, Bobby boy! What in the hell?
What in the heaven? What in the Earth?
Where is your mom? What are you, cursed?
Where are you from? Where was your birth?
Where was you first? Why weren’t you in church?
Why is there dirt all on your shirt?
Man, I think that you’re goin' berserk

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I’m a psycho
I guess I’m a psycho",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-am-i-a-psycho-lyrics
So Dope (They Wanna),Something Else,2013.0,"Wanna sit beside a sick and seductive sinner, see
Something so sinister seeking sookie somethin' like a centipede
Slitherin',
 she's searchin' for synergy
Suckin' my seed, chakra tease stickin' sippin' Hennessy, shittin'
On the hissin' I'll spit you out of commission
Position the bitch and dip in when I mention slip in submission
All of this is to quicken the copulatin' and kissin'
My operation is drippin' to the bottom, shakin' and strippin'
Odd when I bust, 
KOD
 
put 'em in Necropolis
Givin' this rod to the good broads, and they givin' they bras to us
With the gift to break up a couple that's monogamous
Stop with the probs and take off your effin' draws, bitch and rock with us
Been giddy 'cause them titties are on my chin-chinny
Chin, 
did he pretend he was again kiddie?
Suckin' the crème de la crème
 and the skin pretty
Dim lit he, then hitting thee trim in Sin City
Let it in, I'm the medicine, get her wetter than ever been
Never better than a veteran, level that in the bed again
Rockin' red, I been in my letterman, bright as Edison
Like I said I sin, head I win at events and I’m fetishin'
Open up, you hoes, you know what's up
Told you when I bust, her clothes they wanna just
Go right off her butt, for sure they wanna cut
Explode, drop a load 'cause the flow is

So dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine
So ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)
So Thorazine, so morphine
So dope that they wanna have sex
So dope they wanna (fuck)

She said ""I heard that you was packin', I'ma fan of your rappin'
I'm feining action, where you really from, Cape Town?""
I said ""Yeah bitch, and I was born in London
So I'm thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you with the crumpets and some cake now""
How did we get so stereotypical?
Fairly so seminal now I'm flowin' to the pinnacle
I see you got some friends who just lookin' to get it from the medic
So I'ma 'bout to pivot on 'em and I make rounds
Want a piece of the beast from the East?
Complete in the sheets, release beats, got her man down
Your boy just never could compete with us, please better believe
We skeet, now wipe yourself off with a ShamWow
Me and Nina run deeper than receivers
I beat up all on her beaver now she wanna feed the meter!
Speakers bumpin' tweeters from here up into Medina
Leave us pleasin',
 all your nieces screamin' ""Take Me to Your Leader""
I'm trainspottin' the vein rockin' the lane off and came droppin'
Serious game all on your brain, rottin'!
Pick a million pricks and I'm pretty sure that you missed the one
That hits you on the clit, quick drip, I be the main option
Blowin' the slut up just for good luck
And I'm fuckin' the kitty up 
with the angel dust in my nuts
Trophy lovin' cup and that dopin' is such a must
That it's troublesome to give up when they lust
So dope they wanna

So dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine
So ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)
So Thorazine, so morphine
So dope that they wanna have sex
So dope they wanna (fuck)

Lovin' to get it up in it in the back of the room and make 'em scream and
Goin' up in it deep as she was feindin’ when she saw my weiner
She told me she ready for anything, I'm talkin' anything
I stuck it up in her jaws, 
I’m breakin' walls like I was Katrina
Not even know me but she know my flow is OG
She told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely
Homie if I was only right there instead of a Sony
You claimin' the pussy wet but don't tell me baby, just show me
She ask if I'm comin' up with the mask in my entrance
Sinner in a second, real spitter like every sentence
She was there for repentance, ever since I was an infant
I'm damagin' the vagina, remind you I'm filled with vengeance
Hit 'em whenever they wanna run up and they doing it 'cause I rap and shit
I really don't care, whatever it takes to get 'em up on the mattress
I could have been the one that's on the run for busting a gun
But this is way more fun to get up in these motherfucking actresses
In bikinis and suckin' on my zucchini
She told me she wanna be me while sippin' Apple Martinis
Fuck it if I'm a meanie, she probably would never leave me
Shit I can play eenie meanie from sly and cuff on my weenie
And now I see 'em whenever I hit the stage
They posted up in the audience, all of 'em filled with hope
Knowin' they only wanna be in the presence
Or get affiliated with you because you was dope
So dope they wanna

So dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine
So ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)
So Thorazine, so morphine
So dope that they wanna have sex
So dope they wanna (fuck)

Hey now Tech, you know I've been the type
To not go all in on hoes I've been around
But the flow I spit gets hoes all in the zone
That I won’t talk shit but oh my damn they wrong
And these men calling in, they're wondering if I’ma get with a little dick
They got no common sense and with no collage in
Their position is probably something insignificant
If you think I’m a bitch 'cause I probably missed the game you kickin'
They be hollering, hope I acknowledging because I have been methodically
Dropping the common knowledge that I don’t get down like that
Now they be hounding a bitch or probably get with a trick
Or a treat 'cause they dogs and they all gon' bark like that
I’m killing the game, killing the game, killing the game
So he feeling me, he want to bang, I want to wait
So he get at me, he want to say shit that make
Me think that he gon' rape me if I don’t stay
'Cause I got that sickening style that built me a crowd
And men and women feelin' me now and it's freaking me out
'Cause I’m just here to figure it out and what this is about
But I’ma say it’s getting so wild that it’s tripping me out
'Cause I’m not here to kill the morale, just kill all these sounds
But lately when I spit to a crowd, these men just reach out
And they tell me that they women is down, they gettin' aroused
And they be tryin' to give me they child with a gin and a smile
They say they wanna (fuck)",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-so-dope-they-wanna-lyrics

Yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Yeah, yeah, hell

Froze over, when you thought you could hold Yoda
With flows older than the first sold cold soda
Grow more for my bros those rojo soldiers
Them cincos are at it again, blow doja
I am like Iron Mike, back in the day
My rhyming's iron height, defiant flight
Try and bite, like a razor in a candy apple
A taser in a jammy, tackled
By a neighbor with the family shackles
Laboring a man he's gaffled
I get angry, I sip bombs (Chea!) on your rich lawn
I was brought up Muslim and Christian
I been studying Chrislam (Chea!)
That's not a thing so I place this John
In your chicks palm
Give her something beautiful to kiss on
'Til I spit one to her lip balm (Chea!)
I've been rhyming since Reagan in politics
Polished it then got a big wallet where all of my dollars sit
To the wall is split, then I gotta sick the casa, your god exists
'Cause a lot of chicks holler ""Mr. Chopper you're hot as shit""
Ah!

They say I'm the best at what I do
After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'
So I tell them all to put that on somethin'
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything

Yeah, I guess I'm supposed to come with that fast flow
Woo! I guess I'm supposed to come with that gas flow
But no, I'ma just spit it, I'ma get it good
Wish you would tell me what I should do
I don't know, hit the door
Uh, yeah, feel like I been here before
Maybe I have but I can't fuck with it
Hit 'em with a semiautomatic, watch 'em duck with it
Speaking on lyrical ability
Everyone in my vicinity, blowing they mind like Kennedy
I got no love for the enemy, somebody tell me the remedy
I'm like what's good, been fine
Tell me what's on your mind, rewind this shit
My message is beyond this shit
I put that on everything, I'm just being honest, shit
So what's up, hold up
Tech, I'm sorry for the hold-up but I been on the road
Should have had this verse to your ass a long time ago
When I put that on everything, I ain't had a minute to myself
But I been living like I ain't finna see tomorrow
I ain't focused on no wealth
I been living good, I been feeling fine
Pass the sriracha, I put that shit on all of mine
Busting like Columbine combined with a terrorist's mind
That's been confined to four walls for some time

They say I'm the best at what I do
After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'

Sriracha, the flavor popper
We gotcha, even haters jock us
These choppers invade the knockers then blocker
Disintegrating every chakra, eager to off ya
You can bet that we doin' it proper
When I put the bullets in a fully with a hoodie
Ain't nobody gon' stop us, nobody gon' top us
We leave 'em with no option, and leave 'em with no conscience
Even though I can achieve it no problem
And even though I could've seen what they watchin'
TV with a DVD, I can repeat what I see, these streets jockin'
Easy, if it need be then I just eat beats
Like I'm Eazy-E, Compton, I eat meat like I'm EBT shopping
Credit Card max, bend the bars back
Fuck your hoe, get brain and all that
Run in your house and bring your whore back
Sever your face and dead the doormat
Who got the keys to the rented Corvette?
Can't catch me, I'm the man in all black
I been on that shit since Katt been on crack
Fuck that, I been nice way before that
Can't ignore that, you can try though
But you gon' end up next to Dido
I'm that pen that wrote the Bible
I'm on your skin like vitiligo
Sing for the moment, I hit the high note
Someone please let Elton John know
Tell the lieutenant I'm Hect Camacho
With a Catholic priest and the Pentecostal
Why y'all niggas wiggidy wiggidy wack, get a nigga in the back
With an umbilical patch, jump in the middle of the track
None of you niggas can act so y'all niggas are packed
Come and get it again, fuckin' a bitch in the whip
Give me your moment to fall, I'm gonna fit in the car
I can do better than yours, I can be ready to brawl
I can be shattered and all, nobody want to be hard
Better be ready for war, tell me who ready for more (Joyner!)

Straight Out the Gate,Something Else,2013.0,"Together we are, a powerful force, as one, mind, body and soul
Let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce us because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love, combined with our strength, we ward off pain and stress
Technician I am, wholeheartedly, in life and in death

Okay I get it, I'm an F.O.N Freak of Nature
But the pen is gonna heat the paper
Was a problem in a incubator
Mom and dad was a creature maker
I never need the shaker
The beef from table, the teacher later
Now you're the beast awakener
I don't think the streets are safer
My misery seepin' through my delivery
Bitter we givers and they keep my figures, don't try to nig
ger me
The grave digger is hither, he is no kidder, see
Consider the dark energy, sinner be inner me
Black diamonds all around 
callin' all the down definites
Who saw the clown and now steppin' with that tall amount of big tech and shit
Aah-ooh - 3 times
My people they know what that defines
What the people are lovin', and that's T-9
He rhyme and make 'em make a beeline
They 'bout to hate, make out the great
They mouth'll break if they don't pay off the cake
Stay out my face, you don't want me to lay out the fake
Flip the sick and pray thou relate
Damned and incredible straight out the gate

We are the darkness, but we’re leaving
We are the gods that are deceiving
We are the painters of blind-faith
We are the children of your rivals
Holding guns while reading Bibles
Go ahead and seal your fate
Straight out the gate

You see the face of EBAH on Tech Nina
Evil Brain, Angel Heart I remain in the dark and anointed
With holy they console me when they know we
Sin got a hold of me, why they let go of me? I’m double jointed
I’m wicked and I represent the sickness
All you fraudulents feeling I’m falling offending the father
I place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss
Nobody but you and without any food and no agua
I blackened the sun on you bitches
Sat in the dungeons and ditches
Yappin is one of your glitches - halt it
The Kraken has come with the quickness
Back and I’m plundering chicks
And laughing you dummies trip with Exalted

Fuck the industry, independents

Fuck your fame, I became the name of a gun
Now they parents hate Aaron because they sons
And daughters wanna be martyrs believing in my art, ain't it young?
All I got is my balls and rap

I'm appalled that y'all want me to fall calling craps
Suckers hate it, now they crawlin' back 
'cause I'm tall as Shaq
And I'm always up for brawlin' bats
Strange Music saved my life
I was fuckin' it then the music became my wife
Nobody on this planet can tame my mic
Call me crazy, don't matter, fucking insane I like

When the sun's beam melts
Everyone screams help

When telling all survivors welcome to Something Else)

And I say Kansas City

Hood Go Crazy,Special Effects,2015.0,"Hello?
(I want to par-ty) Huh? (You want to par-ty?) Yeah
(We need to par-ty) Cool (let's have a par-ty) lemme get up

Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make a dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one, so it's guaranteed you can do you
'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo
Kansas City natives and we all a lil' coo-coo

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin'
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in then dip off, look for another chick then they pissed off
'Til I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross three thick friends
We mixin' these licks when they big friend wanna lip off
So I told her kindly, ""Get lost, bitch""
This my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit!!

College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche four door, white (TRU)
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her, I'm tryna knock up
I'm tryna put a singer in her so I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender, thank God for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Tryna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, ""Don't mess around with them pitbulls""

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)

Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'gnac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up!
This Kan' City, shit's ran gritty
In the summertime the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Everybody got they hands up like (whoa!)
See a bad bitch like (ohh!)
This whole damn city fuckin' go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the Mo

Dysfunctional,Sickology 101,2009.0,"First entry for Sickology 101: Dysfunctional

Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
N9na wanna get dollars, don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way 'cause back in the day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might
Dude's tryin' to pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be,
 'cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish, surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded when exploded you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Women be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues
 and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push me, play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoodie
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, 'cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be,
 pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need 
depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine
But if you get too close you'll find out that I

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?

Wanna be on TV just to show out for mi mama
But breakin' into colored houses, admit
That it's a bitch when you sick like this

Puttin' all the face paint I can put on
Put my black jeans and black hood on
That's your TV I just stood on
With a faded habit this brother swerves when I sip vodka
I'm the latest rabbit; in other words, I'm a hip hopper
You disc jockers never played me, you said my shit stopped ya
2001, I mixed opera

now every clique's got the

Listen to this quick chopper flippin' and poppin'
With the spirit of Pac and Big Poppa!
Ya! This for your motherfuckin' rap quotes
My shit is surprising and shocking like Barack votes
The traps broke when I rapped with Tunechi and Stacks though
OG Muggs said I'm gonna be the first rapper to cross over to black folk

Lookin' down yo' blouse lady, and everybody is in tune

They got a beautiful woman and givin' poon
They want it cause I'm 'bout to be big and boom!
Breakin' into colored houses is hard, mayne
Cause everybody got (Guards)

I get many enemies with this Forbes list
But I get rid of energy from piss poor pricks
Can I get to heaven?
All I get is threatened every time I get more chips
Gotta grip four fifths for the sick forces
I gotta fight all of the night with cops, Crips, Bloods with sore fists
And them Nazis wanna hem Hadji, up it ain’t too many men godly
Hideous so many cities bust in, Ferguson to Libya, Benghazi
Human equality never been a level playin field man it been wobbly
So many circles of sin rob me, that’s why we go angel to grim Cosby’s
Yellin' this to my superior, the grading of love is inferior

About 300,000 to Syria, are you serious?
I could never think of burying my children p-p-period

They gotta suffer the penalty cause of our education

What these babies blood drippin' for?

Only way people are gonna be able to kill off a demon is
Pick up a gun and be ready to put it between him a nigga be screamin'

Every day flatten the beast
At least Anonymous is hacking for peace
And yet we gotta bust cause we packing a piece
Choke not another one of us for the snappin' police

Of negativity, trippin' with me, you runnin' for your life

Finna witness the murderous monologue of a menace
Comin' from out of a sinister formidable place
I can let you know the ins and the outs
And I can spit it wicked, twisted
And you can see by the look of my face
Gimme the mic and I’ma mangle it, tangle it
Definitely the people see that I got the hang of it
Pity you gotta try to make a mockery of a city who
Block 'em and block 'em, buck at you baby we dangerous
Came to get strange with it, bang with it
Stop and get a little untame with it
Get this chopper like I'm fully a bully with a hoodie
Should he get up and take 'em out or spit 'caine with it?
Well the answer is right before your eyes - who do you despise?
Killers who chop you we got to stop you
Pop you partner, you gushin'
Get up outta the way when Tecca Nina be bustin'
Gotta give it up, I’m a veteran like Edison
I’ma light 'em up and get in your head again
I’m better than ever, never let up feather in, death he be fetishin'
Sever it, hit the mic and then we pedalin' medicine
I’m a chopper, chopper, chopper!
Automatic kickin' the ammunition
Killin' the competition, no it ain’t nobody
Hotter, hotter, hotter!
Damagin' everything and everybody
You know we on a mission, listen to me
How can I make you understand I'm a general
Even if you poppin' the competition is minimal
Kan-city killers and you can bet that we criminal
The demon inside of me keep on tellin' me when to go
So I’ma keep reppin' the midwest choppers freakin' flows
And I’m 'bout to be up on top of this and truly be bustin'
Beggin' for mercy, you punk I ain’t givin' you nothing (nothing)

Lyrically we be the best in the Midwest and we caked up
I ain’t talkin' about women, I’m talkin' about paper
D-Loc and Dalima enter the center
And get coded and when in the competition we for sure to kill 'em
I spit like a fully and ready made, through any type of weather
With the Beretta tucked right under my sweater
And we hotter than lava
The way that my gillas be keepin' it poppin'
Partner you tight, but my gillas are better
We keep it choppin' like a blender, eatin' boys up for dinner
Guillotines, we chop your heads off, and throw 'em out the window
We too critical, we ill and you walking away looking so pitiful
The AGT we be the number one contenders
(When it come to the street we still post on the block)
40 Cal. on my lap and my middle finger up to the cops
On the way to the studio to go and make another hot track
They be lovin' the way that we spit it when we drop
They call me D-Loc, so the functioning definition of a soldier
My opposition is more culture than Rocha
I spit like a Tommy and anybody in my way I’ma fold 'em
And me and my gilla gorillas want it 'cause we the coldest boys
Be tryin' to battle 'cause they want our position
But they can never get in it because we better and bigger
And like I told you we the number one competitors dealin'
Workin' their way up to the top and they won't stop til they get the millions
In the hone of the century D-Loc and Dalima
Chemistry, you can never cross with them
Igganas idah the ebe ossinbay the yricala
Iggertra eavela otherma uckerfay’s lost
You can try to read us, you can try to beat us
Try to get your speed up, but it ain’t gon' matter
'Cause after we get finished bustin' there ain’t gon' be no laughter
We takin' over the map with Tecca Nina the master (master)

When I’m off in a zone, I get to representing the city of the K
Hollow your brain ‘cause I’m a disaster
Dalima get ridiculous if I’m comin’ at you
Leave ‘em in a predicament 'cause I’m a style master
And I’m not impressionable, now just so you know
I make 'em sweat, cause I’m the best with the flow
Whenever you wanna flex we can go, keep stressin’ your cold
And I bet I leave your neck on the floor
Midwest finna blow like (C4 with a low strike)
‘Cause the energy is the bomb
I can tell that you’re fascinated by the way that we rhyme
And we glow like when the four strike with the fire
(It ain’t nothin’ you can say though)
‘Cause I’m sipin’ on Henny and bustin' like a semi on enemies now
Irritated with the haters that be coming around
So I’m kickin' like a relevant but an arrogant style
Meaning that I’m really sure so
I’m too sick for a cure, so
Ain’t a need for a doctor
My verbal word play, be making your nerves shake cause I caught you
Pants down when I popped you
Now let’s take a trip through the valley of real gill
Strange individuals with a militant ill skill
Pop a collar and holler at the broads with real skrill
Get down for the cause, cause we flossin' big wheels, (what up with it?)
Don’t be acting like you get tough with it
When the choppers come out the truck spitting
All of the Strange gill killas gon' be devoted to leavin' your body smokin' when really you can’t get up with us
(And that’s game that’s proper)
‘Cause whenever I’m bustin’ it’s like a full heart stopper
Dalima, Tecca Nina, Kaliko, and D-Loc
Rippin' ‘em up with the flow 'cause we’re Midwest Choppers! (choppers!)

We can sang or we can bang

Hey Tech, watch this!
Kali Baby, you better act right, get right
'Cause I’m the baddest nigga hookin' up with the fastest badass
That'll hit you with the lyrical, lyrical miracle whip, incredible
Bitin' like the head off a cerebral
Diggy-diggy down, once your figgy frown at the c-c-clown
Them hounds is bound for your town, diggy-diggy-diggy
And if you lookin' for the sound
You can be found by the nigga wearin' the crown
Are you really with me?
And when you hear it nigga then zip it
The exhibit make you wanna reposition your pivot
When we write it and spit it, we makin' somebody get it
And if they won’t hear it and deal it, but forget it to get it (Stop!)
Or I can keep babblin' on
Or rattlin' off at the mouth while we travelin'
And I’ll be thinkin' it all be speakin' about the things that I be doin'
A couple scooping up out my mouth this album ‘bout to ruin
You and you and you
And I can stop with the drop of the Caribou
And if it’s on and poppin' it’s due with you and you
And I won’t hesitate to chop you when chewin' you
Uh huh, while they doin' you
And if you lookin' for the better in the veterans who can bust
You got the Kali gun for fun
And if you throw, we bustin' back at you when you attack
I’m on the track I hope they puttin' down the gun
(Dalima’s a chopper) Chopper!
(D-Loc a chopper, that Tecca Nina’s a chopper)
The Kaliko will knock your block off
You never see it coming, hit you when we were gunning
You running we walk off (We walk off)
'Cause it's more than bread that we're wanting (We flaunting)
And we comin' headhunting
No we won’t stop ‘til we get to the top
You in the way, then we midwest chop ya (Chop ya)

2 cups will get her hot and out of her clothes ya know?
Caribou Lou it's like

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come

Half a bottle of 151 off in a jug
1 cup of Malibu Rum, baby that's whassup then you
Fill the rest of the jug with pineapple juice and it's crackin'
The only defect is waking up like what happened
I like red light parties and fed right bodies who like
Bread like Dolly and head right totties at night
Aribou Cay oulay
Terrible day you pay the liquor store teller
With no hair or toupee, touché
Get the party jumping, keep the hotties humpin'
I like 'em thick and juicy so don't Pilates nothin'
Drinkin' too much Lou you
Might be karate punchin' or at the back of the club
Attending the naughty luncheon
Satin, coolaid gives you hella 151 November dog so run kitty run
We gon' drink it until we dumb-ditty-dumb, bum-bitty-bum
Here Kansas City come so give me some

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu

Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
We gon' party 'til the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come

I see double, I see triple
Might be trouble, might see pistols
We ain't tryna hear you haters sucking on sickles
We living it up in two double O sizzle
Wonder you may bro, until your day go
Why I'm the one to drink you under the table
And all the ladies I will do in time
Once you become a member of my drinking club you will find Tech N9ne
Trying to tell her truly get nudey yes
I even do L-words in their fruity bizutti
Like to drink it and yell slurs at the movies
If I'm heated I'm off to get Caribou Lou to cool me
Created by Tech Nizzle and T. Wizzle one high day
We mixed it up and then I say we treat Caribizzle like our lady
Originated in Kansas City, Missouri since 1995 baby

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
We gon' party 'til the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come

Tar bender I need a drother nink
Release Caribou Lou in a party and it's utter kink
Insane manie, keep 'em coming then I'll remain zany
'Cause Sadatay baby I'm trying to make you my main damey
For the rest of the night, girl you're sexy, you're tight
Come to me casa and see the chakra flexin' you right
Groupies at 12 o'clock man I'll crawl, I'll go
Yeah I'll recruit 'em, but I better not crap that's all I know
Yep in my white T and Nikes you might sight me
Slightly hyph and might see dry heaves
Die we shall not need I.V.'s beside me Siamese
(Tech!) Huh? (You're not making any sense!)
I might make her wanna swing her Prada
But once I get up on the mic and do my thing I got her (Tech!)
Hey, batter batter batter batter sah-wing-a, batter
He can hit, he can hit, he can hit, sah-wing-a, batter

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu

Like I Ain’t,N9NA,2019.0,"Ayy, like I ain't on 1, 2, 3-Pac
Like I ain't finna bust when my homeboy make the fuckin' beat drop
Bustin' a cap in the wack when I'm rappin'
You really need to trust in the fact that I'm back and I'm slappin'
The industry for ducking the cat when he rap with a passion
When I'm in this piece, I crush in a fashion
Like I ain't never ate in this game (Chuh)
Like I ain't never seen or had me some big thangs
Like I ain't been around the world and with so many different girls
And kinky parties that it could lift the spirit of Rick James (Jesus)
Like I ain't a fixture and never knew Twista
And never did music for the Alpha Dog picture
Like I never script the pledge in the scripture
Or had a hit song 'bout my own liquor mixture
Do it like I wasn't a starter that was on the Carter (Weezy)
Wasn't in art of my cousin, the Water (Fizzy)
Nothing was bartered, we're bussin' and touchin' the heart of
People that's lovin' the hardest stuff ain't no charted (Pleasies, chuh)
Like I never got signed (Woah)
Not a one, not a two but three times (Chuh)
Like I never did get the cheddar or see shine
Like it's sleep time for peeps' minds on T9
Like, if these rhymes (What?) really never ever happened (Chuh)
'Til right now, like pow, I got it crackin'
With the pen and pad, without no back end
Tryna stack and get action
And pull the cash in is the way that I'm rappin'

Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the 'Zou
Like I, like I ain't

Toured with the Jay Rock, with the homie K-Dot
Like I ain't never had the allure for the pay slots
Stressin', like I didn't step in the session with the Seven
Never guessin' the effin' cure is to spray thoughts (Brrt)
Like I never had a shot (Pow)
Or a song with the white guy Dre got (Woo)
Like I didn't have L.A. locked
Never went on the set of Ballers with Mr. Baywatch (USO)
Like I didn't meet Trav yet, like I never had assets
Bad with the pen, but never cashed checks
Rappin' like I ain't even close to havin' the bag yet (No)
Like I'm tryna be the best up in this hip-hop (Chuh)
And do a track with the king of Atlanta, T.I.P.-top (Chuh)
Then turn around and go switch it up, and do big rock
Tryna ride all the way up to my homie in Slipknot (Maggot, chuh)
Like I never heard fans yell it
Not The Calm, not The Worst, even Anghellic (Word)
Before they told me that I can't sell it
Before I went to the reunion of fam', Nelly
Like I didn't have this new watch (Chuh)
And it never would tic and never do toc (Chuh)
Like I'm rapping myself into learnin' brew hops
Rappin' like I ain't never did a record with 2Pac

Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the Zou
Like I, like I ain't

Skippin' my job, yeah (Yeah), like this is a process
Try'na get from the projects, so I spit like I got next (Woo)
And I trip if you object (Yeah), like I'm itchin' to fly. Tech
Whipping in kitchens with Pyrex (Woo), to the mission that God set (Yes!)
For me, rippin' these quick and will not rest
Like no flippin', Techn9cian is obsessed (Chuh)
Like I didn't know when I was droppin' (Chuh)
Independent music, I wasn't toppin' (Chuh)
And all the bad bitches wasn't jockin'
I rap like I didn't know I'd do a record with Hopsin (Chuh)
They call me Tecca N9na, I'ma shoot this
If you're dissin', you really don't wanna do this
Niggas wanna try me, then you're gonna lose it
I rap like I never did a record with Joyner Lucas (Hungry)
Like I never knew maestros
Like I didn't know Trae was a asshole
Like I didn't have a stash full of cash flow
Rappin' like I am back in the past with my afro
Like I never ever knew Strange
Would put the name Tech N9ne in my shoe strings (Chuh)
Like I didn't know I was spittin' the butane
And I grew fame with the homie Bobby and 2 Chainz

Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold (Yeah)
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the Zou
Like I, like I ain't

So tall I can't even hear any of the sound you deliver
Me and my partners never see any of the hateful frowning you give us
'Cause we splat little bitty braggin' wack rappers
You happen to be the bastard that got mashed up
But down to the simple fact here's a strap past ya, blast at ya
That's after the yappin' I put the cash in my last chapter, that's laughter
Half path over vast money brag, imagine a black Dracula
Smashin' 'em with the gats, upper class stature
It went to my head as my first time
To be cocky I'm just a giant when I burst rhyme
My leg is humongous, is y'all's verse mine?
Stomping 'em out, I can't stop my leg like Robert Klein
Giant robot make you feel very low shank

Hop in ya lane and stopping yo fame, bark is vicious

But in my brain I stay insane and I'm always on some other shit!
Really wanna fuck a bitch, E.B. can't get enough of this
See me take what I stuck her with then I gotta run and give it to another chick
Gutter trick, suck a dick! State the texture of a brick
Making them Magnum rubbers split, what a prick, the brother's sick!

Even when it's annoying like long nose hair

I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one (The wrong one tho!)
Times like this I don't know how to have fun (I don't know!)
I think I'ma fuck somebody up, fuck 'em up (Gunna)
You gon' need someone to hold you up (Hold you up, huh)
What the fuck

It's only one option (White), you gon' need a doctor
I ain't talkin' 'bout the one from Compton
Arms, feet, legs all gone like I'm Don Corleone
Hiring James Bond, that's what I'm on
Remain calm but aware that I'm armed and dangerous
See Double X is known to gang with us
So hang tight, I'm trying to get this right
You think 'cause I wrote a pop hit that I won't pop shit?
The fuck's wrong with you Pop-Tarts?
I pop cherries and popstars, you popsicles is not hard
Popped in on the top charts out the cop car
To remind y'all you just rap, you're not Gods
And I don't care who got bars
Because they don't acknowledge mine, so show me who got scars
Show me the greatest on the stage and the arena
Bet they point they finger up at the Gunner and Tecca N9na

I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one
Times like this I don't know how to have fun
I think I'ma fuck somebody up
You gon' need someone to hold you up
What the fuck

She will not leave a bunch of passes
I just wanna see that ass yeah
Caribou Lou in my glass yeah
I start a riot by accident
Somebody's bitch showin' ass again
I should start throwin' some cash again
Pushing the crowd, we harassin' them
If you start makin' me mad, I

Start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit

Well, that's when all of the heavy artillery come in the picture
And luckily cause of your past, you can have someone assist ya
I was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga!
I swore to never let a man's hand take me to my grave nigga
With my fortune, I'mma get to torchin', like Orkin I spray nigga
I know they dyin' to get it with the N9ne
That's fine, they wanna make a nigga do the woop
So I'mma take the carbine and put it to ya mind
It's goin' through you, not around ya like a hula hoop
Put that on the bible, if ya fuckin' with Tech, get the rifles
Totally trippin', tryna take my title, lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel
If you psycho, you can do this, if he chooses to be foolish
The gun never loses, never give you the deuces
Nigga, this is Su'Wu biz, ahh!
Let me calm my nerves, I'mma simply put this on the word
If ya hella aggravated cause of a song ya heard from the Nina I smoke a nigga like my ganja herb

Got a problem, what he really wanna do?
If you know like I know, then you know, true
And niggas make songs but they really don't do
What they say, got guns but they really won't shoot
He afraid, I'll lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete, nose to the ground
Do him in the streets 'fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang, it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin' ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around, it's enough
Eat a bullet from the four-pound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off, I'll believe you ain't soft
Otherwise, nigga you just soft as all them other guys
I'll kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Don't listen to these niggas, they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns? Shot 'em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low, all my niggas headed for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF?
That's your business nigga, none of mine
I know Young Gotti 'bout what he rap 'bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around, two weeks, had a whole ki
Just cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead
Like disco, then a nigga went and showed me
Guess what I'm tryna say is, nigga, I don't know you

Strangeulation I,Strangeulation,2014.0,"Strangeulation I

Hmm... Tech N9ne!
Smashes the masses, but the industry's hatin' asses

Strange days, when your favorite rapper's poppin'
But ""Is he on top?"" Is something you can't gauge
Especially when he's toppin' the charts
And you see me, K. Lamar, and Macklemore sharing the same stage
I'm the nigga all these artists look up to
Yet for Tech, it's been the hardest to bust through
But I keep my fans fiendin' like clucks do
You don't like how we living, well... (""Fuck you"")
I dominate your conglomerate, want a beating? I can accommodate
It'll be a non-debate, coming up against Aaron the Great
So many got arms, legs and necks tatted, Strange
'Cause music, show, conceptually, I'm the best at it
Let's have it for all of these Tech addicts
Any disrespect to family will get your chest gatted
Aimin' at 'em and it's agony
Burner blew his brain in back and these
Cannons came and caved in cavity, caliber connect, cap it
Yo, there it go, red is in my head, it grow
Headed fo', lead and deaded, yeah, the medic said it so
Let it grow, shred it and get no credits, so pathetic though
Dread embedded steppin' in heaven's crevice, wet and edible
Give her the shivers when I deliver this
Hit her then quit her 'cause she's on Twitter shit
And when she compared me to Eminem, I said ""I'm different""
She said ""How?"", I said ""I'm black and I can say 'nigger', bitch!""
To him, I may be just another bro with a flow
Who'll probably never tour 'cause it'll be thousands of Juggalos at a show
And I heard fatalities happen on each side, so that's never no let it go
So I get it, I keep what I'm makin' incredible, all of them scared of a negro
Strangeulation, this occupation so scandalous
We stop the hatin', no chances
When I rock the nation, so Danzig
I'm killing all these niggas, Operation Code Kansas
Strange gang plain triggered assassins
Got a bunch of untamed aimed trained spitters a' blastin'
My insane brain sayin' ""Give up the rappin'
And go back to the gang bang thang"", nigga, what's happenin'? Soo-woo",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-strangeulation-i-lyrics
Unfair,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"And the road gets harder with flow spits
'Cause we represent that Kansas city, MO shit
Double doses, Tech Kalikosis
But ran into a duo that's ferocious
Some of the best two, kill you, no rescue
They say that you gotta spit hot 16's before you step through
And they say everybody, nigga, even Tech do
Now we gotta explain our journey to the Ces Cru

I'm on a pilgrimage to the rhyme Mecca,
 because I am Tecca
And this mind, it left ya, down at the bottom because N9ne's better
And if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness
They in a mess; bind yessir, sever decay 'em and define pressure
I'ma spit it for bidig roars and not a critic whore!
Hit ignore, 
I got acidic core! Thidis war, you're nada when it pours!
Wanna pla-ay every da-ay, sta-ay for the wa-ay that I spra-ay
Sa-ay? You got the pa-ay? That's ya-ay or na-ay?
Bumblebee tuna, grrr
Don't be smelling like it if you're under me,
 rumors
Will begin about you from hung-r-y pooner's!
Hopin', wishin', prayin' when you're gone it'd be sooner!
When I'm dead I'ma get up in the head of the nigga that set it up pickin' the lead up, then I wet 'em up look like a predator
I'ma dead 'em and let it puss, skip the peace it ain't no humble we Luna
Moon stricken,
 rednecks sayin' who them coones rippin'

Pick 'em off
Take 'em off to my land in my van a lotta room, getting in in

Who are these dudes? We never let in any fools, you know the rules
Kristopher, egotistical, narcissistic wit' cha!
If they sit on my throne then we tell 'em to get up and move and make us some room
I heard of these guys, murderous when it comes to scripture
Ubiquitous and Godemis, they Gods to us, we Gods to them
So we meet right in the middle, chewed the fat and fried up a little
And it's unfair, we got their hands in the air
And you can’t even get a show
No one cares that your freestyle so rare
But don't nobody can't nobody know
And it's easy for them physical favors
Why y'all just spend all your paper
Breezes bend over the table, 
tattoo symbols of my label
Driving and trafficking rhymes, tongues sharp as African knives
We what's happenin' to your wives while you're at nine to fives
You might as well stop rappin'
'Cause it's not happening if I stop laughin'
'Cause it's too hard to impress us, just blatant disregard
The Four Horsemen
 
of course we forced to be coarse when
You talkin' taller when y'all getting the short end!

It's unfair to me, nothing is what it appears to be
Killin' off any and everything
Comin' and threatening somethin' that's dear to me
If'n you feelin' the fear then flee
Fi fo fee fum, what a fuck up!
I'm retarded with a clover, I guess you can call it dumb luck
When I'm rappin', out of habit I'm adamant gettin' adam
But I would rather, hit a madam with a Magnum and split her atoms
Tryna fathom the famine that will diminish the anger
Got a place set at the table, we eating spinach with Strangers
Sippin' Caribou Lou
Spilling the sickest shit ever I tell 'em but who woulda knew it?
I’m one of two in the crew,
 with a knife in my pocket and one in my shoe
Surrounded by haters so what I'ma do?
Thinkin' I gotta devise a game plan
Get a ticket to kick it with Krizz and Nina
So I guessin' I’m headed to Strangeland!
And my main man, woulda told me to murk 'em
Doin' the sin indeed, I'ma catch a couple more
Then I’m formin' a human centipede
Pause, 
I'm aware that they hatin', look it, they gotta diss
Who the fuck is fuckin' with Tech, Kali,
 Ubi and Godemis?

It's unfair to be, doin' motherfuckin' charity
You can pay a fuckin' fare for me
Or really there ain't nothin' there for me, move carefully
I swear that we, fly as a parakeet, high as a Cherokee
In my rhyme I spoke like Jeremy feel my fire, my smoke, my kerosene
We-we-we don’t want no drama, we-we don’t want no trouble
We-we can keep it peaceful if y-y'all can keep it humble
I-I really don’t know what he come fo'
But his name is the same as a gun yo
Strangeland is a place that I seen in a dream
Since I was runnin' 'round in my Umbro
And you heard it direct from my mouthpiece
Tech scouted me out, then found me
Turn out we the perfect strangers, Larry Appleton and Balki
I was out east, when the text came in
With Tech sayin' what is 'bout to be
Before you fuck me on the dough, know that everybody 'round here lookin' out for me
Now that we got that in the air, I can feel the change in the atmosphere
My crew been living in limbo,
 
apparently all this rappin' has trapped us here
And after years they hearin' we lost inside the dream not necessarily
I won’t let this rap thing bury me, 
I'ma let these bat wings carry me

Strangeulation Vol. II Cypher II,Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"For what I wanted to do was take some of my classic beats, and send 'em to my artists to see what they would come up with on these beats that I love so much, so I wanna call Stevie Stone and Ces Cru to murder, let's go

Feel the hate when they come around
Little bull better settle down
Feel the love, I'm the great and or the true
See the fakes and the snakes, I'm always outta bounds
See I been dealt a hand, my nigga, I can peep
Peeping the shifty fans, my nigga
They gon' (see) see me going H.A.M, getting bigger, nigga
(Talk that shit, if you want to hack my Tech N9ne play it again)
Make sure you remember me, me the odd ball liquor
When Stevie get to speaking, the plot
Thickens with and these niggas is Vixens
Competition, it's really contradiction (uh-huh!)
Learning from the realest slim pickings
I love it, how you doubt a nigga, hound a nigga
Panned out, all this profit sought the stone to stand stout
On rigid and rare routes, it's like procedure to hear a nigga out
Strangeulation two and it's right now
Let's take it to another level, hot metal, black kettle, bitch
High pitched, fly shit, falsetto, five words like the bandit lord
I think this weed got me paranoid
Middle finger to my enemies, I say all you niggas is bitches
Jurisdiction have so many restrictions
All you niggas is fiction, no conviction
Niggas get to dissin', I'll have you outta commission
Bodies missing, call my brother to lynch 'em
All you niggas is gimmicks, frail body and soul
All you niggas pretending, thought that we so-called family
All you niggas can get it, turning my volume up
Had us upon that midget
Let me hear you say names, let me hear you holler Strange
Octane with flame, will leave your bodies decaying
Niggas be playing games, my niggas taking aim
Have you in a debacle, better stay in your lane
Guess time'll tell (guess time'll tell, guess time'll tell)

Right hand over my heart of hearts I'm pledging allegiance
To Ces, for whatever the reasons I have withered the seasons
They're dead in the breeze, I'm ready to feed 'em
I never believed 'em, you son of a bitch, son of a preacher, word of
Heaven and Jesus, through seven degrees of separation is still
And spreading diseases, my recommendation is cheddar your cheeses
Maybe you better get business, like I didn't know that I carried the load
I know your boy is heavy and heaving
That's word to Strange and Tech the N9ne, I mean, who better to lead us
Since I been with that team I been spinning them G's
Bitch, yeah, you better believe it, cash come in a bulk amount now
I'm staying ahead of my dreams so the fuck could I sulk about
For real, I'll never be satisfied still, I don't be vocal out loud
Respect is due, I show it, don't blow it, my records are outbound
Chill, I'm choosing my weapons wisely, we never will lose direction
Guide 'em through the Recession Proof, should include a confession, truth
Started from the Bikini Bottom, we're here but it's something fishy
Twenty sixteen, Strange Music, making some fucking history

I know they want me to put up the pen
And just quit with the rapping, it won't never happen, no
For the minutes that I been in it, I'm a killer still in the back but I'm clapping though
In a matter of fact I been acting, so
Out of wack and my brain is on overload
I don't call anybody, ain't nobody calling me
Maybe I don't need a phone no mo'
Guess I won’t pay the bill and the villain is spillin' venom in him then I’m a goner
And haters are catering to me with wishes that I wouldn't win any longer
Idiot, you're just making me stronger, wanna kill me, then pay me no mind
Get a record that's quite a bit longer, if you don't feel me then get on your grind
I don't mean to be mean but the measure is simple when you try to weather the outcome
Now I don't need a reason, killing any season, in fact I am better without one
You don't know anything about heat or the temp of the weather that I'm coming out from
And I wouldn't consider you equal like other people, where the fuck is your album?
Shit to you is a hobby and obviously y'all ain't knowing to measure at all
Murdering it for pleasure, ain't fucking with Godi, I'm sick with a medicine ball
Couldn't give 'em a shit, not even a little bit cause they haters, we know it
We all know the location, come get your face winched

Yeah, Tech N9ne!
Turn me up a little bit more, Ben, so I can rock this the right way, brother
If you got 20/20 vision
You can see Nina handling this music with precision
If not, then it's fine with me
Just know this movement is vivid enough for the blind to see, Yates

How in the hell can you miss me
When I'm counting my mil' making hist'ry
Trip the splits be that 50/50
So we rip the script swiftly and zip through chips quickly
When the trash, mail and pizza man see me
They get a fever and cheesy when they see the man Neezy
I'm easily beast and my hand is in my belt
What? I'm independent and I'm feeling myself
A flunk I won't be
I bumps the trunks see
The ladies pop the monkey and drop the donkey
They want to flaunt me
My songs be funky
Steady getting that cheddar forever
But some people acting like they don't see

I'm top dog, something like a CEO
I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio
But they don't really see me though
But they don't really see me though
All night, life like a video
Prime time, something like a Super Bowl
But they don't really see me though

With contact lenses say he don't smoke
I'm rolling up and let the contact get him
He even choked
My approach was to never to be broke
Kept my real niggas close
Now the player turned to coach
I hear people saying why so many changes?
Why so many watches? Why so many chains?
I'm mixing Kush with all these different strains
Riding in my Porsche listening to Purple Rain
So much knowledge I came up on, you just a Hollywood insider
The inside of my crib look like a gym
Speaking of gym, I'm in the game, you're just a bench rider
You ride the bench that mean you ain't playing
You understand, hella fans
Bunch of hands, hundred grands that's the plan
Wizzle Man!

I'm top dog, something like a CEO
I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio
But they don't really see me though
But they don't really see me though
All night, life like a video
Prime time, something like a Super Bowl
But they don't really see me though

I'm truly blessed
I do request for all of you people to listen
I do see checks and movie sets
And never been a stranger to vixens
Pick up the pen, its in my gut to win
I got a motive and I’m in it with a mission
You know what I'mma get it when I dip into it
I've been through it, I've been a fighter with a vision
You can cover your eye, brother but why?
Cause your lady just discovered that my
Big rubber defies your lover blubber
So you utter replies with a tougher disguise
Cause my payday done caught the nose of your lady
I'm at the beginning of my hay-day
Y'all better Wrekonize like ¡Mayday!
I don't know why jokers just won't let their eyes notice
Deep in my vocals they keep yelling that I'm doper
And i'll choke ya if your lips deny flow
So just buy jokes
You know couldn't see me with bi-focals

I'm top dog, something like a CEO
I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio
But they don't really see me though
But they don't really see me though
All night, life like a video

You know what I'm sayin', and that's the lust demon livin' within me
And, uh, but my heart love big, you know what I'm sayin', so
I know a lot of demons come to my shows, as well as angels
You know what I'm sayin', a lot of demons

When I was one, and-a two, and-a three, and-a four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plum rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon

There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)
There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)

Yo, it make me wanna drink a lot, go up in the pink with not
This the reason I ain't at ease and currently on the brink of pop
This the reason I sit at the window with the millie
Wishing a nigga gon' come break in
This is the reason I be freaking a woman deeper
Loving making her silly because I done they friends
It is the reason I bang, it is definitely the reason I slang
Distributed the 'caine
The reason I'm super-soaking in the pain, and starting to love it
It's wanting to give me way more of it, they want me to lug it through the mud
And thus the reason with happy people I'm disgusted
I'm talking about those thangs that make you do bad thangs
Living the evil up in the fast lane
Making me want to have a wicked persona
Beating the hell up out of people making me mad, mane
Gave me the gun when I ran up in dealings in the ninth grade, with a slight rage
I was Ice Age, another reason Tecca Nina won't have any light days
Voted me the King of Darkness, voted me to be really heartless
All up in my spirit they march, they making me start sparking other targets
Woke up today I was steaming, cause when I found out I was not dreaming
Because the host that influenced me the most was a goddamn demon

When I was one, and-a two, and-a three, and-a four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plum rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon

There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)
There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)

(Three 6 Mafia!)
See there's a demon inside of me, and I'm thinking it's that dope
It's got me doing shit a nigga never even had done befo'
It got me kicking in the door of folks I don't even know
Straight wilding, nine-eleven times a fucking thousand
Buck like public housing, my Glock is so arousing
Make you stand atten-hut the way that bitch be shouting
Something like a scary movie, nigga but I'm scarier
Bury ya, Memphis Ten Black Haven area
Buck nigga, get buck bitch, get with me
And I'mma show you how this Triple 6 will get silly
Psycho, like no other individual
Glock with the red beam to keep you in my visual
Three 6 and Tech Nina wet you like an Aquafina
Desert Eagle, .50 Cal', tell me have you seen her
Pussy juice, still on my shit from this ho I just raped
In her fucking husband's face, shot him in his fucking face

I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plum rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon

There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)
There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)

Nowhere to ru-u-un, nowhere to hi-i-ide

You can't find this in ya big book

Hellurr, straight crown and a burrr
And after I'm finished you know I'ma drink some murrr
But I got 20/20 vision when I'm pitchin, listen
I spot them chickens never slippin like a transmission
You like Baileys, I like ladies, I'm quite crazy
And maybe a little shady to hit tonight baby
Cookies, I gotta bang, they wanna hang with a real nigga
All day, everyday, by myself, not a gang
Wanna go night-night, nigga?
I'ma so nice I lit up, like a swisher
I don't know why thy bitter
Won't stroke by my ni-nuts, Papa getcha
Wi-wi-wi-witch if you hide the puta
Away from me then you can blow me, like a hookah
They know I'm a crowded prusta
On the pooty tang, ya booty bang
And I wish I was your loofah
Oooh, you're sweeter than Dean and DeLuca
Trying to boost ya, this my number that I shoot ya

That's enough to make the whole spot say ""DWAAAAAMN!!!""

Sound like when somebody get hit on Batman
Always looking for the pussy - CAT-scan
Booty's always being watched - black man
Never be caught messing around in the flat-land
I solemnly swear to beat punini
Jiggly jello off in a petite bikini
Women waiting in line to meet my weenie
Wanna see me go Gandolfini
Don't you let me reach the creamy
Ain't nobody got time for that
But I got time for getting you behind the clap
DWAMN! Drew, Rock, Troy, Mike, Rich
Brian Dennis made nina put the dwamn on the DWITCH
We drinkin'
We thinkin'
We linkin' with ladies cause they winkin'
Now I can say ""damn,"" but that ain't big

If you bring it here I'ma throw c-notes
Let me float of in your water like a sea boat
She choked, guess she didn't have a deep throat
Dwamn is when it's impressive
Dwamn is you seeing someone on some next shit
Dwamn is when you listening to Ninna Tech spit - that's it
But look on the big rump on that bitch!
Girl I ain't seen in a while
No longer teen in her style
Bust seams in jeans and her blouse
Like bam, like blaow, like blam, like wow, like DWAMN!

What If It Was Me,The Storm,2016.0,"Free your mind, and remember
Winners are not people who never fail
But people who never quit
All I ever wanted was to sell
Records to the people make a lot of mil', yessir
Rap to me, it was the holy grail
I'm gonna go and do it, I'm never gonna fail
Yeah, but first I gotta make it out of Hell

Wake up and I see crime
All of us we on it's eat time
My homies love me yelling ""Peace N9ne""
At the same time, throwing B signs
Throwing em back and repping the street, I'm
Doing music and I'm writing beast rhymes
But my V-Slimes, had no weak minds
Got with the music, started a group and we shine
Music gave us hella hope
Made it up out of the bangin' and sellin' dope
We were stronger than a bottle of Yoke
Till one of our members found a kid to grope
Then your honor gave the peddy the rope
Losing a man, the band began to slope
Never did think a plan was damned to croak
So doing it solo-dolo stands the G.O.A.T
Started making hella LP's
2000, all the way to five, felt free
Because of the hand the label dealt me
But in ‘06 Fontana helped us melt cheese
Number one independent gonna be spending a ton of funds, in a minute
That's when the government want the sums, then I send it
In a couple of months I'm done and replenished

Everywhere I go, I'm selling out the show
Around the world I kill em and everybody know
Whenever we hit the studio
And Tecca Nina drop, hot
Even though I will go toe to toe
If somebody bang on me, but I'm rolling in the dough
And I'm really respected and protected
Chances of me getting shot, not

Everyone loving the Tech
Publishin', I get a check
Loving the cities that with me, the people that call me the best
I don't have any regret, but it's a bit of neglect
Missing my babies I love em and none of 'em leaving me yet
Feeling good like a villain should
In a mansion, but I'm still in hoods
Not like Trayvon, J's on
Khaki shorts with a red tee like I will and could
I can conceal it my permits say
If evil happens to swerve this way
Hope nobody deserves quick spray
I feel an angelic surge this day
They feeling my songs
Been doing it long
They want me to sell 'em my CD right outta my home
Cos I'm in the zone
I'm putting em on in front of the store when a couple of police won't leave me alone
Why they tripping?
I fit the description
It's two of them rushing me I'm on a solo mission
To get people to listen, but they pushing and kicking me
I'm on the ground when they telling me, ""Cause of a gun suspicion""
It was in my pocket, ain't trying pop it
When they scared of a brother with a gun no one can stop it
Then one of em lost it, and then I was shot quick
Officers took me to heaven, I'm dead and with multiple rockets
Didn't matter I was good and living inside a mansion next to ball players
'Cause of the move he made was drastic now I lay in a casket carried by my pallbearers
Fears what I see, making em kill a G
Rotten apple in the batch; don't tell the rest to flee
This happened in Baton, R-O-U-G-E, even I fit the description
What if it was me?

What if it was me
What if I never got the one chance to be
Everything and everywhere I go, I wouldn't see
If by your hand you took that from me
But what if it were me?
Laying right there
I'll never get up again, it's so unfair
My babies cry out
You never cared
Things that we do make each other so scared
So what if it was you there?
(Should I just) Take your life
(Should I bust) Make your wife widowed, withered, hugging the pillow
The scent of you still on her
Spirit she feels on her
The whole world weeps
Blood we all spill on her
And I know, it’s ill will; the pill’s hard to swallow
How should I feel when I'm being followed (followed)
By the words that you say to me? (Crazy)
And you saved my life, take my life

I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with sore fists
I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with sore fists
I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with sore fists

'Cause I've grown to make them smashes
On this journey, did many back flips
To get your attention, now that I caught it
Who do I catch bitch?

Real rock, rap and not a Xerox
Weird not enough to make ya fear a lot, from here watch
I ran scrimmage, and I fought to the damn finish
And I popped eyes open without eating me canned spinach
My fans in it, constantly tellin' me I can win it
If I stand grimace damaging man every damn minute
I blended it, expands quick, it slams wicked rhyme
Grand spittage, H.A.M. with it, fam dig it's, N9ne
Chea! Hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles coming softer than a cats meow
Red laces, but booted like I'm Iraq bound
That frown'll get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal, pat down, gat down, back down, blackout
With a fat smile, I might react foul
So don't make this cat growl
I caught everybody when I spazzed wow, who do I catch now?

Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who can't get with the rap sound
I caught the industry, who do I catch now?
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who told me to put the rap down
I caught the whole world, who do I catch now?

I caught wreck, AND THEN I caught checks
AND THEN I caught press, AND THEN I caught sex, YES
And no permanent diseases were caught when I caught that
Now the games been offset, 'cause I'm strange in a lost mess
I caught a lot of shit being different, they tried to hinder Tech
By calling him devil worshiper, surfaced up on the internet
My temper gets grimmer just as winter sets, I'm a venter, yes
And I can't forget when the finger pressed triggers, I can't remember that
I caught stars attention, N9na had a large ascension
So high the lord is squintin', (NOPE), I mean y'all are squintin', (OKAY)
'Cause I'm tall as Pippen , (NOPE), got a flawless vision, (OKAY)
On a lawless mission, (NOPE), 'cause I'm ballish pimpin', (YEAH!)
Best believe I caught fades
Never homie soft made, I'm active, no off days
And I got boss paid with music, I caught babes
And I even caught gays before they all caught AIDS

Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who can't get with the rap sound
I caught the industry, who do I catch now?
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who told me to put the rap down
I caught the whole world, who do I catch now?

I hit a pot of gold, with the harder flow
You haters oughta know, that we are the MO
This is my land, you in my hand and you's a particle
And I see you marvel over the fact I caught Tha Carter IV
So that means I caught Martians already
And you talk shit about that, because often y'all petty
And because you jelly sicklin', its costing y'all Bettys
To get tossed in our headache 'cause we lost in tall fetty
Ayy, you catch the vapors 'cause N9na, he catch hoes
And you non believers are funny people, like Seth Rog
Better pay attention, 'cause if you simpin' ya get froze
And I'ma leave you with a wet nose, when I'm ripping they catch colds

When I’m rippin', they catch colds?
Ay, that make sense, don’t it, Ben?

Wither,Special Effects,2015.0,"I don't care
They say my angel glow is subsiding
I'm sliding outside of these high beams, and I won't dare
Try to mend this tear, I love I'm fading, the good once there is just dying
So I'm withering away, and I'ma trigger when I spray, and I'm attacking everybody 'til the feeling's gone

All my life I loved with people
So passive back then, I thought I'd be above this evil
My tolerance level then was up with doves and eagles
Currently, I've hit ground zero under bugs and beetles
I'm tilted, inside my head's a lettuce but wilted
Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, I spilt it
Could it be how many times I've been ran over and jilted?
That makes me wanna totally detach from light and just kill shit

I'll know when the pain is gone
It's just a matter of time before my pulses win
And I can feel the wrong
Coming up through the cracks of my heart again
I'm holding on, I'm going
Straight into the mouths of makers, everything that keeps me calm was taken
I'm letting go, I'm burning through, reserves are low
Just pushing on these old restraints, my time is up 'cause it's too late

I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up at any time today
I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up at any time today

I'm looking for some fire, yeah, putting on my gang attire
Drooling and blood I can taste, so get the fuck outta my face
I'm a killer with a quick switch, yeah, all I ever really wanted was bliss
Look at me wither to waste, so get the fuck outta my face
Find another one to get bent, yeah, and it ain't no stopping this
Loving the thrill of the chase, so get the fuck outta my face
N9ne's a nigga with the sick-ness, yeah, and it ain't no blocking this
It doesn't matter the race, just get the fuck outta my face

Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Gone

I gotta say, when my mother died, I really did inside
And that's the other thing that did it
Turning my crazy on a hundred babies gonna plummet
Maybe I should be committed

What am I supposed to do?
Do I just keep faking? Fucking forsaking everything I am?
Another pissed motherfucker with a fist and a plan
Oh, but you're making me do this
I can scream while you stand there clueless
If you're listening, I've made up my mind
Take another step, but I'm fed this time

Something, please save me, I'm losing myself

I don't think I wanna stop it, but the feeling inside is nauseous
I get really exhausted off it, gotta find a way to wash it, lock it
Profit nada so I got to drop it, ain't nobody in the cockpit toss this lostness
People from the office boxes, if you cross this boss, live cautious
Don't make me, don't make me repeat myself
For your safety because a pilly is beneath my belt
But I don't wanna do anything bad to anybody, but I'll never be perfect
So I'mma say to the people that got a little evil coming at you from me, I think they deserve it

Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Gone

Straight, literally snapping out, my lady backing out 'cause I'm becoming really mean and vicious
Watching me wither, how can I give her love when I been so tainted by these bitches

We are the arsenal
Chemically imbalanced, completely disposable
So butter my knuckles and taste it
Another sick delinquent is wasted
I don't forgive, I don't forget
I haven't got time to regret
Everybody else in the world can hate me
Nobody but me can save me

Shit, Yates hates this place
If you're close enough to me to hit the switch, you better never turn it on

Right over the track singing, like the father of Nona Gaye
Let's get it on, they love it when Tech spit a song way rugged
And check niggas on they grudges, then death shitted on they buzzes

Can't compete compare crotches, cockless, taking Tech is too toxic, toss it!
Never will the bosses take losses
Study cautiousness off this shit!
'Cause some fans are antagonistic
Naggin' bitches, raggin' like a stabbin' happened, when I'm havin' hits
Get massive sick shit, like I ain't Vlad and vicious, bad and twisted
Keep it jabbing fisted, Trav insisted
So I frown scarier, when the clown buries a nigga down to the ground, but the crown carrier
Get the hound out the mound, and they’re bound, marry 'em all together, is how we breaking the sound barrier
I'm three-dimensional, we invincible, you saying I'm over, you never see the principle
My seed is meant to grow rapid, I'm the classical rap shit on acid!

Jack it! (World star) How in the fuck am I ripping, and reaching the masses?
Asses, faggots, too many back splashes
Then a wack black chat hatches, 'cause you napped at rap classes
They making a mockery of my painted face
But me I resemble our ancestors
And these niggas talking stuck, at a fainted pace
Still not realizing, this man blessed ya
I am so clever, my friends adore me they banging Yates
Your rhyme is no measure to him, you bore me, gay flaming fakes
Find him more cheddar, my end's for me stay gaining great
'Cause I am forever like Em, 40, Jay, Wayne and Drake
Pure art, I'm the shit and nigga, you're farts
How they gonna challenge the Tecca N9na, when your flow's softer, than a Velour scarf?
Blowing this track into pieces, I'm leaving you fewer parts
At this moment, I am laying as dead, as before my 2.0 tour starts
Ain't packed shit yet, this how your taint rap hits best
Tecca N9na ain't plastic, my bank's drastic, you can't match his checks
Lot of gore in the flow, and I’m born to go, got your whore in the door
Taking your chick, 'cause a nigga been up on the Forbes list, now four in a row
My religion is followed by little kids
College kids, metalheads, hip hop heads, the rips and soo-woos
Your religion is tainted by money grubbing
Funny hugging, chummy loving grown men, that like to do youths

The hardest rapper that Tecca N9na could fuckin' find
Who that? Who that? That's me
Who that? Who that? K-Dean
When I was comin' up in the game everybody was tellin' me
'I really be killin' a lot of you niggas, I'm mean'
Fuckin' with my niggas D-Loc and Dalima
They told me, 'I be really gotta be a murderin' killin' machine'
I didn't care about nothing but rappin' my way to the top
Fuckin' with my nigga Tech, he told me I'm hot
Anybody got a problem with any one of my niggas
I’ll pull out the 9 mill I betchu it'll pop
Bring the heat, bring the noise, bring the flames
Anything that you bring, I'ma tame
Puttin' dirt on the top of my name
Pull back and I click-click, bang
Ask Tech, he'll tell you I'm strange
If you ever wanna talk about me
I'ma run up, gun up and leave you with no brain
Then you'll know my flow is insane

I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
All across the U.S
Overseas, Midwest Choppers
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Yeah, Midwest Choppers)

Come, come get some of this
Midwest murda music, murda music, murda music
Come, come get some of this
Midwest murda music, murda music, murda music
Let me hit 'em
When I get 'em, I'ma split 'em, I'ma kill 'em
I'm the nigga with the lyrical venom finna get up in them
When they give me the instrumental
I finish 'em, diminish 'em
I guarantee that murda is a minimum
But lately I been givin' 'em hell
They don't really wanna see me, I'm servin' 'em swell
Call me a monster, verse designer, first to bomb ya
Leathaface pullin' up in that hearse beside ya
Murda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murdered 'em all, kill 'em all
Krayzie kill 'em all, they fall
It's a lyrical execution
We snap faster, we the rap masters
Squeeze the gat, blast it, if that's how it gots to be
So they better get it ready
'Cause I'm heated like an AK-47 spittin' bullet fuckin' lyrics out of me
Then they tell 'em, that’s crazy, Jackson
He’s amazin' actually, stay in action
Rap singin' at ya, I brings it at you
I'm kinda like an automatic aimin' at ya
And I don't want a little bit of flame to ashes
You know you really truly insane to madness
You never really find another niggas more scandalous
Than this Midwest blastin'' family

I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
All across the U.S
Overseas, Midwest Choppers

I am the definition of murda
The N9ne is now coming to serve ya
You're running but you can't go no furtha
'Cause I'm running through you with no sign of inertia
Gimme the mic and I bet that you duck
It's what you betta do when I'm bussin' I be flippin', I'm incredible
Never get on my level, I'm a killa with the pedal to the medal
You're edible and ya death is so inevitable
I can take it to ya mama, ya daddy's, in the back of a caddy
You cut up when the sack in the back of you, I wanna
Take it out and make it patty, you gotta be batty
'Cause that’ll be bad if you decide to get mad, is you gonna?
You can listen to me and see I'm the nigga with the ammunition
I'm givin' the livin' a vision of death
Makin' 'em sick and depressed
'Cause I be givin' everything
I'm a rebel and I'm still with the quick and the best
Makin' a mark in the business
I get up in it to rip and diminish ya
Trip and I finish ya
Dig it, you really get me livid, I'm 'bout give it a pivot
I'ma stick it so we can dip into sinister
I be the chopper that got ya little boppers goin' off us
Better not let me up on the premises
'Cause I'm a doctor that's out for the shotaz when I brought ya
Be cautious never talk of this nemesis
We on top of the hill when it come to the skill
Other rappers are damn jokers
They be givin' the people comedy
But the Tecca N9na misery shit is Bram Stoker

I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper

Klusterfuk,Klusterfuk,2012.0,"I was born in November, 8th day, 1971st y'all
9 o'clock in the morning a Christian girl
In Kansas City gave birth, yaah
She taught the kid how to love
And give all praises to our maker till the earth fall
Then mama married a Muslim when I was 12
And the transition was the worst y'all
I converted to Islam, but every once in awhile
I'd read a bible verse, yaah
How am I to refrain from eatin' pork
And havin' Christmas when I'm thirst ahh?
All of this it was blended, many religions
Plenty women down my shirt, yaah
At home no longer attended
When I was 17 I bounced like a nerf ball

Yeeeeah! (Spit a bit quick!)
By day I slay, Pai Mei, trick, (don't get a bitch hit!)
I'm Master Ip'in it, I'm flyin' around with equipment
Really big time and now I'm not fitness, bitch
I'm ridin' around and I'm grittin' it
To the people, the people that want the evil, I'm givin' you
That and a coupla others a (Klusterfuk!)
Of a brotha which you discover I (Crush mucks up!)
In the gutter 'cause I'm a thug and their (Tough just struck!)
On you mo'fuckers I'll be the blood brother
Givin' you love from a slug if you bug on a nigga
Tug on a trigga, no hugs, I'ma kiss her with
Grudges and plug her with drugs when I give her dick
Fatherly when I spit on these kiddies, don't bother me
In the brown and red dickies, Mahogany
Red all over me like I hit a artery
Fuck all of these, hypocrites, lick a dick, just swallow me
If you follow me and wanted to abolish me
When I'm honestly straight oddity
I'm just twisted, non-fictitious, on this wicked shit (Spit a bit quick!)
Ready whenever, machete will sever the head or
Be dead up then the leg up in the metal and (Big thick bricks!)
Pucker up, suck this nutter butter, gutter slut
If you wonder what is uttered this is Klusterfuk!
Ever seen a nigga with hella followers
And they love a nigga so much if he wanna tell them to kill?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah! And they will!
So ya better watch that, no it ain't a shock tactic, got that bit down to the grill
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heeeh! Way real!
I got the shit that get the crowd jumpin'
Moshin', a lotta thumpin', silly just like a drunken monkey!
Nigga, we punkin' flunkies! Killa, we krunk and funky!
Uhh, pumpin' chunky! Uhh, booty bitches in the bunk with a donkey, eh!
Crazy, I might be way in my psyche, laid as a bright P.A
Playin', they wanna fight me
They don't really like me
Day and the night replay
Yeah, I'm good and a little bit of evil
Inside of me, they about equal
Call it a bust, when I'm all in a rut
I'm a Klusterfuk, nigga y'all is just (Fecal!)

Growin' up low enough must have sucked (People!)
Call me what? Call me a Klusterfuk (Fecal!)
Growin' up low enough must have sucked (People!)
Call me what? Call me a Klusterfuk

Talk about growin' up fucked up
I grew up with a mentally ill mother, so it's no wonder that I'm slightly askew
Her fanatical religious views had me sittin' in pews eight days a week
And because of that, me and God didn't speak for a while
Now I crack a smile when I'm asked my religious preference
I utter a Tech N9ne reference replying: ""I'm a Klusterfuk""
I mixed up all the stuff that religion had to offer
Boiled it in my cauldron 'till the bullshit burned off it, all that was left was love
I can't say I always rise above the trivial shit in my life, 'cause I don't
Sometimes my ego won't allow me to walk away, if you know what I'm sayin'
I've done a lot of drugs, shit, I've done a lot of thugs, but in the end
As long as I'm aligned with love, then I know I'm livin' righteous

By a landslide my energy!
Will kill a man, why try mimic me?!
Cause the fans tied identically!
Love it when the fans buy my memories!
By a landslide my energy!
Will kill a man, why try mimic me?!
Cause the fans tied identically!
Love it when the fans buy my memories!

By a landslide my energy! (Growin' up low enough must have sucked)
Will kill a man, why try mimic me?!
Cause the fans tied identically! (Call me what? Call me a Klusterfuk)
Love it when the fans buy my memories!
By a landslide my energy! (Growin' up low enough must have sucked)
Will kill a man, why try mimic me?!
Cause the fans tied identically! (Call me what? Call me a Klusterfuk)

And break her back and then I
Gotta go leave her lashed from the passion (I'm crazy)

Baby girl but don't play me

Wanna excite ya, ignite the fight

I came to turn the night up, now watch me as I light up

Hey, I smoke in Amsterdam, in Denmark, Christiana
Canada then Germany, now everybody in this twist ganja
Now when I go to my second home, big Tech is prone to conjure
Some of that new legal purple good Colorado marijuana

Break it down, pearl it up, fire it up, pass it ‘round
Got that dope, eighth of the dream
And a quarter with the purp when I'm in the town
Nobody fucks with regular, all my shit spectacular
Hit it for the low, shit gotta be real loud and this wild next to ya
Rhino rolling in the most,
 hydro mixed with indigo
Blaze that shit, really can't get no high
But niggas still feel me though
Chokin' dope, blazin' fire, roll 'em up, mile high
Lovin' Colorado strawberry kush, open wide

Put you lighters up in the sky when the nigga do it
For the homeboy Pakelika
Restin' in Reefer
, smoking that Keisha
Through a vaporizer with a feature
Tech N9ne, I'ma kick it every time
When I ease my mind, I hit my bottle
But they legalized it in my second home
When I go, I'ma hit that good Colora-

You already know what it is, tappin' bottles, chippin' lips
Rollin' up another thumper then we on the way to kill another gig
Info, Frizz, Stevie, Tech, Ubi and Pcaso too
Chongin' out in the open,
 tokin', smoke so loud that I can't hear you
Look at me walkin' sideways, wavy but I'm not sloppy
And I'm burnin' down the bush with the chief
The spirits have got me
Better roll up, you know I'm cold as fuck
Going nuts iffin' I'm up in your place
Takin' a hit of the purp, I'ma hold it in then blow it in your face

 Info Gates
(Cough)
 Bitch don't hate
I showed up at the studio, bars official
Cause I'm on trees like carved initials
I got that Candy Maldonado
But I'm in KC, not Colorado
So if a cop finds this avocado
I got in this medicine bottle, I gotta get gone

Be hittin' the indica strain
When it get in my brain, then it isn't the same
I'm twistin the flame
Light up, the Ces is definitely beneficial for the pain
That medical Jane, never synthetic
You know photosynthesis gettin' the blame
Blowin' the legit if you switchin' the state
Ah, blow the piff and I'm driftin' away
When I'm out in the Springs
With a mountain to king, I'm countin' the ounces they bring
They offer that kush (Kush)
They burnin' the bush
, they 'bout it, no doubt it's a thing
I'm jackin' the cyph'
Livin' in colorful Colorado over half of my life

Blowin' loud out my sunroof, back in the Sunshine State

So I growin' eyes on my back and droppin' brims over my face
I need a high estate, elevate
Gotta get back up to that Denver stage
Where the fans are Strange and the air is thin
But the smoke is thick, I just can't explain
Sparkin', puffin', passin'
Ease your pain and all these forms of fashion
I think it's only right we celebrate it, just get

Up-up high, get 'em up-up high
Stuck in the sky, we got a lust, let's fly
And I just met my angel, dangled
With a halo and a bud supply
Went over limit and you heard the tale
About my freaked out, tweaked out weed dungeon
But I forget about that when I'm in the 'Do
See I be all up on them Green Funyuns
Took another trip out to the CO
Where they be telling me the liberty is legal
So that's no whiz test for your PO
We go to free load and debo Doritos
Showing love to Metropolis
And the brother with the funk on the side of the curb
Green cross in a season of moss
When they all breed crops and they dying to serve

Fort Collins to Boulder, we smoke the average
We just feel wicked, we on that Jodi Arias
Rollin' and jokin', these folks just stare at us
Trippin' for no reason, when it's so hilarious
You high or something? 
Yeah square
, you scared to puff?
You wanna fly with me? 
Yeah, airfare is up
Just be careful when you hit it, I got admit it
I been known for sprinkle these orange hairs with dust
Forgot where we was, tried to order a Quarter Pounder
From a Taco Bell drive-thru high so we drove off
On the road lost, blinded from the smoke fog
Made it to the crib, I hit the door and then I dozed off
Broke off my homies a couple buds
And ever since the day I did it, I done got a bunch of phone calls
Ask me how much do an O' cost
In Atlanta, got 'em smokin' on that dope dog, ya-ya-uh-yeah

When I'm in another land, I smoke that fire-ire-ire
I don't really hit to choke but tonight I'm gonna try-y-y
Take some weed, mix it with tobacco leafs
Actually and breathe in and lose my faculties, naturally
(Okay) Worldwide now, following Tech Nina
Take another hit if you got that reefer
Bring me a little bit of that sativa
Baby, toast, cause my anxiety don’t like what I put up inside of me
I go back to the bottle, when I take a hit of that

He's not as grounded as he used to be
Tech was a devil worshiper
They seen a black dude with red hair and a long beard
I mean look, he look scary to me too
And that nigga Tech, man, he sellin' out, man
That... that's... he's doin' that for the white folks
Thats white shit he doin', man

I've been writing for nineteen years or so
Hate rules in these times
Niggas don't wanna see me shine
Stop me, and then try to tell me (come gangsta)
And then compare me to Nelly (where's yo bank, bruh?)
So this song's gonna tell these
So called gangsta niggas who the fuck
Has always been the bigger G
Hey, I've been bustin', and fizznuckin' bitches
It is nothin', for years puffin'
I've been clutchin' riches from his muffin'
Here's ""Fuck you niggas"", this is tough and I
Don't know what the fuck you thinkin'
Tellin' me this shit is hella fake
Say, since way back in the days rappin', the blaze happened
I raised raves, crazed days, was blade packin', and stage saggin'
They's wack and N9na stayed layed back and I
Laugh at negros constantly
They never know the money N9na makes
Hey, this is amazin' how niggas formulate they hatin'
You fuckin' fornicate, you're mistaken
We could never correlate 'cause you fakin', huh?
Who's bringin' in through bacon, huh?
Who's keepin' it shakin', huh?
Got any questions Sinister Tech and Tecca N9na
Niggas know the rest
Gay is all you punks and Mitch Bades
This in your trunk, won't get played on the radio
Too gangsta for an old lady, bro
Gangsta niggas don't hate me, no
Wanksta niggas won't face me, though
Talkin' shit in books 'bout people tellin' me I really need a vest
Okay!

I rep the town harder than any of you niggas
Wherever I stand, my appeal's the same, punk
And you got the nerve to tell me

Come gangsta
Throw your rags in the air
And know that nobody there
Will compare to your gangsta
Sag your pants to the floor
Every woman's a bitch or a whore
When you're gangsta
Pack ya guns in the club
If they shrug give them thugs mean mugs
Yeah come gangsta
Is what they sayin' to me

I should've been done come with a gun
For the ones who bump they gums, you the one
Said a nigga wasn't gonna make another record
Said I was wack and washed up, done
Said a nigga might scare little ones
He's a fuckin' nightmare, here he comes
With red hair and my face painted

Messy Marv and Corleone is so (Gangsta)

You're Nosferatu vampire, bit my shit

But I'm back on deck 'cause Kansas City is whose throne? Mine!
This ain't no punk shit
Nigga this is strength at its finest
I made this shit so you all you simps can rewind it
Meaning you pussies who say this Tech shit ain't hard for real
And try to disregard the real
You motherfuckers is hard to feel
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
But I stay ahead of the game
And you punks is so late
'Cause my one gangsta track will demolish your whole tape
I've been with every rapper who's legendary
Underground to mainstream know that Tech is very hard
'Cause I bring the heater
Love me 'cause I'm your leader
Bitches, they suck my Peter
While I'm drinkin' Margaritas
Niggas get layed down
Seven displayed sounds
N9ne, the crazed clown
Lines like sprayed rounds
This is for all you haters who don't pump my shit
If you say this ain't gangsta you can suck my dick!

I might look like a clown, huh
But you niggas sound like a muthafuckin' circus
Fuck you muthafuckas

This nigga is the tightest nigga movin' man
I mean... Tech N9ne will demolish all you niggas

Nuck figgas always got to make a totha bruch her
Never had no problem taking down another buster
'Cause they be doing shit bass ackwards, fothermucka

What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

I'm Yo Gotti, the drug dealer
I'm Yo Gotti, the thug nigga
I'm Yo Gotti, my own hitter
And if you wanna ODX, then say Yo Gotti the plug, nigga
I've been getting money for a long time
You've been banging, throwing up the wrong sign
Pussy ass nigga, you a cross-gender
Fuckboy, you a ho, nigga
And you remind me of my ho, nigga
Nothing I hate worser than a broke nigga
Got a Tec-9, and an AK, and a FN
Got a white Vette, and a white Ghost, and a white Benz
I ain't running with niggas, 'less I'm getting money with niggas
I don't act funny with niggas, keep it a hundred with niggas
Kept a thousand with niggas, I ran in houses with niggas
I put in work with the squad, we even sold flour to niggas
But, fuck

What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming, maintaining that they factors
When'd you push a package? When'd you ever clap shit?
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space before
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I laid
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame and fuck you, and fuck him, and her, too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?
Bass ackwards

These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laughin'
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spelling ""stressed"" backwards, dessert with my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R&R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back order
Flip you ass backwards
Bitch, you are bass ackwards if you think that's awkward

Moon stricken
Animal need
Bad seed
Untamable (Beast)

Everybody around me always thinks they know what's goin' on inside my mind
Think I'm Mr. Nice Guy all the time
How they say on Diary, you think you know but you have no idea!

Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast

I can smell your women's rosey poonany on the dance floor all the way in V.I.P
I'm a rapper, I can snatch her
And she will leave with me because of my stature
Now everybody move, everybody bounce
Who ever the N9na choose we about to pounce (work it out)
With the 151 in my bottle
I call Hef, will he let me hit this model in the grotto?
I like, all women, tall women, and small women
You got to, let Tech Niz tease your chakra
Species release freaks please the monsta
Petit beast feez these G's will rock ya
Handcuff her buster don't trust her
'round these hustlers, homie don't be a sucker
When your lover say Tecca N9nas a brother
She tryin' to say that I rushed her then crushed her

Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo

Handcuff your hoe

I'm out to get that money like a robbery
Now I got it all my enemies wanna clobber me
Squalor be harder we need dollars camaraderie
The hotter these collars be the larger the lottery
Need them tens twins
Gotta succeed spend G's, Ben Franks
We cram cheese in banks
Breed sin we win thanks
Hungry like the wolf indeed but I give
Money to my crooks that need, I live
In Sherman Oaks but from Kansas City
I miss home Cali is business but man it's pretty
I ain't lyin' y'all, monster for money for mine y'all
If I wasn't gettin' money I'd do time dog
You'll never see the N9ne fall
Big house wood floors, maid cleanin' the bitches with Pine-Sol

Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo

Friend this industry is no kin to me
Behold the flow of the century
But they scared of me
Rappers they don't compare to me
Fair to be, said that they dares to be sincerely a rarity (Wow!)
Check the SoundScan, look around man
Wake up look at your Jacob you in killa clown land
Face paint and Juggalettes with bubble butts
And we rockin' plus the Diddy women in the button ups
Hands down we rock harder than Kiss
But rap me Kutt and Krizz
But can I get two stomps and a clap in this bitch
N9na shot to the top 'cause I plots to get rich
Tell ya, executive, I'm next for this
Success it is, yep the best for Tech
This ain't Baptist, Pentecostal or Methodist
This is the Beast baby out I mean Exodus

I'm mean, and I will, destroy you, I am the Beast

Get filthy must make mo dough

Cause they said they serving more jaw then Jay Leno
What they seein' walk through the doors, winners
Haters muggin' us because they hoes, grinners
Sinners better simmer when thinking they want to chin us better remember it ain't nothing but rogue, in us
Steppin' out with Tech Nina, yes sir, weather remains, wetter she came
Next thing you know, mayne, that girl want everything, everything
When it's playing she saying this my shit
That's why they be waiting in line to kiss my grip
Offer true paid dues, I'm not selfish
But you may lose, if I could help it

Ladies used to hate me, now they comin' out their panties
Girls on the jock (check), pocket full of socks (check)
Got a fat knot (check), somethin' going squat (yeah)
Down, dopa-dopa-do, down for the block? (yes)

It must be a dream
Hit the stage, everybody holler
Gettin' throwed, rippin' shows for a bigger dollar
Father, I don't wanna leave nobody toothless

'Til the rap game came to rescue me
And left my wrist paved in accessories
A dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck MCs
You're wrong if you thinkin' Wayne was the recipe
Nah, he ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back
Get off the kool aid, stir me a batch
See, I prefer to relax, but I can't and God knows it
Gotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with
Oh shit, niggas, keep fuckin' with my emotions
Maybe that's the reason I suffer from psychosis
Shocking as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless
So I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this

I can't breathe anymore
I've gone the distance
Can't see me anymore
The darkness has overcome
I don't wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now it's dripping all over me

We on the surface be hell raisers
We crave good life but born into this dead-zone
I've searched for answers from my female maker
In the cemetery but they never produced her headstone

Black as ever like Shabba
Thick and oozing like lava
See this room with my Prada
, dadda
Must've came from my father
‘Cause my mama, was an angel
But this thang grow, insane bro
 (insane woah)

This is darkness accumulated
Over the years and
 
heartless buffoons that made it
Over to here on the TV
Cops kill a man ‘cause he’s trying to buy a BB Gun (BB Gun)
What’s gonna happen when they see me come
Really run (Really run)

I’m ‘bout to just boom
Take the madness
Let it explode and shake the masses
Shroud that I carry here to break the rabbits
And awake the maggots
I hate your habits (I hate your habits)
Your evil's consuming me
Now my heart and brain's together in unity
Darkness…
‘Cause ain't no opportunity

I've gone the distance
Can't see me anymore
The darkness has overcome
I don't wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now it's dripping all over me

They say my metamorphosis made a monster
In so many ways this statement might be true
Your plan right from the start was divide and conquer
So what do you think I see when I see you?

Give me your wishes
Give me your hit-list
Bring all the wicked
I’m ‘bout to show you I’m vicious
Ligaments and Sriracha’s delicious
No stopping for tickets
Don’t make me give the crooked coppers the business
Coppers the business
(Swallowing sound)
I look suspicious
Wearing your anger
During your danger
Swearing whore wrangler
Don’t let me close to y’all
If you touch it it’s like an overdose of Propofol
I be the ghost to all
That wanna vote for hogs
I got a goat to maul
(Goat to maul)
(Swallowing sound)
Licking my lips, ow!
Burn my tongue
I need a germ to come kill me
In worms and dung lay stagnant
I’m an avid mad lad
See the evil I grab it
Stick to me like a magnet
You can have it
(You can have it)
Rack, I'mma clack on they asses
Brack! Brack! Brack!
Give the evil no passes

Can't see me anymore

So I called on my big homie Big Scoob, and my lil' homie; JL B. Hood
Let's go

Yeah, aha, Big Fella
Back pushin' that trap shit to your tracklist
Tecca N9na's new package, Big Fella gon' snap bitch
Whip game, I'm magic, front flips, no backflips
Ill eatin' old passed whips, looky here, these facts, bitch (yeah!)
Big Fella y'all know me man, show me, homie, I'm still the same
I'm a little older got a little colder, I'm still a soldier, I'm blowing flames
Time to get, what's happening blood?
This don't get it I'm acting up
Y'all ain’t wit it, then I'ma go get it and ship it in, in the back of the bus
Nah, I'm just fuckin' with it, bickin' back and having fun
Bullshit I'm having none, pussy niggas best hold their tongue
Flip a switch and I'm with the shit get to clapping clips and I'm banging drums
Ignorant with this ignant shit and my only wish is you come get some!

I told you bitches where the fuck I'm from
Showed you this is where the luck might run
Out for the doubt, what you do with yo mouth about to be part of the reason I come and bust my gun!
Finicky front wanna be just like them
Nigga's a bore, be hunted just like one
This no war nor kid time son
It's a warning, do nothing dumb
You can feel what it is when exposed to the G's
A real one exists this close to the lead
Get ahold of the disk you suppose to believe
The show is a trip and the flow's a disease
Coke gotta fizz, got zones of the trees
Never let 'em live, let alone let 'em breathe
Not a fuck I could give, like ""fucks? What are these?""
Pros we official, the hoes Lebanese
Strange got the game in a guillotine choke
Language aimed seen finna be quo-
-Ted, know it ain't my enemy hope
Swank if you can't consider me dope
Ya skank wanna grope me and Joey Cool both
On the bull with a 7, no Tony Kukoč
Bitch check into whenever you post
They come out the wood works know whenever you close
You know what I'm yellin' know somebody better tell 'em
Hard head make a soft ass lemme get 'em
Up in art class was the only time you drew a weapon
Up the bar blur lines I'm a urban legend
No T.I. TMI but I'm fuckin' with protection
Paper work in red like I'm makin' a correction
Select what I said hope you makin' the connection
We come at a nigga head it come off him in a second
Me and Tech got high said we finna do work
Spat hot lava, finna shoot first
You expect not vibe I could only do church
If my nigga was alive I am in the booth hurt!
Know that I'mma ride, while I tell 'em B. Hood
You would look odd in my neck of the woods
If I really wanna slide in your ho I could
But I'm God with a double O, y'all know I'm good!
Step like I should!

I steps like a real should
Papered but still hood, we whip it and feel good
Ayy, we makin' your bitches feel good
Yanked it and still could, we whip it and feel good
I steps like a real should
Papered but still hood, we whip it and feel good

Red Nose,Sickology 101,2009.0,"That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose

I got my face painted, crazed, ain't it?
That a black dude lookin' like he got a white tattoo
People thinkin' that he way tainted... by evil
Treat you like fecal, wanna beef you when they meet you
People perceive you to be lethal when you ain't see-through like tissue
I feel like the industry givin' me vivid stupidity
When they distribute these fictitious sissys
When I rip it so serious and wickedly, no forgivin' thee
When I claim we're Strange
Everyone tellin' me I'm insane, we're bane
I'm an independent, talented individual workin'
But the industry is the reindeer game
And they call me Rudolph the Red
They know I don't rip a mic but I chew off the head
Spit it at the PDs and DJs and VJs who be gay
You fakin' you get threw off a ledge
If you tough we snuffing
Homie trust me nothing
Is worse than knowin' you're beautiful
But get treated like an ugly duckling
So I'm Rocky Dennis, but I'm so polished nothin' can stop me in this
Bad in the brain and the good is not replenished
The fakers who imitate me and mock me ‒ finished
We check the mill, yes it's real
Through Strange I don't need ya major label record deal

That's real, people act a different way with me

The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose

They tend to stray away from me because I'm different
And it's been this way with me ever since I was an infant
Other kids were jealous
They say that the look up off in my eyes seem hellish
Never knowin' later in life I would relish
The thought of me ballin', livin' my life and sell it
I blame it on program directors, go and request us, no damn selector
But if you got a lot of dough man they blessed ya, sure can depressed ya
When you knowin' that it ain't nobody better mane
Stuck off in the cold when the bad weather came
Now they gotta see me livin' it up and cheddar gain
Comin' from the forever pain to it never rains
So I throw up the finger to everybody who got a tow up demeanor
Thinkin' that Tecca N9na was sho' 'nuff a dreamer
But the flow is so heavy it could show up Katrina
Now it's time to take it, and you all must face it
Tech N9na is sacred
All of you hatin' fakers couldn't see me with LASIK
Red nose, the leader so follow
You gotta be ready to get up and go is the motto
Made it through everything negative, bravo
The money that's comin' to me feel like I won a lotto
Now I'm 'bout to put the slay on auto
Swoop down on the DJs
Tell 'em all to quit the replays
Make 'em put Tecca N9na in the Serato

That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose

I'm comin' and drivin' my short bus
With this nose I don't need a torch up
Bustin' through like the industry's por' chop
Comin' after who didn't support us
Rip down its bleachers
I blew up 'cause my sound is aether
Underground up and found this creature
Not scared of a nigga with clownish features
I'm makin' a name outside your mainstream
Real, it wasn't an insane dream
From the beginnin' I really came clean
You about to see Strange gleam
Take it over and gain green
Strange Music and RBC along with Fontana we gon' change things
Now it's so funny 'cause with money I can fly away
Or leave them haters off in the deepest darkest hideaway
Why do they do me wrong? My music truly strong
Because I'm different all you cowards wanna shoo me gone
Yes this is Strange year, worldwide fame's near
But the game's queer
Sometime I feel like I'm Rudolph the Reindeer
And the music they said blows is on top and the cred grows
You're gonna have to open up the door for the bro with the red nose

That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose

Granted a lot has come to me
But some major ideas still trying to make it go
Fortune force field
I can taste it, but can't drink it
I can make it when I think it
Can't mistake it, so distinctive
Man I hate this, man I dreamed it, can't believe it
I gotta let it go!

(So!) It's on for tonight
(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight
(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light

Why you wanna try to take my bill ticket?
I mean real wicked, I seem real livid
I've been filled with it, I mean vexed
Un-ex-pect-ted-ness, when everything is the best
I get a minute to rest, but then a nigga regrets
I gets the money but next I'm in debt
(I won, what?) I mean I lost, take green from a boss
Be the things that I dream, but they intervene they get my creme, then I'm off
(Whose they?)
They turned the motherfuckin' best position into a deposition
Dealing with that will make you wanna ex the mission
Never no checks to get to and that's the bitching
How do I maintain my autonomy
With so many leeches in this economy?
My moaning is mearly monetary
But the moment it's really gone is scary
Try to beat my high score, but I fight forward despite lawyers
An eye for an eye because my type's warrior
Never the less I inherit a mess, a big floor spill
I'm steady pushing to break down this fortune force field

Yeah, it's like pulling a bad one
Get her off at the pad, then get the Jimmy to stab some
But you can't and puddy is right there
Like a, barrier or something, keeping you from her such a negative type lair
You can never pipe nair when you've got it in front of you, wanna do, it's a pitiful nightmare
It's like making a baby
You never having it, is making you crazy
And toting a living human, it's making you weighty
Kick, kick, kick, shaking your lady
Like late in the 80's, got my name and got to taking the stage, V
Told the people I got Satan to save me, that's why radio be hating to play me
Everything you gain only brings you pain
But the fame it fools the brain
But you regain it through Strange
Yeah, never put your guard down
Because I wanna bang, bang, bang hard now
I'm a warhound, never mistaken I kick walls down
To the ground and get applause sound because I got even, then I'm lard bound

(So!) It's on for tonight
(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight
(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light

Lot of dreams are lost in the night
Lot of dreams are lost in the night
Fuck your litigation
We gon' win, just a bit of waiting
Everytime that I get ahead gotta be a motherfuckin' drawback
So I'mma draw back and bang them bitches 'til they all crack

Kept the first five I done for me
And you others know that Caribou Lou belong to me
You come for me
Just know we will never settle, war is what it's gonna be!

In the back by myself, I listen to our dope sounds, but (Chea)
There was no women to round up (Chea)
This hound just sleeps deeply, anticipatin' the next town’s luck (Chea)
It’s glitz and glamour when you on the stage
Happy ‘cause you and your homies paid
But a lot of my love ones up and gone away
Because I put my music first, for that it's lonely days

Oh, ain’t no phones ringin'
Ain’t no one speakin' when you’re alone
Oh, feels like there's no reason
For me to keep breathin' if I’m gonna be alone
I can’t sleep alone
And I can’t go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gon' shout
But when the lights go out you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know me being me
You wouldn’t think I’d be
Alone

Got off my tour July Seven, my children
Kicked it with me up to the 24th, then they go home (Chea)
Even though my home used to be they home
But due to separation and altercations with their mama’s it left me so alone (Chea)
And when my girl visits (Chea), she got to leave
‘Cause she’s independent and has a need to make her own cheese (Chea)
At night before sleeping I’m on knees (Chea)
Alone, ""Please, I don’t wanna have the lonelies"" (Chea), on Beeze (Chea)
My two family members that room with me (Chea)
They zoom quickly to work and dip outta town, you would assume it'd be (Chea)
Party, party every night a gnarly nudie show (Chea)
But it’s hardly a party when you starting in the studio (Chea)
I can’t wait for the meet and greets, makin' fans
That’s why I be hella happy, hugging and shakin' hands
When I perform I want everybody to know
I stretch the show ‘cause when it’s over everybody go

Oh, ain’t no phones ringin'
Ain’t no one speakin' when you’re alone
And oh, feels like there's no reason
For me to keep breathin' if I’m gonna be alone
I can’t sleep alone
And I can’t go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gon' shout
But when the lights go out you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know me being me
You wouldn’t think I’d be
Alone

A storm cloud stalks me making what should be a sunny day
Shed tears of lonesome despair in the form of rain
I've devoted my life to rid you of your pain
For feelings of acceptance which reveal themselves feigned
Do not mind that, scream the voices in my brain
But if I stop giving, only I remain
Though I know not of misery
For I lack the company it needs to be entertained
But misery would be a nice change
This solitude drives me insane

Yeah, I think it’s my fault, y’all
‘Cause I’m reclusive (Chea), and I’m thinking I lost broads
Like Y! Exclusive (Chea), and I know that I might fall
‘Cause life is stupid, ‘cause cupid shoots it and I fight off
What it might produce, its love, whatever has it I run
People, pets and even movies that have it, I shun
Thinkin' back when I had a family, was glad I was some
I picture myself in the future, old mad, sad ‘cause I’m one

Oh, ain’t no phones ringin'
Ain’t no one speakin' when you’re alone
Oh, feels like there's no reason
For me to keep breathin' if I’m gonna be alone
I can’t sleep alone
And I can’t go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gon' shout
But when the lights go out you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know me being me
You wouldn’t think I’d be
Ye—ye—ye—ye, alone

Godspeed,The Storm,2016.0,"Kingdom!
From this day on
I will never - force - anything good
Down anybody's throat
Now before I start spazzin'
I'ma speak in a language
That the majority
Will understand

Niggas see me shinin'
They know Tech Nina the best at the rhymin'
Yeah, but they ain't buyin'
Strange Music flyin'
We steady climbin'
I'm still a wanted man
I get a hunnid band
Still I do Summer Jam
Woah!
Tecca N9ne milla'
Kansas City Killa'
Turn up!

Bubblin' up with it because a nigga be gassin'
Enemy know that I'm ready for action
No matter the money we gotta go dummy, I'm wit' it so nigga whats happenin'
I feel like comin' and do it with passion
Whenever I'm in the booth I'm real as ramen and juicy juice
And the vomit induced when the onyx been poop
Regroup and spin this shit
Learnin' this level of linguistics
Lot of you who lose it love lickin' limp bizkits
And I am done
Tryna shine a star of Donnie to the people like ""fuck this nigga""
Soundin' willed as Farrakhan he
Never can raise the bar upon me
I am on par with omni
Kill every thing in sight before the light say ""habari gani""
Longevity, haters don't wan' credit me
When I'm steadily reachin' people like mom said it'd be
They yawn heavily, like they be gone medically
When I'm bussin' on this bitch industry like Ron Jeremy
This song's therapy, Strangenetically, bomb palms red if he's blond
Here to denouncin' The Don's pedigree
I'm a 'gnac linguist
Wit' a black penis
I can act meanest
'Cause I'm a rap genius
Keepin' 'em crack fiendish
Praise K.O.D. please
For blowin' up himself like his last name was Aziz
No kryptonite, I'ma be Superman, makin' Zod leave
Thinkin' you're gonna do better, you're puffin' the odd trees
(Godspeed)

Everybody know us
We ain't gotta say it
They know can't nobody hold us
Maybe 'cause the flow screams
Inner city killa
Ain't no coming from the shoulder
Strikin' like a cobra
(Kansas City!)
Lightin' up the dough
We gonna blow just like I told ya'
Steady getting mo' green
Killa!
City!
Soldier!
Turn up!

Low IQ listeners they bashin'
Lightweight keeping me flashin'
I don't think they ready for the murder for the slashin'
From MMM chopping em up in pieces in a wicked fashion
Not a nigga left, why you triggered then
From the hottest spitta, fought a bigger Tech
How ya figured that
How ya gonna test a hobbler
Shoulda' stayed behind the candelabra
The God does damage to who's talking fucking bologna (bologna)
About who the best, from my crew the threat
From here to Budapest, this how you shoot the tech
I'ma forever be ripping you never be up and ahead of me
'Cause I'ma shooter, do ya through your neck
Shake it till it open make a milli' man I did it and I blew the check
For Pete's sake
This music is gleamin', but because all of the streamin' will never reach cake
Good thing we didn't get our piece late, we straight
Seven this beats great, shoulda' probably did it with Keith Ape
This is for the villains
Kansas City livers stackin' paper to the ceilin'
And fuck how they feelin'
If they hate the way we movin' 'cause we really make a killin'
Make your broad leave
'Cause she diggin' me and my niggas we get it open like fob keys
Knock it out like the Ali's, but to you she was a rod tease
Not another soul will rock it whenever the K.O.D. breathes
(Godspeed)

Everybody know us
We ain't gotta say it
They know can't nobody hold us
Maybe 'cause the flow screams
Inner city killa
Ain't no coming from the shoulder
Strikin' like a cobra
(Kansas City!)
Lightin' up the dough
We gonna blow just like I told ya'
Steady getting mo' green
Killa!
City!
Soldier!

Ooh, Godspeed
If you think you're brave enough then come and try me!
I kill everything in sight
People hate that the number one is related
To the greatest
Independent favorite
That made it, hella rippin' up stages
And gave it everything in pages
And gainin' real amazing wages
Double eight did with Travis
Integrated now as the latest hits
Fuckin' right nigga!
We came up from the gutter
To lots of butter, I put that on Uncle Ike nigga!
Thanks to Carlton and Maudie, N9ne was born!
Now everybody on the globe gonna have their eye on

Love 2 Dislike Me,Something Else,2013.0,"I am your fool
Loving you, I shouldn't
You take me, chain me
I have nothing anymore

You want a regular dude, but you think that I'm what you need?
You gonna get in your mood, wanna bitch in every text you read
Sometimes I think I wanna let you breathe, but I'm the enemy if I set you free
I gotta let you know that it gets to me, ready or not like a refugee
You complaining when I see you
That I never have time, that I'm busy as a beaver
Foul face when i feed ya
Really need hennessy, that be my fucking reliever
Why you wanna stand and cry the most
Are you thinkin' that I’m for you to try the coke
To knot the hole, really wanna tie the ropes
Say by default and hang Nina by the throat
You must really like my imperfections
Cause you stay on dismay, temper detections
And thats nightly, too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts, but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me

What did you ever see in me?
Was I only what it needed be?
I'm running away from your judgement
Don't you try to find me
I won't let you change me anyway, anyway

Yo, I'm feeling stoned now
Sick of having those breakdowns, they gone now
It's on now, I've grown foul, it's wrong how we've shown clouds
You keep your tone out of my dome, gal
I'm sick of this shit
All the picking and the pulling, I don't dig it a bit
Living and learn what I want and what I'm giving 'em living 'em digging a ditch
Dick I wanna fit up in this
You stayed out of my premises
But you ain't supposed to be my nemesis
Wanna be in to kiss, never to finish it
What happened to close friends with benefits?
I'm mad as hell
Cause I wanna be back when we had it well
All this static's problematic like grabbing a rabbits tail
And thats nightly, too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts, but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me


Inside I wanna find somewhere I can hide
Away from all the faded dreams and tainted lies
I wanna tear you up and love you all at once
You quit and score so give me more
Give me more, give me more

Don't tell me everything's okay
I'm only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me
Don't tell me everything's okay
I'm only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me

You point out all my imperfections, but yet you stay
That's nervewrecking
I can't live this way",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-love-2-dislike-me-lyrics

Within this, three planets collide
Brotha Lynch, Dalima, Tech N9ne
Bring you along for the ride

Wait a minute, I’m from the West Coast Conference
Like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me the King of the Valley
All I need is a game jersey
Nigga nuts and guts get served up
When I get it, I’ll spit enough, aim sturdy
Cut it up, gut it up, with cold cuts
Wita oven that heated up, came dirty
I’ll be off of that kryptonite
Turn ‘em into liquid ice,
 stain his jersey
Leave ‘em in the back of the El Co
Like Helter Skelt’, stick it to ‘em like velcro
Nigga, I’m a bitch killer
I’ma dig a ditch, quick to rip ya
Paint a murder picture wit'cha
I’m a jack knife, strip ya that night
Split your legs open and dick you
With the 9 milli ithaca rippin' your guts
Eat ya meat, the deep heat, deplete you with the meat cleaver
Then I didn't see you either
Four quarter receiver, court order delete you
Tech ordered the meat, I’m bringin’ the seasonage
And a suicide note, do-or-die locc
He's in the backseat, cut necks, some sexist

Hit ‘em with a weapon, if he steppin’ with a mall rat
Twenty minus eleven, I make ‘em all scat!
Not prosperous now, Tech’s not with his crowd
He’s lost in his clouds
Rather be off’ed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But I’ve been broke, so I might swipe your cheddar
You better get ready to give me, I got a vendetta
Comin’ to get it, whether weed or money, whatever
Nobody said it was gonna be easy, people deceive me
Or leave me in the dark and buried off in Necropolis
One day you gon' see on me TV, you better believe me

Sickology 101,Sickology 101,2009.0,"Hey, now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up!
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit - get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit - get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit - welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is: Tech N9ne!

This is style, I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, monotone is what you spit
Switchin' the pattern, bust out that quick Middlewest chatterin'
Some people hate but it ain't matterin'
But the people gather, it's flatterin'
Switchin' the pitch, mixin', there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin' full clips on a mission, full bliss when I be rippin' this shit
Make it exciting, got to be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding, if you're going to be biting, you're igniting the beast
This is melodic, melodies if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales,
 you singin' off-key, it's garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction
Don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin' motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!

(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
From our West Coast instructor: Crooked I

My killer cadence can keep me crushin' the competition
Comin' correct when creatin' the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missin''
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty - if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm puttin' swag in my style (in my style)
It's an emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the crossfire

(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology

(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
From our East Coast instructor: Chino XL

Everybody start lockin' their windows and doors
Chino might get in
It's like lightning and how I'm strikin' a triflin' rifleman
Bullets flyin' up and I'm numbin' the bum like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling
Chino be curdlin' blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana than half of you rappers on the radio!
Startin' drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery like I drive a coroner van
I'm demented, spittin' writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin' and fittin' to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin' Sickology, 
try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
Yes, I got to be vicious, this is Sickology

Slow to Me,Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"""Dumb it down. No gun-it sound.""
If I took that advice, it wouldn't be nice, I'd be plummet-bound
So I'm 'bout to clown like Kinko—distinct flow
That'll shrink yo' remains of yo' pee-brain people if you think slow
(Hit the staccato flow)
Listen and follow me, this how it ought to be
Audibly, quality,
 call it the K.O.D it be modesty, but if Sickology's
Hot as me, spit no apology
(Keep going)
Flipping bidiness, it is not a free policy
If I spit it then it gotta be dollars, we
Up and get it I be fucking livid if you keep Donnie's economy
(Double time)
Not too many wanted me to spit it with the syllables
A nigga that be critical, the pinnacle and givin' that original
A killa with the trigga flow and really wanna get the billion in it low
(Play the bongo)
If you don't wanna speed it up, I'm gonna eat it up
Everybody see I'm formidable
I'm coming to heat it up, I gotta beat it up
When I get the booty, she comin' to get it from a real negro
Beyond bomb, the women need pom-poms
When I get to rippin' they want to get little Don Don
To give up the John John before we get to sippin' the Chandon
Free my nigga Ron Ron, for real
Back to the nigga with the fast flow, havin' the cash though
'Cause if anybody, got it, I'm on the mash fo'
And I bet I'm gonna beat 'em 'cause they ass slow, yep

But they never get it 'til you spit it slow
KC niggas did this flow in '94
But they say they understand me when I chop my lyrics though
Nigga, this ain't choppin', I'm a show you how we chop 'n' go!
(Ready, go!)

All I wanna do is get the bitches thinkin' I can really do the cunnilingus and I'm gonna bring it
I can do whatever they want, I'm really good with the tongue
I tell 'em—""That's slow to me.""
 (Yeah)
So when I do the flippin', don't be lookin' at me stupid, I'mma kill it, I'mma nuke it
I'mma step up the poppin', I got the rappin' to cap it up
I'mma say—""That's a motherfuckin' flow to me.""

Ah-huh!
)

Time's up (Time's up), 
when the clock is tickin'
GODS is spittin' flow,
 do you got to listen? No, no
With your hinds up (Hinds up), do I got to kick it? Well, no
But you mind'll visit, knee to elbow, 'cause your rhyme designed us to find this, just live with it
(How you know?)
We was choppin' like this when we first got it poppin' and people was dissin' it (And people was dissin' it)
Now you got the masses formed full from our passion, your asses they kissin' it (They kissing yo' ass)
It ain't in vogue to indulge, you let yo' pen spill the info (Yup)
And I've been told that I've been cold since they invented Nintendo
(Give 'em a lil' bit)
Well I hit it to make them sit down, bitches, they wanna get down, give me a little mid-dle
(More)
Gotta be quicker than that, slicker than that, and she like the way you lick her, put your dick on the map
(Pull it out)
I'm with the nigga with the chin like a billy goat,
 tellin' me syllables, edible, I got eat 'em like a vegetable
And be the next, yes, best to blow, hopefully next for the checks to flow
 (Oh!)
X and Os to the bozos, from ghettos that get Os and get over, and dancin' kiddos
Bless the souls of the spittin'-written middlemen, tryna get the vittles from they demos that they peddlin'
If you get it, you got it right, interview, write it right, maybe you'll take a flight
Overseas, it seems so exquisite, hoes, they love it when the tongue roll, yup

But they never get it 'til you spit it slow
KC niggas did this flow in '94
But they say they understand me when I chop my lyrics though
Nigga, this ain't choppin', I'm a show you how we chop 'n' go!

All I wanna do is get the bitches thinkin' I can really do the cunnilingus and I'm gonna bring it

(Come on)

What, you can't understand me?
 Goddamn, I can spit this too bad, I guess I gotta give 'em a news flash
Dude, you dupe-ass dude rap-duelers are douchebags
'cause every rapper that's on the radio sound the same
And it's troublin' me, I be like, ""Who's that?"" Then they came to abuse trap music and you wack!
Like they on the same level as me and can't see the huge gap between us, I'm too fast, my lyrics just flew past
I'm a thousand kilometers up ahead of the others, shit that I'm writing so over your head that it hovers
And this is for anybody that ever said fuck us, let me slow it up a little bit and maybe they'll love it
These rappers these days be like, 
""If I could rap like this I might get radio play! (Get radio play!)""
But just 'cause you sound like you crackin' with autotune, that shit don't make it okay!
Fuck that! Stealing creativity—don't give it a go, 
tryna kill like Bus-a-Bus, then I'll gimme some more
Tongue flick fast like Raven-Symoné,
 make her lick on the lady pussy, makin' her moan, 
maybe I'm wrong
To me your bars ain't hard and your song too slow, you will never get to have this charm logo
Goddamn, we a three-man band,
 
Tech gave 'em the bongos, I give 'em a guitar solo like
Youuu tryna pretend that I ain't
Better than 98 percent of these emcees but any minute I annihilate
In a heartbeat sooo, many will sleep when I wake
Fuck a magazine, the shit that you write, your internet site, 'cause all the shitty records you post up, I hate
'Cause your shit sound slow to me
Yeah

Hahahaha, Strange Music, baby!
Truly elite shit! Hahahaha!
I mean, if you can't keep up
I don't know what to tell you, it's slow to me
Haha, and if it's too fast for you

This is pretty deep how I'ma decorate the city street
Little bitty pieces, there's really gonna be some chalky drawings
In this dream I had, when I land
I can taste the blood, I can smell the concrete
And I can feel my bones crush on a calm street
Dark and desolate, my heart'll never get
Another beat I'm gonna be other head to split, my hell is credited
Where the red is in, I'm down and dead admit in light I'm dreadin' this
If we're created of God than predestination
Should not be looked at as odd, when we're blessed to wake in-
Side of a dream, like I've been here before
And we sum it up with some french expression like we didn't hear the lord
So I'm hopin' and prayin'
That I won't be opened and sprayin'
In real life and it's just a dream, and it's not a thing that can sway my view
But my fear is that I end up layin' and ready for decayin'
What I thought was a dream now it's Déjà vu
[Chorus 1: 
Mackenzie O'Guin
 & Tech N9ne]
Fear
If I fall will the angels catch me?
Fear
Or end it all is it my destiny?
Fear
Is there a sound when the ground absorbs me?
Fear
Or a dream tellin' me my story

I called up my mother, but who answered my brother
He said ""she real sick but I'm gonna put her on just tell her you love her""
My heart it just fluttered when mama picked up she would utter
""Who is this?"" I said ""Donnie"", but she thought I was another
Didn't even know me, and she's not an oldie
It's the lupus or epilepsy
Maybe the psychosis solely
""This your son I just called to say happy birthday""
Not really knowin' me hit me in the worst way
Then she said ""Oh yeah, little Donnie, how you doin' in school?""
I said ""I'm 42, mommy!""
I'll give my arm, leg, leg, arm, head if that means my momma get better
Toughest thing to swallow is when someone who raised you, they gonna forget ya
I'm feelin' sadness, I'm feelin' anger
Steady praying for the higher power to come down and change her
Rearrange her 'cause my fear is that the sickness in her mind
In due time it'll make her son a stranger
[Chorus 2: 
Mackenzie O'Guin
 & Tech N9ne]
Fear
A stranger to the one who raised us
Fear
Nameless to the one who named us
Fear
Back to the place where it all began
Fear
I'm seeing heaven but I fear it's the end

Taught to have faith in God
Breakin' bread then we bakin' cod
Makin' plenty then spread it abroad
Wash it down with a glass of Shiraz
I try to walk the path of the righteous one
But this life is one, that's full of strife, let's run
To the mountain top
What I'm 'bout to say if suckas starts to thinking this holy name
I denounce then stop
Man, I'm just sayin'
I do a whole lot of prayin'
And I wonder if it's listenin' to Aaron's nightly whisperin'
'Bout mom in the tithe she's weakly payin'
I know it's a blessing, that I raised kids 'cause I got skill
And thank God that gangbang thing didn't bring me hot steel
Now my mom's worse and a lot ill
My fear is that this God I'm prayin' to for my mother is not real
[Chorus 3: 
Mackenzie O'Guin
 & Tech N9ne]
Fear
Extinguish me from this world of fire
Fear
False teachings taught by liars
Fear
Prayers echo in an empty asylum
Fear
No salvation from man's messiah",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-fear-lyrics
K.O.D.,K.O.D.,2009.0,"Mhm, okay
I hear you
No
Yes
I'm your servant
I have the plan
And I'll give it to 'em
Like you told me to

Wanna live in my world you have to have a Tech tat
Preferably the number N9ne and you gotta get it
Where the back of you neck's at
That'll let me know that you rep that, plus get you out of a death trap
You need it for living 'cause I'm the king
And I'm giving you the permission to get with a no stress pact
Novus Ordo Seclorum 'cause the old world orders' post mortem
It's failure inhaling sailing delta
Watched it swell and swelter
'Til there was no male in shelter
Yes I'm the one that provided ya shell in hell and held ya
When your politicians were welchers
So I built this structure just to help ya
So the communists can't come and quell ya
They call me the King of Darkness when I offer you no pain
Why would they label me heartless when your love is my cocaine
And your soul is my rogaine, I have a thirst to know your brain
When you enter my domain gotta take this number for your name
But you don't have to drink cyanide, I'm gonna be right by your side
If we gotta take that riot ride on the enemy and defy your side
Fight for the place we're building
For the reproduction of more children
Trying to get that number back around 6 billion
I'm gonna rule until then
Founded this colony like a pilgrim
Anybody try to penetrate this section or threaten we KILL THEM

What if?
K. O. D. oh K. O. D. oh
What if, he is, what he says he is?
The King Of Darkness!
K. O. D. oh K. O. D. oh

The King Of Darkness!

Xes lliw eb yrotadnam yliad
Ylthgin, this women need to be living by it
Stay fit n' way driven paste it and dye it
I am the king killer captain crazed frigging pilot
Giving you these khaki pants and white shirt
That's what you wear on my Earth
Eliminating your eye thirst to have any kind of desires
To envy material or admire, my way will extract any type of divider
I'm offering this wider
Understanding of life entirely
Blissfully evading friction and fire, chea
The number N9ne will get you food, even get you tools
To build anything your family choose, but within my rules
All white shoes with red strings for all my crews
That lets me know you Tech's people listening inside my pews
All your dreams and aspirations, this is the affirmation
That you can reach 'em in my world it's not a disaster waiting
No bruises and lacerations no choosers of aggravation
I'm just try'na rehab a nation from exasperation
It's not an exaggeration, I'm something more than your blood and gore
On a level higher than devils or that of Satan

What if?

What if, he is, what he says he is?
The King Of Darkness!

What if, he is, what he says he is?
The King Of Darkness!

When I did ""Anghellic"" I was good and bad, straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reparation blew
Then demons had ""Absolute Power"" when I drug abused
So the angels searched for the ""Vintage Tech""
But they found that the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life look necessary
So now receiving God, the angel was ""Everready""
But the Melancholy strikes, the loving angels mommy's life
So the Misery sat in the angels now becoming ice
So as mom got ill and iller, when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made him bane
There's no more angel straight up KILLER!
My apologies, it's not very God of me
To go crazy and try to teach the whole world ""Sickology""
I was then split in two, back to the beginning view
Angel/demon 'cause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids, all the evil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you, you can love big no matter how much mud you dig
Or dug, you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
I'm mostly angel, and you know sometime we fall
Living under God and I hope it's listening when I say I love you all!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-kod-lyrics
Over It,Strangeulation,2014.0,"No matter what way the fans receive music
We at Strange Music
Will be right there in it
All those streaming services make it nearly impossible for artist to make some real bread
We will prevail and take over all facets of the music industry

All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

Time's up, I'm just
Gonna make it difficult for other rappers to get they rhymes up
N9ne's a mindfuck, I'm the kind to
Design the crime, bury them all in lime, your shine's behind us
Stop, you could do it all day
But you're not gonna pop me the crew and all lay
In the box, you were topping the charts
Look at the people not even jockin' your art
Why's that? 'Cause everybody that really buys rap
Don't wanna listen to any guys yap
Fly! This'll leave you in the sky cap (ahoo!)
Three X, we test the best
Reflect 'cause you're 'bout to go see death
And the killer gonna be Tech, he next
All the people never gonna re-elect such a reject
When I spit vital with this title
You sit idle like Seacrest, we over it

All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

Better pray that they want to come see your show
That right there gonna be your dough
You fizzin' out and we want more, we gon' blow
Them all away then haul away
The raw decay then y'all will say ""we don't know""
The K.O.D'll spray the fraud away
Make it a holiday, see killin' when he don't flow
I’m enhanced and polished
All of the women, they wanna dance and frolic
You was a winner with lotta grands in pockets
Now you get rants and audits
We bored wit'cha, quick to hit ya with the war whip
The scripture mister, Forbes lister
Bigger figure from a poor nigga!
A lot of y'all names I could say
If I was evil, I really would Sway
But I was taught to not be no punk
And don't pull no punches, my hood say
But since y'all actin' like Biancas and Beatrices
I should say, your last album was everywhere
And I don't mean that in a good way, we over it

All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

You can rap all you want and sing
But I'm runnin' things
I'm forever, makes you wanna scream
'Cause I'm the one and king

Don't be devastated due to my dialect
Dummies down declining due to die in debt, die in debt
When you wake and wonder why you wide and wet
Wicked whispers whiskin' away you, why invest? Why invest?
Ain't no competition so get violent
Ain't expectin' nothin' but ya silence, silence
So fly your noggin, I can be the fucking pilot
I know you know my number you can dial it, dial it
You got to know by now that I'm really unstoppable
Try now, you'll be silly in a hospital
Lie down, got the pilly and I lock and load
I'm takin' everything, breakin' everything you'll spit
This ain't nothin' to me, child's play
That's why I'm takin' over this (Bullshit!)

All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-over-it-lyrics
Welcome to the Midwest,Everready [The Religion],2006.0,"The only real place to be
The middle of all controversy
West, yes, of the Mississippi
Welcome to the Midwest

Pistol packin' and money mackin'
Rappin' up out the city where killaz keep it crackin'
Too dark and gritty, back in the dizzy
Jackin' was happenin'
Gafflin' many cacklin'
Now we packagin' crack and the addicts will POP
Kansas City, Missouri
Feel the fury of the inner city
Poverty stricken, novelty spittin'
Follow me quick into the bottom
We gotta be thizzlin'
No frickin apology given
You trippin', we lick a SHOT
Get ready to brawl, hometown
Breakin' a jawbone clown
You ain't a criminal killa
Be ready to get up and fall on down
Look at the darkside
Fulla the gangbangin'
Hookers wit' choppas
And the coppaz they keep them thangs rangin'
You ain't gotta be killa gangsta to know
That you can die tryna hide side thangs for the dough
But after the club, get to skippin' 'cause they trippin' off in the MO

It doesn't really matter where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns
Sun rays shine
Stay inside you should be fine
I'll show you, follow me
Wel-come to the mid-west

It's a city where anybody can 'cause you bodily harm
When you walk in my city hardly armed
And hardly safe to show your face
Apes will erase you and let the blades graze you for the paper
Nowhere to hide on either side of the water
For Gucci and Prada
Krizz and the millimeter will follow ya
Holler and scream, it won't get you a thing
So get you a thing, load it up wit' hollow ones
Light 'em up like a halogen
Look at the crime rate
No wonder why I hate
Niggas keep it peepin'
I'm seekin' it when you leavin' 'em
Keep 'em at bay
And take 'em away if it ain't in the day
Hurry get ya people up outta the K
The Mid (west) is more than just a little chaotic
And if we ain't got it we plottin' 'em to rob 'em for they checks
That be the nature of the beast, to keep the peace
I keep my piece when you in the midwest

It doesn't really matter where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns
Sun rays shine
Stay inside you should be fine
I'll show you, follow me
Wel-come to the mid-west

Hands up, if you wit' it stand up
If ya get it Midwest, we admit it we the scheiße
Stand tough, we can get it manned up
When you visit, big stress hella when you recognize us
Hands up, it you wit' it stand up
If ya get it Midwest, we admit it we the scheiße
Stand tough, we can get it manned up
When you visit (wel-come to the mid-west)

If you trippin' we givin' you a lobotomy
Cannibal, you Hannibal can't amount to my psychology
And poppin' me better be the way you thinkin' of stoppin' me
Get on top of me quick before I make what I got on me click
Money, the mackin' and murder is all that we know
Whether sunny or black in the dirt I'ma gather my dough
If you hustlin' maybe the place you can get it for low
Get your package, and get to packin', gotta get it and go.”
Never walk in my city when alone better draw down
Keep them babies out the way
Catch a stray in the K-Town
Boss in my city
Never crawl, never fall down
Me and Millimeter spray in your way and you better lay down
Gangstas, mobstas, everybody know
'Cause in a town ya wanna clown around at the show
Pack a milli 'cause everybody silly
So get ready to hit the flo'

It doesn't really matter where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns

Stay inside you will be fine

PTSD (Warrior Built),UnKnown,2017.0,"Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one that I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in Iraq, hold, I'ma drop those sins
In a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
My hurt, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I grow leaf to chief

Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

I'm thinkin' about my lady, is she doin' something shady?
Like havin' dudes around my baby, situations got me crazy
Brainiac in subjects, but a maniac in public
Where they train me at is insane we sat with no zany act
We in thuggish - mode, feelin' my love is - cold
In about a minute I'ma flip my top, gonna watch my mug ex-plode
What I need right now from a lady is a kiss and a hug at -shows
Got a grudge, it - holds
God bless my rugged - soul
But I got it, I'm stable, I'm for real I'm willin' and able
Got you feelin' I'm ill and I'm crazed go
Get the manic depressant pill on the table
What'll keep me cool is a good birthday for my baby girl
'Till that time I'm dealin' with my mind and trippin' up with the crime in this crazy world

Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

Look in my eyes
You can probably see the crazy feats of danger that I've survived
Don't wanna relive 'em
If you make me, then I get livid
I might just go commit a crime
I can feel 'em starin' at me all crazy
Like they don't understand what I be s-sayin'
But you ain't seen death
Man I been awake for seven days and I just cannot stop shakin'
So now I'm bout to take another shot and try to battle all my demons, can't let 'em win
I'ma take a semi automatic into my dream and pop shots until they all drop to the end
And that was goin' fine
Until I had a small flashback and they all started risin' from the dead
And now they start to double and double, and this shit's overwhelming but I gotta find a exit quick
My psychiatrist told me I ain't got no hope
I ain't got no pills that I can pop to cope
Just need to buckle down, and try to battle it out
And try to dodge the shit that they about to throw
I know I put in the hours
But it still feels like I got a loose grip on my skill set
But fuck it
I know I gotta get a grip on my head if I'm really bout to do this
All or nothin' man I gotta give it all I got
One shot gotta make this shit count I'm on the clock
Watch, my shit tockin'
Sweat drippin' from the top of my head fallin' to my eyes, so God
Please help me do my best
Then pop, there's a hole in my bullet-proof vest
Shot to the chest man, I'm runnin' out of breath
But I can't leave this world till I lay this shit to rest, ahh!

Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-ptsd-warrior-built-lyrics
Riot Maker/Enjoy,Everready [The Religion],2006.0,"This song is dedicated to Brian B'zle Dennis
And all of the 57th Street Rogue Dog Villians
Real riot makers

This one right here's for the riot makers!
The moshers, the stompers and jaw breakers!
We gon' start this shit off right!
We got KCMO in the house tonight!
We gon' start this shit off right! (Off right!)
We got Tecca N9na in the house tonight! Come on!

This is the moment for riders and thugs
Strippers in body bags, zippers and violence and drugs
Poverty, a bunch of minorities die in the club
They say my music's making 'em lose it, I write it in blood
This is my music for all my people missing my music
Keep listening to it, and like I said, get a pistol and use it
Satan shot my homie Maintain with a missile and blew it
For the industry, 'cause he was one of the truest
I don't know why they be pumpin', it's somethin'
Maybe in the music wanna be bumpin'
It's crunk and it's hella haterific
Throw your set up in the air is all the DJ really wanna play
When it's over it's looking bloody and satanistic
Killas from everywhere listen to me when I be bustin' shit
I'm turbulence, some get nervous when I wreck arenas
Concert promoters in Honolulu don't wanna see me
'Cause they say that Samoans will riot on Tecca N9na

'Cause I'm a riot maker! That's if you don't know
I'm a riot maker! They mosh at my shows
I'm a riot maker! And I come out bustin'
I'm a riot maker! Riot maker!
I don't give a damn about nothing!
Slide Freaker, I'm a skyscraper
Riot maker

Hop in a mosh pit for sho!
You push, you shove, you get elbowed!
Back on, 'cause this for Fat-Tone and Mac Dre
All of the soldiers who got gone on that day
All my people's sittin' in prison this is for you
So won't you listen to the shit that I'm spittin?
Fuck the law man the government they'll hem yo ass up
They'll do everything in their power to get a fast buck
No right or wrongs, just killer bees out for your honeycomb
But you'll find out, when you bind out, you can be free if your money long
Ever been to one of my shows? Yeah, it might be crazy
In Ohio, a chick got a little too hyphy, baby
Stage diving and crowd surfing, couldn't hold back
But they dropped her, now she's unconscious with her skull cracked
Now when this happened it wasn't even during my set
They wanted me to give a signed poster to the hospital, bet
When Travis told me we got papers I thought he was playin'
This bitch is suin' Tecca N9na for one hundred grand!

'Cause I'm a riot maker! That's if you don't know
I'm a riot maker! They mosh at my shows
I'm a riot maker! And I come out bustin'
I'm a riot maker! Riot maker!
I don't give a damn about nothing!
Slide Freaker, I'm a skyscraper

Stand back if you're frightened!
Yeah! Get back 'cause we fightin'!
I'm a skyscraper
That's why everybody in my path is trynna get a little piece of my paper
Man I swear the N9na will never love them, plug them
When I'm rollin' with Skatterman and Snug Brim!

It's Skatterman, cat, Strange Music's black sheep (Why?)
'Cause I'm still countin' money off the back streets
Every city, every show, I got to pack heat
This ain't no fucking rap song, check my rap sheet
I'm one of a kind, turn one into nine
Blow your head of your shoulders, dog, it's nothin' but time
And I never raise my voice, you a bum, why should I holler on you?
With a whisper I can drop a couple dollars on you
Sss, sss! Sick them rottweilers on you
Killers bustin out the windows of Impalas on you
A made man in the streets, I made grams
Wrote lyrics about my life, dropped an album, and made fans
Now I'm chillin' on the tour with the red-head wonder
Did 57 shows in a three month summer
Any deuce bitch ass nigga fuckin with Tech
Gonna be found in Swope Park with his nuts in his neck

Like you ain't know, we put it down like this
Snug Brim, Kansas City, Missouri, uzi, groupies, doobies, and fins
Suzy Qs ain't no excuse for the sin, so watch your tongue
If you woopin' we come to shootin' up at you and your bitch
You just assume you tried the shoes, they ain't fit
You never knew that I lose you off in the section with your dude in the ditch
Whether it's reppin dog, or movin' them bricks
I keep it gutta little homie, look my records, see I'm doin' it big
As you can tell I ain't no regular nigga I'm filled with star qualities
I hang out with bitches that's naked and watch the broad swallow me
It's always solo, you can't fake it.. so don't try ta follow me
You still can't get back up on your feet
You right back where you ought to be
I see you failin' 'cause Strange Music got it locked boy
Invest your stock boy, Kansas City hot boy
It's really fuck a hater, some some weed, get ya paper
You can see me now or later, motherfuckin' riot maker

'Cause I'm a riot maker! That's if you don't know
I'm a riot maker! They mosh at my shows
I'm a riot maker! And I come out bustin'
I'm a riot maker! Riot maker!
I don't give a damn about nothing!
Slide Freaker, I'm a skyscraper

We will, tear up your motherfuckin' town!

MMM (Michael Myers Mask),Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"(Enter the mind of Tech N9ne)
Laurie Strode
I got a gory soul
So the story goes
Should I never kill another one or get a bit of lovin' in me or reload?
Reload, everybody lookin' at me like a hero
When I kill a demon lesser than zero
See no evil within it
I'm a killer and I'm bigger than Deebo
He knows, we go begin it
Deep inside of me I'm dealin' with a trio
Leave hoes below, you finished
Abomination comin', I got that combination cracks
All that time you wastin' runnin' I got that bomb relation rap
Now they're tryin' to make it back
To Tech N9ne and shakin' wack
Now I'm dominatin', mom awakin' from a non forsaken nap
Hello mother, when you left I was no mellow brother
I put on my red, killed 'em all dead and I did it with my fellow thuggers
I tell no others, but I'm taking my hell so hovers
When I gotta murder everything dead - I smother
Like Othello's lover
You cannot tell me to stop it with doctor Loomis
Nothing would ever delay when I got your doom, it's
The Boogeyman I got to get your for real
And nobody is saving me, not with appeal
I'm a murderin' son of a bitch
And I'm ill with impeccable skill and a purpose to kill

My mental's made of Michael Myers' mask
You... lay lifeless, Lord don't like yo liars laugh
Who... wanna see this sinful psycho sire spaz?
Please don't light yo lighters last
'Cause this frightful fire's fast (uh-huh)
My mental's made of Michael Myers' mask
You... lay lifeless, Lord don't like yo liars laugh
Who... wanna see this sinful psycho sire spaz?
Please don't light yo lighters last
'Cause this frightful fire's fast (uh-huh)

Not too many motherfuckers out there I wish I hadn't killed
Draggin' lil' rappers up Debra's Hill like Jack and Jill
Slashin' 'til the back cracks attackin' with stabbin' steel
Havin' chills when it happens after stashin' 'em in Haddonfield
I got a demon in me, green with envy, seen the memory
How I get souls
Bring in Philly, things to get me
Never that is why I got up out of Smith's Grove
I'll eradicate a nigga with the feeling
That he better than a spitter with a bigger trigger
Step up and try to get at me and be disposed
I don't know why the great Malek Akkad not fuckin' with me
Wanted to use the theme for P.B. 3, they told me fuckin' fifty
Yeah it's worth it, yeah we got it
But not when Carpenter charged me five
For the first Psycho Bitch so I had to switch
When I wanted to just keep it alive!
Guess he didn't know I spill them bastards
Who say another killer's better, I kill them slashers
I peel them actors, I'm real grim faster
Original mask motherfucker William Shatner

My mental's made of Michael Myers' mask
You... lay lifeless, Lord don't like yo liars laugh
Who... wanna see this sinful psycho sire spaz?
Please don't light yo lighters last
'Cause this frightful fire's fast (uh-huh)
My mental's made of Michael Myers' mask
You... lay lifeless, Lord don't like yo liars laugh
Who... wanna see this sinful psycho sire spaz?
Please don't light yo lighters last
'Cause this frightful fire's fast (uh-huh)

This killer jam knocks
I'm here to kill everbody lyrically, specifically 'til her pants drop
I'm iller than Shaq, thriller fans watch me
Murder many men in Michael Myers mask not a Silver Shamrock
Celebrate Samhain all year round
Never let a fake man reign!
I'ma bake damn brains with a weird sound
Givin' hella aches and pain
Eminem is Jason, Krayzie Bone is leatherface and Bushwick Chuckie
But anything after double M were just replicas of me
Who got you? Niggas need a new doctor
Stop the bleeding, who shot ya?
It was really a true chopper
Mike is who offed ya
Mainly because you caca
Step and see who do block ya
Rest in peace to Moustapha

My mental's made of Michael Myers' mask
You... lay lifeless, Lord don't like yo liars laugh
Who... wanna see this sinful psycho sire spaz?
Please don't light yo lighters last
'Cause this frightful fire's fast (uh-huh)
My mental's made of Michael Myers' mask

Strangeulation II,Strangeulation,2014.0,"Deevil!
Prayin' at 12:12 for hell, felon to sell
And slept on a bed of nails, like nothing I've ever felt
Ghost in a shell was molded with other demons
As if I needed some help or a host to preserve the heathen
Got it, my brain is rotted, I swear to God that I'm not it
I'm set to go to the gallow as soon as the rope is knotted
I ain't highest of high then the hydra have used adrenaline
Came in the cypher clean, still smelling like putrid cinnamon
Then I'm in enemy of the state, I'm straight at an angle
Stop risking and quit your bitchin', it ain't like I'm raping a angel
Said I was magnifique, ya'll ain't fuckin' with it, capiche?
Not as safe as you would've thought with the devil under your feet
They throw a shot and then sit back and wait for some reaction
Ain't nothing to it but to do it, I'm a mummy rappin'
So get to clappin' or dissin' the clan you hatin'
Listen, the man is Jason and this is the Strangeulation

Stevie Stone, I'm on it, I'm so clever
Nobody comparing, I'm better, I put shit together
America's most elaborate rap, pick ya head up, huh
Small talkin'll get you wet up, huh, yeah
I'm ready to kill all you niggas
The feelin', adrenaline that'll spillin' a mill
And yeah, I mill' all you niggas
Ain't even reach out they climax, rather my celing on niggas
And backin' a back, I'll backhand Billy you niggas
Get busy on niggas, this ain't no random some leakage
Stonie in the building, the bitches pull out their cleavage
The snake and the bat, you see them prominent features
The species, Strangeland, we rain on your region, huh
Meat wagon, I come, I be taggin' 'em
Baggin' 'em, bring 'em clusters of three, got three magnums
Gaggin' em out, you pussies is still talkin'
I'm draggin' 'em out, I'm tappin' 'em out

Aww shit, they fucked around and signed a backpacker
Smart, rich, handsome, plus he's not a bad rapper
I'm just a little local talent that fucked around and made it big
Underground bully, pickin' on all these famous kids
And the danger is, now I'm doin' stranger biz
About to make the world forget about what a major is
Independent Powerhouse, running all these cowards out
My enemies are all forgotten, wishin' I would shout 'em out
And I don't want to hear a rapper harmonize unless
He thuggish, ruggish, Lazy, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish or Flesh
But maybe I'm just hatin' 'cause my black ass could never sing
And fuck that autotune I hope the Futures filled with better things
And you a fucking liar if you say you found a better team
Impossible! Like trying to fit my dick inside my wedding ring
And all the bread it brings will be distributed and properly
I represent for hip hop not some fucking aristocracy

I'm the Martin Scorsese of rap, rap predator
Better than severin' the reverend with a jackknife
Kevin and eleven of 'em, revvin' up the engines
We bubblin' up like 7-Up, then when
We shoot that shit, we eat that shit for din-din, grrr
I don't need ya fuckin' okay, ah, are you serious? I'm okay
I'mma make you bleed like it's your period, period
I eat period pussy so eating you ain't serious
What, you need for me to flip that shit and rip that shit
Like a skitzo, stick that shit, that shit, like a automatic pistol grip?
No! I created this fast rap, I'm past that
I put a gat in that ass crack and blast that
I'm light years ahead of 'em, might use the head of 'em
I lose, then you can keep the breadcrumbs

Technicians,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"EST is 1985
 in KC on a bus ride 
from the 56th side
Not too many knew that it was alive
But they spread it so now they tied to Technicians worldwide

Listen!
Trying to recruit is the mission, we offer you a position
Where Tech'll rule and condition your brain
To know actin' a fool is the vision, Caribou Lou is tradition
And the way to be true to your living is strange
We come in peace, but if you wanna be dumb and beef
A gun'll summon heat, wanna be young and speak, I'ma numb his beak
He's a woman, he the one and, he brung in meat for the cunning beast
Hit a lung and seep dung and sleep long, in deep tongue full of gum and teeth
It's when a Tecca-nician do the sets who diss the crew
The best thing is for you to let the clique see who the vet is amidst the new seekers
Wonderin' who the fuck is coming through these speakers
Never forget it the medic for you tweakers
Ahead of the medicine developed to soothe creatures
You're pathetic if you're no believer, 'cause we all are energetic and eager
Come alive when you walking side by side with me
Fly the skies and get high with me
On this ride you won't collide,
 just confide in me
Try denying me, ye dying violently
That's the way, you fakers got to pay
My people quick to spray, and buck a demon 'til they lay
But if he breathing it must've been an angel by his side like Sade
Never would've been the case, because my clique ready to ride when I say:

Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue, they coming through suspicious
We do the shit we do
'Cause if you not with the crew converting you is our mission
If you're a born Technician
Put your ammunition and your hands up in the sky
This is a strong addiction
Live to this if ya Technician 'til ya die

My people all know what a Bianca is
Most of 'em want to diss
Don't come unless you don't want the biz
It ain't nothin' but real women in my circle, not them phony chicks
That don't know what I mean when I say elbow macaroni bitch
They know what I'm drinking
, the ladies looking right, they know what I'm thinking
The babies even hype, the oldies be geekin'
The red, the black, and white,
 the soldiers beef seekin'
All of my people's here, Tech and the bidness are gonna equal fear
'Cause I'm 'bout to bubble
 and get the evil peers
Out of my life I never wanna see you here (Yeah!)
Bitch! You ain't a Technician
You don't know the pledge,
 
but you said that you listen
Guess you misunderstood the shit, huh?
Disrespect that Tech trick get done
The moral of the story is we warriors
Notorious for the hordes of core, ready to roar he is glorious
Technician number one
The mission leave 'em sprung with the tongue
And if you listen it's a gun

Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue, they coming through suspicious
We do the shit we do
'Cause if you not with the crew converting you is our mission
If you're a born Technician

We are family, that Tech shit we on it
We could be damaging to all you punks that want it
We bring calamity, that snake and bat we flaunt it
Unforgettable, Tech's formidable, reppin' the mid, the MO
Bitch we run it
You don't gotta know that I really meant it when I said that I was gonna make the mainstream go me
Still rapping like I'm popping a pillow off of the killer 
more like I was taking Molly in '03
We can take anybody, we so deep, I bet that you got us on yo' street
I'm tryna find a spot that's big enough, so that all of my people can meet!

Whenever problems show up
Man I really wanna pou up, drinkin' 'til I throw up
And tonight I'm havin mo' luck
Couple bad bitches rolled up, to puff a little dough up
And they givin' us the dame thang
Puffin', drinkin', than we bang-bang
Knock it out the frame, mane
Called a couple mo' dame-dames
Then my homies with the cane came
Now we got a Strange thang
Yeah... y'all do, I don't (what's that, Tech?)
Turn down something I won't
I'm a... grinch when I'm yearning it
Get so hot up in the spot, I think I'm partying at Burning Man
I deal with the real, when I feel
But tonight I'm takin Bou Lou to the grill
I'll be damned, if it ain't a day, I kick it and can't obey
When life gets heavy we uh... party the pain away

Where the ladies really didgeridoo it if they smell ya

I be feelin' like a donor
Not blood, but the other stuff
Cause the women bone ya
When the real life's on my case
A woman waits, to sit on my face
In Missouri, it's all on my state
When I'm home, yes I keep a heapin' on my plate
I'm in a dark party, with a red light
'Bout to be another ""take it to the head"" night

20 shots of tequila
Yes I make a little money so I'm gonna pay the billa
If she lookin' don't be jello
Get your woman, take her picture with me cause I'm hella mello
If you're tough and wanna yell though
She'll be leavin' with the crew
And I'ma stick her like some velcro

Party persona, fuck the pain and come and kick it
Are you smellin my aroma?
When things get bad, get trashed
That's my advice on yo bitch ass
Faded like you think I am
On the brink, of a drink, and the drink I slam

My Haiku - Burn the World,Something Else,2013.0,"This is my haiku

The sick pedophile
Touching beautiful kiddies
Really gonna die

I think the world needs more light
Cause what they do in the dark too heinous for your sight
And mine is dark all the time
A sign to design true crime
But I'm blessed to have the platform for this rhyme

Damn, why wasn't the light on baby girl
Grown men touch her, she four, livin' in this crazy world
That's gonna affect her way longer than the lightest life span
If I was there, I'd be sparking way more than a light, man
But if we shine em' all, together we can run them off
Gonna hard-slide on everyone he come across
Molotov's go to slavery in the Holocaust
Lotta chalk, you ain't lit up, then you not a boss
Light the darker alleys, it might just spark a rally
For right these hearts are rowdy, tonight we spark the valleys
In flatland's stoppin' the bad man, with grab hands
Girl he groping, go in the trash can
Nowhere to hide I must say places ain't light enough
You try to cut the bright of us an idol just might erupt
The fine of dusk would light as the night adjust
If you got em' then light them up

If there was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world

Hey
Why did Adam shoot the school up?
Maybe cause the way he grew up
Maybe cause of loose screws
Scratch all that, cause mama loved to pick the tool up
Now the marathon blew up
And it's by the hands of two nuts
When Castro took the kids for about ten years and what he done, I almost threw up

If them was my youngin's I'd try to bring the sun in
Closer to 'em, turn it up a hundred and hold it to 'em
Take a bite and chew 'em
Some of they baby life they ruined
I'd be going crazy on the daily
Daily I'd pursue them
Don't need more reasons to turn this to a fire pit
Barbecue, I would do, right find without all of it
It's awful and off to no resolving it
Molotov's make the night brighter

If there was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world

Yeah
Depressing is seeing men lost heaven cuz we had sinned
The reverend is begging brethren to be sevens and being friends
Tecca don't wanna see kiddies die
Minors on the stretcher, so what you gonna do with them 25 lighters on your dresser
Yes sir, shine them bright so they see us off in Mecca
Lessen the threats of M-F-Er's steppin' with death, impress us
To mess a good will, divide up a fight
Being right and polite, come and help me light up the night
Shine your light bright, pedophile he can't rape her
People stand together, make the place safer
No time to play when I weigh the straight haters
Cause they fakers and doing evil is they nature
This is for  that once and often go through my head, then I wanna run then off them
I don't want no second opinion's, so I'm asking her friend
""Just keep it lit so this don't happen again.""

If there was a lighter
The world would seem brighter (brighter)
Fire (fire)
Burn the world
Burn the world

A wonderful musician once said:
""If the people who are trying to destroy this world aren't taking a day off, then why should I?""
I feel that
So how do I light up the darkness, Mr. Bob Marley?

I'm trying...",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-my-haiku-burn-the-world-lyrics

They ain't never put it out so I'ma give it to you right now, check it out

I be comin' like an autobahn, I'm murderin' everything

A whiff of the wicked I stick it with the crick and they're diggin' it

Because I'm Mr. Malignant, keepin' you riveted
Livin' it polygamist sin a bit
Any chick in a minute Tecca N9na be kickin' it
I flow for the Middle West, go for your little neck
Don't let me get it but yo' ho - I'ma get her wet
Stop and drop on top a twat in your kitchen
Not the guap I pop without an admission
Hailing from Missouri, you can smell out the hell in the thizzery
Just remember me, bustin' deliveries and I'm makin' 'em shivery
I'm takin' my little city to lyrical liberty

I go for the gusto don't leave the ground, no bush to beat around
All the Midwest Choppers on this track and ""Yes sir, we are down""
Tecca N9na with Bone everybody gets on other MC's we are clown
And we do it like a bullet from a gun or better yet the speed of sound!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-speed-of-sound-acapella-lyrics

The Noose,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"I've tried writing this letter now several times before
When the party is over and the liquor is no more
I'll tell you now that living has become somewhat a chore
And following their rules is such a god forsaken bore
Now I say ""God"" because I'm programmed,
 
but I believe in none
I see no interventions, and I see no holy sons
And if I'm wrong, then strike me down and break these breathing lungs
Just take the words, reverse 'em back upon my evil tongue
I've seen children harm each other like it's second nature, some
Just want to watch the world burn and bang upon the drums
And that is why the music and the rhythm will live on
'Cause chaos has a melody and death is like a song

I sing, sing out to the rafters, I sing
Close this little chapter and I think
This life is a disaster and it stings
I'm trying to find a way to just sing
Sing out to the rafters, I sing
Close this little chapter and I think
This life is a disaster and it stings
You see I'm trying to find a way out

What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end

I went to visit wounded soldiers out on Camp Pendleton
And the cause of the missing limbs it mean that it's no love like Wimbledon
When they sat before me young as hell and gave me accolades like gentlemen
I'm thinking that the enemy took away their ability to walk and to touch
No way of rekindling
What it's now gone, unless they got money like Forrest and Lt. Dan
The war, if you in it, damn, they have no remorse at any minute, Bam!
That's fucked off, while we chillin' on tour on the bus getting sucked off
Know our families grieving 'cause war is receding
Their peeps have been crying their butts off
That's why I give so much when I flow bust, why we got it so good?
Cause it's so rough, for the young soldiers who
Do exactly what they're told to do... damn
Through exactly what they told to do
Defend the country and uphold the crew
But give my one and only soul for U (S.A.)?
That's a hell of a job description, I don't know if my God's with this one
But I guess it's the laws of sick men
Send out young'ns and they fall the victim
Of an evil clan's plan, that's why I be saying ""Dwamn""
Cause on 9/11 I realized our fate is in another man's hands

What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end

When I see how my loved ones have left
I wonder how long I would fight
I wonder if I would give in or let the reaper lead me into night?
See I got too much pride left, like my grandmother died too earlier
Reaching for moments more but instead the cancer in her lungs took her from me
We drift, naturally, like two ships in the roughest of seas
That's why this moment is precious, yet I'm too distant to feel it complete
See these days I feel so disconnected, it gets harder to drop to my knees
I guess that's a side-effect of living in Generation X-Y-Z
Obsessed with pain and greed, man I wish we were kids again
Things were simple then
90's incidents got me losing friends to the hands of violent men
Fast, faster than speeding bullets whizzing down alleyways
Abruptly I'm waking up from this haze
But only to realize the world hasn't changed
Some of y'all not even fazed, y'all think it's the way we've been raised?
Fuck it, I'll stick him right back in his haze
Cause these could turn out to be my last today's
With a hope and a prayer put a rope in the air, but I'm just too scared
Choking from the pressure 
when I rock this chair
Swing back and forth and tempt Death with a blank stare

What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-the-noose-lyrics

Lemme laugh at 'em again
'Cause they know I write the back out of a pen
Holy moly get going nobody hold 'em is what they told 'em
And poda-be motor yodeling sick and ain't gettin over it
Sick at the lip and watch 'em clown, watch 'em clown, clown
Loving to tickle 'em I be licking 'em down, give 'em the crown
Look at the ground when you approaching the regal Beagle
And people don't be equal and what they saying is fecal
Betta give it up, put 'em in the blender
Surrender it like you had enough
Never no-contender pretending like you ready-to-buck
Ninja turtle talkin' to a splinter, I don't give a fuck

Killin niggas like they coppers
And rappers on my thing-a-ma-bobber
Come to chopping I'm the home of the whopper
Your girly bopping I don't think I can stop her
So dope that it made her wanna gimme a slobber
They remember you when you stop and you pop
Every syllable, bow down to a nigga that's bigger than you
And he thinking he can come and speak at him really rude
Ah-ha, eat the nigga food
I'll knock the stuffing out ya muffin, fucking knucklehead
Never did it wrong 'cause you singing the song all in your head
Lead off, I beat the beat up and go
Run a nigga feet off and chew him like a piece of pilaf
Shitting on niggas an leave the seat off, then re-tweet off
Social media this to beat off to
Damn, they think that we lost 'cause when we get off a look at themselves saying we awful
'Cause it's more than bread that we wanting
Me and Nina keeping 'em jumping
And we won't stop 'till we get to the top
You in the way then we Midwest chop ya!

Shit, never could do right in school, I just choose to cruise by
The principal told me I'm a loser, the dude’s right
All I did as a kid was shoot dice and toot white
Causing disputes, my future was never too bright
But who would’ve knew I’d be lucky enough to get a record deal
And pursue my music? I’m too psyched, not once, but two times
I murder shit, a repeat offender with the biggest independent, salute N9ne
If they bussin' I'mma take this rappin' shit to a new height
Too tight like Drake's bike jacket, my crew like
A pack of wild wolves, 'bout to howl at the moonlight
You wanna come at us? God bless, Gesundheit
You a pussy, you might lose a fight with a bull dyke
And I already give you a fuse strike, a few of mine
Kinda swole with this now your face is basically a bullseye
And you like ooh-ah!
And I ain't quitting 'til I got a crib in Malibu, sitting poolside
I'm chilling, sipping Crown a coke bag
I say what I'm thinking, never been known to hold back
I'm pimpin' 'em steadily, putting hoes on Prozac
Blow got me looking like my nose is snow-capped
Under the scopes, steady getting groped and poked at
Then those that oppose that wanna do-si-do
Per rope-a-dope will get you K.O.'d or toe tagged
At 5'10"" you can see my 'fro from rows back
Fake friends hanging on my coast below Tech
Hate the term 'no homo' but I'm sick
Of bending over, getting fucked for the dough I don't have
Oh snap, forgot it was a chopper song
This is what you want to hear, I guess I better do a study how I execute it, therapeautic
Don't compare me, some of these rappers got a bigger pussy than the Octomom
And yo, ya-uh-yeah!

Thinkin' about takin' it to another level
I'm from another realm like an angel falling from heaven
I fell to the Earth, the purpose of resurrection
I'm coming through your speakers like demonic possession
And hell's bells, don't be afraid of mythology
Deep inside my brain is a wicked psychology
Ancient revelation intertwined with technology
Alien biology, you know that I gotta be Strange!
Damn right, and I'm proud to be
Biggest independent label, check the biography
We taking over the industry without an apology
Burning all the bridges, tell me who wanna follow me
I'm sick with the sickness and spit with the quickness, so vicious with every bar (bar)
So best to be leaving me lonely, psychotic and mentally scarred (scarred)
And I don't really wanna be the one to tell you but I will if you don't get it by now
Our strangers are angels, and able to seal the game, you lames better bow down (bow down)
You need to recognize a miracle inside the lyrical, we're killing all these shows now
It started from the bottom, now we got the people showing up and lining up in every town
Takin' it to another planet and stratosphere
Circle like a satellite on top of this atmosphere
Snake and bat the symbol of the future, don't interfere
You don't really wanna be the one we make disappear
And this flow is hypnotic, it's class A narcotics, you pop out the bottle
Prescribed by psychologists, go for psychotic shit
Prozak and Kaliko, Rittz, Midwest Chopper shit

I Love Music,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"The- the- the reason that I'm breathin'
Seeping heat, it gets me cheese, why I'm eaten in Bad Season
Was deep in beef and was needing some beats to release in evenings
Instead of me being up and bleeding with thieves and heathens with keys and obstacles
Made it possible for the flow go to be profitable
Yo Tech's audible, his inaugural prada popped and was plausible
God is so good for giving me music!
Liftin', gettin' me through when I was fixing to lose it
Dudes hit Big Scoob's shit and reppin' the blue tip
Fool's skipped when Scoob scritch, we jumped in the 2 whip
Full clips for who stick the homie for true grit
My crew, thanks to music, we all living through it
Got me out of the ghetto, got me mucho dinero
In Cozumel, Mexico shorts and Jordans and a sombrero
This gift ain't given from a devil,
 so settle
Come and get this rebel music that's hot as a kettle, pendejo
Saved my life, paid my lights, made my wife, say ""Bye Bye""
Gave my night babes, I like preyed my mic
Would never fade, forever slayed, days I write
My cheddar raised up better, faze way high hyped
My music's one reason I always get to lay my pipe
The reason Tech N9na can comfortably say ""Night, night""
Blessed me with original flow, so hey! Why bite?
I hear, I feel, I live, listen and learn
I like...

(I love music)
Yeah, I love (I love music)
For real (I love music)
And I need (I love music)
To feel (I love music)
Go and play it (I love music)
Yeah, know what I'm saying? (I love music)
My love (I love music)
Know what I'm saying?

Automatic when I do this manually
Daily, monthly, annually
I get a step closer to being the coolest
Acoustic got me foolin' and about to lose it, ooh, sh-
Jump in the grind, and my hom' Mean Mike produced it
That's music pahtna
I'm just a poet with incredible rhythm
Words arranged will let you know he has incredible in him
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but toot toot, ha ha
I laugh because it's easier than do ray mi fa sol la
Ti do, we know he go say what on that C Note
And he can pay a C Note with that B Note
I'm talkin' truth
And I got stories that I show you that it's walkin proof
A thousand miles of it and I can show you what I'm walkin' through
Music ain't a hobby, it's an organ of my body that the creator provided back in January of '92
So don't you dare say good music skipped my generation
Your hatin' ain't nothin' but motivation for these compilations
Oob!

(I love music)
Yeah, it feeds me (I love music)
I need (I love music)
To feel (I love music)
You know what I'm sayin' (I love music)
It's my thing (I love music)
Go and sing (I love music)
And I love (I love music)
Yeah, go ahead

Music is my life
The reason why I write
Like Edgar Allan Poe on the beat, like a parasite
You thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
Then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
Nobody tried my limits 'cause they're afraid of heights
The ambition, weak or gravity, let 'em die
I let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
Then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
Time and time again 
I treat my pen like The Pen
Bars harder than Pelican Bay and I been
Servin' a life sentence since the day I was ten
Nine times outta ten you only ten songs deep before you leap
Into a pool of sharks then swim
That's an analogy on the way I do casualties
And I do this shit casually, before the verse end
I'll be in the Hall of Fame with my picture framed, friend

And if it wasn't for my music I wouldn't be standing here!
If it wasn't for my music you wouldn't have nothing to hear, yeah
And I love...

(I love music)
I need it to live (I love music)
 (I love music)
Yeah, and I love it (I love music)
I'mma be quiet (I love music)

And I love it (I love music)
Show enough love (I love music)

Low,K.O.D.,2009.0,"Denver, Colorado
Please welcome for the last time of the strictly Strange tour 2008
The number one independent rapper in the world
TECH N9NE!

How could I be so down at a time like this, when I'm high like this?
On the billboard charts, many major tours overseas, when I fly like this?
I've been thinkin' about the people that need me
They needy in all of the pain that I might miss
Sooner or later it seeks me, reach me
Then bleed me deep in the rain inside my pit
I'm goin' down now, because my mom frowns
In a research psychiatric center without her son around
And I'm deep off in this hole, when I'm out here rockin' shows (They say)
I should be hyped 'cause my life is so rock 'n roll!
But I feel like The Grinch mixed with Ebenezer Scrooge
Let the fever ooze, up out of me, clouded me, never eager to
Let up when I'm in an interview, they prolly be thinkin' they gonna hinder dude
'Cause he be lookin' like he might offend the rule
Never intricate to remember blues
Because is always right here, with the Hennessy and light beer
Let it enter me and fight fear, yeah
I know I quit, but I started back, 
the homie caught a gat
And my bodyguard Nicholas just had a heart attack

I'm sinkin' again, I'm drinkin' again
Drownin' in water, you're breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you're bleedin' within
Needing to grin, cheese and recede in the spend
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I feel in the morning
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I sound when you're callin'
(Lower than low, lower than low)
I'm high, but feel like I'm fallin'
I'm sorry, but I'm feelin' lower than low!

My smile is forced, my style is warped
Morale is corpse,
 
now that my really good pal is torched
I'm just gone with the wind, I'm home with the gin, to the dome when I spin
I'ma zone 'cause the phone must be roamin’ again
Another tone, I'm alone now I don't want me to spend time with
I’m just mind this, might find Miss N9ne missed
I find my mind in this lime ditch, dine quick, not even a second for mindless
In the middle of a time when the music's flyin' I've depleted my kindness!
Low like the grasses, low like poor folks on Gratiot
I'm so below the casket, ragged pulse of the maggots
Why do I feel this illness?
I'm lookin' for somethin' to come and kill this a little bit
I got my head in the hills 'cause the real shit is momma is sufferin', takin' pills with the stillness
And I feel it, I can't shake it, in any case my space is the basement
I can't erase my abrasive encasement
I'm chasin' hatred, my taste not complacent
So as I go to the flo', the industry finally opened the do'
But now I'm in the motherfucker, all I feel is.. low

I'm sinkin' again, I'm drinkin' again
Drownin' in water, you're breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you're bleedin' within
Needing to grin, cheese and recede in the spend
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I feel in the morning
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I sound when you're callin'
(Lower than low, lower than low)
I'm high, but feel like I'm fallin'
I'm sorry, but I'm feelin' lower than low!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-low-lyrics
Breathe,Anghellic: Reparation,2003.0,"You know what I mean?
Shit, let the motherfucker bleed the same blood I bleed
This fuckin' hurt a little kid
Niggas know what the vibe? Forever breathe

Never duck another motherfucker, repeat it
Never duck another motherfucker, nigga better delete it
Put the cerebellum in killer mode, for real a foe
Can never get with what a gorilla know
Killin' syllable, feelin' ya biblical ritual
This shit'll get rid of ya pain, here in your pitiful game
This is political pain, deep in the pit of your brain
Let it rain with the unforgettable aim *gunshot*
Nigga lookin' for a spot to bust
'Cause the homie that you killed meant a lot to us
But instead of lookin' for a cock to fuck
Kill a nigga like he was rockin' the swastika
You can do it, but you blew it, 'cause you're mockin' up
Get your ride on, nigga is you rock or what?
Lots of luck, you really gonna need it, hella heated
Motherfucker let the Glock erupt, box him up

I don't wanna be the one to get a millimeter in the gut
I wanna be the one to hit 'em with another milla
Caught up in the middle, I'm a little sick and different
I mean it when I said it, you remember that?

Breathe! Sprayin' guns might result in you bustin' some
Breathe!

Never let a hatin' motherfucker see you sweat
Bleed the chest, no need regret
I fun day caper, a Sunday paper, so I can read the rest
I can dig it, you can dig it, put a nigga in the grave
If you hate or penetrate a loop of love a nigga made
If you step up to me you will never benefit
Nigga if I start it, I'ma finish it
Run up on a motherfucker while he fuckin' a chick
Put a bullet in her head while she's suckin' a dick
Wasn't a bit of evidence, baby it's irrelevant
You got it with your nigga, that's the luck of the grit
Bring pain to everyone
In your face with the bane, you very some
It's a motherfuckin' shame we carry guns
If you don't, you're insane or very dumb
Tecca N9na's too rough (Too rough) Too hard (Too hard)
Too tough (Too tough) 
You scarred (You scarred)
'Cause a nigga know a motherfuckin' round will spit
Fuckin' around with a killer clown and shit

If you really wanna do it, nigga, we can step into it
Put us up against some motherfuckers and we runnin' through it
Fuck a nigga, buck a nigga if he think he's a guerrilla
Meant it when I said it, you remember that?

Get sprayed by the TEC-9 hand gun, now I'm on the outrun
Flowin' up again and hot, cooked, well done
Fuckin' with a crazy insane warlord
Punks wanna trip, but they know I'm too motherfuckin' hard
Deadly, tickin' like a time bomb
Fuckin' with me you would think you were in Vietnam
When I explode ain't nothin' left but remains
But those who were froze fuckin' with a nigga insane
Mentally minded mad, motherfuckin' madman
Out to attack, sinkin' punks like quicksand
Droppin' and poppin' any punk that buck so
Bring a body bag if you wanna get fucked up
There it is you little bitch made nigga
Start runnin' when I'm playin' with the trigger
An Uzi, a 12-gauge, it really don't matter
Many suckers die when the shotgun scatter
From block to block, hood to hood, street to street
Boy you can't fuck with me
So for those who told you to jump up and talk shit
Admit you bitch, your little ass got lit

I don't wanna be the one to get a millimeter in the gut
I wanna be the one to hit 'em with another milla
Caught up in the middle, I'm a little sick and different

We crash into you (crash into you)
Your end is coming soon (coming soon!)

Yeah, ain't nobody ever seen a beast
I'm a catch a career but it's been the least
Follow was a very little, I mean petite
I'ma pull the carpet from under you
How it even started ya wonder who
I'ma show ya what rain and thunder do
Hope ya really ready when they come for you
Not a human or alien on the planet that can do it like I do it
You put a mountain in front of me I go through it
I pursue it, danger
Never stoppin' the mangler
N9na tough with them wranglers
Give me lip I'ma bang ya
Never benevolent, you wasn't ever the relevant
You thinkin' you 'bout to be but you are outta ya element
Bringin' the hella win then came back in hella mint
Condition, noticing my new wicked development
Never let up, ya never get up
It'll never be another competitor better than us
I been on it, ya runnin' late the way Letterman does
You thinkin' you reaching' a level that's clever than what?
I'ma gain it, you don't get the picture then I'ma paint it
With pain I came insane, the N9na language
Thinkin' you gonna be up when I have to bring this anguish
Ain't no question - I am truly the strangest!
I gotta shake it up for a minute
Tecca N9na get the greater percentage
And when I enter whatever I gotta win it
Try to get me in the corner - ya finished
A lotta people defeated when I diminish
When I hit you'll need a hell of a dentist
I got the punch and the power that's intricate
Got you thinkin' ""How did you get off into this?""

Make way
I'm coming through you (I'm coming through you)
There's nothing you can do (you can do!)
It's my day, make waves
We crash into you (crash into you)
Your end is coming soon (coming soon!)
I'm in your veins, so make waves

If life's a beach can we go surfing?
It never been easy for me besides the birthing
And people they eat, the words I'm serving
Then we can all feast, on what we think is deserving
I'm a heart-breaker, wave-maker
And I'ma take a leap nothin' round the Kali baby
Been a ball-breaker, gate-maker
And I can stop and out ya mouth if ya gettin' lazy
I'm a typhoon tsunami, any whatever what just to get the salami
Try to be quick or we're quick to get ya behind me
I could belligerent nuttin', nothin' could calm me
I'ma take the wheel, bust ya grill
If it's an emergency bust a seal
You can see me make the mill, yes I will
'Cause I got the skill to kill plus the will
Put ya lights out, the fight's out
The mic is my knife and device and ya iced out
Pull my windpipe out, that or the thing of a singer
I'ma rip it though they might shout
'Cause I'm a sore loser
If I'm defeated and heated, better be headed right for the door
And I'm a born bruiser
When ya get beated and seated, then I'll be ready to give you more
I can keep goin' and never stop
Easy as breathin' to me and if you don't believe me
Pay me attention until I pop
Eager to eat 'em and never need a reason whether
You better pick em up when they drop
Singin' I'm leavin' the speed is unbelievable
That you better never give them a shot
I don't know how to behave, just know how to (make waves)

Make way
I'm coming through you (I'm coming through you)
There's nothing you can do (you can do!)
It's my day, make waves
We crash into you (crash into you)
Your end is coming soon (coming soon!)
I'm in your veins, so make waves

Yeah, you seen me make waves when I became Strange
And dominated but you ain't never gave praise
You be talkin' shit on Instagram inside a safe place
When I see you and confront you then you try to save face
And vacate, okay kid, I'm about to go grade A
There's no name sake but won't gain fans
They got my name and nuts hangin' so low they scrape
I'm still hungry, it's like I'm stuck in the '08 state of mind
My mind is so space aged, and don’t get it
Told critics, go stick it, don’t get yo dome split
Yo whole shit’ll look like Riddick Bowe hit it
Oh shit his bone's stickin' out, I think it's broken
Now go freakin' dial 911, homie I run run
My city we don't play that kiddie shit where I come from
You high dum dum? You really think you fight on one?
You wanna take my Strange chain and my nine gun drum?
A future icon son, you just a ho ass bitch
You go ass kiss anybody to blow as if
You try to be somethin' you're not my shit is dope as is
You got some dope ad-libs and that's it
Your shit is so average, we ain't similar, homie check ya temperature
You fuck with me and you will need a medical examiner
Put hands on rappers ramblin', put handles on ya manager
They said I'm from Atlanta, damn it I am not from Canada
I came in the game and I represented
Jonny Valiant in this bitch, there's no mystery
They'll be killin' it, keepin' it independent
Tecca N9na is the leader
You need me to jack a hater then say no more, I'ma get 'em (bitch)
With Kali Baby they be crazy
To try me, they just admire the style that I invented
My sophomore album 'bout to come out any minute
I'm about to make waves

But Together

Welcome to planet Earth
Where people are divided
Some who try to fight it got violence and it hurts
Damaged turf, put men at work so people could manage personal demons and them it's worth
'Cause they give roadblocks and you're told not to show at the vote box and go for the broslops
Which in shows get the folks hot, what do you suppose locked the shows rock is gotta be their old and cold pops
Racism is passed down and gay gives them mad frowns
But how they live and laugh now should be they bis and last sound from class clowns
People should be free to be together
Should be free to be whatever you can see that we get better
When we give respect is good in any language
People are the strangers, but we don't wanna see any anguish
When I see we free to be something, anything we see

And hurt each other using color as the scapegoat

Different people together like in a shuttle bus
Trouble is double, dealt with muddle, just puddle tough
Cause we ruddle bust rubble up and shuttle befuddle us

Wednesday Thursday Friday, through the weekend

Saturday to Sunday she be calling in on Monday
I live in the Boonies, 
if your ride is outie, then it's like you're traveling with a one way

We wanna put D on her
We gone, we zoned, in a weed coma
She don't belong if her squeeze phone her
And he want leads on where the G's home was
Ease on, she won't get to breathe on us
Tea's gone, we bone bitches elong' us
See schlong, she moan when I deep dong her
When he's grown, he is known to s-neeze on ya
Beez Holmes, we Jones'd, for the V on her
She's long, these songs get ya free dome
For the weed blown with the tone like I'm Steve Stone brotha
Keep on, be strong, never no leash on us, we beast on ya Biancas

My crew's all tripped out, off that real good green
The liquor's taking over, and we just wan- (hold up)

Party animal, looking hammered, couple of handles of
Crown, we pound the shot cause it ain't shit for me to handle my
Liquor buzz, and bitch I wanna get to bust it open for the gram of Molly
Got her pupils huge, her hands are clammin' up
Took advantage of the situation now she dancing to
My music when I turn around she taking her bra and panties off
Tan lines looking like she just got back from Panama
See these sparks flying like I lit a Roman candle up
Damn I just, can't think of your name, what is it, Angela?
Amber, Tammy, Pamela? I blame it on my Xani buzz
But blondie all my homies wanna hit it, so I hand her off
Pimping since an infant, I can't help that I'm the center of
Attention, 
trying to get paid, like Travis O'Guin,
 
you see the symbol of
Snake and Bat,
 
The Famous Stars and Straps,
 the Gucci signature
The ring that's on my pinky, you should throw the deuces, beam me up
Go stupid in the booth, 
I'm flexing like I'm Lou Ferrigno
, ya-uh-yeah!

Need Jesus,The Storm,2016.0,"Let ye cast no judgement upon thy neighbor
Before the beam of thy own eyes have been cleansed
In the wicked ways of the world
God gives the remission of all of our sins

When I was a young one the preacher put oil on my sixth chakra
He knew when I was older I'd wanna follow 2Pac and Big Poppa
They thought I was so devilish in the dark I would listen to sick opera
But this choppa will be reppin' the city where RDV's Young Rich and Slick's got ya
Well in peace
I don't know why they wanna call me up every Easter Sunday to the altar
Maybe the music I am doin' is never gospel, sinner is what they call ya
I know we look a little strange
 and we the gang, my lane is what I offer
Three dimensional 
altar
 with an ego on top of the rock of Gibraltar

I see-e, it's not the way the bible people want me to be-e
Flippin' the fire for the family focused and free-e
Listen to me-e doing it for T.V-e
With the rebel yell, came out of my shell
Preacher said tell your people let go of your coat-tail
With a tremendous fail he never to say my living'll sell
But even worse said I lead my people to Hell's Bells
Lookin' at me just like my mother and father would breed creatures
Not an evil bone in my body and never known to be naughty in my seeds either
Simple and plain like a cheese pizza
I don't know, prayin' on my knees, keep us from heat seekers
Lovin' the bleed feature while the people tell me that I need Jesus!

Talk about me, judge me
Speakin' I'm evil to people, I'm leadin' 'em underway
How you read me and see me, easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
You seem to tell me I need Jesus! (oh, Jesus! Jesus!)
Every day they wanna condemn me
None of 'em even know me
Anyone live without sin cast that stone at the Stone
Let's talk about it

I'm askin'
What's happening?
Boy, 'cause they bashing me
Bangin' the bible, butcher boy, don't bother with blasphemy
Call 'em a crazy critic comin' causin' catastrophes
Aimin' at Aaron a lot of ammo and an angel actually
Oh mane, Amen
You people let the steeples speak in evil and the neezle playing God hymn
My mother was a Christian but I used to go with the Wiccan for the stickin', what’s the problem?
Questioning the K.O.D.'s grim, anybody talkin' hella crazy I'm 'bout to jaw them
You'll be up on a cross whenever you step to me so take precaution
Y'all false actors, callin' me a demon when I talk backwards 
tihs pot
Tecca Nina gon' be sought after, this drop by the people that go toss rappers hip hop
So you thinking you religious?
When you condemn another man, you never lead us
Telling me what's under me is gonna heat us
Never believe ya 'cause really you need Jesus
Leave us

Talk about me, judge me
Speakin' I'm evil to people, I'm leadin' 'em underway
How you read me and see me, easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
Let's talk about it

Mama never really talked about God
All that I was ever taught was I'm odd
Heard he knew 'bout every thought that I had
Dirty mind I'd see a cross and I'd hide
Lost without dad, salty 'bout that
But I was captivated by the bosses outside
I plotted every way to get in drawers with my squad (church)
Ask round why every man goes
Bad habits to pass down like second hand clothes, mad
Salvage a blouse, gown, and manicured toes
Had half of us ground bound for hell
 and lord knows
Need a savior they say slayed for your behavior
Raised in three days, grace be what he gave ya
The Son of the maker, one to gravitate to
Pay ten percent 'cause sins ya didn’t pay for
Bow to a name insane fast, he told the
Vows to a dame, the tame Casanova
Wow did it change and came crashing, poser
Doused in the flames and bang chapter closure
Spiritually drained, crass and vulgar
Needed somewhere to go until rain passes over
Seeking a miracle from a stained-glass Jehovah
But I don't know if the ordained pastor sober
Dang in disdain prayed in vain
Care slain yo, explain do anything
Lay hands, but role playing, you entertain
Doubt, pain, processin' grow in the brain
It's confusing, now my fangs out protruding
Rebuking from mouths full of communion
Scorn by lukewarm kind, it's time you've been warned
The Storm formed, 
now find refuge in...",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-need-jesus-lyrics

""Can I take yo blunt right to my lips?"" No K
Broke ass always begging me that's No K
You don't understand then bitch, no way
See you ballin', gotta tell 'em, ""No K""
Lookin' like a money bag, smellin' Dolce
Hungry lookin' at you like their feelin' Chipotle
All you gotta tell 'em, ""Run to hell and go play""
We flyin', you tryin', to get a check, sit next to who's buyin'
She wanna sex a vet, never request a net and love Tech for Tech, but you lyin'
Hey, and that's no K, get away and the bitch best obey
Tryin' to use sex to get yo way but the greed negated everything that ho say
And she played out like exposé, tryin' to get quality time like, ""Let's crochet.""
Got me thinkin' of chinnin' some underhanded women but I never hit a woman so I'mma fetch Solé
And Ginuwine said, ""That's no k."" (Heh Heh Heh)
Sayin' if you got ya hand out, stop ya damn mouth

Throw a bitch up in the air and break her 'fore she hit the ground

This ain't Broadway, no play
From the track, from the cage, from the soil, from the mud
Words hella hate, no love
No suckers allowed in my camp and hell no, you can't hit my weed you tramp
Wanna stand on the stage? No K, you can't
Ride on my bus? No K, you can't
Why you always got ya hand out? All you do is pout like a woman
Grown man, act like niggas owe you somethin'
Habitual liar, always lyin' for nothin'
Start a lot of shit and be the first one runnin'

Animosity surround me
And it's all because I found me
How deceptive can the clown be?
Enough to leave the frowns upon the face of those who foul me
So much evil in my mindstate
Many think that they can define Yates
But can not tame the wicked primate
Who preaches sinful thoughts and lead the listeners on blind faith

I didn't mean to hurt a soul here
But my inner demon has no fear
Of making choices that'll make you po' tears
Black transparent flies show me that the soul near
I see 'em then they disappear quickly
Could this be some other shadows signaling the sickly?
Forgive me
Good people, I gotta let them know before they pick me

Brian Dennis was in love with her
I exchanged kisses and hugs with her
I never should've but I dugged in her
Never say no names but her thing was that she loved pictures
Another nigga told my nigga
His reply to me was ""Why, nigga?""
I learned my vices, they divide niggas
Had a chance to say I'm sorry and then he died
Man...
So hurt that I couldn't stand
Meanwhile my dark blob expands
And touching my loved ones dissolving their helping hands
My heart loves
My brain takes
They never know they stepping with a bane date
I put a gun to my insane face
That way your loving hearts I can't break


Black transparent flies again
Could be spots on your eyes, my friend
I thought that the love was gonna try to win
But now I see I'm stuck in here to see the evil rise again
My brain is so gung-ho
This all started when I was young though
This thing I won't keep running from, so
I got molested by my 7th grade teacher, Mrs. 


Damn... To the people who love me, I apologize for me back then

Don't give her no love, never wanna fold up
Then you better hold up 'cause she cray

Your imagination, kills you when it's so bad it's aching
And what's your status? Hatin', a whole lot of aggravation
'Cause she's kickin' it with this rapper, and that rapper
And that factor get a gat clapper
Gotta mash after with a blast at her

So people who givin' me evil, they all finna pay

I murder your whole city
Nigga like Frank Nitty - hideous, insidious
Niggas betta give me respect when I flex comin'
Tech flows like amphibians
From here to the Caribbeans
Unexplored territories like Venus
Niggas never seen the team that seems keenest
Impairing your mind like Zimas
Infrared beamers, keep your posse on my penis

Now it's on
Wicked shit is the link - a middle west flex
The abyss to this bitch who diss this clique
Bliss is hanging that bitch by the clitoris
You get spit on, shit on, hit on, get on
The dick of this slick niggara
But you can always call the N9na
A killer in America - Amerikilla

I got skills to kill like overdosing pills
Blood spills for million dollar bills
You can't try to peel this or feel the illness
Of a nigga that's coming out real
I don't know why nigga you living a lie
And plus I despise those who try
A nigga like I this high and fly and sly
Midwestside, so you just might die

Check it out, I murder these hoes, Hercules flows
My shit carries on like hepatitis
The weak biters mean nothing to me
Give me no fuckery foul like (what?)
Nongonococcal urethritis
I might just make a nigga bite dust
When I bust plus calamity feels great
Can it be ill? Yes
Sanity kills a real nigga but still I'm wicked like Amityville
The best: the N9ne? Correct
Burn, now it's your turn, you must learn
Misery niggas are crazed like 24 gang niggas on Sherm
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Tell these punk muthafuckas to leave me alone
When I'm in the zone you get blown away
Get the clones away, Mitch Bade nigga 'cause it's on today

Now let me smoke and choke and let these niggas know
That Lejo ain't brought no jokes
Nigga better learn the ropes, we're like Cosa Nostra
And'll fuck around and cut yo' throat
Decapitation facing devastation nations
When they raging can't stop this
Nigga you can catch a fist, and you can rest in piss
But the diss that you thought I missed
I'm indestructible and untouchable
Ain't giving a fuck about what you know
I don't love no ho, I don't mug no mo'
But I'm still collecting my other dough
Now peep the rawness, my rhymes are flawless
Fools get tossed for tryna floss like bosses
People can call this the clique with no losses
'Cause a nigga can flow from September to August
Deeper than seven seas, colder than no degrees
Niggas is easy to get down on your knees
When you fucking with rhymes like these
I always find that he's biting my shit, it's me he's trying to be
No more chances, understand this
I'm the man with the plan I stand from Kansas and this
Weed enhances scandalous dances
What is in my hands will take your last glances
Fucking with a technicality
That's what it gotta be, nigga sitting on the side of me
My mentality makes fatality reality
Split your anatomy, assault and battery
Niggas pray to God we stop; we won't though
Asking who's on the top, they don't know
But don't no motherfucker in the motherfucking western motherfucking hemisphere really want Joe
Associated with a deadly force
We got codes, deeper than Morse, sounds like
And needle points bullet shoot through a horse
So of course, I'm leaving niggas dead like a corpse
*gun shot and sparking*

Don't test me Beatrice
Another colloquialism I came up with the bitch, peep this twist
People do pitiful shit I do unforgettable hits
And niggas submitted Amerikilla, did it and got
Aquitted, I flip in a minute, I'ma get them relish lips
You can't sell us dips, we get high off K Bombay
Packing hella heat like Pompeii
Itch-May ade-Bay igga-Nay anyway
I gets ill when I feel like gettin' biz
You know what that is? I know what that is
When I be ripping everybody know what that is
Rewind - snomed ni a doG tip
If anybody wanna catch this
I just said ""Fuck demons in a God pit"" backwards
And that's bomb futuristic attack shit
Match this, takes hella practice
To rips scripts nigga gotta be thorough
I gotta make this shit make sense so I can say, ""Made it Ma""
Top of the world
Give me life or give me death
Death becomes the evil like Asmodeus
I got a melodious flow
It becomes odious changeable, untamable angel
Anghellic, bustin' like a Magnum, Tom Selleck
Missouri terror, sick of losing money at Harrah's
Mac assassin like Antonio Banderas
How many niggas you know that bust style?
So ambidextrous and I mean I'm buck wild
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Like I said in the first zone
Accident prone, but these niggas don't wanna flex with Tech when the heat is on

This Ring,Anghellic,2001.0,"Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da, come on
Do you take this man to be you lawfully wedded husband
In sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer
For better or for worse, ‘til death do you part? I do
Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife
In sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer
For better or for worse, ‘til death do you part? 
I do
From the words of a patriot
I often fear that the sins in my past
Will come back to haunt me
But the consequences are more than I can bare
I feel that shit, this piece right here
Is about what comes with fame
And the struggle to keep family within a family
I give you, this ring

(This ring)
Got me a top notch straight hot fox
We sought rocks and the ewok slot was caught
Got dropped two playing hopscotch on the block
Ought not twat plot yo' for hops knot I brought dots 
(This ring)
Help me remain sane, no damn games
Came from bane to a changed mane
No cane thang refrain from gang bang
Slang a praying brain reigns family fame,
 
then came pain
(Say hello to Tech N9ne!)
Everybody wanna be down with a nigga
Women get a whiff of the money
Thinking of taking it from me
They get up in the club, giving the love
Throwing the pussy full of liquor and bud
Booty hopping around up in the mo
Get to looking around
Every ho wanna lick a nigga low
Infatuated with niggas with dough
Get 'em in the sack and try to make 'em let it go (Tech N9ne)
Be autographing bitches in front of rapping niggas
Who think of having figures they get to grabbing triggas
They can't imagine villains when they come back and get us
We get to whacking niggas
I ain't never wanted no parts of this
I don't never want to break another heart for this
Why the devil gotta make it, why the Lord
Wanna make something that'll kill something so marvelous

(This ring)
Brings demeaning demons in (G-strings)
Songs we sing make 'em fiend semen and (Green things)
Clinging, dreaming, thinking of being (Mrs. thing)
With this ring
But if I wasn't Tech N9ne
Bitches wouldn't even wanna be with Tech N9ne
If I did no music then would you respect mine
This wedding band and music
Draws a line between life and Tech N9ne

(This ring)
Was supposed to protect a nigga, best for niggas
Who couldn't stop having sex with bitches
Bless the missus, who stress to kiss us
Even though we spend our checks with strippers
Obsessed with clitorises 
(This ring)
Made a nigga feel macho
Cry for, lie for, die for, my ho
Nigga I go face diablo with a hostile gospel
If I can't have tres or cuatro, little vatos
I'ma let a lot flow what they sell, up in osco, up a nostril
(That sound like Tech N9ne)
Nigga where the weed where the
Muthafukin' blow and the hoes? (Yes, yes!)
Next to me is ecstasy asking me if I wanna roll (Yes, yes!)
Bitches never gave a fuck about a fling, makes it exciting
When a married nigga wanna fuck around
And bitch know he's down for the fling (Yes, yes!)
I've been tested and a lot of times been invested
Didn't know this Tech's shit
Would constantly get a nigga molested
Been approached by some of the best tricks
In the game and they came strong but I hanged on
To this ring and I hope my son don't sing the same song


Quincy J. told me, superstars are good providers
But two times out of ten when we're on tour family's not beside us
What can a nigga do when he makes ends
Add more to the time they spend
While he make ends, everything else breaking
And the bond at the house may end
And your wifey steady yellin' 'bout quality time
And you think, with all the fame and fortune shit oughta be fine
But what happens when the divorce papers just gotta be signed
And you lose half and your children 'cause you gotta be N9ne
I wanna relax with them and spend time to the maximum
But if silence is golden, then me making noise is platinum
I gotta be Tech and daddy and hubby
But music, women mixed with family's ug-aly
I know and you know that hella be
Hot for a nigga's infidelity, but until then (What)
God, forgive me for any promises that I broke
Family, can I be forgiven for all the liquor and weed that I smoke?
When I succeed, will I cope
Will I still breathe without both

Delusional,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Yeah, like this
I'ma drink this Henn, I'ma keep this grin
But if you look at N9na closely
I'm tryna contain this beast within
I know some of y'all already knowing
That I got a lot of cheese to spend
But that don't change the fact I go insane
I've got a heap of sins, please begin

I saw the glitz in all of this when I was just yay tall
And I pictured y'all and it wall to wall but they all said I was just
Delusional
But the people startin' calling us and I'm balling tough
But the crawling rough and I never thought of stuff with saw enough
What the problem is now I got 'em here
Telling all these kids I'm the K.O.D
And they pumping up the volume and listening hard
When I give my heart, is it
Delusional?
When I'm thinking I'm a boss in the biz
But I'm lost and I fake it that I'm off in the lid
But they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib
Some say that if I tell them to hate
My people are at the gate ready for sealing your fate
That is up for debate because when I make
My music ain't no evil from Mr. Yates
Calling me a cult leader
I don't really know but I'ma fosho heater
Wickedness coming from Monrovia
They could blow me but the folks wanna soul see us
At the bottom with the devil look around and it be no N9na
They say I lead 'em to evil
Like I was Jimmy Jones and feedin' the people
When I bleed in the steeple
The reason they seizing me ain't no decreasing my ego
My power's for good, I think
Would I shrink if somebody took away how good I ink?
But that would never happen I'm makin' it with the rapping
But they want me to collapse and when I could I sink

I hope I find what I'm looking for
Maybe I should drink just a little more
Delusional
I'm fightin' but I'm losing
Feel like the author of confusion
Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life
And confusion seems to be my alibi
Delusional
I'm feelin' like I don't belong
Feel like I'm telling you to do wrong
Hear me!

She feel like I'm
Gonna make them hate me
Because I was around and kick it and make them babies
And now that I made it gotta escape them daily
And that's crazy
Because all I'm doing is making the industry pay me
But when I show my face feeling everything's great
Did a show then we ate then I'm outta that state
She said I'm a good provider
But daddy of the year? Man, I'm out of that race
How I compensate for the losses they get often dates
That's too personal, Will stop the tape

I hope I find what I'm looking for
Maybe I should drink just a little more
Delusional
I'm fightin' but I'm losing
Feel like the author of confusion
Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life
And confusion seems to be my alibi
Delusional
I'm feelin' like I don't belong
Feel like I'm telling you to do wrong
Hear me!

They say I'm seeing things
But everybody know I'm being things, we them kings
Like it or not we running this
Got a lot of hype because I wanna spit
And I come to grip on the fifth
You gotta know Tech's never gonna miss
I know I might be a little psychy
But it's nightly and brightly inside of me making me a little frightening
Ripping it with the right team
I bring hella light when reciting
When it's all said and done I'm sickened and heavened
Caused this a damned reverend
All 6's And 7's

I hope I find what I'm looking for
Maybe I should drink just a little more
Delusional
I'm fightin' but I'm losing
Feel like the author of confusion
Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life
And confusion seems to be my alibi

Strangeulation Cypher (All Parts),Strangeulation,2014.0,"Hmm…Tech N9ne!

Smashes, the masses
But the industry’s hatin’ asses

Strange days, when your favorite rapper’s poppin’
But is he on top is something you can’t gauge?
Especially when he’s toppin’ the charts
And you see me, K. Lamar, and Macklemore sharing the same stage
I’m the nigga all these artists look up to
Yet for Tech it’s been the hardest to bust through
But I keep my fans fiendin’ like clucks do
You don’t like how we live it, well…
I dominate, your conglomerate Wanna beating?
I can accommodate It’ll be a non-debate, coming up against Aaron the Great
So many got arms, legs and necks tatted
Strange Cause music, show, conceptually I’m the best at it
Let’s have it for all of these Tech addicts
Any disrespect to family will get your chest gatted
Aimin’ at ’em and its agony
Burner blew his brain and back and these
Cannons came and caved in cavity, caliber connect, cap it
Yo, there it go, red is in my head it grow
Headed fo’, lead and deaded, yeah the medic said it so
Let it grow, shred it and get no credits, so pathetic though
Dread embedded steppin; in heaven’s crevice, wet and edible
Give her the shivers when I deliver this
Hit her then quit her cause she’s on Twitter shit
And when she compare me to Eminem
I said I’m different She said “How?” I said I’m black and I can say 'nigga' bitch!
To him I may just be another bro with a flow
We’ll probably never tour cause it’ll be thousands of Juggalos at his show
And I heard fatalities happen on each side, so that’s never no let it go
So I get it, I keep what I’m makin’ incredible, all of them scared of a negro
Strangeulation, this occupation so scandalous
We stop the hatin’, no chances
When I rock the nation so Danzig
I’m killing all these niggas, Operation Code Kansas
Strange gang plain triggered assassins
Got a bunch of untamed aimed trained spitters a’ blastin’
My insane brain sayin’ give up the rappin’
And go back to the gang bang thang, nigga what’s happenin’, soo-woo

Deevil!
Prayin’ at 12:12 for hell Felon to sell and slept on a bed of nails Like nothing I’ve ever felt
Ghost in a shell, was molded with other demons
As if I needed some help Or a host to preserve the heathen
Got it, my brain is rotted
I swear to God that I’m not it I’m set to go to the gallow as soon as the rope is knotted I ain’t high as the fire and I have unused adrenaline
Came in the cypher clean, still smelling like putrid cinnamon Then I’m in, enemy of the state, I’m straight at an angle
Stop risking and quit your bitchin’, it ain’t like I’m raping an Angel Said I was magnifique, ya’ll fuckin’ with it, capiche?
Now the safest you woulda thought with a devil under your feet
They throw a shot and then sit back and wait for some reaction
Ain’t nothing to it but to do it; i’m a mummy rappin
So get to clappin or dissin the clan you’re hatin
Listen the man is Jason and this is the Strangeulation

Stevie Stone I’m on it I’m so clever
Nobody comparing ’em better I put shit together
America’s most elaborated rap pick yo head up
Small talkin’ to get you wet up Yeah
I’m will to kill all you niggas
The feelin’, adrenaline that’ll spillin’ a milli yeah I mill’ all you niggas
Ain’t even reach out they climax rather my sillin’ on niggas
And backin’ a back on back can’t billy you niggas
Get busy on niggas This ain’t no random some leekage
Stonie in the building the bitches pull out their cleavage
The snake and the bat you see them prominent features
The spieces Strangeland we rain on your region
Meatwagon I come I be taggin’ ’em
Baggin’ ’em bring ’em clusters of three
Got three magnums gaggin’ em out
You pussies is still talkin’ I’m draggin’ ’em out
I’m tappin’ ’em out

Aww shit, they fucked around and signed a backpacker
Smart, rich, handsome, plus he’s not a bad rapper
I’m just a little local talent that fucked around and made it big Underground bully, pickin’ on all these famous kids
And the danger is, now I’m doin’ Stranger biz
About to make the world forget about what a major is Independent Powerhouse, running all these cowards out
My enemies are all forgotten, wishin’ I would shout em out And I don’t want to hear a rapper harmonize unless
He's thuggish, ruggish, Lazy, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish or Flesh
But maybe I’m just hatin’ cuz my black ass could never sing Fuck that autotune I hope the Futures filled with better things And you a fucking liar! If you say you found a better team Impossible! Like trying to fit my dick inside my wedding ring And all the bread it brings will be distributed and properly
I represent for hip hop not some fucking aristocracy

Wrapped in XLR cables Up from my whiskers, down to my fuckin’ kicks
Wreck-O was echoed in Gordon Geckos You suckin’ dick Nobody be askin’ me for secrets I ain’t chuckin’ tips I’d rather be bumpin’ hips
On that ratchet with muffin tits Tore up the limits
From Britan visions would rock their lives
Inside a prison where giddy bitches don’t jock the rhyme
Born in precision on rhythm spittin’ could swat a fly
For them to just kick a single shillings from Spotify
Bye, Bye killers On a high five business
Gonna ride by the sickest In your high ride to the hitlist
If we ain’t spoke in ages
Then miss me with broken favors, you Miley Cyrus teenagers
You twerkin’ on swollen razors (run now)
Don't make me come to dinner nail your tongue down
And have you plead your case to us
At Strangeland at sundown Be careful of the biz
Cause everything has got a price attached
Wake up with a horse head in your bed
And next your life is snatched

Tank full of petrol Bank full of pesos
Pool on my tour bus Bonus on a payroll
Feel like I be killin’ it Famous on the internet
Really I’m just wingin’ it Cookin’ shit on my Kitchenett
Life so good Right now I need to celebrate
Bout to sell a stadium out And turn it into rave
Look at how the industry norm Has started lookin’ Strange
All my brothers riding the storm While they just ride the waves Caviar wishes Bitches for my bitches
Black shades and hoodies And spots and white linens
Feel like Sam Kinison Preachin’ to these citizens
Screamin’ at the saints You ain’t ever gonna get rid of us Guessin’ that I just cleaned my plate So now I’m gettin’ cake Speedin’ down the interstate Yellin’ get out the fuckin’ way
We plant flags in the ground Because we here to stay
And bring my whole hood out And have my own parade

(Black Gold!)
I purposely wrote this verse Just to murder, dismember, defecate
Disassemble the limbs Of a nigga who try and separate Artistry from nonfiction Im sent with a conviction
To sentence you pons Givin’ the benz on my diction
There he goes Speakin’ bout how he murk a beat
Smellin’ himself Why else would he flaunt about it so verbally Dance around me Like I was a paraplegic
In a do-si-do competition
Lookin pissed like I never heard of feet
Yadda Yadda A whole lotta yappin’
About my rappin’ When I’m the captain Of crunchin’ you niggas milky dreams Im the comparison of Pac’s face Staring in your face Mock razor blades cut Leave you crispy clean
Don’t ask Tech Ask me if it’s questions Guarantee that he tell you
That I’m the best And Im destined To find a snake and a bat Helpin’ Kansas City’s progression Hopin’ I hurt the feelings Of whoever second guessed it Cause everybody talkin’
Imma make you niggas hear me
Mind control flow Now: listen till your ears bleed

Spit it sicker than these sycophants
Keep your dick up in your pants
You were blunted on the block
Me? I had some different plans
I’m trying to get to France
Sniffing grams
Hit a branch
Independent Powerhouse
Vibin' out with the fans
Waking up in different cities Every night
Getting grands
Stay prepared for this
I’m bearing witness to this sinner man
Stripper dance with cinnamon
Clubbin’ with my gentlemen
Drink away the nights events
Nothing worth remembering
Squad will run up in this bitch
Mobbin’ like some immigrants
Jack you for your paper stack
Rob you of your innocence
Taping of the scene of crimes
Swabbing for my fingerprints
Thought about my life
You thought the same And couldn’t think of shit
(Ha!) This type of fire dont extinguish
Now write about some bigger shit
You’re striking out
Swing and miss
Ring around the Rosie, homie
Pocket full of pain
Keep a lock up on my lane
And triple optic in my brain, look

My brain is full of thoughts that are darker than Samhain
That span across the Great Lakes and vast Midwest Plains Spreading coast to coast like a virus you can’t contain
Now a global pandemic, panic courtesy of (STRANGE!)
The biggest independent label pop the champagne
We don’t need no head now, homie you can keep the change Coming through your speakers, receive us into your blood vein We the truth like Nostradamus’ prophecy quatrains Snake Bat, Praise that, part of rap since way back
Since the days of 8 tracks and 808’s and adats
Analog cassette decks, steady grinding, what’s next?
Starving artist ’til Trav and Tech cut me that advanced check Strange outcast step child, call me Damien
Five Finger Death Punch straight to the cranium
Flow so sick, could be enriched with uranium Extraterrestrial, lyrics labeled alien

KALI BABY! ‘Ight man Ima do this!
I’m kinda nervous The purpose of having a cypher is so you can sit here wide-eyed Listen look at me in this position
Now I coulda just left you sitting there
But Nina told me to pick ’em apart you’re a victim of art
K-R-I to the double crooked, look at him he pudgy like they Took an ugly stick and frickin’ shook at him, (OKAY)
And I don’t stay gucci down to the linens I’ll let you trick off, she jerking my dick off and grinnin’
You can see him, but he just a figment
You wanna be him, better get your pigment gone
Try to beat him with deliverin’, I get belligerent
And that’s the end of the song
And I get a little bit ahead of myself
Feel like I’ma melt, and I feel like I’m better than everyone else I guess I be rappin’ ahead of my wealth
I’m the coldest thing since the ice cube
Only thing missing from this beat back in the day was Ice Cube (OKAY)
Yeah I said I’m the best and I meant it , Nigga what?
Only niggas that could contest it is rested, dig em up!

Okay, got it
Kill 'em

Searched maps when I started to burst raps
1985, that's when I first snapped
Decades before they birthed apps
I was giving niggas, what did we call it back then? Dirt naps
But nowadays they still singing our praise
Know how to raise a lot of hell up, or else your crowd'll fade
Devour naysayers hatin', tryna set our cloud ablaze
My route'll stay electro-lit and Kali's my Powerade
And together we get paid in full (That's right)
For the cheddar, we big ragin' bulls
And it'll get Haitian cruel, meddling with pay and jewels
Enemies sick, laid in pools, hit 'em with a quick blazin' tool
He said he wasn't a fan of us, coming at me with a camera
See me and become a stammer-er 'cause I am the one with the stamina
I got the fully, I'm 'bout to be bully from KCMO into Canada
You are the work of a janitor and I'm really coming to damage ya
Nobody wanna be showed up, they send me one verse and they hold up
I send 'em my verse and they go bust another verse after mine, it's a stole cut
'Cause they go nuts when a pro clutch microphones givin' no fucks
'Cause I'm dope, plus, in my flow trust, I got fo' sho' guts they get ate like a Po' Russ
From Jackstack, the gat's back
When I'm out my town I get my Aventus right at Saks (Woo)
That smell and my riches will get your bitch's hat macked
Bosses take losses when they cross this black cat
And that's facts (Done)
Don't nobody want none 'cause (I can make you outdone)
Really wanna go flow with the gun? You niggas are just (Done)
When I'm doing it for fun, yo (I can make you outdone)
Doubt from when you slouched, what's the outcome? (Done)
When I go left I'm speaking in tongues (I can make you outdone)
Ayy yatafawaq ealay-ha (Done)
Technician and independent number one (I can make you outdone)
You know the vibes, nigga
No drums, I still rock that bitch
The industry shunned me, but I got that stitch (Just one)
Eminem, Wayne, Kendrick and Pac's rap pick
Jahseh, Joyner, and Logic, too, so stop that shit
Acting like you don't see me in the conversation
Of the greatest, I never got a nomination
'Cause you hated, you callin' me abomination
When it was domination when you played it
How a nigga feeling outdone when you get him on a label with ya?
Get his clout sprung if the louts hung, if your mouth guns, it's a picture
Now ain't that a kick in the sack? When I saw it, was fixing to snap
On a Gathering mission to pack 'em out with Travis, told us keep bickin' it back
So it let it go when I shoulda beheaded bro, 'cause I put him on a pedestal
As an incredible, I know he regret it, though
'Cause the bread, it goes dead, it sit low as your credit score
Man I'm so (Done)
Not biting my thumbs 'cause (I can make you outdone)
Calling Kevin Wendell Crumb will never stop this beast
They know when I spit speech (I can make you outdone)
Shit gets deep
My talent gives some rappers shivers and it should (Yes, sir)
'Cause I kill it with some of the best spitters and it's good (That's right)
Guessing my sketching gets 'em stressing, they go left and feel threatened
Somethin' like police 'round niggas in the hood (Yeah)
White and black, mostly white, though (That's right)
With hundreds of years with beef, ain't no lipo (Nope)
The problem is no face to face, just Skype, yo (Bitch)
That's so cowardly, kinda like they did Iso (Woo)
No conversation, just left him for doing a song with me
All the ties from the other side was gone quickly
Tears flow here, bro, 'cause I ain't double-cross zero
We all know Mike Johnson is one of the fastest at rappin' and that ain't what I'm here for
I'm here for rockin' the spot (Yes)

Cumming on her butt for a pill with a slut
Playin' with the pussy now I'm tryin' to go fuck

Gon' suck a nigga dick or something

I Love You but Fuck You,Killer,2008.0,"(
Welcome to Killer 2
)

In my brand new Benz, thinkin' 'bout my so-called friends
And why should I make amends when they crossed the N9na
And sin again and again and again?
I love 'em dearly, but hear me, they burn severely
I'm weary to the point that I really don't want not one of them
None of them near me
Did trust you, but what's new for real?
Yeah, I love you, but fuck you for real

I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)

Met you at a rock show, November no Octo'
Took pictures then locked your numbers and then got low
Called you up a lot though, found out that you not ho
Several trips to my show, shot me with your crossbow
We used to kick it in packs, whites and blacks
Triple stacks and fat sacks,
 we matched, we relaxed
To kiss but I never twist her, she wished for the better mister
I mixed the lady with my kid brother and miss, she became my sister
For a minute but then my lady started receiving that snitch
By the nigga on tour, you wanna be the reason that split
You started believin' that bitch in San Jose
You gripped what the damn ho say
You flipped like a man will stay, no trips, never Saint-Tropez
We dipped, used to play for you, even used to pray for you
Never dap 'cause you wanted to spit in my face
It was up, up, up and away for you
I hate this, I was real, so why fake shit?
You lost her, so go fuck them bitches on MySpace, sis

I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)

Every show was a different face
But these two were from a distant place
Followed my tour got a quick embrace
Never would have thought I had to give them space
Father and daughter, loved me to death
Never cared that blood be the set
Just lovin' the Tech, shrugs in regret
When I found out papa kinda had the husband effect
Everybody seen it, but I didn't believe it
Everybody got it but never did I receive it
His dream was for me to fuck Miss Thing
But she looked fifteen, baby girl was nineteen
But instead of givin' her dick I rather give her ice cream
Now I'm trippin' 'cause her pops just tried to auction her off
But it turns out that he was knockin' her off, I had to stop and I cough
'Cause that daddy turned out to be the boyfriend
Guess he was gettin' him a little bit extra when he brought the toys in
You lied to me, did it fuck wit' the N9na? Sure it did
Y'all made me question what your motive is
Don't cry Ally, but my temper was flared and scared also
To see you guess I'll see you in the crowd like Where's Waldo

I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you
I wrote this carefully

I love you 'cause you married me when I needed therapy
Let me move in with you be my wife, you wasn't scared of me
But fuck you because you say, if you don't get a job today
Better kick rock wasn't hard to say when you knew I rap my heart away
I love you 'cause you sexy, love you 'cause you beautiful
Love you 'cause way back in the day, you thought that I was suitable
But fuck you, you treated me, stupid and conceitedly
I wasn't very smart, but a genius you wanted me to be
I love you 'cause you strong, I love you 'cause you're real
Because you forgave me when I cheated and popped them pills
But fuck you for bringin' up shit that happened years ago
Chances of us gettin' back, it's gonna take a miracle
You live in the past, I'm givin' the gas and cash
How many niggas do that without you givin' the ass?
And I ask you what other nigga, would step up with the love to give her
G's in the house for you and the kids and even for your brother nigga
Enjoy the dough you get, 'cause I don't owe you shit
You was unhappy with me, so you split
You need to show me some love, ma, and I don't mean that I wanna fuck you
Just acknowledge me takin' care of you because I'll, I..

I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)

Verse one, I ain't never spoke nothin' but highly about you
But you gonna believe a bitch you never met, that's hardcore shit baby
Verse two, I mean, y'all lied to a nigga
I mean, that was foul shit you did, man
I don't know what the fuck your motive was
But it hurt me real bad 'cause I trusted you, motherfuckers
Verse three, I know I fucked our marriage up
But you can't live in the past
You either gotta let that shit go, or let me go",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-i-love-you-but-fuck-you-lyrics

All this pain for me to become big
Mad at Strange you're nothing but some kids, quit it
Toured the world with Big Krizz, did it
Couple of bitches up in the biz, hit it
See this ho, she wanna meet this mo

We lashin' out at you, you think you 'bout it, we 'bout it too
Only difference is my clout is too massive
We active when actors give malice to anybody we close to
I'll approach you with the woop-wop that'll soak you (so true)
Already be so much we go through, now we gotta rid you in the MO zoo
This is tribal, stick his rival in the mouth with a right blow then he get this pyro
Young punk better lie low somewhere prolly up in Cairo
With a Bible when a psycho wanna give a hater lypo
When the knife go with the quickness, you so full of bitchness
You trip flippin' on chicks but a b-boy make him wanna shit bricks
This is vicious, everything out yo lips is fictitious, hehe
Misses made me mad as Mozzy, huh
Man the motive must been made of molly, huh
Milli maximize a mess with a mind of Malcolm X
And a martyr man whose mom is Maude, huh
Better be cool, I'ma lead you to the B fools
That'll greet you with a (blacca, blacca, blacca)

Could imagine what you all'll think if Tech signed Iso (would you cry bro?)
Gettin' big like Bruce Bruce, mimi ni ajabu foo'

Midwest side
Tech N9ne
The anthem, nigga

If you got scratch, nigga, get the fuck up
Throw your hands up if you hella fucked up
Einstein, Tech N9ne, two triple zip
Crack a jaw, whip 'em all if they wanna trip
Ladies with the bar codes, meet me after this
Maybe you can show me the meaning of abyss
Everybody on the wall, momma is a bzzz
Had her at the Budgetel stroking on my dzzz
This ones for the psychos, gang bangers and sluts
Bumbs holding the pipe those college graduate fucks
I feel for no foes, I kill 'til I close my trap
I'm ill when I flow and you never doze when I rap
Tech Tech, give me women and much alcohol and I'm straight
Eat drink and be merry, yo, come tomorrow might be your fate
Yo, look, look over there
It's that nigga with the hair
TECH and Juan, what a pair
The rest equals MC squares
What?

Who got this motherfucking house on lock?
Einstein, Tech N9ne, dwamn
Who keeps it sizzling? Who keeps it hot
Einstein, Tech N9ne, dwam
KC, MO, Roll
KC, MO, Roll

Everybody witness, my soul sickness
If you dig Tech when he's twisted, then go get this
Bringing the house down when I rip shit like the plates shifted
Angels come in many shades either drunk or lifted
The Einstein, meaning gifted, too slick to get with
Two years ago, my shit was broke, but now I fixed it with the quickness
You missed it when I used to roll with misfits and Nitwits
But now who I do biz with ain't none of yo business
Blood thirst in the church now, the earth's the worst
Clutch your purse when we lurk cause we cursed from work
Trying to party like a motherfucka, broke as a joke
Don't hire me, but you arrest me when I'm selling my dope
So who's the Einstein in N9ne N9ne, Tech N9ne I'm
Crime mind in my prime rhyme time
I'm mixing one fifty-one with Malibu rum
And pineapple juice among all my angels and wicked ones

We're the party people night and day
Living crazy is the only way
Einstein, get you where I got you when I'm on it
Einstein, rock it like you mother fuckers want it


What do we say to haters off top?
Haters got beef, they thinking we got
We gonna get postal if it don't stop
You can get ghost or you can get shot
Generation X gon' party 'til the death
Anybody tripping getting greeted with a stretch
Taking everything and we're leaving nothing left
Demons gotta die have 'em breathing last breaths
I feel that I got will and I'm gonna bill 'til I'm killed
Bell 'til I bail, if I fail, then I'm gonna steal what I will
Tech is a realist, running with killers, you better vill this
Be the witness to the coldest
When I hold this dick, they break camp when I flow this
Einstein go the ill route
Throw up your hands if you're villed out or if you're real sauced
I told you all I'm cold dog I flows, all heat
I'm representing Rogue Dog, Rogue Dog, 57th street

Last Sad Song,The Lost Scripts of K.O.D.,2010.0,"(The Hole)

I really need to get up out of this hole man
I'm really really sinking deep down in this hole
I need to get out of this shit, I'm serious
I really wanna go into the light, man
I know y'all love me to be sad and shit
But this got to be my last sad song
I mean, I gotta get out of this shit
Before I lose myself in it

Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

Hey, y'all know my mother's sickness, y'all know I'm breakin' down
Y'all know in my circle the devil's steady makin' rounds
Y'all know I'm missin' my children because I'm shakin' towns
And y'all love my music and how sad I could make it sound
I'm in the darkness so low I'm under the carpet
Whoever wants me to park it you motherfuckers is heartless
They want me stuck with hardships, want a unhappy artist
But I'ma break apart from this KOD shit regardless
Of who's mad, a lot of my shit is too sad
Like the death of Micheal Jackson, motherfucker who's bad?
To jump right up out of myself, this shit's a fight on my health
The darkness is sellin' but I really wanna put y'all some light on the shelf
Will you still be able to feel me
Even if I'm not talkin' about tryin' to kill me
The King of Darkness can no longer conceal me
This could be my last sad song, hopin' it will be

Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

Yeah, I want some Caribou Lou
I wanna see areolas chicks on my shoulders instead of boo-hoo
Like I said I'm too through with me spreadin' blue spew
All I wanna hear is my peoples say ""Tech go head and do you""
Y'all love my pain and I was glad to give it
But most of the people who love it never really had to live it
Now they mad and livid, I don't want no sad to visit
My music thinkin' I'm about to lose it so they bash and diss it
Before they even hear what I have comin' this year
I'ma be that lit spear let's get some of this shit clear
I ain't switchin' to mainstream only what is happenin' is
You watchin' the mainstream go me
So watch me bloom out of this blackened cocoon
'Cause if I go back into gloom I'm just askin' for doom
Man I'm just rappin' to whom to keep attacking my tunes
I don't wanna be melancholy 'til I put my ass in a tomb

Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

Listen, only time can dictate if I'll get straight
But I'm reachin' for the light as of this day
I love KOD but I think I made a mistake
By lettin' negative energy in me now I'm misplaced
I lost something along the way
My mama taught me bad things are wrong to say
Still I conjured up a album of songs to play
For the dark and a lot of my loved ones are gone today, damn
I'm at a crossroad, I'm tryin' to go into the light
Like Carol Ann there I stand still a lost soul
On the subject on when I talk low
I'm ready to dangle this darkness
At the top of the catacombs and toss those
But will you still be with me or just kill me quickly
Away with the darkness but I promise the flow will still be sickly
I am the king and I always have the throne
But I hope and pray for the brighter day
Hope this my last sad song

Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

It's time to be something else
'Cause this shit is fuckin' me up
Talkin' 'bout mentally, it really is fuckin' me up man
I'm talkin' about, it's infecting everybody around me, man
I'm tryna, I gotta get out
Gotta be done with this shit

Fuck this shit, let's go party, nigga",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-last-sad-song-lyrics

Good times, noodle salad. Haha...

I'm a product of Reaganomics
Neurotic, they saying I'm it
Just got up, inhaling chronic
The oddest, I'm staying honest
I'm 'bout to make it famous
So you can take that J-O-B and you can shove it up your anus
I ain't never understood how the world works
But I always understood why the girls twerk
For a baller, not a 9-to-5
Barely making it with disgust behind your eyes
So I just grip my piece, rip-off fleece
Out to take your lip off, chief with my peeps
We ruthless, if you got money induce it
Goofs get toothless, we loose off two-fifths, we useless
I wanna kick it but ain't got the dough
Sneak in the concert, trip, and make 'em stop the show
We gots to go! Push me and I sock the po'
Gettin' the bail from my parents is impossible

And people holla ""How you do that there?
Why your pants hanging low and why you grew that hair?""
Lighting a bleeze with my people riding a Regal
Always in trouble with coppers 'cause we drivin' illegal
I ain't never giving them leeway, to hear me neigh
The judicial assembly's gay (hey!)
I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Tryna get with Def Jam, Loud or MCA!

Enter the party and my homies got to pay for me
Holidays, them be just be another day for me

Sit at home watching MTV with a empty P-
O-C-K-E-T, I MP3, everything that I hear on the streets
Never buy it, don't deny it, I'm the fear, I'm a beast
You say get a job? I say hit a knob!
'Cause the way you run the world is every bit a fraud
So what you ask of me? You get no tax from me
I got whites, natives and Mexicans and blacks with me
Huh! I'm tryna get up there with Master P
Pass the D, 'cause, that's the way it has to be
We bust to be free, we trust to be G

'Cause I got every bitch in the place straight glancin'
While they next to they lover lookin' at me, hate stancin'
But I'm always with niggas just like a fake klansman
How I'm feeling is people keep usin' identical syllables
Switch it up a little bit I'm feeling that often this pattern is the only one feelable
To the masses, perhaps to the people not needin' variety
Since the umbilical, don't hate the mirror so
I'm just a rapper that happens to kill a bro
When I be clappin', your cap is so peelable, ah

Did it all on purpose (purpose)
Stepped up in their building, make 'em nervous (creep, creep)
Better cuff your bitch 'cause she lurkin'
Spillin' all these drinks that I purchased
Yeah, something real strange (real strange)
When I look around I see real things
If you mad, get out your feelings
'Cause this is how I'm feeling

This is how I'm feeling (yeah)
Bitches, I don't feel 'em
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling

Snow ayyo be the one all of these bitches be talkin' about (yeah yeah)
First they be throwin' them shots and then they wanna talk it out (yeah yeah)
Hold on bitch lemme, find out you ain't know facts (yeah yeah)
And I'm still this cold with the bars tryna get me to backtrack 'Cause you know I still rap but I get that bag and then I go sing
And then I come right back and I let that stack and the bell go 'ding'
And a bitch get slapped and I know it's gon' sting when you hoes hear that
It ain't mumble rap if you hear me clearly
I rap better than you boys and you gettin' weary
'Cause I hit a little melody and I know you hear me
With your dumb-ass, only smart people feel me
'Cause I been out here killin' that rap, it's just that I be lookin' up to Kaliko
Most of you bitches that been rappin' fast, garbage as fuck, I'm a whole different animal
Lately these bitches be jockin' me hard, hear it all in they song, so I shook 'em again
But when they ask if I'm still goin' off, on you bitch I'm a monster don't ever forget, ho

Did it all on purpose (creep, creep)
Stepped up in their building, make 'em nervous (creep, creep)
Better cuff your bitch 'cause she lurkin'
Spillin' all these drinks that I purchased
Yeah, something real strange (real strange)
When I look around I see real things
If you mad, get out your feelings

Bitches, I don't feel 'em

American Horror Story,Strangeulation,2014.0,"I want skin for my bed, spread
I swear the sky just bled, red
I buy, twitch my neck, bread
I'll take them to my bed, dead

I might've lost my mind, how did I get this far
I thought about how I, kill you for laughin' at my business card
Feels like I been discarded, And I don't really get this part
Everyone is high and mighty, until they get disarmed
I'm livin' in this darkness, I got a twisted heart
I got a lethal mind state, you got a vicious bark
And there is no catharsis, no remedy to cure my ill
I know my soul is tarnished, they'll never know how to serve that feel
Black blood on the white walls, do a design in the droplets
Psycho what you might call, but my mind is spotless
Do you like Phil Collins, have you ever heard this album
Even if you know how the song ends, you will never know that I'm out of
My mind I'm above the law and I caused it all this mayhem
Whatever you say when you speak is, childish crawl in the playpen
Everything falls into place and, black gloves and a tight grip
Sittin' on a chest of my victim, if you breathe I'ma squeeze 'til ya lifeless

I want skin for my bed, spread
I swear the sky just bled, red
I buy, twitch my neck, bread
I'll take them to my bed, dead

I might've gone AWOL, maybe I blurred the line
Clock radio alarm set, I know it's murder time
I gotta find my mind, even if only a piece
I'm better off behind, down here where we know no peace
And the clouds don't move when the wind blow, put a seed in the soil but it didn't grow
They say I gotta odd sense of humor, killer clown sittin' still by the window
Cuff links in a crimson cape, scepter with my lipstick smudged
I got a glitch on my headpiece, somebody come and fix this bug
Gotta protect the king, follow a black shogun
Cover the neck in bling, swallow a black hole sun
Lookin' down at my shitlist, wonderin' how did it get so long
I'd rather be the one pissed off, than to ever be the one pissed on
Amen, I'm an animal inside, feedin' on everything in the open
I've been caught with a loaded weapon, red-handed the barrel still smokin'
And I'm hopin', that they waitin' for me to break a leg, I'll be takin' the cast off
Tryin' to wash away all my sins, in the shower with a handful of bath salts

I want skin for my bed, spread
I swear the sky just bled, red
I buy, twitch my neck, bread
I'll take them to my bed, dead

Smellin' like Hugh Parsons, to get a victim when it darkens
Then I'm hit them with a jargon, fuck her with no rubber
Then burn a bitch, I'm an arson(ist)
Then have a lot of drinks 'til I'm barfin'
When I went to do the verse for the martian
He told me to put the people up on the milk carton
Keep a knife sharpened then he laughed like Cartman
I got stigmata markings, pardon when the beast get the bar end
I put the, I put the evil in my art when the angel let go of me
And took what the demon bargained
I'm gonna make a change but I'm Harkin
If you cannot tell me when the sex startin'
I got the kind of heart in spartan and I'm enemy scarfin' then I watch Johnny Carson
If you think I'm harsh then, Strangeland not the place to be parkin'
I guess this is the part when, I tell them all that I'm part hen and part sin
Winning about Noah's ark getting carp and the book is so colorful gotta listen to Darwin
Because you like a perfect margin, and that makes my dick harden
So I'm comin' over with the sparklin' (wine), get to itchin' when it's carvin' (time)
Ain't no matter what the guards in (line), ain't nobody's 'bout to stoppin' (N9ne)
I'm so twisted, I think I created the water, our women and our men
Thinkin' they're gonna take it for a swim, so now I got to throw the sharks in",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-american-horror-story-lyrics
So Lonely,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"So Lonely, So Lonely
So Lonely, So Lonely
Yeahhh
When I came up
I was famous
And I stayed up
Yeahhh
Now I'm way up
People they just
Turn they hate up

Been alone ever since I started
To be an artist
I've been disregarded
I mean the hardest ever seen
I put them in the garbage to be departed when I spit this
Dwamn
 
he is wicked
Face covered up just like Stanley Ipkiss
But damn he is lifted were no families listed
Plan to revisit that big plan that he misses
But the land that he shifted, twisted a bit
Cuz man he resisted to jam when he scripted
Calamity Insanity with it
Like amity picture sickness hit when banished he's living
So Blow me, with a bucket of hot feces poured on me
Never loved it, now ya'll just be so phoney
No Homies
Would I never let bozos with so-so flows own me
When it said it gets better it's just baloney
That's why Ninna's so lonely



This my planet higher then yours
, damn it
No laws and it's no raw candidates I made them all vanish
Vandalistic with this
If man get his lips in this
Quick damage and rip the bitch
No bandages with a fit he draws panic
From clones I spit it up and then they gone
And I'm livin it up within my zone
Nobody left to win my throne
Try calling home but everybody is so monotone
And your gettin this while the Tech is all alone

Tech, Wait
It's so Lonely up here (why)
Ain't none of my homies up here
Cuz they feel like I chose a career over my peers
But I try to tell them love don't pay bills
But me spittin' these frees
 
and pre-writtens
Is probably what's gon' make mills
Try to stay chill
When a lot of rappers lust and chase thrills
Fuck the fame and the thrills I'm maintaining the real
Straight up fury ain't no jury minus the chain and the grill
To me, you were lame if you ain't been embracing the skill
Ya see, cuz I been in it, for a minute, and I ain't gonna go away
Ya'll keep them trash rappers, but I'm the one that y'all throw away
Them songs I make will show the pain but this game ain't to friendly
I can't take it no more so sing it Mackenzie and tell em' why I'm


Got everything that I wanted but it came with a price
Bought me a crib with my money, but I gave up my life
Sometimes I stay up kinda late, and I hate it at night
Every other day me and my lady we break up and fight
Thinking you bringing that mentality into my galaxy
Is a fallacy for anybody that battle me
Realizing I ain't got nothing but friends and family
And after that ain't nobody else gonna look after me
So I'm proud to be

So Lonely (x8)",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-so-lonely-lyrics
Beautiful Music,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"(Bang out)

Now they wanna come with a nigga
Get to the pinnacle,
 get some with a nigga
Get done, get gun, get sprung with a nigga
Re-evaluate your fate, if you want monogamy then skate
You gotta let everybody get a taste and if you wanna date
You gotta wait for Mister...

...Yates!
I'ma put this space this place all up in your face
Picture me painting pretty pussy with a pen and pad
And picking a pair of provocative peaches to press to the pace
Let's get this straight, I am the maker of emotion on my planet
You will be blessed at the gate, 
complex when the mate
Is one that could have any woman breathing
So you might end up with a chest full of hate,
 
less to debate
If women would just ride, she feeling my love vibe
I'm feeling her cup size, she willing to plug guys
I'm given her bug eyes from my dick in her thighs
She thinking it was lies
When her name changed from baby to Sherlock Holmes
When you want to shit and she go through your phone
To see if there's pictures of bitches with no clothes on
Now she pissed at the photos, looking like a ho show
Thinking every one of them are gonna get the pogo
Or prolly done had it,
 
she highly combative
But no-no, shining the light on me with cheater up on the go bro
When we first started out you knew we was on the low-low
Now you feeling Bozo, peeping through my property like you loco
Thinking I'm sticking them and slanging more meat than Fogo

Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it

It's just me and you, better yet it's me and crew
'Cause I never can be free and do
What a normal nigga can manage to be when two
People go out with no doubt to show out
They beautiful couple but when I go out they pour out
And triples and doubles,
 then out of your mouth to blow out
'Cause you had enough of the bitches seizing who?
You saw the beautiful picture at the beginning
With Mr. Tech in your vision having sex in the kitchen
And press in the living room, sex and no less or you're bitchin'
Without extra conditions me getting left is the mission
'Cause I can't get right, ain't this night
Ain't no possible way that I can paint this bright
When the brain is night, mayne it's quite
Difficult to be with Tech, ain't a dame this tight
Or is it? You gotta live it to give it
I'm giving you me, if you wanna quit it, I dig it
'Cause I get a pussy pass every minute, but then it's
A fight 'cause you thinkin' I'm all up in it, we finished
Now we diminished, I get it
See the obstacle then you really admit it
Without knowing I ever did it you split it
I was real and don't you ever forget it
You bit-itch!

Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it

Baby, this is something that you never knew
Instead of me, you being with a regular nigga might be a better view
I know I got a lot of cheddar, true
But a nigga with hella time in your bed is who?
You should be putting way up on a pedestal
You being super happy with him instead of blue
But you wanna see shit that you never seen
My dick is feeling like you taking methamphetamine
That's why when I'm calling your phone you never let it ring
Even when he's sitting next to you I bet it sting
You wanna ride it your hide is divided
By my two thumbs, I murder it when I get inside it
Hit it 'til you get it, then get the itis ignited
When you tripping, you can't fly with the pilot?
I can paint you a beautiful picture
But I think it's better when you got a dude with you
Sitting at home, but then you got a true fixture
You fucking perform because he got it through scripture
I'm a compatible nigga to every woman with incredible figures
Tattoo my dick on him, is that a new stigma?
If you say that then music I ain't gotta do with ya

Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-beautiful-music-lyrics

Don't lay down, lay down
Don't lay down yet
Don't lay down, lay down
Don't lay down yet
This is dedicated to the ones that are broken
Stay here with us
Your time to shine is coming
Trust

Do you know somebody in pain? I know somebody's
All fed up and off in the brain, heartbroken probably
I been broke when life was not gleaming with hope and foggy
But I would never dump it on you, then later say sorry, ayy
It be the hardest when a loved one's life isn't starlit
When they call you, they think the smartest way out of it is depart it
You tell 'em that shit retarded, and hate the call even started
Know they heart isn't guarded, not even your art is cathartic
Please think about your people, yo
Ease on about your ego, bro
That's about far as evil go
You don't really wanna fly like an eagle though
But in case you wanna know how sin taste
I wanna try to help another, save a brother from a grim fate
How could you make friends break down and act like an ingrate
Selfishness, that's what it is
When all your family and friends just wanna see a brother live
But if you don't see the gutter through, you're gonna leave the others blue
You make it hard as fuck for us, but think it's easier for you
Damn

It's easier for you, yeah
To take yourself away from things we all go through, yeah
But if you knew that it was killing me, yeah
It's killing me, would you?
Would you still believe that it was easier to do? Yeah
World ain't never been easy
Don't lay down, lay down
Don't lay down yet
Don't lay down, lay down
Don't lay down yet

Only the angels know the pain that you hold on to
Why would you leave me 'lone, just 'cause it's easy for you?

I know somebody that's stuck down on the bottom
And he deals with his problems in ways that never solves 'em
And I know how he feels inside
Try to give him flowers while he's still alive
I see demons in my sleep
Got a teardrop falling down my cheek
Don't lay down, homie, you can't leave me now
I woke up in the middle of the night, I was drenched in a cold sweat, stressing
I couldn't fall back asleep, so I picked up the phone and I sent you a message, and it said
After everything that we've been through
Through the ups and downs, just know that I believe in you
You said you won't leave me, I know I'm a piece of you
So don't you make this hard on us just 'cause it's easier for you

It's easier for you, yeah
To take yourself away from things we all go through, yeah
But if you knew that it was killing me, yeah
It's killing me, would you?
Would you still believe that it was easier to do? Yeah
World ain't never been easy

Blackened the Sun,K.O.D.,2009.0,"(As the sun falls, darkness shall come)
I went out of my way, to do music for you!
I did shit with E-40, Scarface
Everybody, all your heroes, nigga, Yukmouth!
Modest shit! Now I'm 'bout to do it my way!
I don't give a fuck what y'all think about me!
Call me devil worshipper, nigga
You think that shit was bad? Listen to this, motherfucker!

How do I describe my pain?
It just rains and it brings at the same time flame
I am bane, insane in my veins
No restraints can chain or contain me, I'm dangerous
When I gave you my light it was wrong, wasn't right
And no love was in sight when I need it
So I run with the night and the songs that I write
It be vile and it won't be defeated
It's jet black in my brain
'Cause the hatred you gave me has turned me to twisted
You don't like this – suck my dick
All the kids with the sickness been waiting for this shit
I wanna get into the mind of your youngest
Fill it with fungus and grow it 'til it's humongous
Psycho alumnus, the tip of the tongue slit
Urging the punk bitch: Eat shit from your dump pit!

Everyone, are you ready for doom?
Because I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon
I bring gloom when I step in the room
With the fumes of a tomb I consume all the light in the day
Everyone, are you ready for doom?
Because I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon
I bring gloom when I step in the room
With the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away!

I've got this cloud inside, it's consuming my mind
All the brown in my eyes are dissolving
Into the whites of my eyes, now the night will arise
And I'm hyped 'cause the beast is evolving
Step into my dreams, lot of bleeding and semen and green rotted demons
And they feed their seeds collard greens
Full of feces and cheesed pieces of human cerebrum this evening
(Stay away) 'Cause everything I touch turns to mold!
(If you want me) Everything I fuck straight explodes!
Are we there yet? Are you scared yet?
You got a pussy in your pants, wanna share that?
Let me in, I'mma rip it then I'mma tear it out
I'm tryin' to eat a bitch, where her motherfucker hair at!?

Everyone, are you ready for doom?
Because I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon
I bring gloom when I step in the room
With the fumes of a tomb I consume all the light in the day
Everyone, are you ready for doom?
Because I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon
I bring gloom when I step in the room
With the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away!

Heat swells, details
Everybody eat nails, sleep well
Held a gun, I come to attack everyone
You little crumbs, all are done, I'mma blacken the sun
I'll banish it, damage it, can you manage to vanish?
Cut you like Anakin, manic man, damn it, and it's no panicking
When I eat your soul, he's north pole
That means I'mma be more cold, freeze more soul, 40 below
Piss, Lav, and Cuervo, plus habenero, now chug it!
Burn their head to their toes!
I will not spare those, I love it!
This is the result of you, thinking unclear, callin' me weird!
Thinking I'm a devil so you niggas don't cheer!
I don't give a fuck what you think of Tecca Nina this year!

Everyone, are you ready for doom?
Because I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon
I bring gloom when I step in the room
With the fumes of a tomb I consume all the light in the day
Everyone, are you ready for doom?
Because I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon
I bring gloom when I step in the room
With the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away!

She love she love me not
But I never real touchy lovey dovey for what he got
Suddenly kissy huggy what is for me the buddy slot
But they callin' me to put it right in the open it could be an ugly stop
She's lookin' to be caressed on the reg
Fetched on the reg, sex on the reg
Only Techs on the bread
With nothin' but busting percussion and checks on the head
As she huffin' and puffin' 'cause wasn't no Tech on the bed
And she don't like that Tech N9ne persona
Groupies more groupies 
for true they be juicy like John Bedushi
Like the one that do movies, man ay caramba
You google me I'm beyond the boobies and champaignya
Bumbaclot don't shrug me 'cause I'm the rapper
But again you fond of da slacker who's been on your love
Peace in your honor, 
just trusting can calm ya
She stoned now I'm home 
but she gon' love me mañana

Can't stand to hear my name or see my face
But every time she does she feels disgraced
But she gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

What kinda fan are you
Just because I expanded you ban a dude
Like I do soft musical Xanadu
But I'll be damn if you slander who Tech N9na
My crew cannibals ain't no fan of a true man
Who do a lot in a jam or two
Said I'm a sell out 'cause I worked with Wayne
First your brain needs work you hurt the game
Every lyric that we blurst put the earth to shame
How do we burst to fame if both of our verse the same
We supposed to be different,
 you know that we gifted
'Cause what we spit you know that we live it
We grow 'cause we vivid
You's a fair weather fan, your predictions will never stand
Like you know something better than when I'm chopping
Whatever man

I told my fans, that, I told them this years ago. I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech

I hear ya saying that I ain't the same
But in order to grow you know you got to change
But you gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

Here today but be gone when you blink an eye
Constant drinking got you thinking and you about cry
I was forsaken life taken can you feel the pain
Heart breakin' body shakin' can you stand the rain
I was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy
But now I'm gone just a portion of your memories
But in your memory 'member this vividly
There was no other villain from the hood real as me
From the soil none loyal like the B.I.G
Homie from the show me, hope that's how you 'member me
And we'll soon see I ain't got long to be
On this earth claiming turf running in these streets
I apologize homie look me in my eyes
Time to turn the page be a man and swallow pride
Too many homies died before I got to say my piece
So I just said my piece and hopin' that it brings us peace

Today is gone and I left this place
But I'll be the sun shining on your face
So just love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

Before you get on this bus there's a couple rules you need to follow:
Leave all your cell phones with me
There will be no Tweeting, no Facebooking
No playing the PlayStation, no Instagram, no YouTubing
Whatever happens on this bus, stays on this bus

Wassup? It's me, Caribou Lou again

Kansas City, fuckin' hooligan
If you think you cool and true Then doing the fool my friend
You'll begin boozing and choosing women that we do and do again
Only if they hold us, the secrets they crossing over
The beaches and often go, where we eating we rock and rollers
Deep in the thoughts we go, but no Tweetin' she lost her mobile
And geekin' because we showed her, freakin' across the globe
In the weekend we off in Boulder, Colorado
All my soldiers got a bottle
And some hoes with a wobble from sticky dough's you hella bobble
Head bitches they model and let's kick it Colorado's
A red district full of brothels and med fixes
Yo, we gotta hide, just see, we get no privacy
Why, would she ride, with me, tweet, and straight lie to me?
I don't know (What?) who, she sleeps with
But, all I know is: Don't you tweet this

Do what I told you, I told you, I told you
(Don't tweet this!)
Do what I told you, I told you, I told you

Baby I would hate to, kick it and then erase ya
Cause you wanna go to one of those social networks
And go state the facts about my nature I gave to see you later
(Oooooh) this bitch is shakin' the table
Pissed at me cause you wished it be
Listed with a Twit Pic sick at me
When ya missed it you scripted me
When I gotta move invisibly
You violate it, you fly away it
Simple cause I am stealth
Then formulate it, we tried to made it
Keep it to your damn self
Get our nudie on, quiet, we can truly bone
And I'll be pushing all yo buttons like movie phone
Act like you belong, creeping in my groovy home
Drinkin

Dippin' get me to drop some jizz on your lid maybe
We in Canada partying like some animals
Even my tour manager know that Tweetin' will vanish you
Tweet the day I go and say my party wasn't amateur

Please, grab all your needs, ya cannot leave, not a thing
Put away ya phone, Yahtzee!

Buckin' the bammer when I bust with a bang
And it ain't no clause that say fraud ain't no tall tales
Women love it when I hit when I covet the booty
They givin' it to me, but it ain’t no thang
We reppin' KCMO, fellas and the ladies know
That we coming with the killas, I'm with the gorillas
The villains that get ya when you disrespect us
Even the babies know, Tech Nina got crazy flow
We be givin' the women the willy we sick of the haters
Wanna pay us good to get this record
This is important, we be courtin' every place we go
Get you up in the room, and drippin' up wit' the groom
I give it to you any way you wanna have it
Baby is a horse and yes, of course, I'ma have to break the ho
Leavin' the kids at home, I wanna bone alone
We hoppin' up and down like jack rabbits
So many kids, put this on they daddies mind!
Never will I ever put 'em out there like that
Feelin' that I did Tecca Nina take it right back
Tellin' 'em that they mommy's boyfriend's Tech N9ne!
Don't be lookin' at me like you really wanna fight cat

Leave Me Alone,K.O.D.,2009.0,"Where I'm at right now..
I ain't got no tolerance for something stupid
Or hatred, or envy, if you bringing any one of those
How 'bout, leave me alone

They pray I'll free fall any day
Well I don't need y'all anyway
Negativity give me nay, you finna hear me say
Just leave me right here with my Henny, save my chicks and plenty pay
Your boy Tech done blown, an still rep the home
But now I just wanna be left alone
They wish death and my flesh and my chromosomes
Slept my songs, they need a little bit less Patron
And they holler, the weirdo! When I walk in the spot
The zeros pissed 'cause they ladies wanna swallow my gyro
They live in squalor and fear though
They daughter come here though, she know I keep plenty Robert De Niro
You punks'll never get to see me let a tear go
Started hatin' the second I busted a mere flow!
I just want you to get some gones, not near no
Negative energy that is a remedy, aiyyo listen here bro

Stay away from me, please stay far away from me
Leave me by my lonely, just let me be
Stay away from me, please stay far away from me
Leave me by my lonely, just leave me alone!

The hood don't play me huh?
Treat my Strange Music like rabies, huh?
They be saying Tech Nina, he crazy huh?
But you want me on your video and CD
You elementary rappers are straight remedial - A.D.D
I'm in my own world partner, and you don't fit there
All your Tech hatred has got you sounding like a bitch, playa
And this is to multiple haters and I swear it
Ain't about a pass homie, but if the shoe fit wear it nigga
It's a size N9ne, wanna step inside mine?
It'll feel like you died trying and you will know that I can't buy time
For you to catch Casper it's high time
You tried crimes against me 'cause you couldn't follow the guidelines
They say respect yo' elders! You best go tell the Lord
Forgive you 'cause what's next - your failure!
Just leave me where it's less your hell, brah
Invest your mail to something that sell
'Cause the Tech don't smell ya, Tech gon' tell ya

Stay away from me, please stay far away from me
Leave me by my lonely, just let me be
Stay away from me, please stay far away from me
Leave me by my lonely, just leave me alone!

Leave me singular, numero uno, ichiban
They want my doom and my funeral, psycho bitch be gone!
Losing my lithium quickly this chick done hit me don
And bit me on my finger, tell Trav to get me bond
'Cause if it happens again! If it happens AGAIN!!
I'ma - FFF- uh... boy!
I wish I had no problem with smacking a friend
With a gat for snapping a chin
But I got chicks that wanna get it in, fo' sure
I'm taking all the crazy hoes outta my lady mode
I'm done with the oldies, nothing but new shit in my radio
Leave me solitary 'cause the way she go is shady though
It's later for their ego, no more Tech N9ne, let the baby know
All of you need to try clit, and straight deny dick!
Leave us alone 'cause you're mentally damaged, no try sick
I wish I wasn't a star and the gentleman would die quick
So next time you tripping, I'll flip and hit you in yo' eyes, bitch!

Stay away from me, please stay far away from me
Leave me by my lonely, just let me be

Girl: You wanna get high?
Tech: What you got?
Girl: Whatever
Tech: Let's do it
Girl: You feel it yet?
Tech: Yeah... (yeah... yeah...)

Fall into a spell way deeper than hell
Sensation was given to me from my homegirl Chelle
She told me since I was in pain and I like to rebel
This Motorola I'm givin' you will suit you real well
Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes, feelin' funny
Butterflies, my eyes dilate another size
Overwhelming sense of love, got these nuts so sprung
Walk up to a stranger baby: ""Can I suck your tongue?""
Tinglin' baby got me feelin' like minglin' baby
This is a hella higher learnin' than Singleton, baby
One minute I'm cold, next one I'm heat
Give me some, Big Red so I don't grind my teeth
This is deep
I take another one and another one
And another one, uh-oh, here comes the other one
I'm simulated man, I'm hella blown away
And all my problems that I had've all gone away
I pop another pill and I'ma take a sip of Caribou to wash it down
You thinkin' I'ma overdose I never had a moment that'll turn a nigga 'round
I really wanna give you what I got under my dickies in the bed I wanna start
I feel I wanna fuck you but my dick is really numb and I don't see me gettin' hard
She told me ""Take this cap' of GHB
With a gulp of Mountain Dew with glee""
So I could possibly end my existence
GHB, ain't no need for resistance
Ecstasy
, yeah!

Ecstasy (I love you very much)
GHB (I love you very much)
Shrooms and weed (I love you very much)
This is the Tech N9ne experience
A-C-I-D (I love you very much)
PCP (I love you very much)
Caribou-Lee (I love you very much)
This is the Tech N9ne experience

I'm on five pills and a cap of date rape
One Caribou Lou and it ain't even late, great
I feel good, let's go to the ex house
That's where Heather and Marty got everybody x'ed out
Walkin' the crib, my homegirl say Tech's with me
'Cause she know all the bitches wanna get next to me
I'm a star and ladies wanna have sex with me
But the bitches still get jealous off of ecstasy
It's like thirty people in the house
Rave bitches, massage and glow sticks in the mouth
I take another cap of G with my Mountain Dew
I'm higher than the top floor of the Fountain Blue
Somebody said they got the chronic, light it up, man
Let's smoke it all 'til we fall then get up again
I wanna fuck but I'm numb 'cause I'm fizzled up
Skip to the Lou, I tried to piss, dick is shriveled up
My nigga Kutt got the blunt, nigga pass it
I didn't even know you was here
So he passed it with a couple hits of acid
Like I refuse to stay alive
It's pills and mo' thrills, I'm lucky if I survive
I'm high!

Ecstasy (I love you very much)
GHB (I love you very much)
Shrooms and weed (I love you very much)

Caribou-Lee (I love you very much)
This is the Tech N9ne experience

Dipped out the ex house, it's right around two
Off to Westport to kick it with the Hurricane Crew
Saw my niggas C and G after party at the room
My homegirl Aiesha slipped me a couple grams of shrooms
Damn, it don't stop, Embassy suites, three o'clock
With my niggas C and G, they got hella G and E
I get two more hits of that ecstasy shit
I don't wanna come down off that ecstasy trip
Bitches in the room lookin' so fresh so clean
A couple hella high panties and bra, no jeans
My nigga said that he got codeine
Mixed it with cherry Robitussin and juice
I took a sip of his lean
In the bathroom to bust a shit
I couldn't do it so my bitch came to suck the dick
It was hard and soft but hard enough to penetrate the slit
'Bout twenty minutes, damn near fainted when it was time to spit
Five o'clock in the morning and we still zoned
Seven o'clock in the morning pill is still on
This life I live, I might not die
If let 'lone, love my experience
This is my fucked up life, don't try this at home
Yeah!

Paint a Dark Picture,Killer,2008.0,"Man lives in a sunlit world of what he believes to be reality
But there is unseen by most an underworld that is just as real
But not as brightly lit... a dark side

(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away
(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today
(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away
(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away

I don't really give a fuck of what you think of me, I had it up to here, yep
Follow me into another dimension of insanity's right here, step
I know you're feelin' I'm lovin' you
When I'm kissin' and fuckin' you, in a minute I'ma veer, left
And by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover
And then I finish when you're near death
I'm sorry, but I mean it
'Cause when I got to chewing on the bitch I got bulimic
Up in her like a gynecologist, with a penis
And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish
Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of, I really rely
On the feeling of the sex and the red of a woman
Can I take a bite of your cerebellum?
I think it'll really get me up if I could be sucking your serotonin
I'd rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trust in me
Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me and mocked me and fucked with me
Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and make 'em panic at the disco
Kcuf uoy, fi slived era, tahw uoy pihsrow
I can paint a dark picture
You don't want me to start with ya
Don't want me comin' up with the heart, hit ya
Chew you up and if you really tart, spit ya
After the brain, I put the lemon moraine in
Blood of a dame, is what I drain my fangs in
Takin' the spirit and then the body it came in
Away from the sun and forever you can remain in

(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away
(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today
(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away
(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away
(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away
(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today
(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away
(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away

When I'm all up on a pallet o pain
With blood of my name, in vain sun up in it
I'ma break it down the walls
And try to stop me from poppin' my gun up in it
Skits onta me honor me for the time
Never given to the rhyme in another mind lookin' like a nice guy
Behind the face be the beast of another motherfucker that be heard the least
So many hear me when I say they can
That I remember everybody that laid me astray, yo fuck 'em
Nobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away. yo fuck 'em
I'm to sick that I never checked outta my mental-ward working in Sweden
Burying the bodies, this song made my memory feed 'em
Ghost made me loud and I'm proud I can see them
I don't even wanna talk about it
But I do it for the demons and the devils alive
Hopin' that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time
When I make a move when I'm comin' through I'm a stay devoted to rhyme
Devoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked I'm a be forever de-dine
Picture this my wrist silt pissed off I'm hangin' from a meat hook
Yo I'm bangin' on a meat hook it's the twist
This chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a main hook book
I'm tellin' everybody I'm not doin' so well
I'm feelin' my noggin to you better watch ya self
Sub-noise when I'm bangin' on a tech set
Best believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse everything

(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away
(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today
(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away
(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away
(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away
(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today
(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away
(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away

I'm your worst fear, I'm your favorite
I'm your acquired taste, will you savor it?
If it's blood thirst, will you run from it?
No need 'cause I'm inside of you, when the sun is lit
You cannot escape me, I'm your last resort
When you have an eager, you cannot report
I am the void of sunshine, malicious, vain and heartless
If ever you need an alibi, rely on me, I am

Disparagement,N9NA,2019.0,"You can't stop what's divine, no
So why in the hell are you trying for
The Cayenne flow got you dying slow
'Cause my info got the Zion glow
They don't like seeing Tecca the N9ne go

They said I'm evil
They said I'm totally demon in my cerebral
They callin' me criminal, comin' to curse a cathedral
To punish the positive, opposin' the peace of the people
They said I'm a dreamer, and not a good singer
That'll never get bread and no kind of Heaven'll bring ya
When I lessen the N9na
Oppressin' the Tech and left in the ringer
'Cause I am the effin' best with the lingua
Calling me failure when you know Tech is a choppin' impaler
It's funny when you rolling, they come and try to derail ya
The tale fell to hell bruh
Nothing you tell her is stopping me when I nail her
She loving the delta
The hate gon' show but the faith gon' grow
'Cause I am a winner and gonna make strong dough
When I take on flow, when the pace don't slow
It's comedy saying that Aaron Yates won't blow
(Yates won't blow, Yates won't blow
Yates won't blow, Yates won't blow)
You did this, how you live with the stupidness
Knowing when I get loose, it get lucrative
Who can sit through this and boo 'cause it blew to bits
Doofus is not a muse, it's a duplicate
Riddle me, riddle me, yo why does a little league
In second fiddle belittle me when it'll be literally
Killa B's on the milla spree to drill 'em and filler flee
Ain't no illa G, reala B, the skill is agility

When they be itching to down ya
Throwing the hate all around ya
To all the people that clown ya
But not a sound when they come encounter
A real one, they don't feel none
Swear you're sitting on just little crumbs
When you really making multi-millions
When they say you lost it, but the deal's done

Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement
Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement
Yeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment
Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement
Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement
Yeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment

It's crazy what haters say when creating a narrative
I will flatten 'em all like they ain’t put no air in it
Media maybe is airing it and made a few errors
It doesn't matter, money’s made and many take and are sharing it
Nobody's thinking about the way that they carry us, they are precarious
Fallin' like the angel that flared up and hated comparisons
When I think about native Americans being named by some terrorists
I ain’t say it in Arabic homie!
I figured I could make it apparent like babies in carriages, but this ain't related to marriages
When I say I'm separated from a lady that merited liberty later that buried it and made me a heretic
They are taking our heritage to the grave
Innocent but say we're nefarious, now we hang
But them people are fake as a fairy is on the gang
Put a target on their face then I can 'em like it’s a bang (ugh)
They ain't prepared for this, I made it so there it is
So they throw the shade in areas grayer than Meredith
Tuck a .50 for the shade like Anastasia, I'm airing it out 'cause
Living nowadays man it be stranger than Aaron is
They paint you in this light and try to make you a derelict
Grammys ain't giving any love to Strange and I'm very sick
'Cause N9na's on the throne but then he say I'm heir to it
Fake ish won't fly like a cape with a tear in it
Demons swinging low not at your face, call them sweet chariots
You know how many people that grew up and they don't say what their parents did?
Good could’ve been that, but it could’ve been bad, so your beliefs be careful with
I'm sitting in the nuthouse looking at my freaking therapist like

Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement
Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement
Yeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment
Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement
Yeah yeah, this is called disparagement

I Get It Now,The Storm,2016.0,"Industry does not, feel you
I'm sick of this shit
Blind bitches wish
N9ne's wickedness away

Motherfuckin' killer B
There's about to become a distillery
The majority don't really feel a G
With the paint and a dark soliloquy
Music, they said killed the fee
Me, Krizz, and Makzilla free
So I'm gonna have to keep it real with me
Fuck them straight with agility
They callin' me crazy
Don't wanna play me
So I make the music that will target their babies
And open 'em up to wicked shit
They wanna know how hip is this
This never been no hipster shit
So the fakers see me and dis the 'fit
I ain't cool like the late great Biggie Smalls, the illest
So I went the route of a killer clown comin' to pillage a village
Steady tryin' to get 'em all to feel it
But I learned you can't please everybody
When my mother was livin' they used to say ""your son is scary Maudie""
I don't give a flyin', dyin'
Spy inside of al-Qaeda, they lyin'
When tryin' to diss Tech N9ne
And when they all shall buy us
I don't fit the part for main stream cause I'm rougher
Only time they wanna look like me is Halloween motherfucker
I realize I'm not inviting

You ain't with it
Sit it down
I'm a vicious
Wicked clown
And I'm livid when the critics give us frowns
Trippin' with this nigga's sound
Yup, I get it now
Get it, me and you, we are not the same
We unequal and the people is to blame, get it?
I get it now
I guess I got the wrong pants on
And I don't really make no dance songs, get it?
I get it now

Y'all can't tell I'm fuckin' myself up more and more on purpose?
I love scarin' the hell out of y'all, haha

Stick the masses, racket off in the casket
Sound like they wrist broken like put the fuckin' lotion in the basket
How is he livin' lavish when he rap really fast and he mask it?
They don't get it when I gas it
They laugh at it, mad it ain't ratchet
They wanna wear clothes just like A$AP Rocky, like Yeezy and Drake
That's what they identify with, not with a nigga with the clown paint on his face
I get it that I'm wicked
When I spit it they be comin' to get 'em a ticket
Talk a lot of shit at the gate and they got to zip it
When I'm bustin', they open up to somethin' different and dig it
I get it, I never looked like the average black dude
Track shoes, gold teeth, and covered in tattoos
Yak, booze, reeking and chiefing the sack through
Speakin' about reaching them hardened hat screws
Jack move
Yes, I've become a big boss
But I'll never be cool as Rick Ross
That's okay, N9ne's been rhyming
And now he's shining
Perfect timing

You ain't with it
Sit it down
I'm a vicious
Wicked clown
And I'm livid when the critics give us frowns
Trippin' with this nigga's sound
Yup, I get it now
Get it, me and you, we are not the same
We unequal and the people is to blame, get it?
I get it now
I guess I got the wrong pants on
And I don't really make no dance songs, get it?
I get it now

So what I've come to realize is I will never fit in
So it's my duty to make sure that I stand the fuck out
Meht etinu lliw eh esuac' ,meht sthgif reven eh yhw s'taht ,meht ekil gnihton s'eH

Do y'all realize what y'all done did? (Hihi)
Y'all done opened up a can of sick-ass
And I'm about to eat y'all quick-fast, hey

I've been hibernatin' in the deepest darkest part of Necropolis
Now that I'm poppin' it's top, yes I'm the opposite of monogamous
Ménage, I get awkward in this box a bit
Hostile, it's gotta get twist in a knot with this apocolypse
Holla it (Tech-Tech N9ne-N9ne shit, I'm lovin' it)
I'm a drug to this grudge of his, rip my covenant, I'll plug a bitch
Lovin' this mug is what the ruckus is, psycho thug with it
Fallin' down like Michael Douglas with the ruggishness
What did I mean, they wonderin' why did I bring this side of my dream?
The Nina's a horror machine, dollar for dollar, I balla for all of my green
Nigga, my name is Inigo Montoya, I got an evil plan for ya
And you're about to get dropped, this box is worse than Pandora
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
They're all gonna laugh at you, 'cause I had to do what I had to do
When tappin' you like Shabba Doo
Beatin' 'em up and shootin' 'em up then stab a few
Sad ya knew that you had your crew and they ass are through
I'm killin' em, throwin' 'em back at you

See once they open my lid I'mma give it to 'em
Ever since I was a lil bitty kid I've been truly ruined
I reflected on what I did 'fore I ran into 'em
I used to be a fat jerk now I flirt 'cause the scent of a woman
Now I don't act like, walk like, the nigga that you used to know
Now I sing and rap about the strange life, it's beautiful
Tell it to 'em like a Geni-u-s, spit it out like I thought you knew
Bubblin', hope you hear me fizz, prayin' to God I make it through
Kali Baby, check my strange box of tricks
Calico alley cat, lyrical, watch his lips
He can go really fast, slow it down and stop that shit
Or make it dumb to make sure you niggas got that shit
I'm just playin' with music, I'm the elite heat speech chief
Play me and watch they feet turn Beat Street
'Cause I'm blowin' out they socks, The Freddie Foxxx of my block
There's somethin' strange goin' on in that box, Kali Baby!

Off of this here we go I get it in

Figure this, I'mma get venomous takin' out ten of us
Niggas is sweet like cinnamon, wait, but then again
I'mma pick up the pen again, bit 'em in half, blood bath
Then I'mma laugh, then I'mma smash
Then I'mma ash, then I'mma blast first
Then I'mma send him his ending, cut 'im up
Fuckin him up the rectum, I dissect the man
I'mma try to eat the neck and hand
Slice him up like a Mexican
Seconds in his body is fricassee shit is bleedin', you should see him or you can be him
I got dead human beings in the freezer, I'm a believer
I ain't no Wally Cleaver but I carry a meat cleaver
I speek geek to people, I'm lethal, a little strange
I eat it with Cream of Wheat and some butter that's mixed with brains

Where it's at then? (
Mm-mm

Nigga fuck you! (
Gunshots

Ahhh! Ahhhhhh!
Bitch ass nigga

I open my mouth and what comes out is dangerous angel dust
Mix it up with cocaine and just kill yourself in Los Angeles
Niggas lost and jealous, couple tossed umbrellas
Too hot and plus 45's is cocked, blazing 'til we in clouds with Pac
Not to mention these federal penitentiaries
Locking all of my niggas up, giving 'em half a century
So the day they get out with Alzheimer's, they won't remember me
And everything they did before 20 is faded memories

Hated enemies ready to finish me
Government wanna limit these men with G's
Spin 'em, put 'em in a key
Then it's me beginning this chemistry
I am tangled cause living, it's got a man strangled
It's fandagled, hand me a plan from a damn angel

Angels in my city get it gritty, rioting off Henny
In clubs they act fast, packing, they gats got plenty
When you in my streets, better open your fucking eyes
Niggas in front wanna take you down, in back wanna break your spine

Stain inside broken glass, and to forget it all
We grab a bitch and poke her fast, walk her out holding ass
Anything for that Lambo, in years of holding cash
Spend it on a couple strippers and forget to hold the gas

Gas is high, but it ain't like me, I'm past the sky
You'd ask us why, we emotional and have to cry
Cause the cash is my way that I'm gonna last or die
But when they classify me as bad in the masses' eye
Dare

Dare you to go through all this sickness
Need a minute, come to my senses
On block they pose, throw 'em to the dogs
Pitbulls then they place all bets in
Often I cop, often I fight bitches
Launder they thoughts, launder them leave stitches
Street vicious micro missions
Still play the game with the end in a vision
Might

Tech, Angel & Game

That’s My Kid,Something Else,2013.0,"If my kid has a problem
It's up to me as the guardian to go solve 'em
Make my life and involve 'em
Late at night when I call 'em
I like to hear 'em say daddy your song is awesome
Instead of gangbangers in school won't let up
I'm fed up I'm wondering if you can come up and red up
You shut up, negativity can be found inside of my angels
Even though I was stupid but I put it down
Set trippin' - But I let it go headed for energetic flow
When I'm up to know that I was down and out
But now I'm breaded though
I know you saw me rep colors when I was young, dumb and malicious
I'm thankful, that all my blemishes never made you suspicious
Latched on to light
That's known to hype apparent you coherent knowing I rapped wrong to right
Love and positivity instilled in my kid
Their family my family their mother and I did
Discipline starts at home even if they can't stand you
Watch em' fights land, you clock em' right hand
To stop em' that a man if you stand up even add a camera
They won't be James Holmes,
 
and they won't be Adam Lanza
Or John Malvo,
 I'll flow loud for my child though
Ain't raising no groucho evil out my house yo
Instead of me watching em' disappear in the night
Air em' at graduation saying that's my kid right there

I proudly proclaim my love
The future's born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters this time
So my prayer is that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

To my unborn I give my all so you could ball like I couldn't
Stay in school and play it smooth and do those things that I wouldn't
Pay attention and keep your distance from ignorant instances
Play a instrument anything that you want just envision it
Follow your dreams, no matter what may come or what may fall
Cuz' ain't no shame in failing as long as you know you gave your all
Staned up, man up, get a handle on yourself tighten your belt
Do what you can to do for you and ya'll just don't, do it for the wealth that they offer
It sounds awful but if me and your mama' ain't talking
And she said that I ain't offering a call just as often as I should
I pray that you get older and you understand that I was just, doing what I could
If she let me, if you have a second I could explain
Like so many transitions in life that people change
Whether I'm on top soil, or dead in a box
I love you dearly sincerely and that'll never stop
For my kid...
For my kid...

I proudly proclaim my love
The future's born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters this time
So my prayer is that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

Paris and Darius Dariana Unique Oshay Malik
And one on the way in a matter of weeks
But it's a shame cuz' I think that my other daughter ain't mine
Andria baby I love you I guess your father was blind
In due time you'll understand it, how your mama' was scandelous,
(Wait this don't seem right man, I don't think I can handle it,)
When I all I ever did was show love for you
Sweated blood for you, any moment take a slug for you
But its cool, the baby mama drama is expected
And that karma is going to be what I been blessed with
Sit back and learn your lessons as our seeds grow from kids to adolescence
Then resent you for yourself as misdirection
The first to heed the message is Malik
Abandonded by his mama' on Thanksgiving evening
Bout' three years ago was up to me to feed to em morals
Values manhood, knowledge a week ago he graduated
You ask me, then Ima' say

I proudly proclaim my love
The future's born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters this time
So my prayer is that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine
[Outro: Tech N9ne & 
little girl

Pay attention to your children
They shouldn't be able to be into too much that you're not aware of
Together we are a powerful force
As one mind, body and soul
Let no evil enter nor attempt
To reduce us because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love combined with our strength
We ward off pain and stress

Strange days have found us

Strange days have tracked us down
(Nowhere to run, what I did is keep it wicked real and never to pretend)
They're going to destroy

Our casual joys
(I'mma take away your everything, I'mma merk it a bit when I begin)
We shall go on playing
Or find a new town
Yeah!

In the beginning it was negative wasn’t nobody checkin'
Or steppin' to this heavenly sick brethren, it's
Tech's veteran, better than clever man
You're gonna be off of your rocker when the chakra's on chopper, it's
Kinda funny having no money coming up
The number-one independent rapper, people running up
When the fact I'mma sum it up, way way back I was run amuck
Now I'm beastin' the nation, cheese generatin'
Now everybody know when the flame sprays
Fame pays, maintain brain crazed
Leaving them all leaking in pain, hey gang, wait
Get ready for Strange days

I told them I was gonna ball for y'all
Did it all, they didn't wanna get involved at all, yeah
They said that I was gonna fall, but now I'm walking tall
They all saw wicked raw a stud yeah
Everybody will applaud the odd lyrical god
The fraud better kneel before Zod, yeah
Never ever will I dissolve, I'm a hog in the dark
So when they call, I'mma maul and claw, yeah
Wanna hate me, industry gotta face me
They be shaky, ladies say we may be the crazies
They hella Gacy, John Wayne the case be
The industry fake, soft and sweet like pastry
Look at all these mentions
Look at all this uber attention
'Member everybody saying that I wasn't gonna make it
But the Tecca Nina kept on inchin'
This ain't no dang phase
Never will my reign fade
On the come up and a one up on 'em
Man, it feels good to finally see Strange praised

Strange days have found us
(This is the trip)
And through their strange hours
We linger alone

Strangeulation IV,Strangeulation,2014.0,"I am, too hot to cool off
Blew Atlanta up like Eric Rudolph, and starving in pursuit of moolah
Floss and get your crew robbed, my crew'll shoot at you like ""hoorah""
I be on tour and shit, you get on stage and you get boo'd off
You throwing jabs at me but we ain't in no boxing gym
I'll stab you and have you inside of a hospital hooked up to oxygen
So who the hottest? Conversation my name get brought up in
I'm Woody Harrelson, this industry is Zombieland
You wanna fuck with us, you must've had no common sense
I'll kill you then your guts get eaten up by Brotha Lynch
It's Strange Music so the competition nonexistent
All them other record labels fallin' off like rotten limbs
I'm making some money, it's making their stomach cringe
I'll never forget it, a couple of summers ago, I was cooking and scrubbing pans
Drink 'till I get drunk and spin
Puffing something with a lovely scent behind the Cutlass tint
Floating in the Strange stream, who jumpin' in?

My brain is full of thoughts that are darker than Samhain
That span across the Great Lakes and vast Midwest Plains
Spreading coast to coast like a virus you can't contain
Now a global pandemic, panic courtesy of (STRANGE!)
The biggest independent label, pop the champagne
We don't need no head now, homie you can keep the change
Coming through your speakers, receive us into your blood vein
We the truth like Nostradamus' prophecy quatrains
Snake Bat, Praise that, part of rap since way back
Since the days of 8 tracks and 808's and adaps
Analog cassette decks, steady grinding, what's next?
Starving artist 'til Trav and Tech cut me that advanced check
Strange outcast step child, call me Damien
Five Finger Death Punch straight to the cranium
Flow so sick, could be enriched with uranium
Extraterrestrial, lyrics labeled alien

Appetite destruction, never been no punk shit
My voices give me choices, just to spite me I choose dumb shit
Choppers all around me, I mean lyrical and literal
Spit it through this microphone and pull up at ya mami's home
Jump out on the dumb shit, speaking through this drum clip
Tearin' flesh, rippin' hips, watch me kill shit
Cypher without the villain, that's appealin' but it's silly though
An army without it's general, an octopi no tentacles
Not trying to be subliminal, nothing I do is minimal
Heavy hitter, heavy words, push a nigga, pushin' verbs
Squish my button, you push my nerves, ten toes in the turf
Not the last or the first, gutta nigga, stomp the Earth
Grippin' metal, I ain't special, on the level
Smack your temple with the barrel, not complying, I'm a rebel
And I'm fresh up out the ghetto, puppet master, I'm Geppetto
Take a minute, you'll get it, nigga, Scoob did it

Kali Baby! 'Ight man, I'mma do this! I'm kinda nervous
The purpose of having a cypher is so you can sit here
Wide-eyed, listen, look at me in this position
Now, I coulda just left you sitting there
But Nina told me to pick 'em apart, you're a victim of art
K-R-I to the double crooked, look at him
He pudgy like they took a ugly stick and frickin' shook at him
And I don't stay Gucci down to the linens
I'll let you trick off, she jerking my dick off and grinnin'
You can see him, but he just a figment
You wanna be him, better get your pigment gone
Try to beat him with deliverin'
I get belligerent and that's the end of the song
And I get a little bit ahead of myself, feel like I'mma melt
And I feel like I'm better than everyone else
I guess I be rappin' ahead of my wealth
I'm the coldest thing since the ice cube
Only thing missing from this beat back in the day was Ice Cube
Yeah, I said I'm the best in a minute, nigga what?!
Only niggas that could contest it is rested, dig em up!

Darkness on my quest to find the light

A sense of hope walks with me

Still I hold onto this dream of a scarless heart and a spiteless mind
No longer shall I try to find a name-less ghost nor provide
A shelter for my demons

Demons, there's so many I smell brimstone
Come in through family, I'm seein' all of the sin shown
Kin grown into enemies, then it be your friends gone
Ain't you very lonely, but a sanctuary when grim's home
Got rules but I dig it, God knows that I'm wicked
Or does it, cause when I tug it, it never shows that I visit
Tell the judge, y'all make me feel like it's hella love
So stand out amazed when I let loose on my Beelzebubs
My spirit needs jumper cables, never know love but I want ya label
I'm comfort-able
Nothing lately makes me feel like they worthy of trustin'

Shelter for my demons ...to hide

I'm, cool with the trauma now
Cause it's abundant, ever since I laid my mama down
Some members talked me so bad, 'til my persona found
No mercy, go earthly, cock and make the llama sound
Cause that's the language they know, deep in anguish they grow
To people without rules, and make you doubt who's
Gonna love you forever cause they gave you some hateful mouth ooze
I was so effin true, but I became the person to shout to
Now that I'm lonely, I don't give no Pho like Laos food
And I'm such a meanie, wanna come and see me? Reroute dudes
I'm chillin' in hell in hot water sittin' on my couch fools
So it ain't no problem walkin' through yo hell in my house shoes

I find a certain comfort in searchin' through the
Darkness on my quest to find the light
And as I'm digging through the ruins, that line these city streets

Feedin' you N9na ever since the money was allocated
From T.O.G. and every time I drop people salivated
Venomous vernacular is very vicious and validated
By many people but to the fuckin' foolish my style is hated
Ain't that a panini that's mad at a weenie
The stabbin' and jabbin' rappin', cappin' as bad as cabrini?
I'm one of the critical ones
Fiendin' for fire foul and formidable from pitiful slums
But I got up and served these suckas my syllables some
Roadrunna, this MO gunna's a flow stunna
When he get chose by the hoes, none of the clothes on her
Lovin' the soul of a rogue and they want the dough from a
Platinum and gold negro under one O's number
I'm hand pickin' 'em, clarity and the quick in 'em
Stick with the fam', thicker than rarity, never different than
A chariot with it flickerin', flame I hold like Olympian
But the kicker been, I really can't tell if anyone's even listenin'

Tell me I ain't got it, you fakin', lyin', hallucinatin'
You get a vibe but do hide your feelings, you tryin' to escape 'em
To the rudimentary, it's too Da Vinci for you to take in
Hopin' that if I do fall, eventually parachute gon' cave in (Woo)
Foolish envy, with whom am I miscommunicatin'? (Uh)
Claimin' like I ain't one of the illest, you get a rude awakenin'
Seen this side of me  and then sat in silence recuperatin'
If you looking to do some hatin', figure no use in waitin'
I'm bored, important spoils of my sport
Cyborg at war winnin', willin' to die for it
On my Thor shit, floor spins, spin in a time warp
My portion short, then I kill and fill my fork (Hell yeah)
Table-tippin', the energy got the cable glitchin'
Enter the Matrix, when I'm blazing, bitch I be Agent Smith
And shit go shiftin' back and forth over, it ain't no game of tennis
Takin' human form when I'm morphin', homie like wait a minute

Baton like Rouge and kill everything like Rittz while foes are on

Please believe it like Ripley
I'm gunnin' like when you quote it wrong
Rockin' o's like I'm Jovi Bon
Got the force, call me Solo Han
I'm the war to you whores, I'm the dinosaur steppin' on your lawn
Anybody wanna try to keep up with the killer
I don't even want him gone
Sick enough to go toe to toe with a crook, someone calling ya
""And that nigga's from Omaha?""
Told you all that Iso's a god, bitch, it is like I switched dimensions
And photo bombed Kotal Kahn
Holy moly, what's goin' on?
With a bat leave 'em Mortal Kom'
Open portals when I flow and producers call me Polow da Don
Tech finna soundin' effortless, rhymin' better than most of y'all
You're like designer, yes, I be flyer even when clothes are off
Who do I catch now?
Gotta catch 'em all like a Pokeball
Better follow the protocol, listen homie I told you all that

Next bout, you stretched out, we test clout when in yo' town
Ex'd out, full of debt doubt cause the best house we hold ground!
Better run now, don't come around my way
Gonna be dumbfound when the gun sounds cause sun down is my day
Meaning I don't sleep, but yo food yes I'm gon' eat, alone peep
Anybody tryna get the grown seat better gone, it's gonna be a long week!
(Rah, rah, rah!) That's what they talkin' a lot of em bumpin' they chops
But they can never compare to the winner, they simply be giving me something to knock
I slay wack, just play back my hits
So you better stay back on this great track cause I made that my bitch!
You wantin' this, I'm on a mission too
So you ain't gonna get what you wanna get, this one I'm kickin' through
Hit they mama, quit the trauma, hid dishonor gets to shoot
If you want a bitch, a ton of shit cause I'ma hit your crew
Bout to knock you out yo' skin, go in body, then I'ma go chin
Place yo' bet, you gonna hate the Tech
Cause I'ma break yo' neck, we ain't no kin
Dreams and hopes will be broken when that flow spin
I'ma fo' sho' sin, level headed when the rebel get it
Heavy metal fetish when I go in!

War paint on my mean mug
Accolades, I got dumb clout

With mo anger, that's no-brainer
So y'all niggas better run routes!

I'm coming for Sun's crown
When I hit him he done after one count
Yeah I'm living, I love it, my lungs loud
When I come from the scrummage
The scrimmage, I did it, I done it like what now
We could put up some butter and do it no stutter
But put up or shut up your bum mouth!
Now it's your move, took a chump out, I'm so old school
Yeah, say hi to my little friend
Kill 'em with the pen, make the dynamite go boom!
Talk about big balling, and it may seem like I'm stalling
When I'm staring outta that wall and
Bombing like Babe Ruth when I call it
Yes y'all it, and my bet's all in, heck nah, never let y'all win
In the game, everything a test to check
To see who can really hang like a net, all in
Come and train with the Ces, yeah
It's no thing little bunny, I can bang with the best in the biz
You better be saving all of your breath for the gym
Gotta run until there ain't nothin' left in the lid bruh, let's get it in
You heard me, chewed 'em up, I'm done early
Suited up in my jersey, feelin' like who or what can come serve me
Y'all too corrupt to come prove to us your kung-fu
You suck, you're unworthy, 
dirty like Harry makin' my day
Tell 'em I come to slay when I play, break!

Killer and I'm dealin' 'em, I'm wavy
Sinner in the center of a stadium, ya numb
And now I go gorilla for real, uh, fuck I'm off the wall for real, uh
And I'm an inaudible offense as often as needed
Y'all slower than molasses, 
run screen passes, Weeden
Ya get hit with a blitz, boy
Just for thinkin' that they couldn't catch this
And when I run a muck, I'm puttin' numbers up
Go and take you a look at my stats bitch
My contract's got no cap, and the money is under the mattress
I stay high like A.I, what the fuck are we talkin' bout, practice?

Cult Leader,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"In this house there is no room for envy!
This is why we wear uniform!
Racists, not welcome!
Rapists, not welcome!
Hatred, dreaded in this house!
Ready to fight hatred with love?
Join us!

If you come with me then I can show you
Where we'll take you, where you dare not go to
Follow me and let my mind control you
We'll rebuild this world that will destroy you

How many wanna go? How many wanna know?
How to fight demons when the planet is gonna blow
A lot of ammunition gotta be packing a lot of dough
Being together and it is wonderful
A gun was loaded, one exploded
Speaking evil with the tongue he just folded
From the Tech soldier, some get blessed over
Bums they come from straight under get swole
I told ya, that I would die for my loved ones
Kill for my blood ones, beside a cousin
Together when the evil does come
I question are you willing to plug one
Protection is one thing you need
To battle any animal coming with greed
If evil try to penetrate us and feed
Simple mathematics, demon you bleed
I know this comes off violent but this fight's for love
It should not be this way but evil drew first blood
Put the roman numeral nine on your inside
Right wrist, so I can read it properly like this
That's how we know we together within the crisis
And you don't need a lot of your money to buy this
Stay with me in the darkness when the light hits
I will promise your family low prices
A better war for boys and girls
Might get a little dark and dirty before we get to the brightness

If you come with me then I can show you
Where we'll take you, where you dare not go to
Follow me and let my mind control you
We'll rebuild this world that will destroy you

The red is for the blood we all shed fighting
The black is for the nights we fight with no lighting
The white is for the clouds from which we came flying
Landing in this jam with man and then began dying
We slegna see dread through these retinas
We beg to be swept up by the blessed head inspector
But all these hecklers don't respect the way we lecture ya
Get next to ya, that's when the Tech get flexed in a watup who's next with us
If I happen to die at the end of my run
Please give all of my note books and guns to my son
When the smoke clears I hope there's some folks near
To vote me as the pope here, not quote fear is not a condition and no tears
The new color is black clothes black boots and strings
I'm gonna show these nonbelievers what mass lab producing means

If you come with me then I can show you
Where we'll take you, where you dare not go to
Follow me and let my mind control you
We'll rebuild this world that will destroy you

That's right!
There are people right outside these doors
That actually would attempt to be our oppositions
Simply, because of the love we have for each other!
The love! Ain't that something?
We still have our daily jobs, we still pay our taxes, right?
Some of y'all ain't paid your taxes but we workin' on it right?
So what do you think the problem is?
That we all dress alike? That's petty that couldn't be it
That we helped those in any kind of trouble
That's supposed to be a good Samaritan, right?
Then evil is why we have friction!
And what do we do to evil?

But fuck being anything else (Made me)
The animal that I became to be
That'll go really insane with these
Wicked ideas in front of the people
Without being nervous
They loving the killa they came to see
Even though he's fucked up mentally
Back in the day I was down
I was nothin' but tough luck sent to me
Talking to myself and I learned to talk backwards, tihs
Took that thing and I put it in a raw rap verse (Ah)
It worked, it's perks (But?) It hurts (What?) It irks
Flyin' but I'm sickened
'Cause the crazy things I'm thinkin'
Got you sleepin' in a hearse
My brain is cursed
Closed in this hell but my soul isn't stale
Isn't failed, so sinister, got a ghost in the shell
Why did it fit so perfect when I was young?
I didn't cry when it hit me like

I caught crazy
And I plan on keepin' that shit

Catch it then you're very grim like no
Other motherfucker, just rap to win, you bury them, die though
They gonna have to pack him and then carry him, aigh' bro?
Killed him 'cause I'm an African American Psycho (C'mon!)
I was born this way
And a star was born that day
Crazy and I love it
Embracing my loco
Saving my life and I'm sharp as a knife when I'm rippin' and letting my flow go
Keeping it 'til I die, but my music's forever gonna fly
And I'm thankful that I caught it like

When you're pornographic and the Kirk spray out
On a workday couch and divert they spouse at the house
My residue on her birthday blouse

Sound like y'all disregarded what Biggie and Pac brung in
But me, I been rippin' shows, havin' the thots summoned
When I took my dick out of the equation

Blur,Klusterfuk,2012.0,"Bad day with my bitches, negativity on my phone is ridiculous
Limo shine up on 
TheRealTechN9ne
They talkin' 'bout me on the Sickness
Comin' at a nigga so vicious
Get up out of my bed, I'm sick of feelin' restricted
Fans sayin' I switched,
 they can tell I was hurt by lookin' at my Twit pic
Got a call from Stevie, y'all know his steezie
Said he's 'bout to come to KC, wanna have a get together, that's easy
Got a little Cabo Wabo, some beers and Cîroc, yo
They wanna have it at my house, is there room for Frizz and P-caso?
Hell yeah, come on down,
 
told Makzilla to be done on rounds
We gotta get more liquor, spread the fun around
We 'bout to kick it with family, put the gun on down
Nigga, I ain't kicked it in eons, 
this 'bout to be cooler than Freon
Got another call from my homeboy in Denver, named Dion
He just pulled into KC sayin' he's double fisted with bottles
I told him I was on liquor duty and Stone nem was on models
All of my niggas ready for action, when I woke I don't remember this crashin'
I can try and tell you in the next verse, but I don't really know what happened

It's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur
It's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur

Woke up, got sick, ain't nobody sleepin' in my shit
Looked in the mirror, that's fucked up
Because busted is my top lip
Real busted, real puffy, like a nigga punched me the fuck out
I don't smoke, but my mouth taste like big weed like my nigga Yukmouth
I think I remember two chicks, one thick, another was a toothpick
I think I was takin' shots with 'em, of Patrón, I don't do this
KC Teas
, 
ghetto suds,
 talkin' to the chick with ghetto butts
She was trippin' when another beautiful widow cut
In front of her talking to me and then I said ""Oh, fuck!""
Everybody keep sayin'
But I don't remember even seein'
But I heard if you really wanna please
Put one, two, and maybe three
Glimpses of a house full of bitches and dancin'
And some losin' their pants and romancin' each other
And eating each other, and beating the brotha's
My publicist almost stuck a bitch
Cause she punched my nigga with her fucking fist
But he kicked her out, instead
She got a lie nigga something should have been said
Then somehow when I touched her
My lip hit her big head

It's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur
It's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur

Scenario, what happened? That nigga keep laughin'
Cause he made all the drinks potent, my lip is fucked, I'm not jokin'
Said she's made up with hips out, she 'bout 5'1"", hell pretty, but Cripped out
Said she got a little cocky, called me a demon and I flipped out
Said her body was boozed up and her earlobes had a few cuts
I told him I don't hit women, It was not me, I don't do stuff
I came downstairs, all my niggas still sprawled out
The makings of Caribou Lou, now there's a loose screw

The night was going perfectly, all seemed well
I woke up in the darkness dizzy, feelin' like hell
I don't feel like myself, oh no
I've never ever felt this way before in so long
It's just a blur
 Hey, um… It… it’s  I don’t really… I’m not gonna front. I don’t know what the fuck happened last night, or nothin' like that, ya know. I’m not trippin', but… I don’t have my purse or nothin' like that and I know… I don’t re..really remember how I got back to my home, and I just really need you to help me… um… get my purse. So, if you could, call me. Please, I would appreciate it. Alrighty. Thank you. Bye

Put on my please-come-trip-with-me suit
Lace my boots tight and what
Ahhwoo ahhwoo ahhwoo
Turn up, turn up

Hard times living in this bad land of mine
Everybody on vanilla skys by design
A lot of my brothers are buried, a lot of 'em in their prime
So take my chopper and stick it where the sun don't shine
Ahhh - please don't make me make you say that
Tripping cause momma ain't really happy where she stay at
I can't afford to move her away until I pay that

Son needs a way through college
Daughter too, harder, you gotta pay for true knowledge
Sinner eyes when a guy get layed off
Everything ain't payed off enterprise
Beam up, I'm finna die, in a lie, them and I minimized
I'mm kinda tripping in my go clothes
Step with malicious intent, I'm throwing bolos
To my soul goes
The average person they hurting cause for certain everybody's doe low

I'm with the bullshit tonight
If they tripping I ain't tryna do right, uh, uh
I'm with the bullshit tonight
Let it loose on every devil in sight, turn up
   

Yeah, tell 'em I'm tripping, I'm at war with these devils
Dumped that bitch in the gutter, they can't get on my level
I ain't give a fuck about nothing with the way I'm strapped up with this metal
I was tripping in the back of a truck that I done packed with these shovels
I don't want no problems, just want you to leave me the fuck alone
Before I end up inside of a cell and have a neighborhood inside of your home
My money be funny just laughin at niggas
And the hoes they got keep asking them niggas
How I'm crashing them niggas while I'm passing them niggas
Well, take your seat and fasten them niggas
Before I dispose the trash of them niggas, go to smashing them niggas
I'm on that bullshit, ain't nobody finna pull shit
D got my wrists rolls-es balling, I'm on some bullshit
Pay attention
It don't get no realer, hater killer, about that drama
Terroristic, risk it, you get Truth Osama
If I don't get you The Boss back to me with that llama
Bitch this is what we do, believe it, downing niggas' mama's


Cocaine on my mama's table, I'm out of line
Doing lines open wide, nigga suicide
Blood in my vein, hella drugs in my vein
Rap with the strap
, keep the thugs entertained
All my foes I leave critical, they pitiful
I'm a 5 star general

West side salute it, all these kids my students
Class still in session, the shooters I just recruited
Turn up - look I came to bust a motherfuckin head
Got some wild knucklehead killers bucking lead
I came from the bottom, now I'm on the roof
I'm big-headed so the coupe never had a roof

Gassing on these pussies, no brakes, they pray I do stop

Ate an earregular mind state, but it fried N9ne's liver!

Earregular, we're nebula
Dear secular listeners, we're here next to ya
Giving you fear messed with original weird stress for ya
Peer pressure, the ignorant near deaf niggas!
Earregular, we're nebula
Dear secular listeners, we're here next to ya
Giving you fear messed with original weird stress for ya
Peer pressure, the ignorant near deaf niggas!

I know that my style is diff'rent!
Meanwhile I get frowns and lips bent
He better know, we let it go, flee, never throw, glee at a ho, see that a pro
Will make the sounds breaking down the distance
I get my psyche blown, when I sit and I write these songs
Then I fuck with my Nikes on: ""Plop, plop, plop, plop!""
To the women it might be wrong, 'cause in the middle of the night he gone
And the wife for the night she's home: ""Stop, stop, stop, stop!""
So many sicknesses that I get medicine, I get it up off a nigga
But it can never disappear, I know many get with this
But it's a couple of really stupid individuals looking for the Nina fate
'Cause I innovate, and I be the Yates, they can disintegrate
Guess my sin it begins with the number before ten
And being a clown, always been and raised!
When I rhyme my design isn't mindless
You can find Tech, flowing up the divine stretch
Never spineless, spider K's a rhyme vet
And we ain't the only earregular since I got Stevie, Mayday and I signed Ces

Earregular, we're nebula
Dear secular listeners, we're here next to ya
Giving you fear messed with original weird stress for ya
Peer pressure, the ignorant near deaf niggas!
Earregular, we're nebula
Dear secular listeners, we're here next to ya
Giving you fear messed with original weird stress for ya

Y'all motherfuckers stuck on stupid (duh!)
I tried to slow it, but my flow's no lucid thing
I gotta be clever to do ""This Ring""
You can feel it if you 67 or you 15
Aggin! Yeah, that's ""nigga"" backwards
Tech N9ne be that spitter master
With a Cris, with her mugs, and I'm with a grasher
Let a chick on the bus and I'm finna smash her
Could have been a bastard
Swimming in cash and the laughter, I'm a sinner faster
Better get a pastor

Earregular, we're nebula
Dear secular listeners, we're here next to ya
Giving you fear messed with original weird stress for ya
Peer pressure, the ignorant near deaf niggas!
Earregular, we're nebula
Dear secular listeners, we're here next to ya

A Real 1,E.B.A.H.,2012.0,"You should be accountable for the sins
You commit when behind the computer

I don't see why these motherfuckers don't get it, I'm livid
When a youngster trying to punk ya, like he wanna thump ya
But it's something he twitted, tweeted, when the fun
Come ya done agreed it, get a lump sum you gonna need it
When I'm heated, you don't wanna go to war with a thug who succeeded
I'm not the bigger person in person this music grind stops
When niggas first in the cursin'
You're choosin' N9ne's block 57 jerkin' your curtain
Missouri crime dot, both workin' turfs I be lurkin'!
In case ya be in a bit of hate and you wake
And become an enemy the date should be late
With the brother's memory, the Yates, nobody's safe, it's how it's finna be
You said that you're gonna rape my daughters then cut their arteries?
Would a father be honored? We'd be slobbering to cut your water streams!
Nigga, so while you hidin' behind yo' tweets
I be findin out yo' street, 'cause all that flyin' out yo' beak, nigga
I'm a real one, rhyme without no beat
Say ""Fuck N9ne!"" and I'll go weak, you just lyin' out yo' teeth nigga!

I can only take so much
Why don't you think if you threaten me then I'll bust
It'd be different if you stepped to me then get touched
I get a little bitter, we be beefin' on Twitter, I'm bigger
I'm a REAL ONE! Ain't nobody iller
Don't make me call on my guerillas
'Cause what ya say might leak through
Watch what you say when you speak to
A REAL ONE! And ain't nobody realer
If I'm hurtin' then you can feel a nigga, who's inside out
Think about what be comin out ya mouth
If ya doubt I'm a real one

As real as they come, been me since day one
Good heart in my chest, good smoke in my lungs
Good head on my shoulders, stand in front of my soldiers
Never let anyone hold us, think back when a wiseman told us
That ""life ain't about the destination, it's the journey,""
Fulfill one mission, get a new vision, this ambition burning
Maintain determined, distinguished gentlemen but a regular person
Energy up in my veins, got my fangs hangin' I'm turnin'
Run with a Strange gang and I'm certain
That good thangs changing in that burden
Lifted, DIBKIS nigga hundred percent
Of it all real if he comin at me sideways
Thinkin' that I will not kill, you trippin'
Been like that ain't, nothin' different
In a position throne like I'm sittin'
Can't get pissed with consistent dissin'
Fuck that, where they do that at you gonna
See a nigga act unchristian
I'm unstable, just ask Krizz then
When I flip, so wicked it's sickenin'
Niggas ain't takin' food up outta my kitchen
I'm aiming at you, cowards
Don't stand in the way of ours
That's word to Jesse Deuce Howard

I can only take so much
Why don't you think if you threaten me then I'll bust
It'd be different if you stepped to me then get touched
Instead you be on Facebook with a hate look, AY, LOOK!
I'm a REAL ONE! Ain't nobody iller
Don't make me call on my guerillas
'Cause what ya say might leak through
Watch what you say when you speak to
A REAL ONE! And ain't nobody realer
If I'm hurtin' then you can feel a nigga, who's inside out
Think about what be comin out ya mouth
If ya doubt I'm a real one

Extensive time on these lines
Obsessive with mine, when I rhyme
Express what I find
When I'm tryna access my mind
I'm here with Tech, Tech, Tech (N9ne!)
If that upsets you then fine
Too sensitive, busy cryin
Nigga bout' to get left behind
Expensive wine on the table
In the atmosphere of a winner
Celebratin' and I'm drinkin'
Like fuck it I'm on a bender
Havin' the time of my life
Hope I sober up and remember
Keep it all Strange, brody
And it's only gonna get bigger

Animosity, we don't need it
But the botchery in your tweet it
Really bothered me 'cause you're seated
Hella far from me, you're deleted
But it's irkin' me 'cause you said it
Wasn't givin' a fuck when you read it
If all of you motherfuckers was accountable
For givin' the negative all of it would be debted, dead
So watch that evil shit you spread
I'm a real one so I feel some hurtin' pain then I go shed
Yeah, so don't back off when I respond
And take your cap off when I go Nam'
So when you jackoff I'm on your lawn, motherfucker!

I can only take so much
Why don't you think if you threaten me then I'll bust
It'd be different if you stepped to me then get touched
But my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
This the song that you made? It's too late!
I'm a REAL ONE! Ain't nobody iller
Don't make me call on my guerillas
'Cause what ya say might leak through
Watch what you say when you speak to
A REAL ONE! And ain't nobody realer
If I'm hurtin' then you can feel a nigga, who's inside out
Think about what be comin out ya mouth
If ya doubt I'm a real one

I'm a real guy, just 'cause you made me a star
Don't make me a bigger person
When you say something disrespectful to me
I'm gonna react in the same way
That a regular person would act on the street
It don't matter If you buying my records or whatever
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I got feelings too",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-a-real-1-lyrics
Strangeulation III,Strangeulation,2014.0,"Wrapped in XLR cables
Up from my whiskers, down to my fuckin' kicks
Wreck-O was echoed in Gordon Geckos, you suckin' dick
Nobody be askin' me for secrets, I ain't chuckin' tips
I'd rather be bumpin' hips on that ratchet with muffin tits
Tore up the limits from Britain visions would rock their lives
Inside a prison where giddy bitches don't jock the rhyme
Born in precision and rhythm spittin' could swat a fly
For them to just kick a single shillings from Spotify
Bye, Bye killers, on a high five business
Gonna ride by the sickest in your high ride to the hitlist
If we ain't spoke in ages then miss me with broken favors
You Miley Cyrus to majors, you twerkin' on swollen razors (run now)
Don't make me come to dinner, nail your tongue down
And have you plead your case to us in Strangeland at sundown
Be careful of the biz cause everything has got a price attached
Wake up with a horse head in your bed
 and next your life is snatched

Tank full of petrol, 
bank full of pesos
Pool on my tour bus, bonus on a payroll
Feel like I be killin' it, famous on the internet
Really I'm just wingin' it, cookin' shit on my kitchenette
Life so good right now, I need to celebrate!
Bout to sell a stadium out and turn it into rave!
Look at how the industry norm has started lookin' Strange
All my brothers riding the storm while they just ride the wave
Caviar wishes, bitches for my bitches
Black shades and hoodies and spots and white linens
Feel like Sam Kinison, preachin' to the citizens
Screamin' at the saints, ""You ain't ever gonna get rid of us!""
Guessin' I just cleaned my plate so now I'm gettin' cake
Speedin' down the interstate, yellin' ""Get out the fuckin' way""
We plant flags in the ground because we here to stand
I bring my whole hood out and have 
my own parade

(Black Gold!)
I purposely wrote this verse just to murder, dismember, defecate
Disassemble the limbs of a nigga who try and separate
Artistry from nonfiction, I'm sent with a conviction
To sentence you pawns givin' opinions on my addiction
""There he goes, speakin' bout how he merk a beat""
""Smellin' himself, why else would he flaunt about it so verbally?""
Dance around me like I was a paraplegic
In a do-si-do competition, lookin' pissed like I never heard of feet
""Yadda, yadda"", a whole lotta yappin' about my rappin'
When I'm the captain of crunchin' you niggas' milky dreams
I'm the comparison of Pac face staring in your face
Mock razor blades, Kutt leave you crispy clean
Don't ask Tech, ask me if it's questions
Guarantee that he tell you that I'm the best 
and I'm destined
To find a snake and a bat, helpin' Kansas City's progression
Hopin' I hurt the feelings of whoever second guessed it cause
Everybody talkin', I'mma make you niggas hear me
Mind control flow, now, listen till your ears bleed

Spit it sicker than these sycophants, keep your dick up in your pants
You were blunted on the block
, me, I had some different plans
I'm trying to get to France, sniffing grams, hit a branch
Independent Powerhouse
, vibin' out, wit' the fam
Waking up in different cities every night, hittin' grants
Stay prepared for this, 
I'm bearing witness to the sin of man
Stripper dance with cinnamon, clubbin' with my gentlemen
Drink away the night's events, nothing worth remembering
Squad'll run up in this bitch, mobbin' like some immigrants
Jack you for your paper stack, rob you of your innocence
Taping off the scene of crimes, swabbing for my fingerprints
Thought about my life, you thought the same and couldn't think of shit
Ha! This type of fire don't extinguish
Now write about some bigger shit, you striking out, swing and miss
Ring around the Rosie, homie, pocket full of pain
Keep a lock up on my lane and triple optic in my brain, look
Ringing

Show Me a God,K.O.D.,2009.0,"Anger
I gotta get this out of me before I start this album
Rob Rebeck
I want this one to go before the intro so they'll know
What this album's for

Ey, my momma, my momma, my momma is so tormented
She been through trauma, more drama
The dawn is gone, it's more contented on this side, it gets out of it
How does a prophet who loved God as his father slip and then get the bottomless side of it?
How come an angel gotta be sick in the pancreas like she an atheist?
Maybe it's the faith that is making this lady and crazy has made me this skeptic, next threat is lupus on top of epileptic
Never rested, psychiatrist forever tested, reverend blessed it
Brethren, heaven, Tech is beggin' for effin' X-Mas
Hopin' momma ain't left an exit
It better get better quick
How you let her get sick with bread invested?
In the church every Sunday, I've been searchin' for one way
Or another, 
you're gonna have to curse me or burst me with a sunray
To let me know that you're coming or en route
I'm 'bout 99, but I need 100% proof!

Show me a god, ahh!
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a god, ahh!
And if it is, why ain't he doin' his job?!
Show me a god, ahh!
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a god, please!
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

Where is the passion of Christ?
What happened to passin' his life for the masses?
Bad it ain't happenin' twice
'Cause my mother's stacked in a lab and it's stagnant at nights
I need your help, and I'm not askin' it nice
All her life it's been paramedics
All my life comin' up all I heard ""Is there a medic?""
A youngin', all I could do is stare at it
Seizure after seizure, if I was you
Wouldn't ne'er let it be hereditary
If Aar' get it, I swear that it's scary
Sittin' in an insane asylum
God or god's ghost, man I aim to find him
To take away all of this angel's pain inside, come rain
If Momma go, how come I can't deny them?
And she only 54 in a ward, watchin' her war
And it's more blood and gore
She tore 'cause people are so deceivin'
And I'm on the floor
'Cause with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor
Havin' all the soldiers screamin'

Show me a god, ahh!
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a god, ahh!
And if it is, why ain't he doin' his job?!
Show me a god, ahh!
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a god, please!
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

Think of how all the victims of Katrina feelin'
They need a ceilin', they say that Mother Nature, she the villain
I plead a million, the bible, I read a billion
Still I'm free to see the real and my feet are grillin'
'Cause hellish heat is buildin' up
Think my momma ain't ill enough? It's killin' us
I will erupt if they're pillin' her false, still ain't no healin' her
Been searchin' for answers, but I find nothin' but man stuff
That puts a damper on the current problem at hand, bruh
Or whatever it is, I will never forgive
Anybody who take Maudie better get her to live
She's so sick that it don't matter how much cheddar I give
To the thing or the lady, here's a letter to his
Majesty, why ain't you stoppin' these tragedies?
My mother's glad to be with you, but her life's been a raggedy one
What's gonna be done?
In two thousand twelve when hell's gonna be
When the Earth aligns with the Sun?

Show me a god, ahh!
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a god, ahh!
And if it is, why ain't he doin' his job?!
Show me a god, ahh!
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a god, please!
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

That's why I be lookin' for ghosts
Somethin' supernatural
Only thing I know that's supernatural is the rappin'
Maybe if I saw something like that it'd make me change my life or somethin'

(Go to sleep, go to sleep) oh, you make me go
(Go to sleep, go-go-go to sleep) you make me go

That's what it be feelin like when they bear you through
Every stereo radio, and they swear you true
But the dopey delivery is unbearable
Drink (CARIBOU)
Gotta grab your nads, you in the building
Rip it 'til you blast, they ass, up in the ceiling
Look a lot of rappers trash, ain't got the feeling
Not in your brain, to wanna change, up your energy game
What a shame, you got a name, but you're lyrically lame
Sedated, save it, cause your memory stained
From 'caine you're faded, a beginner remains
With fame you're jaded, and you give me your lane
I came to spray it, and it finna be pain
Will you please, stop...
Rappin' that crap that you givin' me, mayne?
I been fiendin' foe, meaning flow
But they thought process seemin' slow
You ain't gotta rap hella fast for me to like you
But wake the fuck if they screamin', bro
And that's good, you're able to get your green and go
But a lot of you shouldn't wanna be seen in show
Cause when I go to your set you be leanin' low

Never do you really gotta be ill as me
Lyrically, stalled
Lot of rappers gonna wanna grit they grill at me
Furiously, y'all
But when you run up and then you find out villains we
Fear is recalled
Music and murkin niggas don't really wanna deal with me
Seriously, dawg
Your flow's on NyQuil, or them night pills
Or that codeine, that y'all drank
It's a funny sight for real, the people like you still
When you so lean, that you can't
Spit one of your verses, worse, you just faint
Better get a nurse, a hearse, and kiss paint
Watch a nigga urk and jerk, he's on the purp
A Percocet alert, to Earth, if it's quaint in a...
Box, see me comin' but can't even swing at me (weak as fuck)
When you be rappin', you mummy, you don't wanna see me
Screamin' up to the tip-top, a lot of you rappin', it be Ziploc
All I'm sayin', is I never wanna have no MSG in my hip-hop
(Ehe-haha! Can you feel it? Feel the swagger, hahaha)

(Go to sleep, go to sleep) oh, you make me go
(Go to sleep, go-go-go to sleep) you make me go
(Go to sleep) rockabye, baby

Last thing I'm gon' say
The people don't really have green or gold pay
So when you think of rapping and go lay
Your vocal, you better, mash mean and go cray
But if you a beginner still, in a deal
And your remedial rappin' is in a mill
I guess I better slow it down a little bit
And go pop me a couple of (Benadryl)
Fuck, nigga, why you wake me up, nigga?
Makin' million dollars layin' in the cut, nigga
Fuck what you say, I been 'sleep for two day
Go to sleep, Tech N9ne, nigga, too paid

Stay alive, homeboy, that's all I want you to do

Genitals, so plentiful, ya chemical's low but shot up
Wishin' they'd slow the god up

They think that I be sniffing on Snow Tha Product
Bitch I might be, this a nice key, to get ya hyphy
Dick ya wifey, this for Ike
Slice of sin or source if ya see somethin' slither slightly
Step inside the surface of Strange, or simply sight-see
Spit the flow, get the dough, then I hit the ho
Mister irresistible twisted is this kiss the toes
I'ma kick ya nose if one of ya pricks oppose
I'm all he hates, 'cause I became a landmark like Ollie Gates

Trust that 'nuff scratch does back much wackness
Flush that shit
Down with the gowns with the sounds for the clowns
And not in a good way
You can drown underground with the pounds
When they gust that shit
Oh so, low we stojo, hoes and dough negro we flow though
Let the soul glo, mojo, nigga
Pillowcase, over the head of the industry
Illustrate, with my mouth and murders my ministry
Seal the fate of my enemy, feel the weight of my energy
I heal the hate. Facilitate. Disc jockey's with scrilla make
Them play your records until you break
Radio ain't nothing but real estate
It's still a fake deal of mates who ain't real awake
But the mill is great, ain't no iller ape that can kill a Yates

It's no challenge, it's no challenge at all
When you up the bar, it gets below average
Below average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em
I'ma let you be great though (x3)

I can keep my head, while everybody losin' theirs
No Marcus, I told you, don't start this debate
I'm all arsenal friend, we the median like, you feedin' me in
Tired of bein' with the intermediate
Faded on bullshit, control the whole medium
I done ran inside my meniscus
I done out-rapped everybody Christmas
So why in the hell would I fail?
If I do, I'm just being Ezale
Front line level, untamed, unchained
After all this shit, I remain on lane, loser
And that's what yo ass get for hittin' that snoozer
My brain is worth a few trillions, I don't get worked
So my verses hurts when they send me to kill 'em
I'm like Biblin' niggas, keepin' it blacker than Power Rangers
But why the name Zachary? No leashes, I'm free sucker
No reachin' no knee deep into mine
Like a comprehension of lines
Revisit them when you wanna hear that real wizard dim
Young and timeless, elite science, prominent and flyin'
And beat them beats to meet and greet but I conscience",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-yates-lyrics

Second battalion, fifth regiment, like this...

A lot of talent a chemical imbalance and MDMA (MDMA)
I can't reroute it so people they hear 'bout it and tend to turn away (tend to turn away)

Kinetic you bet it's somethin' movin' your head it's prophetic
So get it embeded let it control your bodily
Close to lettuce my head is far from synthetic
You credit this vet is poetic that is merely a part of me
The other part it be wicked similar to psychotic
We kick it we frolic sickness neurotic fought at the God in me
Mixed with erotic on top of Hennessy and Hpnotiq
You got it a solid sub-savage knowing not of comradery
Don't want kill ya (somethin' in my head)
Is makin' me done deal ya (somethin' in my head)
Is making the gun fill ya (somethin' in my head)
Is makin' me want drill ya, can we get familiar?
Check, always fantasizing on gettin' sex
Wettin' that and settin' Tech up on you carressin' breast
Sweatin' that you'd get me vexed and not get your second breath
Stressed you would've been left where you was beckoned at we neck and neck

Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
The place where I have no relaxation
Is in my head
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
Liberate me Lord devastation
Is in my head

I keep that one that'll heat ya, so you better like run better seat ya
Might get found under the bleachers, no one'll reach ya come to the creature
'Cause in my head is a hole, dark and deep and it grows
Actually capital G-O-D have mercy on my soul
I'm sick as I wanna be, get the hell up from front of me
When I spit at everybody yeah they gonna be feeling this for eternity
Boss many thoughts pretty lost but I cost plenty sauce
Soft killa crossed me tossed put 'em off in the moss
Respect my mind everyone (somethin' in my head)
Says if he disrespect N9ne then he done (somethin' in my head)
Wish as I could put the nine on his tongue, (somethin' in my head)
Says ignoramus you too famous for that to be done son
Stuck 'cause I can't trust his bluff must
Clutch bust (hush hold up enough)
Woosa goosfraba makes you holla
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta

Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
The place where I have no relaxation
Is in my head
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
Liberate me Lord devastation
Is in my head

Some people joke and say me loco
Throw evil quotes but yo they don't know
Doctor don't know, so he won't go
In my head it's like I said I mean I'm oh so
Full of decay and MDMA
Sin we in way deep off in the end like many men say
Slaughter you pay, he told me that you gotta today
Allah hu A.K.B.A.R. with a Auda Dufe'
In my head, in my brain, dead am I?
Will I shed a cry when they red Ninna
You might red Ninna, but never dead Ninna
But if you bled Ninna, then you's a dead nigga!
Yo, I feel it you feel it, can we heal it? The devil's encephal
We rebels get it level no matter what it becomes
With the heavy metal impatiently wait with a shovel
For the wedos who hate the negros, I think I'm losing my Lithium

Super savage erratic you don't say such an attic combative you don't say sick his status so there's no Beyonces there's no hope for Dontez

Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
The place where I have no relaxation, is in my head
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
Liberate me Lord devastation
Is in my head",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-in-my-head-lyrics
Slave,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"Fight the pain inside the rain
A rebel know to let the devil go
So now to get paid, 'bout to be working like a slave

I’m kinda good, kinda bad
Kinda getting money can’t be mad
I’m kinda broke but I’m kinda rich
Wishing I had a corner I could put a bitch in
Ain’t gon' do nothing, ain’t like I’m suffering
Food for my baby mouth and I bought a house
For my baby mother and
What’s wrong? I try
Don’t matter, still die
I’m strong, but I’m not
When I’m alone I cry
Out for you is hard to do
I can’t see you, so doubt for you
And out my mouth I sprout the noose
Too much Vodka, and Mountain Dew
Blaspheming ain’t what I be meaning, if you listen fast
You’d think I was a heathen, but the last
Sunday receiving the preaching from the pastor
And I ain’t even believing the bastard
But no Hades, God’s baby
God made me a lil crazy
When I’m off I’m gone, my life is my songs
It's what I mean? When I sing ""still on a wing and a prayer""
But if I listen to what was written
In the scripture maybe it’ll get me there
Share with the people I swear it isn’t evil
Scared that it might be in vain
But if I say I’m the genius,
 and like Jesus
Everybody gonna know my name, Kali

I’ve been working like a slave, oh Lordy
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done stumbled on this road, I’ve been wrong, I know
I know that there’s no peace in my shelter

Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
I need reparations due to devastations
From the state of present situations
And it’s not easy
To walk a narrow path and mock Jesus
It’s hard when you’re family wonderin'
When you’re gonna make enough to stop leavin'
Stop breathing for a minute 'cause it’s all
Artificial when them laws tryna get you
When them haters right behind em
Wanna shove a double barrel sawed off in your dental
What can I do to stop a big catastrophe
When niggas after me and bitches after me
Wanna have my baby,
 missing niggas lately
Trails and tribulations tackle me
My mama think I made it, she feeling elated
Proud of her only son born
My kids think I’m the greatest, I can not display a smile
Feelin' like a Funion
Salty and all (You’ll be...)
Locked in a stall (...Tryin')
Lost in the cause (Truly no denying)
Ain’t nobody gonna do it for me
For the MO, don't let it drive me insane
Solicitation of a prostitute
'Cause you're a ho when you’re playing this game
But it’s okay I am gon ride till I triumph
'Cause everybody once upon a time was a slave
This is Calhoun

I’ve been working like a slave, oh Lordy
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done stumbled on this road, I’ve been wrong, I know
I know that there’s no peace in my shelter

I work, I play, and I drink booze every day
Tryna muffle the blues I'mma say
You'se in the way, fools run astray
Allah, God, Jesus, Jah somebody please help me
Mama got a problem with diabetes, it don’t seem healthy
Everything depends on Ninna
Fame hitting Dontez Senior
Gotta nigga thinking some of the fans I’m making it
Will they wanna do me like Selena
Devil laughing like a hyena
Losing all the good in my demeanor
I don’t wanna go psycho but yo the flow ya know
I got to go and Charlie Sheen ya
Tryna stay good with the old lady
My mind made her go crazy
No time for my poor babies
So don’t let a motherfucker play me
When I say FU pay me
Even though I’m getting money you can still see
I’m hungry like I’m in Haiti
What am I to do? What am I to you?
But a lot of cool? But I’m not amused?
Can’t you see? I’m stressed, not free
From y’all, I’m sick
My body’s hot, if 'n this pressure
Don’t let up, this will prolly stop for Tech Ninna

Tech N9ne
 & Groupie]
Um, I normally don't do anything like this 
(mhm)
But, um when I saw you in the club
I just thought, I had to try something different! 
(mm hmm)
I normally don't take anyone home on the first night 
(mhmm)
But you look so, good to me
Shut Up, take off your clothes

Lay down on the mother fucking bed, like I said
I'm a different kind of nigga, like to spread bloody red
From banging the thing I'm a tame when you shed naughty legs
I'm geekin'
'Cause you peakin' with my head
Leave you dead and leakin'
I'm a killer, but instead of a machete
I got my dick, I'ma drill her
Then I'ma wet her with the steady
A proper check up speedy
Like Andretti hit the crevi
A lot to pick up, Betty gotta be ready for the yetti
To eat, my kind of meat, find mine to feat
But climb N9ne the beast, It's my time to feast
Einstein N9ne
 slime the sheets
I’m tryna’ design prime dime schwan the beef
She whine the least
Rewind the beat 'cause T9 he grind the freaks
Puttin' your mother fuckin' feline to sleep
Cannibalistic with her I'm hoping she don't mind the teeth
You invited me in
Gimme the Henny, lemon and sprite and the night'll begin
You ignited me when you stated you sighted me when
I was painted up, said you came on up and want to be sin
'Til the morning light, it was on tonight
You met a DK-N to fuckin' bone you right
Clones'll roam you might, be surprised with the vibe
But I'm leavin' paint on your pillow meaning I was inside

Suck on me for 40 seconds underwater baby girl
And if you succeed, I'll extend the same to you

Listen
I ain't finna seal your fate
My aim is to kill your hate
We gon' drink 'til you can't feel your face
Then I'm leavin' paint on your pillowcase
Paint on your pillowcase
Paint on your pillowcase
We gon' drink 'til you can't feel your face
Then I'm leavin' paint on your pillowcase

I’m smooth nigga, live nigga, pimp nigga
When I told her when she asked 'bout my mo'fuckin' face paint
‘Cause bitch, it don’t matter what you think
When the drank, get up in your tank you won't say Ace Can’t
A little bicker and a little more, then slit her a little more
Liquor to get the whore, to straight skank
Fuck you because I do it with 
a little fluid
Later she gon' feel real stupid like a play prank
‘cause I know about the hole that was in her
Know she a sinner, oh, no beginner
Hungry ass ho went low for that dinner
Told that ho no, ‘cause my heart cold like winter
Yes, so, ‘cause she’s a freak, and ig'nant
Born the whore into streets that’s gettin’ it
One in four creeps just hittin' in, so I told the carnivore, eating my meat is a privilege
Can dick her down, dick her, dick her, dick her down
But if I dick her down, then a nigga will never get the crown
But if I get a picture wit her on that liquor lick her down
Then her lickin' down then she will never bring a nigga down
And her being a saint is erased, and the next day she’ll be in a tainted place
Some that she can’t escape, but I can, even with a trace of my painted face

Aww boo don’t be afraid I’m not into making you naughty
It's just a joke, not a dick, so don't take it so hard, ha!

Listen
I ain't finna seal your fate
My aim is to kill your hate

Then I'm leavin' paint on your pillowcase

Lust
 - the sin that brought us all here
The one we love the most, but yet it's the one we all fear
Sometimes sadistic,
 it gets mystic and then trends are twisted
Bodies in exquisite positions, that’s so illicit
Illegal to exhibits, solicit, yet we exist
In a thrill and all sorts of feelin' we get, that’s so implicit
Why people riskin' their life, depinction husband's and wife
To get closer to the true wise that brings us eternal life
The paint left on your pillow, the stain from off the face
The one you see in your dreams 
when you’re achin' below the waist
The devil was given horns, but the nature from which was born
Every person that’s ever lived so give praise to the god of porn

God didn't bring you here, the Devil did
Accept the nature you were created in

Listen
I ain’t finna steal your fate
My aim is to kill your hate
We gon' drink 'til you can’t feel your face
Then I’m leavin' paint on your pillowcase",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-paint-on-your-pillowcase-lyrics

LAJFA! Last words spoken by my mom
Heaven opened on June 6th, mama's on the first thing smoking
So many emotions
Sipping on my potion, choking, black slime's taken over my body
So much it will contaminate the ocean (I'm not joking)
Get 'em up, wanna bust, with enough of anguish
I'ma clutch and he trust when he touch, my name is so famous
I'm adjusting a bunch of stuff, my brain it grows heinous
And I'm loving that rough and tough and tainted, so dangerous
People piling in to peep it
So many step inside to see the secrets
Really I'm a rabble-rousing reverend
Writing in reefer, risen, rippin' a wretched rhyme, release it
Blood in my mucus, turn it into mud I should've gutted the lupus
That bug is intrusive, what the government uses
To turn love into nuisance, and shoving a big drug in your juices
Wondering if I'ma bust and light this llama up
If I'm the number synonymous with anonymous
The drama just equal Osama nuts
You crazy, that's why they honor us, listen to it
I am not professin' to be the highest in heaven
So I say with no discretion, this is a K-O-D session
So if any wanna question, you pro'lly should get to steppin'
'Cause you 'bout to hear the lesson of twenty minus eleven

Enter in my castle and you'll bow down

Help me carry on this love that I'm buildin'

Inshallah, really just sent Allah
What a Christian just saw, evil winning
Don't know what it meant to y'all when death went to Maud'
But it really bent the KOD, please no grinning
What can I do, to make you believe
All this beautiful music I conceive
I'm taking out the pain and times the N9na grieves
And putting it to music, now you heard to leave
For your spirits I covet, that doesn't say ""Devil worshipper,"" does it?
Good and evil, I got oodles and oodles of it
And I got so many more followers comin' and I love it
Wonder why everybody's insane when they come to Strange
They had my mother locked up in chains like she was deranged
I'm takin' aim on every lame, they're gonna see the change
Watchin' my brain darken the game

Enter in my castle and you'll bow down

Then, then without wings, I truly die

If you trace it back to the beginnin'
I never sold a single piece of music before Mitch Bade
This laid, the foundation for me to get paid
This day, you can still hear that gangster on a sick page
Now I'm flyin' high but dyin's, my
Fans that were buyin' I
They're cryin', ""Why
Does he have to get bigger and flow with artists from mainstream?""
Good music reaches all and he's creating a strange scene

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away

How the hell are you sayin' that all the records I'm playin'
Since 2010 are not obeyin' the Strange Law
Remain raw, give your happy and pain all
Spit with a flame jaw with the teeth of a chainsaw
This what I do when I'm flyin' right off the shelf
And when something musical helps
You can't keep it all to yourself
It grows and grows, always hard never tryin' soft
So how in the world you fix your face to say that you dyin' off


AHHHHHH
Frustrated, cause I'm thinkin' that if enough hate it
It'll make remaining fans start feelin' their trust faded

I don't wanna die (I don't wanna die)
I just wanna keep my lifeline
And that's the family who recite N9ne's passages
And back it just cause ain't no other like mine (tight rhymes)
And even the people applaud
They still wanna bury hard, cause they don't wanna be a god
I'm higher than the stars now
The bottom is too far down
Whoever throws sand at the Nina
Yeah it kinda cuts but it ain't enough to take me down
I've been so true, so things I do will go my way
With the power of the pen, the paper, the people do as I say


My fans are my lifeline, so it kills me to think how they can just cut off--
There can only be one
Thou shall only be me
When the whole world's changing
All shall remain (x4)

But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mum's the word
Tech Ninna face painted look like he come ta purge!
Real Scorpio, shoot this thing like a torpedo
Rock the rip, no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork, we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust flow to death, I must blow the check
It's never enough dough for Tech
So I get sick with it, I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quick-spit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Try to bite I buck a blammer in his fitted
Killin' music get me stiff sitted, I can't piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And I'mma murder 'til I'm on the yard (Murder)
My verse are like burst that jerk up and merk the weak twerp
You cannot hurt the Gurkha
First ta', insert the work, the son of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya
Then I'mma squirt ya MRSA (Ugh)
Trip not, you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when Ninna's shit drop
I do numbers, I'm the pinnacle so never will this stop
Y'all can't beat me doin' nothing, except for
Stalkin' these thoughts I spew and suckin'
We run this independent game, it ain't no screwin' us
When we runnin' everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin'

This is my rifle, there aren't any like it cause this one is N9ne
This a gift from his mind

I wanna try to kill everything in my way

Yo, I Got the call from Tech N9ne
He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit that get up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex lines
I get love in every city I sack in cause I rep mine
Around the world, the girls give me head on tour cause I headline
I gotta get fed, I'm fed up, my homies is doin' fed time
I look at that clock and all I see is ""Go get that bread"" time
Lost too many soldiers so tears, I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio, hear yo shit, and oh, it's bedtime
I fall asleep, it all is weak, most y'all shouldn't be called MCs
Burnt ya discography, you ain't sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree, my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy, that's prolly why you wanna halt my team

Livin' facetious, bobbin' head while the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I don't play like I don't see shit
Yeah, one hunnit, one hunnit, keep it that way and it's potent
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it, I'm down after the sun and up before it, better know it
MVP, most valuable poet, been the coldest, kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal that you don't shoot for
And every time you cut a corner, you make two more
Put richness in my life so I don't have to half at things
And listen for the whispers so I don't have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want, so it's just colors when I dream
And then you realize, it's not as scary as it seems
Normal is for pussies

I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Ain't nobody handle me, heated like a candle be
Kissin' dirt, ya man'll be for tryin' to dismantle me
Music is my weapon, true, loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew, be careful who you steppin' to
I remember when I was young and I got scars through
Right in back of the paddy-wagons and cop cars too
Now that I'm flyin' high from a rockstar view
Security level let Allahu Akbar through

If you hear me tell my homies anything goes
With these chickens dipping to Davy's
Right when the clubber close
If you see me on the grind gettin' mine
If you bust in a room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes, rippin' each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line
If I'm rollin on dubs, if it's K-town bud
If they showin' me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them haters givin' me mugs
Ladies givin' me hugs
Know it ain't no rocket science, it's because

I'm a playa, I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa, I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa, I'm a playa
Oh, oh, oh, I'm a playa

I'm a playa
I'm a playa, I'm a playa
Oh, oh, oh, I'm a playa
(Yeah, Tech- Tech- Tech Nina is a playa)

I'm a playa in every sense of the word ya heard
I'm gettin' money from these dummies, flip your chick so absurd
I'm a playa and I pop collars
I'm a playa when I don't or when I drop dollars
Them Rottweilers
She don't want no softie sayin' he do when he don't
She don't want no perpetratin' nine-to-fiver tryin' to flaunt
She don't want no punk that can't get it crunk
No she don't
That's how it goes so my homie Kaliko, tell 'em what she want

She want a playa, not thugs on dubs
We be rolling them 22's and 3's, popping ludes and V's
I'm in hot pursuit of a prostitute
Kaliko knock boots, gots lots to shoot
And I'm pullin' out the latex and givin' it to who's next
I'm pullin', pull a brunette with unforgettable sex
She's oohin' oohin' new sweat and I ain't tellin who's wet
And I ain't gettin' loose yet, so who's next for group sex

I'm a playa, I'm a playa

(Listen closely, this is something you might not know)
Never ever tell your love where else you get your love
Move in groups, no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies, throw away your ticket stub
If you sexin', learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water, don't put no soap on your washcloth
That way when you get home
No questions, you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap 'cause it will leave a scent
Don't tell a number 2 that she's your one and only
'Cause if she knows we're easy to go her own way
If you takin' chickens to your secret home, hey
Always go the back way to confuse 'em, just go the long way
To all my ladies if you playin' throw your hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw your grands up
This is forever baby, havin' clever thangs
I'm a playa mothafucka and I bet I never change

I'm a playa, I'm a playa

Black, I mean ya know, you understand what I'm sayin'?

F-U-C-K Y-O-U

They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on

They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one

Yo.. yo.. check.. check..
Don't nobody wanna deal with a nigga that got it together
For real, and even think his own thoughts
Everybody wanna do what everybody else do
When the ""copycat"" is what they been taught
I'ma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain, and I'ma give it to the rap game
The way you're doin' it, the way you're pursuin' it
You're gonna ruin the feelin', it's a goddamn shame
Are you ready for the real? Here we go now
Most on the radio can't flow now
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another Pac or an O-Town
We can't have a contest or a showdown
With two guys got the same kinda flow sound
Tecca Nina; I'm comin' to put the mo' down
Run up in the record label with the fo' pound
Am I too versatile? Cursed to drown in the bowels of the Earth
When I'll be first to growl, and burst out the fouls
Of the original murderous verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one winnin' the race
That's real, I'm speakin' to everyone in the place
I can deal what ya don't like; the drum and the bass
If you can deal with a motherfuckin' gun in your face
I can't get wit' it
Record labels in the industry are sick wit' it
P.D.'s that really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch - if you diss my hit, you might get pistol-whipped
Catch him in the hall - hit 'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans, they can get it all
'Cause the industry is punks! - check I'm ready to get crunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump!

They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one

How many 2Pac's and Jay-Z's and Master P's can they conceive?
Don't they know a few Glocks, 380s, and Master Keys'll make 'em bleed?
How you gonna say
Black people won't listen to this and don't listen to that?
Like sayin' a fool can slang 'caine
A fool can gangbang but never will get hit with a gat?
You better - get your story straight
'Cause I ain't no devil for real - I'm a rebel for real
That Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You a pebble to real niggas - songs like ""Psycho Bitch"" and ""Real Killa""
""Einstein"", ""Niggas"" after mill still-a
The idiots say black folks won't feel us
What you think we dumb?
Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showin' original tongue, it'll be fun
But the motherfuckers with the bums and the weak ones
Suge Knight punked the industry quick
That's because most the industry's bitch!
Nigga I'm a man, I don't be runnin' from nobody
We deal with the niggas who trippin' and givin' us shit
Radio won't play the Unk Fay
Thought they wanted rap to advance but they Ont Day
When I die I'ma aunt hay
Every industry's rackin 'em, givin money to the Unk Pay
Tech and Technico, dead peo-ple, involved from K.C. to Mex-i-co
Strapped with that fat Desert Eagle
Run up on the industry and let the heat go!

They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on

They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one

You can look into my E-Y-E's and you can see why these
Motherfuckers don't wanna see my steez
'Cause I'm a killa with lyricals comin' down like miracles and
I come from a kingdom of humble drums and hums become rumbles
I'm the one that begun the gun tongue
Get sprung, now everyone comin' in bundles
Act like a bitch; treated like a bitch
Act like a chump; treated like a chump
When the funk jump - what ya gonna want?
Ain't gon' want nothin' - industry punk
You can run but you can't hide from the riot
So you can say that it's dope but I won't buy it
You can think Tech N9ne really won't fly
But I got a killa ear and a killa eye
Def Jam take chances; in my opin-ions
They give advances; to the niggas that's really on
Universal, Loud, LaFace - that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots; most of 'em on some heinous shit
That other shit; call your mother, sis, or ya brother bitch
Not no lover licks, packin' black and fat, blubber shit
Yeah the radio dead! - 'cause the industry is punks! (punks!)
Put the double-barrel to his forehead!

They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on

They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on

Now that's absolute power bitch, that's real shit
We ain't kissing no motherfuckin' ass to be accepted

Look at all you player haters frownin'
Raw! God said: ""Kill 'em all!"" Tech's back's to the wall!
Fightin' for my life and I'ma bust back 'til they fall!
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs
I'm hollin' one-eight-seven if you trippin' with Strange
I'm really real with it, like my homie AJ say, ""Deal with it""
Pushin' and pullin', fightin' for the meal ticket
In a minute I'ma do it like a villian, I'ma get 'em in the middle of a bomb
Put 'em on the spot 'til the funk go pop and I bet he never have another quam
Tech Nizzle! When I'm thizzled it's, ""Who be you?""

Absolute Power! That's the only way to roll!
Absolute Power! They love us everywhere we go!

Absolute Power! Absolute Power!

I do hip hop! And I mix it with the hard rock!
Designing this rhyming for climbing
Tech N9ne he's unwinding the shining is blinding
Greedy so we constantly grinding
I've been in the game 16 years making rap tunes
Raising hella havoc up in the classroom
Now in '02 you can watch me clownin', diamonds shinin'
Watching DVD's on the Hoshitoshi (It's all Jesus!)
Now I keep the crowds pumpin', they jumpin'
Get back to the telly we rollin' and stickin' somethin'
Racing to the main line
Absolute Power is having Halle Berry and Juliette Lewis at the same time
Oh! That's how Strange niggas run
Listen to the villian with the gun-associated tongue
(We're close to the end) But not done
The Tech's just begin, begun, beginning to begin to have fun
The curse is tryin' to put me in the hearse
But I will not tumble, first thing's first;
Took a lot of shit and I can't take more
Fuck Jay Ferus and everybody down with him and fuck JCOR!

Thanks to Strange Music I'm comin' and all my enemies they runnin'
Now all my haters bummin' 'cause I was summoned
We Kansas City players and we 'bout soul game
We make it so Tecca Nina is a household name
How many points you got? I got 50
Here's a question to the Censorship Committee
""Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?""
My villians are gritty
Big Scoob, Txx Will, Bakarii,
 
rest in peace Short Nitty
Foul with the evil ways, power's what the people say
Rebel yellin' we're felons and my pockets are swellin'
This beat's from Berlin, Germany
Throwin' up Mizzizzy so ain't no other city concernin' me
I teach it and I speak it very loosely
Stamina gunnin' got player haters runnin' profusely

Put a couple of hands of grease in my hair
And in my eyebrows and now I'm tight
I wanna be with a woman and just this one
But the taste of blood is still on my tongue
If I could just eat food instead of her D boobs
I want this one alive when the morning comes

I just wanna be a normal boy
Just wanna be a normal boy
If I could be good and just
Keep the women off my tongue
Then she can be my number one
Lady!
I just wanna be a normal boy

If I could be good and just
Keep the women off my tongue

Just give me just one more clit
One more tit, one more bitch
What does I gotta do to get me fixed?
'Cause I gotta have this one in my mix
She's so beautiful I would slit
Both my wrists, if she split
When she finds out that I'm so sick
I eat women
I really eat women
They're really delicious
I gotta be normal so I can make her the Mrs
I gotta date with her so I can tell her my wishes
Even though I'm a beast but she don't know that I'm vicious
So I meet her at her place and she's so sweet
Made me dinner but really want her meat
From her cheek, maybe her feet
I'm trying to be discrete
But I really want to eat her out
Completely, teach me
To keep it away from her
The eating and taping on her
The chewing away fingers
Once she feeds me I'm lovin' me tastin' her
Can I just have a normal night?
I just wanna be the man to live a normal life
Normal wife, keep her in the formal white
But the psycho creature with the horn will bite
It's almost sun up now
I'm getting done up, wow!
Fellatio! But I found out she was insatiable
She wanted me to do her too
Don't want to see me through her view
'Cause I got on my knees and started doin' my deed
But then I accidentally chewed her through

Just wanna be a normal boy

Keep the women off my tongue

Yeah, technicians, mercenaries, believers, strangers, let's go

Cloverdale, thirteen-hundredth block
Where you from? From my hood, I took a hundred shots
Got my chain up on sunset in front of all the stars
Gio, NONMS, Plex, Wrek and Bernz, it’s like it’s all of ours
Said I need my own parade
Fuck it, give me hand grenades
Watch me make a suicide salad out a rap ballad
For the love of the kill, I kill for the love
I'm murderin' this track and you won't see no blood
Cause I got my Dodger blue on
They ask what squad are you on
Strange gang nigga, 'till I'm stiff with a suit on
Disrespect the clique, and oh, you know they ain't got far to go
That's when I grab em by the neck, hit 'em with that RKO
Outta nowhere, I'm on my viper shit
Might just have to resurrect the dead and bring back Piper's pit
Cause' we about to teach the industry a strange lesson
Just when they think they found the answer, we change the question

Dirty boots, heavy eyes, hot summer, watch 'em fry
Like inside my backpack, headed towards the other side
I don't give a fuck I'll let y'all take a glimpse inside my mind
Enter at your own risk though, be careful what you find
I'm a grimy despot, tyranny on my desktop
Ruling over the rulers with nothin' less than the best pot
Enemies take they best shots, outta range in my sweatshop
Turn a page on my rage and you know there's pain in my hip-hop
I'm Marty McFly, and these bitches just ain't from the future
Their music is tired, rewire your fucking computers
Got fuel and fire but quiet is all in the shooters
I feel like a tutor giving lessons to children enthusers
Strangeulation, bitch, don't let me start losing my patience
And burn 'em down if ain't it Strange in your radio station
I’m yelling ¡MAYDAY!, in front of the judge and all the plaintiffs
I don't give a fuck, man, I lost my mind and that's just contagious

From beneath the stars, Wrek is the definition of underrated
Gotta walk with a pop, cause the heat that we drop has been so understated
Give me my props, or get left behind with no horse and saddle
We bringing hitters to Strange, figures the road is fragile
We got some Jack in the bag, and we stacking the fact that you can't get it cracking
Don't need a half a mil to battle, taking anybody's challenge
So if you want it then hop on board and just keep your balance
'Cause Strange will have you feeling 'bout as fly as Ritchie Valens
Bitch ass, my cyphers known to cut you quick, fast
Get a whiplash from the big gash that I be leaving on ya, making all the kids laugh
And I be dropping bars like all stars, check the call card
On y'all to drop bombs off when I'm hauled off against pawn stars
Guess that's what happens when you let the tweakers come for all the bacon

But I wouldn't be real if I didn't

I be sittin' by myself and I be thinkin', ""Momma, what have I become?""
All I wanted was a family, but when I look up, you the only one
Losing everything but money, everybody left and I don't even get to see my young
Only happiness I get is in the studio or when I get to do another run
On the road, doin' shows, get the woes, when it slows
Gettin cold, getting old, but the flows, gettin' sold
I've been doin' this a minute but I think I wanna end it 'cause I'm on a higher level when I go
But the music I be doin', it be losin' 'em and make it really tough for me to grow
All I wanted was a family portrait, see my babies on a ranch with horses
But I was fucking devil bitches in corsets
I was livin' really good then I torched it
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, I'm speakin' for real and I never meant to make your daughter cry
But I guess I'm a failure with women I'm lost and I feel like I ought to die
Feel like that I'm rotting away, my life is just off in the grey
How much does it cost? I will pay, to lay, and be off in a coffin today
I mean off in ashes, this life ain't after it clashes, If I get blasted
This is Suicide Letters all over again, I thought that I passed it
But I guess that I didn't, 'cause this one is written and there is no mending
When I'm broke I'm a joke, when I croak I just hope that I won't be descending
But this ain't a joke, I want you to know that Tech Ninna is never pretending
Alone in my bed, with a gun to my head, asking, ""where is my happy ending?""
Yeah

Tell me how it ends

What about me? Where is my happy ending?
What about me? Is this a life worth living?
You know how it begins, but how does it end for me?
Will I ever win, or does he have it in for me?
Will this stop before I stop breathing?
Is there light in this dark I'm seein'?

I put my life in this music
, Nina is inside out
I set my heart out for people, they know what the inside 'bout
Will they keep feelin' Nina forever? This I doubt
Can never cry for help, so if you listenin' this my (Shout!)
I'm searching for the passage way to happiness
But i'm worldly so I have to lay in nastiness
Yes, this is Strange year, worldwide fame's near, but the game's queer
Sometime I feel like I'm Rudolph the Reindeer
But instead of a red nose, I stay in my red clothes
And the music they said blows, is on top and the cred grows
Can you resurrect a motherfucker that feel like he posses a dead soul
Deteriorate to an inferior state almost equal to bread mold
Now as my head goes, wish I could shed those
Because all the times the Nina was shorted, what I bled froze
So now that I'm cold blooded, and hella sick is what the med shows
The tread slows, and don't even think you reviving a dead rose
Yeah

Tell me how it ends

What about me? Where is my happy ending?
What about me? Is this a life worth living?
You know how it begins, but how does it end for me?
Will I ever win, or does he have it in for me?
Will this stop before I stop breathing?
Is there light in this dark I'm seein'?

I'm on the verge of insanity, but I'm competent
I'm breakin' so I pick this one to vent
The reason I look away when you talk to me my brain is producin' evilness
I'm drownin' in 151 and Rumple Minze
That's how I feel

I sit in the mirror with this gun and practice how to kill
But I know damn well that the people like me really wanna know how to chill
This life is about a check, about a number, about a bill
Think about all the love I lost because my quest is about a mill
I feel like you're stupid, don't talk to me I'm crackin' up
And I don't mean laughter, I'm full of bitterness and it's backing up
And I live with angels, but lately demons been shackin' up
Tug of war with my spirit, see the blood I'm hacking up?
I love my kids and my fans inside I sob harder
'Cause you pay the price for my life and it's right like Bob Barker
And I won't pretend that it's okay I'm no facade starter
So I guess my only happy ending's in a massage parlor
Yeah

Tell me how it ends

What about me? Where is my happy ending?
What about me? Is this a life worth living?
You know how it begins, but how does it end for me?

Who think they fast enough and vast enough to step to him, and then he, uh

Looked in the mirror like, ""Dwamn""
I ain't gotta use a filter on the 'Gram, ain't no glam

Ha! Ha! Ha!
Hungry! Hungry!
Starving!

I think it's safe to say I'm a monster
Yeah, because killin' is my mantra
Fellas wanna see me dead up yonder
But the women are fond of Ron, it’s Don they conjure
I’m big-headed 'cause Tecca N9na stay breaded
I get it the wettest, competitive, I just shredded your bed
It’s the crevice I fetish, call the medic you’re deaded
Push and pull, you’re placed at pathetic
Soul is so not sympathetic
I’m on a roll, creepin' and I am outta control
Women see Tecca N9na as the matter in the commode
So I’m in there, like swimwear
On a lady that’s ridin' inside of what’s skin bare
I’m so hard, niggas don’t even wanna face me
But it’s the opposite with their women, they taste me
So many hoes witness the trouble I bring, they cling for the stream
I’m the king, I go by the name of ""the thing""

It's sorta like a whatchamacallit (The thing!)
If you ever saw it (The thing, the thing!)
Give it to you like there's no tomorrow
Sorta like both of ours (The thing, the thing!)
You believe in what you believe in, B.I.G. for a reason (The thing, the thing!)
All in 'em like I live in 'em hoes
The thing's what I'm givin' 'em though

Heart breaker, body part taker
From your lady, negras hate us 'cause thou art fakers
Schemin' when seekin' I found a tush
When I blow that kush with a rhyme, and I be beatin' around the bush
Area, I'm scarier than malaria, the carrier of hysteria
I swear he's just nefarious, with hairy nuts, the cherries bust
Don't tell me to zip it, I'm wicked
Your ladies, they take me in like a whip it
Got a mind of my own, I'm in a zone
I get deep into her like Tech N9ne in a song
You can't tell me nothin', I'm in my prime and I'm grown
My homie N9na behind, I still climbin' alone
Ill spit, real sick, need help real quick
See nobody can hit the kill switch
Still chill chicks, come and get me somethin' that I can feel, bitch
Drill stick, I am Tech N9ne's dilsnick

It's sorta like a whatchamacallit (The thing!)
If you ever saw it (The thing, the thing!)
Give it to you like there's no tomorrow
Sorta like both of ours (The thing, the thing!)
You believe in what you believe in, B.I.G. for a reason (The thing, the thing!)

I watched Snoop do it, he let that blue flag hang
So watch Scoob do it, I'mma let the brown rag swang
Middle deuce to it, boy that's just a five six thang
Now SOO WOO! WOO! That's how we rep this gang
I ain't new to it, vill I got that bang in my veins
And I'm true to it, all I know is bangin' and 'caine
So get used to it, validation now I'm with Strange
OG villain off the block representer of them flames

I pledge allegiance to the flag, my united hoods of Damu and trees
I'm certified, around the top banging was so influencing
I made it with my heart, a vendetta, in hopes of unity
And left out a with family, a forty cal and a newer me
Deuce click represent, red rag regiment
Redrum replicants, whips runt recreate
Rest won't recommend, refs don't let you win
Red Rider Warriors we rectify the testament we

Niggas think the feds came and got me when they got West Crook
A vet, look, pull up stuntin' and get your vet took
Or we could stand mano y mano and get your best whooped
Knuckle up knucklehead, nigga been with this knuckle game
Still fuckin' with Scoob, Kutt and Kali, baby ain't nothin change (STRANGE!)
I ride for em without the paper work, and organize drive-by's that have you and your neighbor hurt
Send a couple down and hey you and your neighbor mercked
Show you I ain't playin' fuck around and knock your neighbor first
It's Skatterman, pussy more than just the verses son
Who you think Tech gonna call to make sure that the dirt get done
Red cap, red shirt, red shoe strings
My .45 is a bitch, and I think she havin' mood swings (mood swings?)
You think them boys got guns watch what your dude bring
Fully auto AR-15, wipe out the Blue Team!


Beats bangin' better bring it big or bounce bitch
'Bout to blast it in blood I'm back in this black brick
Boss balla, been breakin' bread 'n baguettes brie
And beautiful biancas, bideos, and Begas with big B
Bow been for brilliance, stressed to be buildin' it
Best in this barrio bane and bazaar be more bills in this
Bankin' his babies be blingin' and his boo be that big booty!
Big bust! Be in his Benzo bronze and get big bucks!
I'm a black baboon, bring me bags of bananas
Bona fide, billy bad ass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bacardi 'bou Lou but I'm 'bout to be bigger bent
Better break if you bustin' before I'm blown and belligerent
Six deuce brims biggin' it, I'm bloated than Blimpy
Broads be blowin' me in the back of the black Bentley
Never been about no babblin' not bringing no bootsy
But I've been in the bay with big bond like shaboobalaboopy!

Yo it's the OG Bumpy Knucks, Knucks I rolls with them B. Boys

You can talk that killer shit if you want my niggas, spit it
Guarantee that you'll get clapped up-up
See I'm the beast, you the bitch, I'm better battling baby

And for the record nigga, check mines and you will find

Come on, to be like Bump ya gotta be a big ball breaker (Pow!)
Crack a nigga whole rack I'm like a jaw breaker (Crack!)
Knock you out and and hit them pockets like a cold hand

Mama Nem,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Let's go, yeah
I feel this one mane
And this one is long overdue
It’s ’bout my Mama Nem
My mama, her sisters, her brothers, grandma too man
I just wanna take this time to speak about mama nem
Yeah, check it

She carried me when she was fifteen
Had me when she was sixteen
Reminiscing on how well she did things
Got one popped on 11/8/71, she had this king
She was baring that on that day
I was just a staring upon that face
With her, just declaring, my mom said ""Wait""
Then her and her sisters named me Aaron Dontez Yates
She tried to give me everything I seen
KCP&L Gas Service was her means for green
Took me to the movies one day for Halloween to scream
Got me a big wheel couldn't afford a green machine
But I loved it
When I got it, all my friends swarming
Cause in the projects big wheels wasn’t the norm
And I’m pouring this out to the woman I’m adoring
She knew I like Sugar Smacks and a fried balogna sandwich in the morning

Mama
I take you everywhere I go
I thank you’re mine, that's my momma nem
I only know what I know 'cause of my mama nem
You gave me life and made me me
I don’t know who I’d be without
My auntie nem, my sisters and, my uncle nem
Mama nem

When I got bad grades I was in the heat seat
Got a whoppin when I used another kids cheat sheet
But when I got a good grade card she bought me Beat street
The single, ayo I had that mug on repeat
Mama nem taught me rythm that I use yep
My uncle nem say’s stay on your P’s and Q’s neph’
Mama talking catch you, if you actin' like you deaf
God-fearing still taught me how to two-step
Took me to church, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Than Sunday thinking why me?
That was mama nem placin’ the love inside me
Our house was lively
My granny house, 8 girls and 4 boys beside me
Thanking Mama nem, for the weight that you carry
Pulling my teeth with thread sayin “boy you scary”
I ‘memba mama laughin sayin’ “Is it loose?”
“Very”
Pull it then, put cash in my pillow sayin’ its the tooth fairy

Mama
I take you everywhere I go
I thank you’re mine, that's my momma nem
I only know what I know 'cause of my mama nem
You gave me life and made me me
I don’t know who I’d be without
My auntie nem, my sisters and, my uncle nem
Mama nem

Epilepsy at 18, the lupus hit her
Pancreatitus was taking her but God was with her
I asked to show me something 'cause I was all bitter
Right after that the pancreatitus had all withered
Mama? “Yeah”
Mama!! “What?”
MAMA!!! “WHAT Boy?”
I’m a big timer
I’m always away from you 'cause of this music biz drama
But I really miss you and I’m always thinking ’bout big mama
She used to make that Thanks Giving and Christmas dinner
Grandma’s home cooking easily show up Mrs Winners
Mama nem would take you in even if you’re vicious sinner
Nobody would ever take that humungous love that's within her
If your mama gone, heavens where mum belongs
But if your momma home, call ya momma phone
And say I love you momma and you are not alone
I just wanted to thank you and that's why I made this momma song

Mama
I take you everywhere I go
I thank you’re mine
I only know what I know cause of my mama nem
You gave me life and made me me
I don’t know who I’d be without

Killing You,K.O.D.,2009.0,"You're the meanest person on this planet
I can't even say anything more than that
You are the fuckin' devil!
You have fun making your goddamned K.O.D. album
'Cause that's what you are, the King of Darkness
You're nothing but fuckin' hell!

I was born a beast, you don't wanna meet
I'm the worst, a lot of women see the demon in me
Still they want a piece, they want me carnally
A lot of them are really searchin' for the semen in me
I let 'em know at the front, I lust demon
The wannabe bust kitty, you're rubbin', I love many
They trust me with the cunt and I thrust plenty
And jump in the next city, they wanted me, just kidding
But I can never tell a lie, if you look into my eyes you can see that I'm a
(Angel / Demon)
Lookin' for the love in every thigh, makin' you wanna cry, spirit'll be
(Strangled / Screaming)
That I'm a serial killer when it come to heartbreakin', hate and the fury, you better cynic and it starts makin'
Everything wrong, everything's gone
So why do you say that you will forever ding-dong?
That just will make you much meaner, that's some mistake to love N9na
It sucks to hate the one thing that makes you come clean
Then breaks and just leave you
I'm just a fucked up individual
I love lust and crushin' you for an interval
Plus bust the gush off in a centerfold
Eating a meaty muff like it's a dinner roll
You should have kept away like I told you
How can you press to stay when I'm rover?
I think it's safe to say that my fate's to lay and I'ma waste away when I'm older
So just step and give me the cold shoulder
'Cause I'm a mess, the N9na's the most vulgar
And I'm a threat, you'll never get no closure
My kiss is killing you, wake up and it's over

Why can't you see me for the animal I am? (I warned you!)
Expose my beast inside? Yes, dear, you are willing to (Willing to, willing to, willing to)
You took my invitation and they all told you never to take me in
Why can't you wake up and see that I am killing you? (Killing you, killing you, killing you)

I never knew why I had to be so cold
Inside of me so froze, it's gotta be no soul
Because when a lady want me in oath mode
I put on my ghost clothes and get on a close road
I'm tryin' to tell you that I'm sick in thee encephalon
I thought I could do it, but I'm guessin' we can never bond
As long as I'm chasin' the gold like a leprechaun
My heart'll be covered in cold ice and tef-lon
I'm sick with it, I'm brick with it, N9ne twisted it
Ten times outta ten, if you lookin' for what it stems
I guarantee that you gonna find a bitch did it
But I'm takin' it back, I won't blame it on you
'Cause I be the one that be gamin' on you
Famous and heinous the painin' you do
'Cause I'm blatantly playing and laying the crew
I ain't proud of what I turned into
All my fire keeps burning through, burning you
Up in the inside, I'm knowin' the heat is concerning you
I don't know what's gonna become of me
All I can say is don't anyone love me
Because I'm a monster, I'm sick and I want ya
But you better back up and when I come shove me
But then again I really, really need you
I want up inside of you, wanna bleed you
To get the last drop and then I'ma leave you
Every last one of you I'ma speed through
Covering every lady wanna see you
Open up wide, I wanna feed you
Into the pit of evilness, I'ma lead you
(I'm an animal, take what I like then release you!)

Why can't you see me for the animal I am? (I warned you!)
Expose my beast inside? Yes, dear, you are willing to (Willing to, willing to, willing to)
You took my invitation and they all told you never to take me in
Why can't you wake up and see that I am killing you? (Killing you, killing you, killing you)

No wonder why you kept walkin'

My mom was 18, waiting for her prom date
Which was my father, yes, this night's gonna be beyond great
Two years prior they both created Aaron Yates
So the bond straight with two fine mates, so mom waits
And waits, in the upstairs window watchin'
For my pops and it was shockin' that he never ever came knockin'
Just left her, in her prom dress and that's the eve
Where all the stress hit aggressively, she had her first epileptic seizure
And kept havin' them, doctor, help the sick lady
Medicine with the quickness, just maybe it'll stop
'Member this, in '80 I was, nine
Asleep and I heard somethin' collapse
Hopped up with nothin' but tighty whitie
Saw my mom just fell and slapped the floor
She shakin', I'm scared, I ran out the house in my underwear
""Help my mama"" is all that's comin' out my mouth
A neighbor came to help so mama wouldn't die
As a little kid, watchin' the ambulance take her away, I'm thinkin' ""Why?""

Cause it was all meant to happen

No wonder why you kept walkin' my way
Cause it was all meant to happen

'92, I was 21
Sellin' rocks for my auntie was plenty fun
And yes she loaded the house with many guns
She got me a TEC-9 for my birthday, ""No more trippin' from anyone""
Is what I’m thinkin', Boone's Farm’s what I’m drinkin'
Singin' Jodeci loaded, we exploded, these chicks I’m binkin'
Daily, nightly, the ladies like me, I’m baby Ikie
Maybe slightly, I’m crazy might be
Really shady, sheisty not like this though
I’m sleepin' again, this dude breaks in with a pistol
I heard his bullet whistle, so I had to roll of on this flo'
Heard a struggle then my auntie scream, I’m feelin' for my piece
Then, just my luck, my birthday gift that I got wasn't in my reach
The gunman busted in my room lookin' for somethin'
Found me hidin', pointed the gun right at my head, my heart was pumpin'
Then he turned and ran away then with a blink of an eye
He was gone, I found my auntie shakin', hidin' in the closet, I’m thinkin' ""Why?""

Dear Darkness, you've been with me for so long
I never understood, 'til now in this slow song
Been in some shaky situations, but life goes on
But still, a lot of things you showed this kid was so wrong
But what's so right, this pain and strife that I go write
People go buy it, they think that my flow's tight
Got a cold mic, they got me a million sold twice
Not a low-life anymore it’s always sold-out show nights
After K.O.D. you scared me, so I ran from you
Then accepted you on Seepage, then saw the fans come through
Just when I thought I took everything I can stand from you
I kept writing and then we watched the Strangeland come true
So now I see, these stories in my life
I was meant to share my darkness within my light
People say it helps them to see me fly
From the bottom, that’s motivation for them all, now I see exactly why

Alucard,Seepage,2010.0,"From the depths of Misery I stood th-there, now and forever
Exodus, insanus, nocturnus

Alucard when I'm on stage
Alucard in the booth when I'm loose and see no days
When it's too right I be rippin' the mic everyday
And every night a nigga won't lay down for no one, towns'll go from
Down under surround the globe to flow some
Timeless lyrics, I'm that spirit that keep it young but the old one
Handle my business, 
other rappers have no stamina in this
They be livin' glits and glam and they finish
But I've been in it since the man did begin it, will be 'til they end this shit
But why is the Nina so intricate? And his life is seeming so infinite
They call him a demon when he steadily feedin' the need'n be keepin' it limitless
I was back in the days when the rappin' amazed
Everybody wanna rap at the waves
A lot of the rappers up from the passin' away
But I was there and nigga, I'm still here, the killa that been feared
For livin' in them years and leavin' 'em in tears
Hella fast when he say, the lyrical lash and with a passion he spray
Alucard in your dreams, everlasting life ain't hard as it seems
Part of the thing, rapper eatin' rappers up
If you step you gon' start a machine
Losing so many lives, all alone in the skies
I've been livin' so long and this music was still goin' through it
Seen so many die
 (2X)
Alucard everlasting, timeless bars when I'm rapping
All these stars never last yet I will still stand while everyone's passing

Been around for the rise and fall of many, it's plenty of y'all
They was in the game heavy involved, now you ain't livin' at all
A lot of these people looked dead at me, then I knew it would be the heridity
Never credited me now they wanna know the secret to my longevity
I think it's in my blood,
 
my scent begins to flood
Everybody on the planet understand it, I give them a drug
And I get no rest time until it's set shines
I say it's Alucard, you call it Tech N9ne!
By now you know I'm more than just a rapper
I will be now and yes I will be after
I am older than fucking ghetto blasters
But they wonder why youngsters love me, label me master
I am faster than all of you bastards
Livin' at the bottom, I got up and then
I brought 'em a bullet from a gun, I'mma long laster
Now you ask for explanation, my last word
A-L-U-C-A-R-D, read it backwards
 (2X)

Alucard everlasting
Still frying while watching their demise
Yet, I am not, the only one, of my kind
Ice Cube is one of us
Snoop Dogg is one of us
Busta Bus' is one of us
Nasty Nas is one of us

Ugly Duckling,Klusterfuk,2012.0,"I'm this way cause I got up and got it
When I was the oddest to demolish the hottest scholars
With all of this God-ish product
Call it way polished, I jotted
Dotted then they got it bollocks'd
Stayed modest but brought it psychotic
Thought, it's raw and sick
But everybody didn't wanna give a nigga the time of day
How will I ever reach another when I'm in the grave
I gotta be different to get the grip with the pace
Say, say, say what you want about Nina
The one who's wishing he coming up missing
That one is a dreamer
Calling me ugly I laugh
Cause I'm rough as rugby and fast
Industry's chubby and flab
You look sick, pudgy and crass
Now your chick wanna hug me and smash
And look lovely with cash instead of muggy and clash
You act like we was buddies in class
Got my painted face
Ain't it great?
Really illuminated made it with entertainer's space
Better to bring it straight and gain it late than aim at fake
Fame, as for my brain its fate
That I strained in faith
And became the great
Yates!

No love or nothin', just blood and sufferin' for the ugly duckling
No love or nothin', just blood and sufferin' for the ugly duckling
Trust me, trust me nothin', trust me, trust me nothin'
Is worse than knowin' you're beautiful, but get treated like an ugly duckling
Trust me, trust me nothin', trust me, trust me nothin'
Is worse than knowin' you're beautiful, but get treated like an ugly duckling

Ever since I came out the womb and I was birthed to the planet
It's like the Earth couldn't stand it, I was just worthless abandoned
So I write verses in cursive to try and cope with the damage
Citizens gave me, you hoto’s gon' feel my curses in Spanish
Hoppin' in hearses then vanish, though not the first to be banished
Or ostracized cuz I prophecised how the church is scareless
See my words are just managed, perfectly perched on a canvas
Paintin a picture with scriptures, with my fellow dirty from Kansas
So I'mma spit on the wax and flip on a track and spit all my pain
Rather than give me a gat, empty the mac, shatter and split off my brain
People are strange
Hoisters be spendin' a dime on the top tryna get on a chains
I have to devise me a plot to then capitalize on my stock
And then get me some change
See all the hate that they gave me it fuel my passionate speech
Made me react on the track and start whoopin' ass on the beat
So since I'm Rudolph my nose is up like I flew off the grease
Head in the sky, hella fly and high like I blew off the suite


It's about god damned time
Go ahead shine the light over here over darkness
What ya thought? We were gonna play dead, roll over and add up losses
Damn fools
No more playin' cool politicking with the rules eat fools in the carcass
Cause we back well season the leave
And don't believe the vegan on sausage
But don't ride dick now, and act like your light bulb's lit now
Keep signin' the killers and fat drug dealers really the big shit now
(Take a big shit now)
I gotta state these niggas be weak runnin' round like they nuts cut loose
Can't even shake a nigga hand gotta dab a nigga up
Fuck around and touch butt fuck juice
Mayday to the pay day to they say we stay don't cut that noose
Yes, off with the heads then it's off to the bed
Gettin' head like duck-duck-goose (Awoo!)
Technicians form a petition to never ever let it up
On a rapper that sucks in this industry fucks
With a bucks that wanna hit and swarm from a duck
Crystal meth, cocaine, e pills
With a little weed fill and a lotta freewill
Add a couple refills to whenever we spill
Won't see thrills like these skills on a steep hill
That's some hott shit, that's hott shit

Habanero,Planet,2018.0,"Your journey from Earth to Planet Pyune has been successful
When exiting this aircraft, a Speedom-mobile will be assigned to you
Ah

Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Let me hear you talking, I'm so far away
Let me hear a single word that you say
Feel like y'all just mad at my dinero
All I gotta say, ""You think you hot, lit, bitch I'm habanero""

Nothing identical
Bussin' I mimic no fuckin' bug, I'm crushin' thy tentacles
Suckas be huffin' and puffin' 'cause I'm touchin' my pinnacle
Cussin' my menace flow, now their women are suckin' my genitals
They flip 'cause so many is the heat
I got the remedy all of my enemies feel ignominious defeat
Knowin' it finna be like an infinite lettin' 'em have it
I wreck and I ravage, a Tech and a Travis make the record a savage
I popped a muffin, I skywalk for nothin'
But takin' you higher levels when I rock percussion
I'm at the top of the list in a fly chop discussion
It's fried hot on my block and I'm not the Cuzzin
The eye lock is sudden
Whenever the people see me they cry lots of lovin'
We high notch the oven
And my clock's-a-buzzin' when you're done and you die, drop fo' dozen (Roses!)

Can't get too close 'cause I'm real
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
My temperature make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Keep it lit up and I'm still
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
I got no brakes and no chill
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Let me hear you talking, I'm so far away
Let me hear a single word that you say
Feel like y'all just mad at my dinero
All I gotta say, ""You think you hot, lit, bitch I'm habanero""

LAJFA the wealthy and not the poors that've got not
So I'm bringing the heat and I'm walkin' on agua
'Cause if I'm a penny pusher that be like blah-blah
And never listen to see if you habanero
So I'm stuck in the booth and I'm Colin Farrell
I'm sweatin' with every second I'm destined like I'm an arrow
Aimin' right at your chest if you effin' with my dinero
Get out! Nobody touchin' the Tecca Nina
If you feeling you can do better, then you a dreamer
I'm gonna live and givin' critics the middle finger
Bringing hella disaster, ain't nobody no FEMA
Welcome to my planet, we damage and we can chop
Killers with the advantage, we manage to be the top
Competitors ain't no better 'cause we the head of the flock
We made the Planet Rock, now I'm gonna make your credit drop
And it stops...

Can't get too close 'cause I'm real
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
My temperature make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Keep it lit up and I'm still

Devil Boy,Anghellic: Reparation,2003,"And I want the congregation to check yourself
Watch who you worship, watch who your children praise!
Like your so-called hometown hero Tech N9ne
That boy ain't nothing but the devil, can I get an amen?
You know I'm right about it
He ain't nothing but a devil boy!

Who the hell is Satan? And why I gotta be him?
I ain't worshiped Nathan, so why you gotta see him?
When you look at me, is it the imagery?
It's gotta be god-l-y, evil's not my energy
I pose as angels clothes is mangled
Instead of Girbaud and Kangols, the ho's still dangle
I chose the angle of souls who tangle
With foe's those who stain your brain so bane though painful
Shit is what they like, hit is what they might
Spit his stuff in life, shit is fuckin' tight
But some people think it's an evil experiment
Some people is fearin' it, those who do Beatles is hearin' it
Sincerity is neezle sin
People who look and never listen
They thinkin' that I'm the tyranny of evil men
But I just tell it like it is dude
My life story's quite gory, spittin' even if it is rude
So ain't no brimstone, I ain't no Jim Jones
So put your grins on, listen to them songs
And you will see that they be classics verbal gymnastics
You call me Lucifer, go to hell you bastard

They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell

Hot Christians, pop my disc in
Stop the dissin', squat and listen
I never say hail Satana
I'll never bail out and sell out and sell gay drama
Hey mama, they trying to crucify me like Jesus
Religious groups deny me like skeezers
We mic pleasers, rip it and write heaters
Niggas that ain't pleased, with quickness are light readers
I said Anghellic, then let the man sell it
I let the fans smell it, then I expand relish
But the devil tried to stop me that's JCOR
They thought I'd crumble while it's rocky and stay poor
Deus Vobiscum, we playas go get some sprayers
And hits 'em with layers of slayer inscriptions
That means God be with you, we split dude then hit you
With pistols whip you then giggle never dissing Nizzle again
I talk about the rain, I talk about the sun
I speak about the pain, I speak about the fun
I'm sayin' that I'm bad, I'm sayin that I'm good
I'm saying this to the suburbanites and every hood
Y'all act like I'm sayin' (I love Lucifer, I will kill all of you)
Motherfucker I ain't step into the lime light
To devil worship in front of kids, get your mind right

They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell

They call me devil boy, but I don't like that
Those who recite that, that's where the fights at
'Cause I'm a tight cat, who hella write rap
Even a slight crack, and I'll be right back
To devil worshipers at my signings thinkin' I'm gnarly (huh)
I just wanna go to your parties
So I can run through all your goth bitches, and rock bitches
Take 'em on the block and now they 2Pac bitches
I love the dark side with horror, got archives I'm sure you
Got hard lives, Missourah is our side
And it's hella depressin', hella a stressin'
Retrogression back to depression, a hell of a lesson
This where it gets more sick, don't respect poor pricks
Who listen to this album and then say exorcist
You dense, hence the word 'Ang' it means good
'Hellic' it means bad, you didn't catch it you should have
Idiots make me wanna bust it (rebel toys)
Tried to explain now I say fuck it (several ploys)
Foolish title I can't touch it (devil boy)
'Cause I talk backwards (suseJ sevol uoy)

They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy

Hits in the interim, them are done 'cause here me come

If you don't get it, get rid of it, trip if you diggin' it!
I guess I got mo' than my balls and my word
I got broads in a herd, chasin' this and all of my nerves

I got a bed, it's too crowded for you to come get in it!
I spit that Tech scheiße off to y'all
It's crazy! Even Michael Jackson said it's ""Off the Wall""

I be the best one for gunnin', nobody can get with it!
So when you see me in the spot: bow down, trick
I eat, drink, sleep, dress, look and sound rich
(So jump up, get pumped up, crunked up, everyone must)
Stop with the jealousy with me, the haters be riveted!

In my lou of Caribou sips
The super dew lifts, everybody in the party will lose it
Vodka and Mountain Dew is the new shit
Thanks to IcyRoc and Demonica, we honor ya
And I get so much money sometimes it feel like I'm wearin' a yarmulke
You cannot monitor my money, I'll monetarily astonish ya
So what's with the bad comments and all the drama for?

I'm at the top, but I can be poppin' and shootin' with ya)
Chip on my shoulder now, ""Mr. Nice Guy"" is over, wow!
To a ritzy and older style from ditsy and Gomer Pyle
Look at my checks swell, chicks with wet tails
Ready to rock it, in my pocket got the Trojan Magnum XL's

But when we in this drop, all our records we will dump
Havin' a good time, just stackin' 'em with

Doin' about a hundred fifty with slaps in the Maybach
Haters, of course ya doubt that I'm makin' a warped amount
I got Ozone

That ain't comin' from RBC, that ain't comin' from Fontana
It's comin' from Strange Music's Dontana in a calm manner
I'll say this in baritone, (""We come to get our cheddar!"")
Huntin' you in yo' dreams, you wake up screamin' in falsetto
MTV clipped me, birthday bash show
I got fans like cat castro that'll boost my cash flow!

Drunk at the club and y'all can't stop me
Superstar style, woop to our pals
Out the roof, I scoop the group we troop in large crowds
Yes we are foul and we rich now
Used to be all on me, but it's all on a bitch now
They wanna get me stuck, and come into my world
It's too late I got
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)
I was nineteen, met a nice queen
Car was bright green, naughty as ice cream
But she too jealous Nickolas, sort of ridiculous
With the lip kickin' it
We can never be inconspicuous
(My bitch) Rolls with me, it's so sickly
In love with me, but she give me fellatio hickeys
Would go get me, in the wee hours to get me slow quickies
So sticky, roll with my homies, she so shifty
(My wife) Married a monster, carried a youngster
Said if you cheated would come back to haunt ya
She say my filthy world makes her wanna hurl
And that's my first verse
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)

Daddy told me this, ""You wanna control the chick
Ya gotta go blow her grip, 'cause it's all on a bitch""
One is no trip and two is just mo' lip
But three I can cope with

Daddy told me this, ""You wanna control the chick
Ya gotta go blow her grip, 'cause it's all on a bitch""
One is no trip and two is just mo' lip
But three I can cope with

Got a nice anus, and it's ripe, ain't it?
Can't really touch it durin' the day, but in the night taint it
Usin' fight language when she take inches
Great bitches, gettin' busy on the weight benches
(My bitch) Got a big butt, a big slut, who get bucks
You might luck up and get your chick sucked
'Cause she's bi-sex, keep her thighs wet
Spontaneous I don't know what we gon' try next
(My wife) Got a ghetto booty like Naomi
I'ma tell you like Jayo say
All my bitches havin' fancy dreams
And all my bitches wear Apple Bottom jeans

If one's trippin' the other's for fun, pimpin' you cool
She run's limpin' you end up with funds missin', you fool
Come wicked, your woman becomes vicious and cruel
Dumb trick gets ya fumblin' some chicks and you lose
I done balanced the playalistical values in life
I done challenged the way of mystical powers and hype
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
I'm defiant with an evil twist my girl, my bitch, and my wife
Ain't no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it 'cause Nina macks the three
Have to be, crass to see
If not you'll cause a catastrophe, exact-aly
(My wife) Don't like me
(My bitch) Gets hyphy
(My girl) Might knife me twice just to spite me
(My wife) If I break her heart
(My bitch) It'll rip her apart

And around the night time I get very horny
That's why they call it horny, 'cause the devil's 'supposedly' supposed to have horns
But, who knows if any of that bullshit exists.""

I'm a nice guy... My life's a light sky...
So much love I might cry... Daah! Nice try!
I'm an evil seed, in the day I sleep and the night fly
G.A.Z.E. in my E.Y.E's and you might die
I'm a horn dog, got a lot of that porn y'all
Warned y'all, I was straight born raw like Orenthal
But I'm way worse because he was cornball
I remember keeping him in my dungeon with a leather suit and a orange ball in his mouth
I had some foreign broads in his house
How did they get twisted and torn claws when in bout?
Nine inches then I stuffed they dorn draws in his couch
For now I let 'em suffer in the morn' all then it's ouch
I have a devil's haircut in my mind
That's why I be sucking blood and bustin' nuts in my rhymes, I'm horny
So don't ignore me if you're semi-fine
Me and Gordy, Prozak love orgies and we in our prime and we

Can't hide the (Horns!) And I won't hide the (Horns!)

So if you want the (Horns!) Then I'll give you the (Horns!)

Schizophrenic thoughts spin around my mind sorta like rotisserie
Spittin' this wicked ministry to the beat of this Rebeck symphony
With a sin for me, separated by 6 degrees of greed for centuries
And hatred engulfs my sensories like hallow screams from penitentiaries
This perpetual cycle of depression retention remains bottomless
Even my psychologist said suicide may be the only option out of this
And while the name Prozak and insane seem to sustain synonymous
One half of me wants to engage in the fame while the other half subsides anonymously
A vigilante who sends deadly packages through the mail
Confusing law enforcement agencies 'cause I write death threats in Braille
With somewhat of a God complex sending the Arabs to the depths of hell
I warned you, you were forewarned, now witness thy horns unveiled
I'm taking you on a hell ride so grab those safety belts and fasten 'em
Through the screams of tortured souls and eternal flames crackling
Refusing to reap what you sow and wanna stop this all from happening?
This madness will continue until all of Stran-ge goes platinum

Can't hide the (Horns!) And I won't hide the (Horns!)
I live with the (Horns!) So I'll die with the (Horns!)
If you fuck with the (Horns!) Then you'll get the (Horns!)
So if you want the (Horns!) Then I'll give you the (Horns!)
Can't hide the (Horns!) And I won't hide the (Horns!)
I live with the (Horns!) So I'll die with the (Horns!)
If you fuck with the (Horns!) Then you'll get the (Horns!)
So if you want the (Horns!) Then I'll give you the (Horns!)

I'm in the desert sands of Bethlehem
Trying to get Jesus to mate Mary in the manger and molest a lamb!
Don't jerk yourself off Jesus, use someone else's hands
So where's those damn disciples he'd like to have some sex again!
I guess Young Peter's receiving 'cause Jesus felt his ass
Christ is an effin' fag, he likes to dress in drag
But hey, I guess his dad is just as mad
God woulda never had a sissy for a son, bet he's regrettin' that!
But yet we still ain't accept the fact
That he's fuckin' his mother and at the Last Supper he confesses that
He's an undercover male-lover and oh yeah Heaven's wack!
He don't want the Light, now I got Christ wearin' black!
See, I'm the Devil on his shoulder, yeah I'm that scary fat
Demon that'll turn all you heathens into scaredy cats
King Gordy, the Anti-Christ, God Killer
I am before and after Christ, I'm called a sinner

Trapped in a Psycho’s Body,Absolute Power,2002.0,"Yo, what's up?
For those who don't know, I go by the name of Tech N9ne
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret
Some of the things already known, that are familiar with me
And my thoughts, so these are the real thoughts
I'ma share with you, like this

Don't you come near me 'cause the Devil's sittin' next to me
I drink my drink, and smoke my weed and pop my ecstasy
Then add some GHB and mushrooms to the recipe
This means I'm really lettin' the beast within get the best of me
If you can hear me, I need help
I'm caught and I'm stuck, and I'm trapped in me self
Don't understand this fucked up hand that G dealt
Lazarus help me 'cause it's hazardous to T's health
He's set trippin', he's tryin' to get a nigga killed
And get a nigga peeled, the otherside is gonna rid 'em in the field
No sentimental feelings, send 'em in the cold buildings
I tried to tell him where you go you will not see your women and your children
He popped, fifteen hits of x in one night
Licked big tits, had sex with some dykes
And he won't use protection for my erection
Constantly makin' me get that penicillin injection
Wait, I hear voices, speakin' from inside
I'm out front waitin', he creepin' and he hides
I can't help but notice he's kinda stuck up, I'ma let it slide
But in the meantime shut the fuck up, and just ride

Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby
Oooooh... It's about to drive me crazy
Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby
Oooooh... It's about to drive me crazy

When I was younger I used to faint at the sight of blood
Now that I'm older I notice that it ain't at the sight of blood
Now the sight of blood equals the very first sign of love
Menstrual cycles, feelin' like you right at your height of drugs
Bleed for me, baby, made your heart, rage
Fuckin' you makes me feel a murderous sensation, blood mixed with ejaculation
Cum bustin', bump heads 'til concussions, after we done fuckin'
If I can't get the spirit I've won nothin'
I got children, and a wife
He's thinkin' of leapin' off a buildin', takin' flight
By now somebody should have killed him, end his life
Too many motherfuckers feel him, in his mic
Somebody stop him, 'cause he's fuckin' up my livelihood
With me trapped inside this psycho how can I be good
To my wifey, if it's remotely close to a punani
He's in it, a monster runnin' me back and forth
To the free clinic
If you a friend, time to say toodaloo
'Cause ain't no possible way he can ever be true to you
Cancel your appointment to do the due
If he wants to kill himself, what the fuck you think he wanna do to you?

Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby
Oooooh... It's about to drive me crazy
Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby
Oooooh... It's about to drive me crazy

I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
Brain deteriorating 'cause I'm X pill poppin'
I got, more troubles whatever you got it doubles and triples
And quadruples, havin' fantasies of eatin' nipples and noodles
Drugs; take the pain away, used to have a lotta love
But now I fade away— The fact
That women love the music and they open they legs
For a psychopathic nigga that's so fucked up in the head, is beautiful
(Told my parents this isn't suitable)
Devil bitches'll learn (no!), gotta recruit a few
(This nigga's gonna do me harm, I'm drugged up and I'm torn)
(Look at this motherfucker he colored my hair orange)
You can't touch me, everybody loves me
Listening to my music, children are gettin' ugly
If I told you everything I was thinkin' it wouldn't be G
Tellin' you how many crossed my path, just wouldn't be me
But they know, 'cause they way low
How 'bout some X n fry n yayo, and fuck a halo
A lot of Jim Beam, to have grim dreams would be healthy
(Hey yo, I'm trapped, in psycho's body, can you help me?)

Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby
Oooooh... It's about to drive me crazy
Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby
Oooooh... It's about to drive me crazy
Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby
Oooooh... It's about to drive me crazy
Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby

Suicide Letters,Anghellic,2001.0,"This is a piece that I wrote
When I was on some ole, low down down low feelin, depressed shit
Y'know what I'm sizzlin?
It contains, heh, three suicide letters to my peeps
Well actually uh two suicide letters
Y'know what I'm sizzlin?
I wrote it in rhyme form
But I'm gonna try to read it to the best of my ability
Y'know what I'm sizzlin?
So bear with me
Listen to the lyrics, check it out..

Picture me in that casket, blasted
Never nobody knew how long the pain lasted
Keep my eyes tight I'm frightened
But I fights like Tyson
When playin' this game of life I'm losin', longin' to be enlightened
Absorb my mind state
Reduce the crime rate and take me out
When runnin' toward the Lord I see 'em fake me out
Shook me so from church I played hookie
Listen to the words of a brotha
The sick stutter
So ya better better get the get the bags ready
Comin' killa killa like Scagnetti
My brains contaminated, hella rotten
It wasn't me who killed you (Who was it, what was it)
The affects of the mildew, my brains wilted
In my eyes the world is a bit tilted
Lord take me away before somebody else get killed
Bloods spills seriously
This is the letter to my homies I'll be missin'
God told me to behold a pale horse but I didn't listen
It's hard mane
My life is scarred mane
I'm losin' my mind
So now it's time
Sincerely signed N9ne

(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna cause that's the way
That I feel I'm barely hangin on
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up cause that's the way
It has to be
(Man, this is to my wife, check it out)

I made your life a livin' hell with my infidelity
Remember you tell me
All I gave a damn about was weed, stems, and melodies
Remeber ya spent thirty minutes in the hospital parking lot crying
When the blood test read the baby of another woman was mine
99.99
Should've left long time ago like Mary J. say
Just let it go like Ray J
I know your momma heard you yelling May Day
Spent my life trying to R A to the P
You were sick of me always being B to the R O K to the E
There was nothing else left for me
I was a bum
But you still wanted some
Through the rain, snow, and thunder
Foul-ups, bleeps, and blunders
But no man shall tear a sunder is what you said
Shoulda put multi bullets in my head
When you found that Evil Instinct was a song
But the events actually went on
This is the letter
To my homie, my friend who put up with me for 8
So now to take me really quickly's my fate
I'm sorry
For makin it hard
I know you’re scarred
I'm losin' my mind
So now it's time
Sincerely signed N9ne


I love y'all
The dynamic duo, my babies
It ain't your fault that your daddies crazy
Donny I miss you drummin'
Like me, one day you'll be rulin'
Lilly I miss you always in my face yellin' ""Daddy what ya dooyin'?""
You two are the reason why I'm still standin' today
But I'm sixteen-hundred miles away
And it gets my heart sinkin'
When I start thinkin' 'bout you babies
I heavily start drinkin' on a daily
Puffin', I see in my heart I gots to toughin'
Can't see me leavin' my angels with nothin'
So I keep bustin'
Use my pain
For you two I gotta come up in the game
Fly planes to an island so one day you can do the same with yours
Love you galore and I ain't playin'
Makin' me put a end to the suicidal mindstate sayin'

(Tech N9ne says this during the chorus)
Ya, thats what a nigga was on y'know what I'm sizzlin'? Sh..
But as you can tell
Like I said, I can't leave my angels with nothin'
So I gotta keep bustin', y'know what I'm sayin'?
Suicide ain't my thang
Never ever gonna be my thang when I know I got my love
So we just gon sit back
Write these rhymes, make these mills
And chill

2K11, ridin' solo
In the Benz on twins hella low pro
Slangin' CDs out the trunk for mo' dough
My mojo said, ""a thick bitch"" so I go slow
I pull it over tryin' to get up on her bumper
Wantin' to crunch her so I said, ""baby my new CD is a slumper""
It'll make the trunk thunder, girl your rump give me lumber
Up under the sheets I can put you in a real deep slumber
But she said fuck Tecca Nina didn't feel her
Did everything within' my power not to kill her
Disrespectful bitch I really wish that I can grill her
Light on my head that said put her in the trunk man you can steal her
I put the hater bitch in a head lock, she flippin' out
I pop the trunk she crunk but I ain't 'bout to chicken out
I'm sick and tired of bein' nice and lettin' shit go by

I'm bumpin' everything that beat like gangsta shap
I bangs the rap, in her ear 'til she gives thanks to that
Never take a prisoner where you hang your hat
I'ma roll around with her in the trunk
Poppin' that Tech N9ne slump 'til the little bitch faint collapse
I'ma roll to Topeka
Tecca Nina'll reach her if I gotta double back to Eureka
Crispy flows through my tweeters
Bumpin' this ring when I roll through Attica
Wait a minute I think this bitch is trying to kick a hole through my speakers
Get my gun then I open the trunk and said

Get out the god damn trunk, get on the ground! Take off your god damn belt!
Put it 'round your ankles, I'ma tie up your wrist myself! (Okay, okay)
I just wanted to drink and show you what the dong'll do!
BITCH! The hell wrong with you?

Eyy, the hot sex was not slam dunked
Rolled for hours then I stopped right off Van Brunt
When a bitch talkin' crazy like a lost man's chump
Short say ""I throw a bitch in the god damn trunk!""

Hours turned to days, days turned to weeks
Had to drill holes in the trunk so she can drink and eat
Whatever I stuffed through the holes hot dogs and ho-hoes
Kidnapped on the low low, spoke no mo' oh no go slow, there the po-po
I gotta ditch this bitch with the quickness
Man I just remembered this benzo is lifted
From Swope Park, that's where I'm 'bout to go dart, let her know art
For the evil bitch and the brainless witch with no heart, it got so dark

Police are still looking for 21 year old Crystal Nelson
Who has been missing since last Sunday
Friends and family told police that they thought this was
Yet another one of Crystal's weekend excursions
But after all this time, they're still worried sick

It's been fun momma, fed her my catalog like Adderall
Fucked up in the trunk with rump is how I had her y'all
In a ditch, walked back to the trunk, wicked is how I sounded
Whispered, ""Bet that you love Tech N9ne now, bitch""
(Threw her in the trunk!)

I think I've found the missing Mercedes here in Swope Park-uh
In a ditch near shelter five
It's kinda appears the car is still running-uhm
Music playing, I'm approaching the car now
Let me turn down the music
(God damn )
I'ma go ahead pop the trunk
There's an African-American female  been shot up and appears to be delirious
It could be the girl that's missing from last week

When it's coming at me, I am with it
Best keep it off of my fam
Bring it this way, then you pay, make you say ""God damn!""
K-C-M-O is the place that I'm from
If you live in my city, you grippin' a gun
And we ready for them, who like killin' for fun?
And we get 'em before they get us and they done
I'll be damn if a devil is taking me from
My lil' babies, two ladies, or breakin' thee son
Deep in necropolis they can become
All of your drama is making me (dumb)
I'm in the thick of it, cause they plottin' on me
Not gonna be fistin' it, cause I'm popping only
Better watch your vocals
Cops, politicians, white folks, niggas going postal
Lot of people on some scavenger shit
Now in Missouri, for a gun, I ain't gotta have a permit
Wanna feel that chrome?
I can peel that dome
Just like me, everybody left their chill at home

(Drama!)
I'm a real nigga that they wanna kill
So I keep it drama filled, I don't got no kind of chill

I'm a real nigga that they wanna kill
So I keep it drama filled, I don't got no kind of chill

Yeah, bring that if you got it to bring
I get it, admit it, we on the same thing
I swear that I just wanna ball
But I can end it all with a call if there's drama
That's on my mama nigga

We don't have them blades
We go in the trunk for what I have then spray
Gonna have to grab them graves
That's what you're gonna get after you catch them (fades)
Everywhere you hear the gunshots
Drama be on everyone's block
Now we be up in the gun shop
Target practice trying to make your lungs stop
Better stack up on your sunblock
Cause the light from the heat that I brung's hot
Kill my fam, I hope that everyone rots
And your family goody goody gumdrops (yeah)
I'm in the thick of it, 'cause she lying on me
If she send them to get me, everybody dying homie
But not me, not me
Got my shooters for any intruders that I see
House alarm is red, been wanting a set
I was born to bless so nobody harms the Tech
So come one, come all, you want us to numb y'all
Making everyone fall dead up on their gun law

(Drama!)
I'm a real nigga that they wanna kill
So I keep it drama filled, I don't got no kind of chill
(Drama!)
I'm a real nigga that they wanna kill
So I keep it drama filled, I don't got no kind of chill

I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't ever ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money

I've been feeling like Pablo in the Wells Fargo
I ain't here to talk about a car loan
Pockets on my cargo shorts full of money
And a duffel bag stuffed full, hard to keep the zipper on the top closed
You can barely pay a car note
Why you mad at me because your credit score low?
I done gone broke but I bounced back
Leaning on the counter while she look at my account
Can I have a lollipop though?
Runnin' game flirtin', with the bank teller
I can tell she thinking I'm a cocaine dealer
I got cash 'cause I rap, I don't trap
I was hurting when I didn't have money, now the paper like a painkiller
The Internet say I'm worth four mil'
It used to be a way worse ordeal
No more Dollar Menu orders, eating four course meals
Thought I was a winner, look at what the scoreboard said
Forrest Gump in the end zone and kept running
On the way to make a milli you can bet on me
You sitting still like a crash test dummy
Like you got a check coming
Tryna flash, you ain't got Tech money
You ain't ever live lavish, tryna be Travis
You ain't ever built like that
You been living in a fantasy knowing that you can't achieve

Get some big ones, shit comes, quick son ditch 'em
'Cause they gonna get to begging from the rich one
For the money for tummy, booty, and they tits done
Cross yo neck with a razor
For the fetty when they see you livin' major
How they comin' for money ya job paid ya
When not even one of them did a little bit of labor
With them brand new hunnids
Damn you done it
Not a way somebody can ever ban you from it
How can you stomach
The poverty I hit the lottery
So when you go in the pile can you plummet
Damn you stuntin'
On the land when you expand the grands
They gonna stand who run it and the jam you brung it
Comin' from all the fans the Kansas City man do gun it
Take all the paper don't let the paper take ya
Big money maker you're gonna wait to vapor
From all the haters they wanna waste ya
Like a trip when they hit a gallon of Jäger
Off with the money is why they shoot ya
'Cause they jealous they makin' the shotty juice ya

I'ma get to the money
But I give 'em what they can build in it
Rock at the rigorous on the go without a chill
We two up, it's too much money to be made
Too much money for me to ever be a slave
Too much money for me to not wanna get out of the bed and go get it
Somebody already gettin' paid
It don't matter if you rappin' or thuggin', be stackin' or pluggin'
It’s either you are slackin' or pumpin', how bad do you want it?
Look even if you hover at the oven and you wrapping a couple of 'em
Moving two by fours like Jim Duggan, you buggin'
If you don't got the lucrative hustle
Looking for loot producing part of productive 'cause you
Gotta be tough and plus you gotta do what you must do
Throw it when you win, they will son the rustle
But I see hawks when I see these thots, and I read thoughts
Let them wonder ‘bout the bread

Let alone fucks I give 'em the photo cred
Even though I do collect the dough, I haven't changed yet
Never quit, never sit waiting for a paycheck
To the paid jet, then get lifted like a weight set

Hope for a Higher Power,Killer,2008.0,"“The world- The Kingdom suffers violence, and the violent shall take it by force. If we can’t live in peace, then let’s die in peace. (Applause.)
We’ve been so betrayed. We have been so terribly betrayed
So my opinion is be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing suicide; it’s a revolutionary act.”

If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?

Grandma told me the good book said
In the last days get ready for the ten plagues
1st, the rivers will be ran with red
2, 3, and 4, dead frogs will 'cause lice and flies
Sick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives
6, 7, and 8, a boil storms a fire and locusts
9 is darkness, so dark it's hard for you to focus
And 10 is death of the firstborn
If I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point
To get at me and battle me, maybe have this verse torn
How will this curse form?
Well, Creationism and Darwinism been at it forever
'Bout at it I got nothin' but hurt for 'em
'Cause really nobody knows when you live
Then you die where your body goes
If it's Hell or it's Heaven
6 or the 7, well I'll keep the nina for all the foes in a gamble
That's what life is and it's hard to handle
When the bible says worship this but the scripture's written by man though
So when man destroys us the word might not stand so
'Til that day I'm just gon' protect my fam with ammo

If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
And at the height of their power
(God) will send an angel to destroy them

I've been looking for something supernatural for a long time now
But I never got proof that a spiritual realm existed, wanted to find how
Everybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?
Wondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king
I know it sounds far fetched, every night I put knees on the carpet
Then I pray to who's up with the star set
'Cause the Earth in its self is a target
For destruction, for combustion
'Cause there ain't too many you can trust in
Think of all the women losing their husbands
In Iraq a lot of killing and suffering
What I hope for, seemed folklore
When the enemy kills and gloat more
'Cause they killin' us off in this hoax war
Then I wake up yellin' and my throats sore
'Cause the fight's there, it's a nightmare
If it come to me, I'm in my snipe wear
If a bullet give my lung a slight tear
I wanna believe that the light's there
So all you Christians don't get mad at me
I just hope your mystical magical miracles work in catastrophes
And this ain't blasphemy, but artillery is my strategy
I hope for a higher power when I look at all these tragedies

If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
I will never follow the beliefs of man, why?
Because man destroys everything in his path

Oh what a miracle, angels and demons
But the only miracle is that people keep believin'
Right hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle
Keep that for my rivals and evil disciples
Expand your mission, man to women
When they attack do you plan to give in
Or do you do like I do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition
People like us, piece and knife up
'Cause we got evil to sweep and wipe up
Devils and demons and humans, irrelevant
So if they lookin' deceiving I bust
I hope that the higher power is watching over me
'Cause we young people don't see faith like most the older see
If he or she is listenin', a mere sign can spark me
But if the laws in the bible are bogus, then prepare for anarchy
Worst case scenario is never ever was a higher power
So in the midst of chaos now, the only real savior is fire power

If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?

Stars,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"(You know that there are billions of stars in the universe)
But the star had quite a difficult time shining amongst all the other stars
The year was 1994 when the star began his descent
And continued falling.. And falling...
Landing in an unknown place
The star creates followers from underground rap
On the quest to shoot beyond the stars once again
The star begins in Strangeland

Ground zero, crowned hero
But ain't nobody ever heard the sound before
I found me so
Competitive, I never get the credit back at it when it was clown and Lejo
Now we pro, the brown people
Was on it for the moment but they frowned at me fo'
Layin' what I was sayin' didn't sound negro
Now people 'round me low down when the beat go
Never will I ever stop or quit what I'm doing
I'm getting better, even clever, rockin' it then I ruin every competitor
We at 'em poppin' shit, I be chewin' 'em up ahead of ya, etcetera the
Speed bandits coming for ya, now he's making an industry sandwich
Come enjoy the flow, we're takin' them in to see damage
Gunnin' boy, you know we shaking the finicky planet, we've landed

We've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!
The thoughts will reign on this planet!
The arts been painted on the canvas, you're helpless!
We've landed! The arms of fans have been branded!
The dawn of 6's and 7's! It's the start of musical madness!
We've landed!

Shootin' for the stars, lootin' for the cause
Who's inducin' puke and hootin' for the bars?
You get stupid groups of loose and juicin'
You for true, but you recruit the youth ignore bizarre niggas
But ain't nobody fuckin' with any of our niggas
And if you trippin' under the Tecca there are millas
And you don't wanna fuck with a murderous gorilla
War 'til the lord hit a scar, nigga, what?
Bitch, I'm at the bottom and I'm comin' to get at ya
Better get up in ya column and I'm gonna diminish you
When I spit I really got 'em right in front of me timid
And I want a percentage
'Cause I fought for everything I got, it was not handed
And nobody fed a nigga nothin' when I was famished
I'm bussin' for life and not for Nathan, but God damnit!
Notice something beautiful just landed

We've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!
The thoughts will reign on this planet!
The arts been painted on the canvas, you're helpless!
We've landed! The arms of fans have been branded!
The dawn of 6's and 7's! It's the start of musical madness!
We've landed!

I've landed six feet under six feet
The area where ordinary people can't sleep
The badness, we had this back in high school classes
You're dealing with three faces of madness
Never been average with the image of a savage
At the very bottom I'm livin' under the maggots
But I'm 'bout to shoot up and really wake up the masses
Gas it and blast and have the upper class rackin' ashes
Upper class rappers, sucker ass packers
Rougher tougher motherfucker spaz backwards
Kcuf Natas, gutter mad slacker
Tecca Nina's what their lads after
Everybody I wanna say, ""What goes up?""
Vertically movin', I know it's 'bout to blow up
Thinkin' when I hit the stars I'mma slow up? Hold up

We've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!
The thoughts will reign on this planet!
The arts been painted on the canvas, you're helpless!
We've landed! The arms of fans have been branded!
The dawn of 6's and 7's! It's the start of musical madness!
We've landed!

Green Lit,N9NA,2019.0,"Aw, shit
This somethin', y'all lit
You niggas called it
To yourself, saw the line and you crossed it

I ain't gotta send it to you trippin' all it take is
Negative lippin', you automatically start the mission
Clique is stricken, 'cause you hissin'
Leave your shit in a bad condition
So many N9cians, I can't list 'em
When the funk comin' up, they sniffin' (Chuh)
My niggas is hibernatin' (Chuh)
It's all love, but believe we got the sniper waitin' (Chuh)
And they ain't rappin', no talkin' and never cyber-hatin' (Chuh)
They specialize in that thing you can get from Mike or Jason
I ain't gotta say a damn thing
Once you say it, next thing you know the clan came
You run your mouth and make 'em come expand brains
Damn shame, and lame
Got to drop and pop your top like when they poppin' champagne
Ugh, and I got plenty means
To get it done, but I ain't gotta drop any green
The many kings that love me will give 'em semi-streams
If he say 
anything (Anything?)
Anything (Anything
, chuh)
So close they hold these spitters
So many that I might not even know these hitters
Havin' love from me, so if you try to slow these gritters
When it pop, don't look at me, I can't control these niggas (Uh-uh)

T-T-G, yeah we trained to go
Real niggas in they biz, so don't get exposed
Police come around, they go, ""We don't know""
Get ya hit, get ya split, but we do the most
Green lit a pussy, bumbaclot
And my niggas always down to spill the blood
What that mean? Double back, hit his top
Young custodian and might pull up with the mop

A lot of wolfin' goin' on from these new names lately
Don't ever have a career, huh, on 2K maybe
Your car will get dented like Harvey, if you're two-faced, crazy
My youngins'll mop you up for a blue face, baby, ugh
I don't wanna get you green lit like I need him pressed
That line like it's call waiting, but it's those texts you'll be receiving
No one gon' start shit but I play defense
Look at my shark fins, you're in the deep end
When I left, I kept on calling Chilli like T-Boz, I be creepin', nigga
Bitch please, don't get your whips swiss-cheesed
Melted for the chips like trick, give me some dip please
Don't get tricked off like Roy and Siegfried
When the Sig squeeze, I'll make Ms on 16s
Strange Gang, I'll bang-bang like it's Chief Keef
Sprinkle wax blunt, call us sequoias, big trees
I ain't ridin' 'round naked like a striptease
I'll do a drive-by on a 10-speed for 10 Gs (Shroom)
I be gassin' on 'em with intense speed, what the lick read?
They don't wanna see me ballin'
They know I'm the king, like Lebron I switch teams
How ironic that I got the iron in my pants and my pockets increase
Shittin' on them niggas hella bad
Take the L, I've been on a win streak
I'm on your head, yeah, I'm so proactive
And I don't wanna push your team back, so no more malice
Trav said, ""Take the high road,"" so I won't go at it
But if you hatin', do me a favor
Do Momo challenge, chump

My niggas be with it, we comin' to get it
You know how we be pullin' up, ought to be cool with us
But they not cool enough, but they not bool enough
Ain't tryna disrespect nobody, but my goons'll catch a body
Shoot 'em just like paparazzi, now you stumblin' and flockin'

Blunt and a Ho,Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"IRS took all my money, I was a stupid kid
Cause I didn't pay taxes when shit was lucrative
So I had to start over, good thing I shoot the shit
Off enough to not take me away to do big bits
So I say that to say that I'm straight building
But it really hurts when the government take millions
Since I was shady had two ladies to make children
The same time when they do college you break scrillion
So you think of doing the shit that be un-earthly
To be sure your daughter stay steady and up in Berkley
Money be the problem, but other things be here to curse me
Hurt my girl so much she now doing the shit to hurt me
Wifey cheated after I did and skeeted
My life is a Red Hot Chilli Pepper I eat it
Like I'm Anthony Kiedis, I'm heated
So, just like a man, I resort to my penis
So check it out...

I got a blunt (And a ho)
I ain't about to spend my whole day stuck in the funk
So I'm about to get drunk (And a ho)
Sitting right on top of me with that incredible rump
So check it out

I used to have this festival called ""Paid Dues""
But I never fully got paid, dude (Really?)
The IRS thought they think I did
And now they after the kid, shit
And I'm the only one in my household that go to work
Ain't getting no pussy, so now I gotta jerk
Feeling like a jerk and that ain't ever gonna work
Playing positive, but ain't getting none of the perks
What to do when your IG popping off?
Snapchat got the gym rat panties dropping off
Saying all she want is this dick, whether it hard or soft
Closest I been to pussy is fish sticks and tartar sauce
And I ain't tryna be no martyr boss
Fucked around and she done pissed Nick Carter off
This nigga Tech got me high and now I finally got a good alibi

I got a chick out of town always giving me stuff
She stay mad as a fuck cause I don't visit enough
So she calls me to cuss
I don't know what it was, but, uh, something that I does got 'em falling in love
So we on the phone beefing and she crying to me
Like ""U-B-I, you be fly, but you be lying to me""
True, she dying to see where I was and what happened
Studying social media, she trying to catch him
Bad bitch caught him off guard with the condom off
Let her hit, now my dick feel like it falling off
Sperm went and shot 'em off burning like a Molotov
Word to my mama, I'm disturbed by a lot of broads
That's word to mother, son, I cut her off
Baby, she make me cum a lot, but it come at a cost
I got a girl I love, and I lost, we'll never reconcile
She played me like a pawn for the record

Hold on Me,The Storm,2016.0,"Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much
I can't handle life without it, it's become my crutch
I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans
Soon I'll be flying, oh so high

All my life whenever I got into a relationship
Couldn't take the nagging of women never be taking tips
When they said I needed just one of them in my stable
But never would I listen I wasn't able they say to me
I know you got other chicks, and I'm sick of this shit
You think I'm asleep when you go sneak away for a bit
I hear you talking to her why do you treat me like this
Why do you make it so hard to admit
Player would never show his hand
I become something they can't stand
In the long run they on one, our song's done
Get they bags and they bounce
And they say I'm sick and need a little counseling
You are the king, but don't know how to treat a queen
I hear the words you speak about her when you dream
Thought that we were a team, how could you let her intervene
Guess you got me
Really got some feelings for this one you can't stop me

Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much
I can't handle life without it, it's become my crutch
I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans
Soon I'll be flying, oh so high

Cause it will have its hold on me
Her blood is coursing through my veins
I need to hold on tight just let it take the reigns

Don't get in the game
If there's a feeling you can't hang
Women tell me that I should be loyal to one dame
It's a shame, they say I'm a playa and I never change
I remain, how we start out the same
And I can never get with it, you can give it to whomever wanna get it
Now that I'm seeing vivid you come at me I'mma pivot and
Get up out of your room, treat me like a buffoon
I can see you love her to the moon
I cannot lie I'm hella busted, they say I can't be trusted
I ain't got time to love shit but this does it
Loving her even when out in public goes with me wherever I tug it
I'm really done with you yes I had a lot of fun with you
But your many will soon be none with you
So what you gonna do?
It's only one and without it I might lose it
I cannot keep a woman cause time with my music

Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much
I can't handle life without it, it's become my crutch
I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans

Got a little secret frequently on my cash
When they wanna try to beef with me in my hi-hats
Keep it so they never ground me

Naturally gassin' 'em (Methane)

Passing these raggedy left lanes, wet stains

Who believe that when they envy, it'll kill you

But I like your lady so don't you abuse it""

That our purse grow when I burst flow
Flat foot got that chuki, when I snatch coochie
But he that goofy, to act groupie for a fat bootsie
That belongs to the brother of Makzuki

Mad 'cause I got the beast flow
Steady servin' niggas like a bistro

Tellin' me that we can make it in a hell where it's gonna be many more shocks
Use to be I needed love now I need about 3 or 4 shots
With another round just to hit it now yes I'm messier than any gore plot
I am doing what the sick does
Takin' anything to get buzzed
'Stead of eatin' wit' the family I rather get my dinner in a strip club
Not a evil that can rival me becoming even darker than a crip slug comin' to clip bloods
Took the gentleman and put him underground like in Dig Dug
So long every day shit there's no hope for we
Repetition kept us glitchin', your folks bore me

Turning in me? NO!

Stupid women I blame so goodbye sane I'ma fry my brain! Drugs I'ma try aim to deny shame and defy thy rain
Look into my eye mane I wanna fly gettin' really high and die strange
How do I describe, you and I entropy, inside of me an entity
Turning me into to the portion of identity
That you'll never know there, 'til my anger make a slow tear
Any beef wanna grow, I swear I eat it so rare, baby oh yeah
Take off your bitchiness that hate oh so it's just
Turning me into the insane, playing all kind of sin games
Taking it in like a ganja hit, you're the reason why the bomb was lit
Got me thinking ""murder everything in sight"", monster shit!

The Boogieman,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"And just when they thought that everything was peachy keen
Somewhere deep within the shadows
There were other things to be seen
An untamable beast with an urge to feast
And only alone would he stand, the culprit of fear on the 67th tier
There lies the Boogieman

No introduction needed
N9ne times you must repeat it
Mind tryin’ to just delete it
I'm N9ne supposed to be this rough MC
Whose gluttony would rhyme grime
Trust, believe it
A legend ever since the projects
A odd tech would get respect
When he wreck the set but never get the props
That was god blessed
So this is me, never lettin’ the crowd rest
The object of rawness
Dejected steps to darkness
Led to the industry whispering the name
History became a mystery
Cause listeners in the game
Wish ta sing the same
Riffs, cerebral glitch will lead to lame
And this will be your pit
For me to split and bleed your brain
They heard the name
But can't put a face with it
Oh what a shame
When it rains in the woods he stands still
He turns to lanes
From sane to straight wicked
Don't tell me you ain’t heard the sayin’
“The Boogieman’s real”

He's underneath your bed
Trapped inside your head
You try to fight it
But you decide it's just that
Boogieman
We fear what we can't see
This web’s a tangled weave
Life designed you
To try and blind you
From that Boogieman
And in that voice you hear
'Eliminate your fears'
What do you do?
Discover the truth
That it’s the Boogieman
And now you know it's real
And everything you feel
Hits you again, you will stand
Face-to-face with that
Boogieman

They don't wanna have to try to do as I do
That's probably why it ain’t been easy for me to slide through
I chew rappers up, on stage and they’re like fly-flew
Out with the ravens, flight to hatin’, haven lies you
Cause you don't want change
And you don't want strange
Rearranging the main lanes to brain games from plain jane
That's when your fame’s Strange
And you can’t maintain
You think you sang such an insane rain
Same thang
And I'm the shadow in the dark
That came for battlin’ the park
And they skidaddled when I barked
It gave a rattle to their hearts
Cause they're afraid they will all fail
Darkness will prevail
The Boogieman is not a tall tale
What a tough act to follow
You afraid? Tell me are ya?
When this came you were nada
Tell your lane ‘sayonara’

And you will get a couple in ya muffin top
Me popping will be they D-day
'Cause they can't say the shit he say
Everyone don't have a tongue like a gun
They not trying to be running no relay
Sat in hell for a whole lot of years
Bread and tales I got a whole lot of cheers
Sold out shows, so 'bout those
Foes doubt flows but bros oughta hear
Change in the making
Deep in the midwest something insane been a-baking
They claiming a nation with brain innovations
Aligning with everyone with the Strange integration

Poisoning the well
Y'all gon' hear me, oh yeah
You're on me, final days have only been going through Hell
So drink it up with no filter
I give you my drama
So if you don't get it, don't get it
Well then you can't live it, I'm livin'
See I’m only as funky as my last cut
Don't blame my gifts and fill your glass up

Something strange in the agua
When everybody sound like blah-blah
Put the KOD in the pot and he nod
But the God no more rides well Tecca Nina saga
Someway the killa is getting twisted into the mainstream
Gangrene sick of hits again
I can flip from the rip come and sip the sin
That's my dirty water worser than Flint, Michigan
They don't wanna see my progress
But you can't stop a talent that’s God blessed
Over the years I showed 'em with my odd guest
To a handsome man chilling fom the projects
Wayne Minor, insane kinda, in the brain I'm a strange rhymer
Always been a change the game grinder
Poison the well
You can tell that this boy's been in Hell
I'm a joy when inhaled
I'm the reason why everybody cheesin'
I got 'em even making noise in the jail
If everybody had to do what I do
They'd have flows coming out the wazoo
And let the god spew
Alaikumasalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh

Poisoning the well
Y'all gon' hear me, oh yeah
You're on me, final days have only been going through Hell
So drink it up with no filter
I give you my drama
So if you don't get it, don't get it
Well then you can't live it, I'm livin'
See I’m only as funky as my last cut
Don't blame my gifts and fill your glass up

Oh! Oh! Strange!

And we ain’t nearly done

The Rain/Welcome Back/Party Hard,Everready [The Religion],2006.0,"I now pronounce me and music together, from now until the end of time

Always on the road, doing hella shows
Day to day high and lows, but that's just how it goes
When you grinding, homie, ain't no rewinding
Time but the family behind in this business that I'm in
I don't feel anything and it's hard remembering
Places and faces they think I'm what December brings
The day is just like moments turned to hours
Autographs, sound check, radio spots and quick showers
Hit the stage and get so much love from the fans
Keep it rough with the fellas, but I make the ladies want to dance
And still I don't think you understand what's real
While I'm wit' you with my wife another chance is killed
And my kids all three of 'em suffer in the worst ways
'Cause last year I missed all three of they birthdays
So when you see me with me eyes full of pain
Give me love 'cause these are three of the reason why I call the road the rain

So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)

My little girl said-
Daddy (What's up), me and Reign really miss you
Not to mention momma always need a tissue
I saw your picture in the paper and I kissed you
I heard you won't be home for Halloween, is this true?
(Right after Halloween baby) Yeah, I'm used to it
Why don't you teach me and Reign how to produce music?
So we can travel everywhere that you're traveling
And be in the family, me and sissy fighting and tattling
I know you miss that, I know you dig that
Do your fans every wonder about where your kids at?
Is Donny really coming to move with us in L.A.?
Will mommy still love you and be with you everyday?
I gotta go now, I love you daddy but slow down
There's not enough Tecca Nina's to go around
Reignbow's crying, she wants to talk to you badly
(What's up Reignbow, baby?)
I love you, daddy!

So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)

I love my fans 'cause they make it possible for me to provide for the fam
The fact that my life is in shambles, they could give a damn
When it shakes then they chose it, fakes who hate lose it
They love my pain because it makes for great music
But in the interim this family matter is a tender one of mine
Leave in January and come back when the winter come like:
Calling my wife when I'm in the rain and then end up getting into a dumb fight
'Cause she lonely, you try to console her but you ain't come right
So it's about what and what? You give them everything they need
But what they need is your presence indeed
Life yes has been a strainer, it's like if been a stranger
To my kids and wife, that's the life of an entertainer
More money to gain, more people to change
Swords deep in the game, the world's peeping my pain
Out on the road cussing for sure, reaching for fame
Healthy relationship you can't have them, when you're living life in the rain

So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)

So we did twenty shows, I got like thirty six more, you know what I mean?
So when you coming home?

Spill different mixer on my vivorant kickers

Not itchin' to kiss her, but I'm fixin' to twist her

Time to scheiße or get off the crapper
Man I move on a lady give her what she deserve
Try to win 'er dinner
Whole lotta bump in the night, man a lot to be heard
I'ma bend 'er, spin 'er
Drunk enough to lie to the Bianc sayin' that I'll be hers

Give It Up,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"It's for real emcees only, nigga
Everybody on this mothafuckin' flow
This real shit right here
Lebowski hit 'em!

Gotta give it up 'cause it is a must plus
I'm fast like a rushed bus
On her ass we bust nuts
Then we smash past your city
Never last, the big bucks
I'ma gas this pair up
Whoop ass and kick dust
They try to talk tall but their money is straight dwarf
And you won't think it's funny when we pull up in the grey Porsche
We treat 'em like stray whores
We leavin' their face sore
Got the gun in the safe
Shoot from the waist and the case fall
Keep on testin' me especially when my ass be up on it
It'll be a death, defeat, don't mess with me
Killing off all opponents
Never slipping, never tripping off money, matterless moments
Will you take it or you'll leave it
If you'll leave it you don't want it
I'm a strange individual
Leaving you suckers to drown
The flow's continuous, when I begin to it
Chopping your bitch, it goes up for the pound
I cover the turf of the pelagic sound
I'ma diminish 'em off to the ground
We never knew gimmick, you know that we clowns
They all get with it when they hear the sound

Whoop! So jittery they think I'm back on it (back on it)
So shivery they be like ""doggone it"" (doggone it)
So quivery they freeze at that moment
No liberty for lil bitty pretenders that want it, guess what
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down

This here'll put the desire in 'em
Light 'em up and put a fire in 'em
Don't nobody wanna openly worship the Devil
But know that I'm writing with him
Look at the way that I ride the rhythm
I put the virus inside the venom
I don't wanna call 'em pussy but I know what they eating
I see the vagina in 'em
I admit I'm off of my rocker with underlings
You've been warned! Call Ces (creamed corn)
We running things
You fly? Fucker be gone
It's not flapping a hundred wings
I'll snatch the mermaid from out bloody water and gut her clean
When I say I got it together
They say I'm insane - funny!
The city is no utopia, notice it ain't sunny
Like Philly, really get silly, they spaz and they brains runny
'Cause everybody keeps asking what's up with the strange money
I tell 'em it's nothing to it
And choreograph the murder
Tell Fyre to play the track
And ask Ubi to bag the burger
We eating, look at 'em sleeping
Now doobie sucker you supper
I tell 'em ""welcome to Kansas City, duck motherfucker!""

So jittery they think I'm back on it (back on it)
So shivery they be like ""doggone it"" (doggone it)

Stranger things have happened
Tech told 'em and now the channel in tune
Picked from the street and hit the beat, now the planet in doom
My cannon boom, if you can believe they put a man on the moon
Mission complete my landings aloe and lanolin smooth
Listen to me, oh there's so many other fish in the sea
From clown to shark so which fish are you fixing to be?
Drown in the dark or bathe in the light in the blistering heat
Of a thousand suns son 'cause it's all 7's and 6's to me
Felicity, the U-B-I be so promiscuous with
The gift that he been blessed with, Ces clips that he spit
With a stench of tree peace to McGillicuddy's lit
Up in penitentiary
Ces essentially, quintessentially crescendoing, I settle beef
Killa City could never Gepetto me
And you better believe that I'm changing in red and the green and you're never ahead of me
Man I'm a better when up in the mezzanine
In a settlement over the evergreen
And my medicine it is acetylene, huffing this oxygen
When I set it free, putting my enemies down on Benamine
And we ne'er gon' let ya
Live it down again, I'm gonna get ya
Nobody wanna Erica, they wanna Ke$ha
'Cause in America everybody is messed up
I came to raise the Midwest up
And do things with Strange and big Tecca
This'll be the first time the Ces heard
Pressure, give me that yessir!

Whoop! So jittery they think I'm back on it (back on it)

You see me get money, honeys
Everything I want I really feel it
When a dude see cleavage funny
Dummy if you never heard of me - Tecca N9na's a beauty
Peep it
A lot of groupies need it
And you a chump if you don't like it
And give it up backwards say pu ti evig
You got a pootie, I leave it so juicy when I beat it
Feed it mooley and I eat it like sushi
Betta heat it, steam it
Making 'em crazy crazy
Never much to sway these ladies
If you talk about me to a bitch and she don't suck a dick
She gon' say she pay me
Wunderschön, Tech is second to none
Inadequate bums you come
But you niggas under crumbs
Dust specks
And you trippin' 'cause you know deep inside your fluffed ex fucked Tech
Paid Lebowski
Then wanted permission to suck Ces
Better give it up, check it, I'm bout' to rip it up
Tech impeccable, never no better flow
When I flip a cut everybody so nigga what evolution is big enough
To get you hickin' up when your bitch'll be licking dick and nut
Death'll be the only way you're cold
So sorry I had to give away your soul
Tecca N9na never ever give it up
For the crown better try him later hoes

You don’t know where you are?
No, I don't
You’re in Strangeland
Strangeland?
Yeah, Strangeland
Well uhh.. how did I get here?
Well that’s simple, Mr. Yates
What, do you mean?
You’re the creator

What I saw was amazing after raising up and
Gazing at the babe that said I'm creating nights and days and paving
The way for raging Tech-aholics
Making havens, next to all this hate and crazing
Death, we call it a place of consummation
Of perfection, fulfillment, the Tech runs the building
Respect one's resilience, from threats guns and illnesses
This place is realness, it feels as if its lifted
A bit sick and twisted and real wicked, villages
And I'm the main man
That made every effort to gain fans
Through all my pain I obtain grands
Millions just cause of my brain and my lane stands
Insane rands the name brand, call it Strangeland

Getting paid was the game plan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced into Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland
Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in a Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland

A world filled with Technicians, lets this one, stress
Lifting, mesh kids in sets with them Tech listening vets
Expression is best written, less hidden, flesh
Women, sex driven, that's living, yes been impressed
By the way, the Tech is blessin'em
It shows
Cause the land it steady grows, and I'm the man with frantic flows
But understand he said he knows, but he ran a deadly road
But he woke up with a family rose, in a land of uncanny souls
And they adore him, even if they can't afford him
Be the rich, and be the poor then, really get to be before him
To get laced, on mistakes, and big brakes
Quick pace, lyrics they pick in this place
He played me some stuff in uh, in L.A., off ""Tha Carter IV""
He has a, he has a record on there with umm
This dude named Tech N9ne I don't know if you guys heard of him?
Oh man, he's CRAZY, he's crazy

Getting paid was the game plan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced into Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland
Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in a Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland

Am I in the Twilight Zone? Cause my mics on
But I never thought the world would buy my songs
Cause in my lane I am the highlight inside my dome
But now it's my height, they try bite, cause my life long
In this hip hop, everybody's lip drops, when I spit the
Gift quickly shifted cause I get props, it's terrific
They recognizing me on every level if ya missed it
If ya look ya findin' me on a very rebel, this is listed
Tech N9ne a insane man
His own lane had the strain and pain, and then became fans
When all the dames glance, he's doin' the rain dance
Because the whole world is 'bout to be a Strangeland


Getting paid was the game plan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced into Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Bane, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)

Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in a Strangeland

Think about the war you'll be starting
Come for my people, you'll be sorry
We're not sorry, we're not sorry
So think about the war that you'll be starting
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry

So called Christians, what do they do?
They label me evil
Man you don't know just how crazy these people
So many conspiracies they get from hearing me
Fearing me 'cause they think that I'm the tyranny of Devilry
Think they planning to level me
'Cause I'm king of the revelry
I will never be taken by the hands of another man
I get grim like no other can
Christian household my mother ran, in this gutter land
Then she married a good Muslim brother man
So I had a hell of a lot of teaching
We leave sin on the table with the goodness and feasting
Eating like cannibals we're the animals beasting
Seeking the enemy who invented these preachings

I put my best foot forward
I keep my family by my side

So think about the war that you'll be starting
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry

I'ma say this quick
If you come for me and my family, I'ma spray this clip
And my army is super ready if you haters trip
Keep popping off at the mouth, you get inflated lips
Ain't no Illuminati, don't let the ruckus consume ya body
I'ma groom the shotty then I'ma aim it at whom is naughty
With them damning me to hell, planning for me to fail
Ain't no landing me in cells, abandoning me in jail
Stop mocking me and my symbols
Back in the day was bishop, more, and me in the temple
So if you coming at me I will never be gentle
You gotta know ya conspiracy theories are mental
Me and my children breathing that is really essential
So me just being a rapper is not my only potential
Was brought up in a war, you can check my credentials
All I gotta do is tell my army come and let the sin flow
They see tenfold

I put my best foot forward
I keep my family by my side
I sleep with one eye open
Pray you'll stay right by me and my

I'm for real when I say I got an army
Stand down if you think you can harm me

Crunch and munch on a clit, dunking a dick
Somethin' sunk in it quick, 
krumpin' a bit
Humpin' the nina bring the thunder

I eat it up like sufamunda, cheese between lasagna
I skeet it up then giddy up, fiend for cream, vagin-a tong-ue
Then feed the need, we lump for hunters, easily we done you
The gal sure look like fuck food to me
Might as well, bitch, I know you suck dudes for free
I can smell slit, when I'm in lust to a degree
If it's shellfish, I'm in the dust, you is debris, trick
If you one hund-er-ed, we so hunterish

And my whole crew hunt
Want some of that new chum

Snatch her out this habitat, soon as I stab my hook in that
Can't stop lickin' my chops, watchin' her walking, now I'm lookin' at
Them pair of Apple Bottoms and that donka that she put in that
I got bottle full of Captain and Jack and I'm ready to get it crackin'
Baby, now tell me what you wanna do
I got a package full a Magnums back at the pad
If you wanna attack then I'mma be strapped up for you
And all ya home girls, baby bring the whole herd!
It's open season for pillow squeezin' and leavin' toes curled
Inebriated, slightly faded, time to get it poppin'

Show me her naval ring and said there's one more underneath it

I'm on the prowl
Just a wiff of the feminin' scent I'm equippin' for infinite pimpin'
It's goin' down
See baby girl, I'll beat it up, and put it in a headlock
When I snap and go primeval on that ass, makin' the bed rock

You're one hundr-ed, we so hunterish

I'm a sexual predator, better alert the neighbors
'Cause they desperate housewives is just my flavor
Darth Vader, pullin' out my light saber
And they like my hard candy, call it Now and Later

I'm a hunter-gatherer
Lookin' for a super soaker and loofah lather her
Bend 'er over then ya stroke her, I mean ya stabbin' 'er
Get to pokin', get to strokin', I mean ya ravager
Bring it down-a, I'm eatin' bush babies right out the showa
Dine with me and N9ne, byin' fine wine
We devour ya, carnivourish niggerish
I gobble the top of ya like it was liquorish
I even tell fat girls (HEY!) come here, are ya ticklish?

Honey want a hunt ya just ta hit ya

When ya lick and rub it
Tongue kiss it and tug it
Spit sloppy I gotta (Sing on the microphone)
Got her singin' and feelin', I'm finger fuckin', I'm feedin'
I'm beatin', munchin', and needin'
Keep gushin' appease and I'm greetin' lust with allegiance
Heart thrust when I'm deep in
And makin' it wet, see that's an understatement
But your legs like this, I'ma dig it like this
Let me get a little innovatin'
Yeah, had to give her that long stroke
Had to put that Pro Tool and that hard drive in that condo

(Na Na, Na, Na)
(Na Na, Na, Na)
(Na Na, Na, Na)
I could have it every day
Cause ain't nothin' but a bae
(Na Na, Na, Na)
(Na Na, Na, Na)
(Na Na, Na, Na)
I could have it every day
Cause ain't nothin' but a bae

Me and her are just alike, so when we fight it's just a fight
But when we finally fuck at night, it's too taboo for the stuck up type
And we don't need no porn, we turned on from the foreplay that we perform
I work wonders with my fingers, had it squirtin' in my hand like a squeezin' orange
We both freakazoids, tried all the creams and oils, all the beats and tours
We love fuckin', when she bleedin' I leave it in with no rubber
Leavin' hotel comforters and sheets destroyed, is that TMI?
She and I don't give a fuck, choke her out havin' angry sex
So take it out and let her taste the 'cillin
She deep-throated with no gag reflex
Whoever taught her that gets mad respect
I let her wear my Strange chain while I fuck her with my skully on
Remember when I fingered you in Kroger
We thought we were discreet but a couple people probably saw
We act like a couple teenagers, the both of us grown as hell
While you were up, like a ponytail and let our neighbors hear us moan and yell
Fuckin' like I'm diggin for gold I'm thrill up in it

(Na Na, Na, Na)
(Na Na, Na, Na)
(Na Na, Na, Na)
I could have it every day
Cause ain't nothin' but a bae

One Good Time,Killer,2008.0,"Just give me one good time
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Yo
Yo

I know that I'm hardcore, know how to start wars
Know how to scar yours in a fist fight
'Cause toughness is our floor, warriors that bar nor
But this one is far tore up on this night
Some people show it and then, some people hide it
But other people they do it whenever they get excited
But me I can't even do it when the wrongs all mine
I'm saying I've been trying to do it for a long long time
I get jealous when I see people do it and it's like fluid
I'm thinking how can they swallow that when I can't even chew it
I guess God seen it fit to label me the consoler
Bestowed upon a broken show and forever be the shoulder
My mission is plain to see, it's freaking insanity
I'm wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why can't it be
Simple 'cause on the real this one could die
So I'm asking God Before I go just give me one good cry

If I could cry maybe one good time
I could wash away all my pain and maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway

Why I got to be the one to cheer up, people until they clear up
When I sneeze I tear up, and then I go look in a mirror
So I can see how it looks, when I really wanna know how it feels
When I'm hella down I try to push, no matter how hard no water spills for real
My patience is soon to go, waiting for the balloon to blow
I'm thinking back to when I used to go to funerals
No matter how close we were, on the inside it ached while
Others be losing it, I'm wishing I could just break down
And I been to a lot of them, and there's not a one
That went on and got it done, no moisture that even try even to come
And this ain't no tough thing, 'cause I've had enough pain
Tears should be runnin' like Mustang's, man it must rain
Been trying for years, but the crying been inside
And the Nina so serious, there ain't no lying in his eyes
And it makes me so furious, when I look and I'm in genocide
Please let me break down with the pain I felt when Brian Dennis died
One time..

If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway

I look at actors crying, it's as easy as fondue
But what do you do when extreme hurt is upon you
Real life ain't no movie homie, and this ain't John Woo
But I almost lost it at the ending of John Q
And I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew
But I'm still waiting for that real emotion to come through
Then maybe I could get a cry God
Maybe one, two?
Been red for life for the first time ever me want blue
(What?)
Give me the blues, sometimes I turn on the news
And I look at all these feuds, then I try to make them ooze
(Don't cry, no teardrops from your eye
Poetry's music oh my, almost made me tear up about thinking about my children, no lie)
Maybe I'm black hearted, you thinking damn he shady
Or saying man he crazy, for the way I abandon me lady
One day she can repay me, yes that woman can betray me
Then I'll probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe

If I could cry maybe one good time
I could wash away all my pain, and maybe free my mind
After my shows, it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time, hey, hey
Nobody's looking at me anyway",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-one-good-time-lyrics
Awkward,Klusterfuk,2012.0,"Yeah, heh..
I'm just gon' tell a couple stories real quick
Shit that I think is pretty awkward, you know what I'm sayin'?
Check it out

Kickin' it up in Salt Lake City
'Bout to be doin' a show and the boss stay really
Lovin' a nigga, I think it's because I'm becoming a killer forever
The piece of my thoughts weigh gritty
But one day someone say: ""Why does he gotta be closin'?""
I am the one with the frozen flow and pockets bulgin'
Fairground: it was a explosion
I told the promoter to hold up and I told him I came to rock
Give the famous spot to the man that claim he hot
Twenty-two thousand people saw me make the planet rock
But when I was done, nigga, the show was done
Right when he took the stage everybody runs
And the outcome was three hundred folks set a show
So I'm at the shilo and it was

Awkward, situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard
In my circle when it's awkward
Situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard, awkward

Great sex, thanks, Tech
That's what she say, I grab the latex
Off of me, and throw it away to be safe
And I give her the getaway-look and I say softly:
""We gotta move, my bus is leavin'""
I guess that wasn't a good enough reason
To have to go, I gave her a shirt
Not my jersey, I know it hurts
And then I heard call somebody saying come and get me
Grab the gun that's with me that's a no-no
You came and you leaving solo, keep it dolo
Making the walk of shame then I let her out the front
I was in the crunch when the person standin' at the door
Said: ""I'm her husband, man, we love you
And this is what she really wants""

Awkward, situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard
In my circle when it's awkward
Situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard, awkward

I ain't even gonna rap this verse, I'm just gonna tell you the story
Cause it's funny as hell to me, you know what I'm sayin'?
We shootin' ""Am I A Psycho?"" video down in Atlanta
Somewhere outside of Atlanta, it was cold as hell, it was dark
You know what I'm sizzlin', we only had like one trailer for everybody
It was just me, B.o.B and his people, my people
You know what I'm sizzlin'? 
Aqualeo, satin star, their people,
 you know what I'm sizzlin'?
Hopsin's people
, uh, uh, the make up ladies, people that are in the video
You know I'm sizzlin'? We all in there drinkin' you know what I'm sizzlin'?
I'm in the back all the time, I'm reclusive kinda you know what I'm sayin'
So B.o.B came in the back and he said to me:
""Hey, man, you fuck with them tools?""
I said: ""Tools?"" He say: ""Yeah, man, you fuck with them tools?""
And he pointed his hand like like a gun
And I said: ""I ain't got no tools here if that's what you askin'""
And he said: ""No, I thought I saw some tools back here""
I said: ""Hell nah, nigga, I ain't got no tools back here, man""
""Nigga, I got God with me, nigga, and angels around me,""
And we start laughing, and he's like: ""Nah, nah, cause I go to the gun range""
And I'm like: ""Oh, that's cool, but we good right here, man
We ain't got no guns down here"" and we was laughing
And when he was leaving out I said: ""Hey, nigga, it's all Jesus my brotha!""
Hahahaha, nigga talkin' 'bout tools, you know what I'm sayin'?

Worldly Angel,Special Effects,2015.0,"Oooh
Yeaaah
Mama told me I was her angel sent down from heaven
When I was a little one enthusiasm caught my dome and lessons
Teachin' me 'bout the Seven and how I should be a reverend
She really gave me a ""this world is not my home"" impression
Sent down to help lost souls and fight their foes
Angels chose to toss woes when the night air's cold
But it got to me when she looked up and said (I'll soon be gone)
Then I was right there, froze, cause that meant, I'd be alone
The second, that she was gone
, I was beckoned by my brethren
Then my head spinned like (buzz), Tech went to be a grown
A complex gent, that freed the wrong
And blessed it with the best scripts
I invested my whole life, chose light
But the people down here, don't know what to do with it
When I fly away, cause I really don't know
Too many that's true with it, ya know?

(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Man...

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away

They don't understand me, when I say everybody's family
With the evil deeds they proved me wrong, I failed
To the heavens you can hand me
Cause my god will never just land me
Down deep with Satan, that is not my home in hell
But where I'm living now, people are living foul
They keep they heaters on the key to stone
I'm mentally stiffened, wow
A lot of love is missing now, so (I'll soon be gone)
Cause they don't wanna listen to what I'm giving thou
Love, but who gets it usually disperse
B-b-but wait, it gets worse, I found out that it never helped it hurts
I thought my job was to give it all the works
To many it's worldly, when you can't control your thirst
So if I can't bring happy, I'll go
Flings that this queen catch me really seems tacky, ya know?

(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Man...

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly away

Fear not, cause this ain't the point when you hear shots
Me, and my peers got, by God's will dropped in the weird pot
I wanna ascend cause I'm feelin' like I'm near shock
Mama gone I'm feelin' like I want the rest of my years blocked
You got your ears locked?
I wanna fly away cause inside I have eternal tear drops

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly

Overtime,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Yeah so, since I was 10 years older then her she tried to give me that ""Coming to America"" spiel. You know what I'm saying? Like ""Some guys put in an hour. Some of 'em even an hour and a half. But a man gotta put in overtime for me to get off."" Ha ha

Work it baby
I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby
All the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime

If you think we 'bout to go to sleep - forget about it
You really doubt it, though we can make the synergys link
In the middle of the night I'm fixin' to enter the pink
Never the one to be stingy. 
I leave my dinner, she winks
'Cause she think she got me and her percentage be Brink's
But I'mma stick it without a ticket in the tender she thinks
Suck me up then I can become her energy drink
And that's what she gon' need
Punching the clock, I'm not gonna be done on three
Baby you probably wanna kick it and get her done on E
But you ever have steamy sexual fun on weed?
So I told her nein! No I don't look like it but I'm the older kind
But that don't mean I'mma stick it, n' quit it, forget it
Because tonight I'm 'bout to get it in overtime

Work it baby
I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby
All the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime

Lovin' your body, lovin' your pace
Love it when you maneuver your body off in my space
And weather the chase, and have your body off in the daze
And could you feel the hormones, they off the rage
Now check it - let me take a little dose of the page
I'm hittin' for hours and hours, hours hours and days
All the positions I'm feelin' real kinky today
I've waited to play my trombone, have a parade (have a parade)
Kitty kitty kitty kitty c'mere
Well there's a couple little things I wanna say in ya ear
I'm shiftin' gears, love it when I strike the wheel
Stevie Stone in the bed, I'm a freak for real
Baby girl I'm a freak for real
A little too much tongue got me head over heels
Wetter the chill
Head shot, ready to kill
Ready to deal, head rock, watch what you will

Work it baby
I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby
All the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime

Baby, baby, gave me a job and I love it
I know you be lovin' the way I throb when you hug it
When I got the poonini I thought the job really was it
Before the poonini you take the job and you shove it
Feel like a nigga makin' love when I does it
On the clock I won't stop and when it buzz I'mma plug it
Good enough for me to be your husband in public
You really be wantin' to pack a stud in your luggage

Ah, pack a stud in your luggage
Break down baby, Stone gonna love it
While we bangin' make a nigga wanna love it
Make me wanna snatch it
See to it girlie, ha
It's one of a kind
You bring the girls and I'm comin' with the N9ne
Spread them legs and open wide
Give you that overtime

I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby

And it get so hard tellin' 'em all please try to form one line
With the player haters combined, I don't think you know
How much of a strain it's been, I can't explain, it's insane
But I wouldn't give up a thang, I live with the pain and resort to brain trippin'

I got this bitch named Janae from

Into bitches and sexual favors, told me I could take it
Got a fetish – addicted to pain, wanted me to choke her
While she sat on my di-nick and came all over the sofa
But this ho from the 
""O""
, she was cold, didn't like to swallow it
A pole to the back of the throat, kept a bitch from vomittin
She begged for a dick in her ass, baby liked it anal
But my head was too big for her ass, so I used my fingers
Down to Dallas with Rita and Alice, white and Phillipino
One on my dick and one tossin' my salad off in the casino
Real sex ain't got shit on these vets, told 'em they could keep me
Even thought about writin' the check, I'm coocoo for a threezy

Nigga petty shit is second nature
Throw 'em in the mix nigga, fuck 'em with a friend
They will be callin' you so they can do it again
You ain't gotta spend, ain't gotta pretend
Call her up and tell her you needed to put it in
And not just white, there's hella beautiful black bitches

And y'all be fuckin' them bitches like we be fuckin' them bitches

Never stoppin' it 'cause I ain't had enough of you bitches
Now, sex out south you can put it in her mouth
And you don't need help from Hitch
You can find 'em in a house of six

Go inhale that

So dope they wanna off em

Too good to battle you but

pick a name and suck on this in danish
If I'm walkin' around like I'm the brown that's off in ya drainage pipe
Better hope ya water main is tight
But if ya dump it on me I know the name of the game is white
I'm so Febreze, when I'm shitting on em. You think ya better? Oh please
Nose to me, and you get what come out of coca leaves
'posed to be, high and mighty toilet bowl to breathe
Socially those hidden without rose to be nosily
Put they schnauz on the old tussy, if my odor be stinkin' but they notice me
Bein' better than ever fresher than a lotus leaf nigga

All my life
I wasn't good enough
Now my shit don't stink
Now my shit don't stink
Now my shit don't stink",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-stink-lyrics

If I Could,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Could have, could

Listen!
I know I'm always gone and I ain't never home
And plus you barely ever hear me on the telephone
Just trying ta sell a song, 'til my bright angel is known
And my hell is shown,
 but if I rest
It's just like all my mail is thrown
All away, all the day yawl a say call the way
A love one calls to say ""All's at Bay"", hog and stay for a holiday
But I'm far away, gotta pay lot of K
For my daughters
 way, son and mommas, they sobbing'
And it's problems when I'm away
But I gotta go get it, lotta dough in it
Hunnid percent, I'm in it ta fly and road grit it
Tecca N9na be raking it up when I go spit it
But it get to me when the family cry, 
no shit it
Becomes hella hurtful,
 
yo, feel like I'm runnin' around in circles
If I could I would, I would stop, but I might go bazerko

But if I could, I would be good
I would be there for you just like I should
You wouldn't cry, when I say goodbye
For the reasons, do not tell me why
But if I could, I would be good
I wouldn't leave you, you think that I would
It feels like I die, a little inside
Know I hurt you when I say goodbye

I know your heart is skipping
Cause I'm on a mission
Your eyes and schnoz are dripping
Cause your dog is missing
And you, his broad and wishing he wasn't a freaking politician
You want his kissing and you hope and pray that God is listening
You want to frolic with him
But he gotta get them dollars, give them
All of his grin, polished scripts and they all assist him
Now he's balla big and tall ambition, you're fallen friction
Cause you miss your body's twitching
Throbbing from his rod incisions
So you started fishing
Websites and call him, bitching
Thinking some broad is nibbling on his dick and y'all is drifting
But he just say ""Nah"" to chickens
All of this when cause is given
If I could I would dissolve suspicion


Just trust me, please, just trust me
I'm doing all this music, so we can go all over the world
I swear to God, I'mma take you all over the world baby
We're gonna go, to Hawaii, we gonna stay for months
You always knew I wanted to go to Hawaii
And we're gonna go all over the world baby
If you just give me time
I'm gonna get this right, and do what I'm supposed to do
I swear to God we're gonna go, all over the world
We're gonna take, long trips
We're gonna go to Japan
We're gonna go to Africa
Wherever you wanna go, all I need
Is a little bit of time
A little bit more time, all I need is time",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-if-i-could-lyrics
The Calling,Strangeulation,2014.0,"And I'm back to the drinkin'
Soakin' wet every bottle's open
Can't believe it I'm occasionally smokin', again
With a deep and cloudy ocean, I'm in
Have a lot of trouble copin', my friend
I'm surrounded by folks when they lovin' me the most and
The goad is really croakin', within
Thought I was Superman the truth was
I used to be clean as a loofah and I used the
Cool devoured the booze to hand I lose the
Land if I triple booze the fans
I dream of stoppin' but greed is knockin'
They feelin' me from me from KC to Auckland
Proceed with caution, heat exhaustion
If I keep it goin' I'm gonna need a coffin

The river takes me away
And I've fallen from grace
Tell them I've tried to wait
But they're too late
I can't see when this pain will fade
Oh God Heaven is callin' my name

I feel that pain comin' from inside
My people had the same drinkin' and then died
Devil in my brain I'm sinkin' within pride
Drinkin' for lunch and I'm drinkin' for dinner
I'm nothin' but lush when I'm pushin' up in her
I seldom remember the 8th of November
Cause I be goin' so hard I'm always on a bender
I got money, I got cash
So picture unlimited amounts I got stash
When it got bad I went out and got trashed
When I hit glad what'chyo think's in my glass
I gotta catch me, I'm fallin'
Not a limit to a young brother ballin'
Gotta let go of the weight I'm haulin'
When I look in the mirror within my eyes I'm headed for that callin'

The river takes me away
And I've fallen from grace
Tell them I've tried to wait
But they're too late
I can't see when this pain will fade
Oh God Heaven is callin' my name

Go hard or go home
That's the motto I hit the lotto
Mister sorrow can miss tomorrow
So grip the bottle of this Moscato
My eye whites are not white
They hot fire and not nice but in my ice
I need a shot twice
(Drunk, I...Might, die)
(Falling, down...Gonna, drown)

Make way for the idiot
Interior is hideous
Need help like immediate
He actin' like he don't know alcohol is insidious
While I celebrate life
I'mma elevate heights
Not known to man cause I chose to ban
My clock on the land on a hella great night
I'm knowin' this my callin' so I gotta try to miss that call and
Alcohol and you twist that big sack and hit that
Think I better quit that stallin' and stop
Feelin' real gotti I'm mixin' my liquors
You gotta get me at the party
Naturally naughty
Please help I'm still trapped inside of this psycho's body!

The river takes me away
And I've fallen from grace
Tell them I've tried to wait
But they're too late
I can't see when this pain will fade
Oh God Heaven is callin' my name",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-the-calling-lyrics
The Needle,The Storm,2016.0,"I once said in a cypher of famous friends back in 2011
""Who do I catch—?""
Outside of technicians' tunneled Tech vision
At a point in time when dope is the new whack
So it's safe to say we're in Barney says Cheadle
On the outskirts of our army, we scare people
But it's not for evil, up with hawks and eagles
But I'm lost and feeble wondering if this restarts the needle
Look around, do you spot Tech
In front of seventy thousand at RockFest
By the way he won the crowd does he got next
To infect the mainstream or sell a lot less
God bless my core fans still around
We're here 'cause you held us down
Love the way that you love my sounds
But I'm still try'na break new ground

Feels like I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

Yes doing this for, yes doing this for, yes doing this for profit
And my pocket's one dimension
I wanna reach so many hearts and souls is my intention
Since 2001 is when I started my ascension
But in 2015 I went up just to get honorable mention
Makes me wanna end it, I get so offended
When they speak of genre breaking but no N9ne is in it
Or friended I'm winded, my music's intrinsic
But it's kinda looking like the needle ain't moving even when I did a killer with Kendrick
Jimmy Kimmel was splendid, four million attended
But when we were done it's like not one of them were mended
Maybe it's my image and large amount of grimness
My pen spits on them scripts
Thinking I'm on a sin trip and then skit
Rock on the range we had 'em flocking for Strange
But it was a shocker when no rockers remained
When it came to the game where they claimed
Fame could get you big as the Beatles
Yeah we got it this far but I really wanna push that needle

I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

Pardon me Lucas
I was blessed to do a song with Marshall Mathers
I was thinking when the emcees hear this they hearts'll shatter
'Cause the art's so radder than babblers with partial chatter
But the garble swagger actors win it all, but this?
Not a chart no ladder, dark so daggered
Why do mega artists do this with me?
Man it make me feel so good when they all really do skip the fee
Slipknot, System Of A Down, Deftones, Doors got a few hits with T
But the one thing that makes me wanna say screw this and flee
Man I did it all this when music is free

I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

Now they gonna say:
""Poor N9ne, please you're fine
'Cause you made it to the Forbes List 'bout at least four times""
But since I wrote my first rhyme it's been war time
To get the masses to see this talent deserves more shine
So this year I sat at my very first Grammys
Me and my partner Travis watching my peers go hammy
I thought about all the awards these folks should hand me
Man I swear I'd disappear if it wasn't for fans and family",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-the-needle-lyrics
Promiseland,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Turn me up a little bit Ben
So I'm just 'bout to spit some shit real quick
It's the last song
'Cause I ain't got to the Promiseland, baby
Let's go!

I remember when my soul, hoes and dough was missin'
When I went to all the shows, yo my bros are bitchin'
Never meant to blow my goal so it's motor spittin'
And when I enter all of my flows I'm so in pole position
I promised to be the best to mom
Get us through, get up at the dawn
Let Tech spew, flip it like an omelette
Ever since the calm bet you Tech ain't made you yawn yet
I sign checks in my pocket are the color upon Shrek
The industry never passed the baton guess I grabbed it
If it's beyond us even so I get the gauntlet
This music shit was enough to make me vomit
But I kept you all astonished, make way for the KC comet
Now I'm winnin', I'm more sarcastic than Vince Vaughn yeah
Honestly when I walk in I come off like bomb threats
'Cause them no want Tech to go straight 'nam vet
Throw on jets and get all the way to this land that was promised

Look at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury
Rolling down this road doing this thing
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat
Through storm and rains with demons chasing me
To this promised land
To this promised land

Would you let me kiss 'em?
Couldn't defeat me none
We started beastin' 'em
Sellin' records, millin' seconds
Look at us teachin' 'em, yellin' Tech is hell and methods
Rippin' and reachin' 'em, felon jeffers tellin' heffers
I ain't got no income but I got dough and then some
In come some friends, they wanna attend hundreds send 'em
Knockin' 'em out, my chain go side to side just like a pendulum
I'm in to one but the other is impatient waitin' for the sin to come
This is what goes on now that I'm in their light
Now they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights
Been chasin this for so long, never has been fair fights
Lookin' for them rare sights, it's in there right?
In the land where everything is yours
Not fictitious like the boars, all delicious like a s'more
I'm be walking through the doors they often to the stores
Got me bossin', doin' more for the Promiseland I'm you and yours, Nina

Look at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury
Rolling down this road doing this thing
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat
Through storm and rains with demons chasing me
To this promised land (Promiseland)
To this promised land (this is the Promiseland)

Is this it? Is this what it's all about man?
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking, snorting? Come on man
Meeting, feeling, touching, we on dames
Killing, busting, really loving us 'cause we all strange
Ha ha ha ha ha I like it
The Promiseland is real simply because I write it
Don't stare too long and envy 'cause you might get iritis
Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices
In Promiseland I'm gonna stand an honest man
This honor gets the drama yes the llama can
Bring disaster on rappers like water on Japan
He got his chance and Tech puts it all on his fans

Look at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury
Rolling down this road doing this thing
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat
Through storm and rains with demons chasing me
To this promised land (this is the Promiseland)
To this promised land (this is the Promiseland)

Strange Music, baby
It's what we been waitin' on
For everybody to recognize the real shit
It's all happening, baby
We just gon' ride out to this, I love this beat

Drowning,Something Else,2013.0,"Light looks different down here
Inside my diamond prison
And if I could reach the edge I would
Oh I'd take us somewhere if I could

But I am slipping under water
The tide oh it's pulling me much farther
And maybe I am drowning
Maybe I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning

My Tsunami, my Katrina and my inner Sandy
Man it will not simmer expanding
If I swam seem like I would slam the damn thing
But I'm scrambling, falling like I damaged my hamstring
I'm deeply disturbed, so many things keep me perturbed
Inside of me peeping this surge and I'm completely submerged
My data wiped even if NASA had a sight
Couldn't catch it with N.O.A.A.'s ghost satellite
Storm's F-5 within I'm torn alive
Hearing the horns from high
Pain is for sure my eye
Having a lot of blackouts
Medics try putting me on medicine
But I need light
Just like the East need con Edison
I'm dead again
Drownin in everybody else's mess when
I got troubles that's been pullin me down
Ingesting water, no breath in
Look how it swept in
To evacuate or not evacuate?
Is the question

But I am slipping under water
The tide oh it's pulling me much farther
And maybe I am drowning
Maybe I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning

Teach me to swim, keep me from them
Eating the limbs and other body pieces from him
I may be wrong not to, play these songs, caught ya
When you got me drowning in my own Davy Jones locker
It's caving in, it's over weight
No saving him, he's freeloader bait
And everybody picks him then sticks him
But your rain and wind equal my shut down system
Yeah

But I am slipping under water
The tide oh it's pulling me much farther
And maybe I am drowning
Maybe I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-drowning-lyrics

Got a hazy condition this lady's position
Was pay me for the spliff and then maybe submission
Too high to try and turn crazy on
The way she came off it was shady, wrong
I got many people that gave me zongs
Told that Bianca ""away, begone""
Leave us, we keep bud and nobody gotta see her
Coming cheaper than a Totino's pizza

Hey Tech, it's *** and ***
Wishing you a happy Halloween, baby, haha
So we were thinkin', if you chose to kick it with us tonight
We can finally do that threesome, haha
Call us back

Yahtzee, two baddies talkin' 'bout gettin' busy
Having a thrizzy with Tech Nizzy, now I'm doin' the Shiggy
Thinkin', two pair of titties give me jizzy
Mane, I'm with this, bang them bitches like The Warriors against The Lizzies
Proceed to pelvis groom 'cause I'm 'bout to nail it soon
Doin' the palest moon, they said meet 'em at Raoul's Velvet Room
Now that's a hell of a plan, both of them bitches vanilla pecan
My other plans are now a hella Saran 'cause bitches wanna share the gel of the man
The homies swooped me and put the pedal to the metal
Through the ghetto, we switchin' lanes, real Toretto
 (Chyeah)
To get with the thickie black, and then the other Mexican and guerro
I'm the red Devil, rollin', no jokin', Jared Leto
 (Chyeah)
Walked in the spot, got with two thots and hit the floor quizzick
Bartender pour vicious, so I'm seein' four bitches
Take a seat at a booth with the girls, how I knew we was gonna for sure kick it?
Both of them bitches went under the table on N9na playin' tug-of-war with it

We 'bout to leave it on the flo' (Leave it)
And gon' retrieve it when a ho (Need it)

Two gifters in my zipper, two angels bump with the broken wings
Mister, mister, mouth's naughty, feelin' just about gaudy
One of 'em got up and said, ""Let's go and hit a Halloween house party""
Come on, everybody's leavin' (Leavin')
I made it to the hoppin' ass house party
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is three shit, rollin' and weedin'
Where the bathroom, bro?

 so we did, zoom
Me and the bitches but then I accidentally went and walked in to some kid's room (My bad)
[Verse 3: Landxn Fyre & 
Tech N9ne

Oh no, Tecca N9na's at the door
Want me to spit it, leave it on the floor?
Rippin' the flip, anything gotta go
Get it, demolish it, I'ma spit, never quit
I'ma be all in it, bitch, I be callin' it
Like it's a fantasy, all of you fans of me
I'ma be haulin' it like I said, ""Bobble it,"" I'm the shit
Baby been busy, pop like I'm fizzy, now you be spinning
'Cause of the rhyme I spit making you dizzy
I won't kid all of you, but, bitch, I'm winning, woah (Wow)
Thirteen, you kidding? When I'm done, only thing I'm committing
Is a homicide, might make your mama cry
She found her kid had died from the beginning
Woah, hold up, lil' dude, you freaking me out
Tech, what the fuck are you talkin' about?
Oh, this? Fuckin' the game up the way that I came up
Is something they're payin' but didn't really wanna do it to 'em
But they couldn't think of a way to tell 'em
I ink and I play no games, I ran up on the bitch
And then I did it to 'em anyway
We destroyed it, can't avoid it, but the bathroom is that way
(Right on, man!)

We 'bout to leave it on the flo' (Leave it)
And gon' retrieve it when a ho (Need it)
Best believe it's finna go when you let us in the door

Thickie black and the Mexi-white
What they got 'bout to sex me right
I already dated the Mexi one
So it ain't a thing for me to get me some
So I started to play with the other first
Through the kiss, I looked up, and the other's hurt
Man, I thought it was 'bout to be porn shouts
But the other one flipped and she stormed out (Damn, man)
Ah, I knew she couldn't handle this, I'ma go get her
Stuck in the bathroom, mopin' and hopin' to smash soon
Thought I had poon, feelin' mad gloom
'Cause they left me open like a stab wound
I squirted the lotion (Hell, nah)
Well, get it done, I ain't with it, son
When I murdered the ocean
Would've been servin' them both, but I heard a commotion (Chyeah)
People screamin', shit bumpin' and breakin'
I'm stuck in this basement in a fuckin' displacement

You gon' make them thangs come up out that load
You ain't built like that but you talk so cold

Hurts now, purps found cause a nigga squirt rounds
Acting like ya wore a purse on turf grounds
Like how his homies didn't tell him to pull his skirt down
Now look at'cha
Loud mouth we found a round to match ya
Bound to smack ya, now the ground'll catch ya
'Cause you frowned at the hounds and you found disaster
He talking hella shady
How I get it on the daily
They jelly bout my gravy but they crazy 'cause they think I won't be banging like the 80's
Your homie was a movie
So we dot him with the tooly
Got his family sick and woozy
Giving him the finger, way of Rodney O and Joe Cooley
They hot around the collar
'Cause I got a lot of shotters
So don't nobody bother, if they try to then we stoppin' they medulla oblongata
So be careful when you saucing
You could end up in the coffin
You better take precaution when you see real niggas crossing, shut the fuck up when we talking
If you get my killers heated
You'll be curled up like a fetus
All them words, you're gonna eat it
Every fist and all the feet is never ceasing when you pleaded

We take 'em to the end and then it's biva Las Begas
If you tripping, y'all nuts
'Cause we sick and all bust
So get the motherfucking pineapple, the rum and the coconut and mix it all up
We coming from the ghetto
And we keep the heavy metal
So you suckers better settle 'cause we turn a wolf and devil to a woman in stilettos
'Cause they didn't really want it
They was only in the moment
Hella talking, never on it
Had they're chance and now they blown it 'cause the king was their opponent
He bit the hand that fed him
Run you over if you let him
All the homies wanna get him, heard the words when he said them now I know that he regret them
'Cause we be getting money
And he be looking bummy
So keep the coward from me, when you see me don't be chummy
Muh'fucking dummy
I know you can't stand me
But you know that we go hammy
Have you sleeping like a xanny, hit them with a super whammy when I cut them from the family
We in every nook and cranny
Hit you when you're in your jammies, when you're in your manny panties
See me and my brother Sammy, ain't no yelling for your granny and no running to your mammy, nigga

Tech N9ne!
I am what? Fresh out of fucks!

Fed up with everything, I'm cynical than I ever been
I'll make the Beretta ring if any comin' up at a king
Alluding to leveling a leader livin' a better dream
Kinda like the brother on the side of Coretta King!
But the people, they made me a monster
I need a getaway and may need some Kontra-
Band in my hand I'm goin' crazy and bonkers
Like I'm rich and my baby's Ivanka!
They don't give a damn about a good nigga
They wanna take what you givin' and put you out in the river
Without a particular bout, I give you doubt if you is a
Fallacy giver and nothin' but a salary digger!
I'ma relay the message, you're gonna decay
If karma displays a deathbed, you wanna delay
The drama today that Tech said he gonna repay
The one in the way, I check it wit' a llama to spray!
When I spit it, niggas, quit it, 'cause I come wit' it
Big digits, got 'em livid, when I quick flip it
They don't wanna dig it but the spirit is not authentic
Not a pity party, but I'm fed up with the hatred
And how they wanna spit upon and hit the gentle faces
Not even knowin', we sick and mental cases
I open up they mouth wit' a fully and dental they shit!

I am (what?) fresh out of fucks!
I am (what?) fresh out of fucks!

Is it that I'm having a panic attack and I'm tired of fact
That I'm starvin' like Marvin Hagler, heart of a battler fighter
Or get you from out of here, hit you for standin' there
Man in here, mind your manners and manage your mannerisms
Your mouth of a minimal double dribblin'
Stuffed up a Ritalin, got me jitterin'
Got me feeling the pit fighter's adrenaline
Sittin' inside of a cage, prison, shank sharpened and bank targetin' (get 'em!)
Is it that I'm having a panic attack and I'm not gonna have it
Fresh outta fucks and I make it a habit
I don't trust anybody the fact
That you not giving a fuck, I practice
I been seein' on you wishing my tactics
Now the blood up outta my body, even the water out my cactus
I'll tackle a pterodactyl and shackle 'em, ride the back of 'em
Slappin' them in the abdomen, hurry the wings flappin'
We flyin' to Strangeland and demandin' a pretty penny
And poppin' my collar like I'm hidin' a hickey
I am who the suckas pretend to be, get offend of me
They depend on my energy, there's a penalty nigga
Finna be remedied, the epitome of an enemy
Any minute, we cut the noise and become a symphony
Catch a Windom, finally finna be, gettin' me behind a riddly dynasty
Tecca N9ne and me signin' these twin time to be violently
Murderin' my mind and become reblinded by me
And ignitin' the dynamite and then me Swish!

I am (what?) fresh out of fucks!
I am (what?) fresh out of fucks!

Bleed ya if you got the funk a milli fever
Nothing but a sucka billy diva
Buckin' really we had enough of the silly negras
Agreed get the heata, bussin' up to really freeze ya
I'm an abomination, when ya on ya hatin'
Kinda conversation, I'ma bomb ya nation
With my congregation of non-sedation
The Don's awakened achin' the spawn of Satan

Who called my name in? I go in
Not contemplatin' out dome
My combination ain't norm
I'll sock a face in the eye socket and break it
His mind pocket is achin'
The time clock is awastin', a pine box is awaitin'
I'm salivatin', they call me the killa, killa
There's no feelings, it's sentimental in general
I'ma hammer 'em, I'll hit 'em all in the middle
They feminine, all that bitchin' is not admissible
Zip it or get a kick in the genitals
When I spit it, niggas critic
'Cause every time I come with it
The winner, victor definitive
Pen and pad an opinion, opinionated
A pyramid in the makin' it permanent, here it's statin' initiative
Tryna get it and fit it where the position is
Put my life and my money, freedom at risk for this
Give me mine, I don't give a fuck what tradition is

Connect, ain't nobody but Tech
I been dope since I put raps on BASF cassette
Since then my pen been at war like Montagues and Capulets
A menacing strap you get, been winning in rap who's next
To get permanent power polluted, paper protruded
Punani praise on its pubics and they're prepared to pursue it
Get us then we drills em
Having plenty thrills um Wellington, New Zealand banging her with a 
chest like Wendy Williams
Everybody know with the kinda money I bring to the table I can put em on
Take em all around the world, get the dough and get the girl touching other people and I brought the hood along
Teams where I wings fly, things die but the king's eye people never seen cry
If you wanna see the mean side just go stream what I seen on steam, put your hand in my bean pie
Salam Baseem, Hakim and Keuh Rameen
I'm something fierce, I bring player haters to tears with my schemes
Come reach me, I got the species locked and no one can beat me
The feces, what I released on this beat he's gonna wanna seek me because I'm the WeeFee

WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
With my push alone
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
Now you're set in stone, I'm the
WeeFee

People need me, I'm the WeeFee
I get them on movies and TV
Connecting Scooby and Stevie
Straight from Missouri to Fiji
Trying to intrigue me ain't easy
Unless you bringing them bad beasies in three-bies
We be having them louder than 194 dB
Organ, grinding, so they pour us in their mouth, and they're loving it like Thorazine
When they freaking out I'm Jim Morrison
But I go without hair Billy Corgan
Releasing a lot more of them endorphins
WeeFee wins the war again the gores been like a horror film
Cause we kill, everything so be still
When we move in, not a cheap thrill
When the beat feels like E pills
Steadily repping B till, my B-L-double O-D spills
Then again Tech Nina keep mills
So I know I'mma get me a refill
Tech is highly respected
Been with a few major labels and left it
I rated my records intrepid
Since they didn't rep it then F it
Now I'm elected to get the check and invest it
I'm such a vet you can bet that I can get you connected
Cause I'm the WeeFee

WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on

Now you're set in stone, I'm the

Disconnect from me, get away from me
Get a bit of fake thinkin' they're big as your paper be
When they try to shake a G they normally have to take a fee that's lower than what they pay for he that works in M&M Bakery
You doubt a N9ne, you out of sight, you out of mind
Nigga shout a crime from me they sniffing them powder lines
I'm the righteous
But I kill a man like I'm Cypress
Play me like I'm not the nicest
No WeeFee leave you lifeless
Taking a knife to fight with ISIS, I like it
When they spite they get vices
When they hit that pipe think they're psychic
Wanna figure my mic and try to slice it
But they do fizzle when they hear SuWu whistles
Disrespect me true this will happen and they lose signal
This was long awaited
Strange is how all the fakes were created
They think they made it, forgot about me and skated
They music, everybody played it cause I was right there to save it
They downgraded they hate it cause their signal is faded
Cause I'm the WeeFee, nigga

Pitch black, star bright, yeah that's my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends, plot foes, stock ends and pot holes
Cause when the tank hit the bank, it just got closed
Don't be stank in the paint cause the yak froze

Wish I knew back when I was strugglin'
If I plugged in and kept bustin'
I'd be buzzin', that'd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin' over but
Cousin, I keep it up and gushin'
And tell all of my family, aunts and uncles, cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No good to remain sour cause someone else's lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell 'em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin' a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends, cause it's never enough
At hostile situations with folks, I learned it's better to bust
First, and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuff's worth
You love who love you, do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to cuzz blue
So keep hopin' the Lord does show up
Cause it'll never be no peace on earth for all of us
'Till this mug blow up

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on those that's on my mind
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Ponderin' these thoughts while sittin' idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelin's boilin' up, I'm simmerin' on everything
Goin' for the gold because it's shimmerin', but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured, need a better team
Every thought and every dream, every plot and every scheme
Lurkin' around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative, and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect, abuse the medicine
You thinkin' you can let 'em in, partake in buildin' excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin'
The feathers flock together, see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so it's best to let 'em go, we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled, trynna justify they pestilence
I don't understand why they so demanding manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess, I'd make an estimate, I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate 'till I'm at heaven's gate
Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on those that's on my mind
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Mmm, life sentence for fallen angel physical body
Illuminate my soul, officially became godly
I be the one, all of these demons runnin' from
Dumped a gun, lifted spirits, niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd, rappin' gap and loud
Facin' twelve in the pen, none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
I'm 'posed to break bread bitch, taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin' the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin'
I'm on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden, trynna dine with women
Dipped in finest linen, try and find a business
I love who love Gee, fuck you if it's fuck me
That's just how it gotta be, cause I'm paper routin'
Tame nuisance, insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me, guess when the god speakin' Strange Music

Ain't tryin' to have no more babies
So come for my crazy love
Enough to make her go crazy

I was born Aaron Dontez Yates
Now this song's for Aaron Dontez' mates
If you ever been with me
Had some sex even kissed me
Spent some years with me
Or even a quickie trip thee
Way I handle the beast in me
The piece in me and equally
I chief to say the least
Women are weakin' in me
Since I was a little fella wanted me a female(a) Isabella
What the hell not one but it's more like twelve lemme tell ya
Hella, bitches love me once and love me again
While you're lovin' me I'm lovin' your friend
Ya'll just lovin' the sin
And all that Tech time you're lovin the spin
But I ain't tryin' to be no husband again
Look at all this mud that I'm in
And all this dirt that I do
And this hurt put on you it's true
Worse that peppy le pue what I do
To my ladies I remember the
Message I sent to ya
I know you think I'm a friend to ya
But I'm tryin to put it up into ya


A child of the ghetto, my uncle explained it to me
Kick it with bitches the picture that he painted for me
Now that I'm a G I'm 'bout to go in a depth
Got low when I crept
With a bitch, you niggas ain't know when I slept (with who?)
Sonya, Tonya, Vonya, big booty Sandra
Wonda, Londa, Rhonda, Monya, v-neck and Anya
Anxious to feel the pound between her, kiss the crown on my wiener
Once you lay down then you stuck with the killer clown, the N9na
Witness my sickness this itches for the bitches with the quickness
Kisses for misses this clique is suspicious then I hit this
But he really don't know I had the most ludicrous fling with his girl
I think the female is really the most beautifulist thing in this world
They take of their shirt, take off their bra
Then let you take off they skirt and panties, keep a nigga in awe
In-between 'em, such a freedom is lovin' monster sex
For them to let you inside 'em is a fucking compliment


The homie say for true he sick
Cause he choose these chicks
On the road and let them sut min pik
They tellin' me I show my wife no fidelity and lost it literally
My way with women is costin' considerably
Bitter is he who loved and lost with the grudge and crossed the moss
In the land where the word lost is boss
So we quest for love and flings with the finest this life can bring to ya
True you two have a thing but it'll never ever be singular
Guess you can say it's the angel in me
That got these bitches havin' dreams of mangelin' me
I know it hurts it sucks for women, but they let me thrust' within 'em
Why do they lay with a snake? They can't stop they lust for venom
But you will not forgive me baby, you gots to admit we crazy
Because you bring me ya light and I'm just so dips and hazy
My heart is massive but they want my dick
Bitch, you ain't never felt no shit like this, so gimme a kiss",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-girl-crazy-crazy-love-lyrics

So wind and dine me and mine 'til we belching lots
I can't stop eatin', I really love eatin'
I know my body be wishing I was vegan
The fat of my stomach it was leaving me, feedin' me
All I be thinkin' when I be breathin' unevenly
But that don't matter, I'm taking it to the head
Tucking my tummy in even if in bigger threads
Telling me if I don't be careful and kill the bread
I'm gonna pig out until a nigga dead

Insatiable's my name when it comes to my favorite things
I sleep my sins off in the day
And then at night I come to play
On my favorite
I never plan to die, too much I haven't tried
Give me more, give me more, I crave it
Yes I love it, that's my favorite

I'm an addict, who's frantic manic on everything
Kamikaze chemicals into my blood stream
Caffeine, nicotine and the good green
On top of Vicodin, it's kinda like I'm takin' flight again
Prepare for lift off, stimulation drift off
If I don't feed my addiction I'm getting pissed off
All these vices they siphon my life span
Monkey on my back, I got the devil in my right hand
Always leadin' me, deceitful thievery percedes to impede 'til there's no more Steve in me
In need to feed the beast, off to eagerly
I can't seem to leave it be and be freed
Feel my synapses collapsing, I'm gasping
I think I'm going out like Michael Jackson
Tunnel vision, everything is turning black
And I'm headed to a place where there never is no coming back
Swan dive in the Lake of Fire
All thanks to my faithful drug suppliers
All it takes is a taste, now you're all subscribers
Under the reigns of the chains of your own desires
Your new God is in black attire
Now a slave to his ways, you could not defy him
Such a waste in this race 'til ya life expires
No escape, given chase like I'm Michael Myers

Insatiable's my name when it comes to my favorite things
I sleep my sins off in the day
And then at night I come to play
On my favorite
I never plan to die, too much I haven't tried
Give me more, give me more, I crave it
Yes I love it, that's my favorite

After the shows I be off the E
Got a big fat sack and it be all for me
Six in the morning I be off of these
Yellin' ""6 'N the Mornin'"" like my nigga Ice-T
I pop all of it all the time
And they put me in the zone when I'm writing rhymes
Drugged out, 'bout to take the mug out
Drinking gallons of water I gotta get the drug out
So stuffed like I'm sniffing coke up
And I love it as much as I love getting cold cuts (go rough)
Yeah I'm the nigga that your hoe love
She be trying to rape me but I be like ""Hold up""
Date rape, 'bout to sell a rape tape
Yeah, Kim Kardashian/Ray J
All up in that ass again, mayday
I'm just sick in the head as they say
I be off the top, TEC-9 cocked
And I'm paranoid ready to pull it, that's off top
Y'all better than us, hog slop
Get us on a Tech N9ne stage, it's gon' pop
Grrr, and it's all up to here
She just popped the pill and I'm purr
This is not for real and I'm ill
Call me a Beastie Boy, Kill at Will

Insatiable's my name when it comes to my favorite things
I sleep my sins off in the day
And then at night I come to play
On my favorite
I never plan to die, too much I haven't tried
Give me more, give me more, I crave it
Yes I love it, that's my favorite",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-my-favorite-lyrics
Questions (Rough Draft),The Calm Before the Storm: Part 1,1997.0,"The name of this motherfucker is called ""Questions (Rough Draft)"" (Ha ha, tell 'em)
QD3 did the beat (All day, all night)
What's up to everybody out there in L.A
What's really goin on?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why so many questions?
What am I doing?
I talk to myself... when there's no-one to talk to

I wanna ask me a question:
When am I gonna make it up out of a hellish and devilish way?
When are you gonna make the millions worth of dividends?
When are you gonna make ends, generate wealth?
Who in the hell left the gate open to you in the cell?
Is everybody on wavelength like us?
Why do I rip it in half? Do we kick ass with backwards
Attacks ish like hap ut yrlived?
Can you wait a minute?
Can you slow it up a little bit N9na so I can get up in it?
But did you really wanna dabble in fanatical supernatural
Lyrically radical milli minutes? I'm about to begin it
Can I get some? Can I spit some? Which one?
When am I gonna get off this trip?
Can I take another peel? Why do I feel
Like I'm a sick individual in the room, poppin' off at the lip?
Do you feel me? Do you do voodoo really?
Did you get it? Do you want a real epidemic?
Will you let me run up in it?
What's the word? Is it absurd? What is that ish you heard?
Was it real? Is it real? Was it really real?
Tech N9ne in it to win it besides QD third occurred
Who's the worst? Who's rastafari?
You never livin', never sure it's Selassie, the first
Brother on the planet Earth, who?
Do you wanna flow? What you wanna do?
How can I be in the zone like this? Gone like this?
How can I break the obsession?
In the middle of it all, when I snap back, step back
And ask myself; what? Why do you ask so many questions?

Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace

Do you understand? What you gonna do when N9na hit you
With the critical homicidal lyrical killer flippin'
Leavin' you with boo-boo underpants?
How does it feel?
Do you wanna come up and chill with an assassin?
Can you feel it inside, what?
The feeling of a commotion of two titans clashing
Why me? Who are you? What I am supposed to do?
What a nigga here fo'? Who do you fear mo'?
Is it the N9ne with a brand new joint?
Like to hear it, here go
What are you lookin' at?
When am I gonna get a dose of Thorazine?
Can you give me a little something to ease the pain?
He's the mayn, who's the mayn?
Tecca N9na with the Rogue Dogs and the MidWestSide crew's to blame
Can I get a little backwards attack ish?
What do you accomplish, never can't you diss this
Pitless bottom of a, in you toss out nigga ass, Bade Mitch
Hater-playa percent hundred that is Side-West-Mid
Down ever who off but aggin
Did you know Tech N9ne hot like a dragon?
Did you feel it baby?
Can you give me a double dose of whatever?
The feeling I'm gettin' is really pain, Kobain
For anybody want a piece of this, sickness
Is it a cinch to get with hot?
Who? When? Where? What? Why?
I'm at the pinnacle with a killer eye, do I wanna die?
No, I just wanna dose of the most inner syringe up in my thigh
Bonzai!

Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace

Now do you know what the real is?
Does everybody think I'm twisted? Non-realistic
Or do you think that I'm gifted? I'ma lift it, yeah
Can you help me? Am I lookin' at you?
Could I be peepin' you from afar? Please, remain calm
Could you be the reason I'm a bomb
Straight out of Vietnam, ready to explode on Satan?
Tell me what the problem is, I'm alright where the bottom is
Do you know what a empty column is?
Am I your worst nightmare? I feel sick right there
Should I blow it out? Can I do without? Do I need help?
Am I living within a pen of demons?
I'm stressing, can I get a blessing? (from who?)
The one who cursed me with all these questions

Some say I'm psychotic
But if I have to label it, it would be ""confusion""
It's like I gotta write shit like this
To keep my head from exploding, y'knahmsayin'?
So many questions

Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?

What is livin' on 904 Michigan?
What is havin' roaches and trouble findin' more dividends?
Dyin' a poor citizen
What is bars in the door to seal us in
War kill us men, tryin' for your kid again
What is savin' your pay to go stay in a available place
In the way 'cause you ain't paying no janx when the Yate makes a way to rotate
What is weight in your safe? So we can stay in your race
Lay 'em on tape invading your state with this pain in your face
What is the door slam? They ain't with the program
The bidness give a damn, you go HAM, you giving 'em more stamina
What is having a manager bookin' many shows to go jam?
What is at the bottom? They don't really gotta
What is in a column without another who stopped him
Dropped him, popped and chop him, what is summer, spring and autumn?
What is dope and to the top and shot him what is poverty?
What is acknowledging a prodigy?
What is the dichotomy of this good and bad anthology?
What is lads that follow the sad path Sickology?
What is livin' life low, then livin' like you hit the lottery

When I first heard the beat, it gave me the vision that if the
Mayan calender was correct and in 2012 the world was actually destroyed
When a new civilization forms and they get to diggin' they find this
And this will be a perfect way to start off the new hip-hop culture
You know what I'm sayin'? We're two murderers lyrically
You know what I'm sayin'? It'd be crazy
Strange, baby!

What is gettin' off the X and writin' an album?
What is being put in the middle like Malcolm?
Sicker than sarcoidosis
I eat Carrion, I got body parts in my Carry-On
That's when the party starts, nigga, I'm very hung
Been rippin' up niggas since I was very young
Scary-lookin' motherfucker, ready to kill your daddy's mom
Ready to eat that meat with a meat cleaver
I creep in the streets and defeat these
Eat these niggas up hot shittin' out their feces
Put a knife in their nieces
At least he's younger, hunger, dinner
He sees thunder, one nut in her
He sees baby, doctor visit
He spills rabies in his lyrics
Put her in the back with the flat tire, I'm fire 'till I retire
I tie her up and then fry her up and then give her to the higher up
Tech N9ne intertwine, get out the wine
This is my kind of hip-hop

This is hip-hop

To all my youngsters out there listening to this:
Find some sort of education or understanding of life and how it was
And then try to find out how you can continue to grow this thing
And better this thing and take this thing to higher heights with
More knowledge and more conviction to preserve this thing called hip-hop!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-this-is-hip-hop-lyrics

This one is the business

I don't make this drink by the gallon

Got KMK, Slaughterhouse and Brother Allen
On KC Teas we all over the world wild'n

Hennessy, twist of the lemon with the
Hennessy, Sprite go right with the
Hennessy, make your night go right with the
KC Tea (KC Tea)

I like to drink it in a real big wine glass
At my place with full of women lettin' time pass
With Hennesey, Sprite and lemon baby I mash
Drunk as a skunk but the second one im on your fine ass
The first variation from the homie Vito
We grink the Hennesey and lemon where ever we go
Then add the Sprite from seven was me yo
Then me a Kali named it in a Las Vegas casino
Lemon or lime it don't matter if you slum (Man that sound real good)
Taste good too punk
A double shot into your cup will get you crunk
Too much more and when you wake up and you thump like
Bam bam aww dwamn
This is how you feel the next day because you slamed the KC Tea
Gotta take easy like E

Fill the cup full of ice first
Cause the Hennesey will melt a little ice and it might urk
Me when I'm all up on a little tight skirt
I need a fully loaded Kansas City tea to quenchin my thirst
If you ain't got no real lemon
Just let a little lemon or lime juice spill in 'um
I know alot of caucasian people don't really do the Hennesey
But the way I make it I will in 'um
Covert alot of people every year and
On Saint Patty's Day I shared it with very weird fans
They started fightin' and my leg was near 'em
I told em ""Take it easy, there's a beverage here, man!""
Kc Tea is 100 mane
Check it if it's flat Sprite then I don't want it mane
My money mane is on Hennesey in the image on cream corn
I'm runnin' thangs (I'm runnin' thangs)

What you want? What you need?

All we need is Hennessy

A lot a men never sinned on the Hen
Where ya been boy boy where ya been?
It'll have ya wit her again and again
Even strong enough to do her lesbian friend
If you can't handle her then hand her to me
Cause I'm at five of em and I'm bout to hammer the V
Even got it set up for the camera to see
I'm wit her but I'm really picturing Angela Yee
She ain't wearin nothing but Blahniks on her feet
KC Tea got me really supersonic in the sheets
Hittin harder than sticky icky chronic on the streets
So nice to wake up in the bathroom ain't no vomit on the seat
Bartender made it right and I'm sure because it tastes sweet like candy
Yeah, and Ludacris you can make it with Conjure
And 40 you can make it with Landy but authentic is the

Retrogression,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"What is this in the distance?
My drug begging for commitment
Man I'm gonna do what they say
Release and just retrogress with ¡Mayday!

I'm thinking of retrogression, about going back to my best friend
On a X Binge, but the uncut, Molly, will you kill me is the question
I miss sessions with about two chicks on deck
In my bed undressing now we meshing pressing
Sex and sweating left an empress of heaven
I used to boost her with Adderall, my teeth would chatter all gnaw
It really don't matter y'all, I'm cool
Like the cigarettes, I was a bigger threat to the clitoris
Successful sexually bit her neck get her wet
Just how high can a nigga get
Blasted acid, F-asterisks-C-K, coulda' he say
He may crash it fit to replay D-Day ashes
I take masses so I could stay plastered
That great plastic I ate like bait in Lake Placid

Molly I miss you, if I was to kiss you
Will you take this sick fool to gold days
I know you can lift moods when I'm having issues
I wish I could split smooth to the old days

If you feel like their plan don't fit us all
Then you will find my land don't give us law
If you feel like not taking that bigger fall!
Then with all respect if we retrogressed
Then they'll rid us all!

Okay so lets go, retro-gression I'm guessing that Wrek knows
These memories all in my flesh though, strange love, he's in a depeche mode!
Some of the greatest sex woes that ex-ho
And if I was bringing a Vicks tips to her lips
It was for something that she'd never let go
I drink shots with her laughed and smoke Newports
The time we spent was too short, my mind is heading due north
My body's on its true course, this woman has got my youth sore
And tooth raw, all of the lights are leading me through a new door
Can't we just go back? Can't we just reunite?
I need a throwback to seeing you in flight
You had that down south body with a hint of death
Picked you up and held you down, sound until I went to rest
But who needs rest, when the world is gone
Everything is burning so I'mma just alert the globe and hurt you slow
You're known for fast love and vertigo, so I'll just
Pick you up and get a little intimate in a minute
A cue for the return of a virgin soul


I tuned 'em out, I-I tuned 'em out
Too busy turning on it dropping out
Behind my, my mama's house, producing clouds
Never understood my need to get numb
Meanwhile I'm bleeding out my eyes
Heaving out my lungs, trying to avoid the sun
Curious at a young age for a taste, watching them numb they faced
Till Caroline found someone for us to bring out on dates
I call it youthful curiosity, jumped the edge every saturday
Strobe lights and low lifes the city at night was calling me
I turned 'em out, I-I-I turned 'em out
Had 'em both kissing on my lips
Then smoked the spliff to boost the trip
Lift off, I'm gone, phone call my bro, let him know that I'm lost
And I got sand in my shoes from twilight beach - Menage a Trois
Heavily sedated I, grew up with jaded eyes
See she's been friends of mine since '99
But now we don't see eye to eye
Can't retrogress, unless life gets too heavy for my chest
Then I be tuning out and caning dropping out before they win",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-retrogression-lyrics

To rock it, I'm with it, but outside it that shit is booty-hole
No interviews with Tech Nina unless you well versed
On what I done after so many years, how we sell work
Even in this climate, we climbin' as high as inhaled purp
But you don't know that I'm the new and a throwback, so wack
I hate doing radio, but I do it well
And it's done 'cause the pushin' for N9ne and crew to sell
But I get up in the establishment, never got the music, we have the shit
What I want to do is straight jab and kick Timbo’s to his tail

Wanna waste the time you get nothing, but cursin' out at me, true
Some of them see us 'cause slackin' will hurt them salaries, you
Never get my presence, you peasants be dirt and cowardly, ooh
I can rap, woohoo, I got stacks, woohoo
Everybody know that so I musta rap on your tracks, booboo
They don't fit my flow, when I spit I glow
But do I fit to that which is normal in Hip-Hop (no!)
Some bumping the flow to the young pump and a bro
Plump sprung when you go tongue dumb, dumb then you grow

He don't make me feel I gotta kneel at a dark altar
His colleagues are cool, things are jolly and smooth
Anything else, it'll be part stupid and part awkward
Do your homework before you talk to a vet
That way you won't get no static comin' from Tech
I'm on my own Planet, I'm in my zone, dammit
I see a lot of you and wonder just how you drones manage
You niggas don't get it at all, the wicked
You get it delivered to y'all and give it a negative critic
Know when I spit it them people are giving the calls
Requesting me, I'm blessed and free
You want Tech the G, you must step to me
I ain't beggin' for no petty press, I'm already set
Done a lot of work with Travis that made our fetti stretch
Even though I'm Michael Myers, I still get steady checks
But yo when I'm slicin' haters I leave a Freddy mess

But they rich and got more to blow and every thing's affordable
But they gotta go before me because their stage show is horrible

I hit the stage, grab the mic
And blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
They may be platinum, but they know
I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
Why you do me like that girl?
You know, I love your mama

I just wanted to have a bite with her or somethin'
Didn't go get up on that show to fight with her or nothin'
It was Keyshia Cole, Eric Benét, Gorilla Zoe, Tech N9na and T.I
But Keyshia was actin' bia-bia
Why she actin' like a (What?), like a (What?)
She ain't know I grab the mic and light it (Up), light it (Up)
She say, ""She don't know me""
But I'm the number one independent in the country
Man, she the only one actin' funky
And the people at the summer jam, they want me
She say, ""She ain't going on before somebody that's local""
And she went postal and loco, saying, ""her not closing, is a no-go""
Down talked me real low though
'Bout how she got more doe and just did a TV promo
No show better than the MO bro with the S and M logo
Damn baby, much success is sittin' in your favor
Slam the N9na Tech before considerin' the data
Fans waited, so we went, so she'd get it for later
But Frankie said, ""Excuse my daughter, she's a bit of a hater""
Dwamn!

I hit the stage, grab the mic
And blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
They may be platinum, but they know
I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)

Ayy, ayy, check it, I understand seniority
But in this case, on this show, I'm a top priority
In Lawrence, you're minority and I'm the majority
Check it, I was young and broke
But I'd fetch it, if it was freshest
Shoveled snow for the Eric B. and Rakim record
Promoters called us and said
""We got this show and want you to close us""
Ghostface and Brother Ali rockin' with a band in 'Sota
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock, but he never ever showed up
He swole up 'cause he didn't wanna go up before us
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Think that the world gotta kiss their asses
500 capacity but you wanna get 200 passes
Thought it was about gouda, 40 Water told me
""N9na, get your cabbage, stay savage and ravage the average""
Y'all better hope radio and video
Keep me from slithering into they circle
I'll change it, that's why they shivering
Rakim the god? He just missed the king's delivering
'Cause they know they'll fall
And I'll blow them all to smithereens

I hit the stage, grab the mic
And blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
They may be platinum, but they know
I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)

Real, real spill, yeah, baby girl
I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy
You know what I'm sizzlin'?
Ol' boy, I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy
Do your research before you down somebody else
Get off your high horse
Keyshia Cole, get off your high horse
Rakim, get off your high horse
Industry, get off your high horse

Sad Circus,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, hurry hurry hurry! Step right up and witness the sad circus! Come one, come all, to the sad circus! Step right up and see the lonely poor bastard. Witness, the man with no hope. Stories guaranteed to be tear jerkers. Now without further adieu, the sad circus!

I had so many plans, cause I got plenty fans
I thought that I was never gonna be alone to spend these grands
But it seems that every girl that I dated somehow hated the way I loved
And I mated with so many, now the ones that with it, its not any; they all ran
I thought that I was gonna be Hugh Hef, 6 women to go 2-step but not one of my crews left
Kids are growing up and they got lives now nobody arise now
Used to be married but narcissism let my bride down
I used to be a playa, I used to be afraid of bein' alone
But they all eventually said ""I'll see ya later..."" much later...
Sittin' in this plush lair must say I'm stuck in a rut
I guess not enough prayer
Cause ain't nobody came back, I bust the same raps
But ain't no dame pack wish I could change that
They say that I'm extra I'm messed up and I murk the deals
That I have with them in the past and I miss 'em and it hurts for real

See the man with the broken heart (He's just right over there)
All alone he stands so lonely in this world so cold
And he's been hopeless from the start (He feels like no one cares)
Born alone, he'll die so lonely, saddest story ever told

Sooner or later rumors that tear me up in pieces
And he's just bad luck everywhere I go I'm sick of this steepness
More money more problems, no money problems gettin' worse
He don't have to get bloody but he didn't have to get hurt
Fuck I'm so tired of all this cryin' it don't work
It's affectin' my work, not even carin' about my worth
Thin line between love and raps, Strange got the fans comin' back
Bad plus bad run in packs, startin' to think is a curse
I can't you do it without you nigga'
Can't be done without me nigga'
Well, yes it can, wait, please don't do it without me nigga'
Strange move on without these lyrics, makin' it to where these fans can hear it
I'mma have to get done I'm near it, Brotha Lynch Hung you can't be serious
I'm starin' at these pills, in the back of the Cadillac, and matta' fact
I got it I grip my steel, I'm always on this suicide thinkin' that's how I feel
I figure if I get rid of these pills nobody would care if I'm killed
My label's on the road, me just sittin' at home, see
Spittin that chrome, he gettin'that gold
We get that call and then we run in they house, gun up in they mouth
Just know it's Madesicc Strange that's what I'm talkin' 'bout


Thank you! For coming, to the sad circus...come again...or not...hahahaha...

I'm falling, I'm crawling, I'm yelling but no one can hear me calling. I'm crying, profusely, sometimes I wish somebody would just come and noose me",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-sad-circus-lyrics

That's so fucking foolish
In my book, never been a pardon
When the yapping happens, capping in your jargon
Babble yells, that'll fail
I bet you been a tattletale since kindergarten
He's punked, we dump the punk, debunked, no sin again
We bump P Funk, he slumps, Glee jump, so feminine
That's why he's a cop dressed in his block best, but a hot mess
Never do know how to talk less, so we plot stretch, when you got next?
Two in the ten, he doing again
He gonna rat on you and a friend, then you in the pen
He gonna mix it up and try to put you and the crew in the blend
He gonna tell, then the screwing begin
El capo debacle, that is what he can offer
Depend on him and then in a rut he can toss you
He claim he down, dirty, and muddy but softer
Than cotton candy, me and my buddies'll off you

Hate to see me shining get to tripping when they off they ripple

Most of them in my city never know me but yet they heard of me
At the BET awards chilling with the Federation  women at the door giving away the shoes didn't really want me to have 'em, man I had a ticket I had to grab 'em
Come to find out I was in a rhyme bout a couple years ago
Here's the blow 'cause I rake up dough
She was one of the women I left behind up at the wake up show
Congratulate me 'cause I'm a go getta

'Cause it's Strangeland everything goes up vertical above the clouds I flow
How I got here I don't really know or remember like The Alamo
So to give me direction on this journey is Big Krizz Kaliko

Now here is a beautiful world for you to enter
You can hear how we kill everyone, we're Helter Skelter
On this fear that is fearing us spear chuckers that love to bust
Shear stroke of genius since we appeared out the penis
We just the lost boys like we sons of Donald Sutherland
We done struggling we forced our way in and forced to weigh in
The big swinging cocks of rap, R&B and rock
We been seeing lots of cats copying ya not
Them G-O-D's and we can bless ya like we was a pastor
We past ya long ago ya concentrate on rapping faster
This is the temple of making it look simple to y'all
I wasn't really into rap or in the rap 'cause I seen too many flaws
Why they fall for Strangeland go up filled with streams of Caribou Lou
Fill ya cup and toast how they blow up
My team captain is you Nina I'm the first lieutenant
Enjoy your visit this is Strangeland that you invented

Complex written scripts are always sex driven
Behold us we've had it so rough so what's the slogan we have at Strangeland?
It goes up!
When I ask you what goes up mane if it's all good then you say that it goes
Mane if it's no, you simply just say that it don't, then I'mma label you foe
That's when they hit the flow if you hating in my land we can throw
But I prefer with drinking 'Bou Lou that's cold
Then hit the vertical path and get on these hoes
I love it Eep Op Ork Ah Ah
Even if you're brand new come meat shock your faja
And I'm looking for the girls with them deep bra's more tatas
On the vertical then get horizontal then I'mma beat up your nana

The Martini,K.O.D.,2009.0,"The Martini
In movie terms, directors use this phrase
To describe the last shot of the day while on set
The stories you are about to hear are true
Names have been kept the same to reflect the Strange
This is the Martini..

This is Sam
He was so in love with her
But she was young and so that put her off in a jam
Though she was sweet as a yam
She wanted to explore other options with her man
Straight sending Sam into a rampage
And no matter what his fam says
He's lost without this woman and don't wanna live any damn ways
Now he's thinkin', if he ain't gon' live, she ain't gon' live
And the other man's mercy, he ain't gon' give
This what love do, it cops a .38 snub to
Knock on your door, and take somebody that used to love you
Rub you, the wrong way, then it's blood true
Love through, she's slug one and he's slug two
Then on a rainy evening, with a panicked feelin'
Went to her home and looked in the window and Sammy sees them
The door's between her and the Necromancer
And what you think is gon' happen if she answers?

Take a drink, it's more than what you think
I gotta let you know, don't plan on letting you go
But if you have to leave, that's where we'll end the scene
This is the Martini, last shot's for you or me

Yo, this is Isaiah
I guess he was, I'd say a
Ladies man, everyone used to call him the KCI Playa
Flying multiple chicks in, give the stick then dismiss them
But somethin's gonna happen that'll twist him
He fell in love with a beautiful black woman
But he ended up having a couple problems with that woman
Talkin' to other men, did it behind his back on 'em
Facebook, computer love, crept on the Mac on 'em
Now he's salty, 'cause he found the woman he loves is faulty
He told her at the very beginning, ""Don't you ever cross me""
Now that she did it, he plans to do something unlawfully
Get a gun off the street, because he was treated so awfully
One bullet for her, one bullet for him
Crimes of passion, ain't no more pullin' for them
And the worst way, we broke apart, it really hurts lady
I've gotta go, but yo, you gotta go first baby

Take a drink, it's more than what you think
I gotta let you know, don't plan on letting you go
But if you have to leave, that's where we'll end the scene
This is the Martini, last shot's for you or me

This is Brian
He was a rebel and stayed on another level
And had no intentions of dying
He loved Kim a lot, above them was not
But a jealous ex-husband would love them to rot
I guess he loved Kim still
His only thoughts him, them, kill
'Cause he a coward motherfucker
On Christmas Eve he broke in and waited in they house for hours
Crazy motherfucker!
Brian pulled up with Kim and little Alissa in the car
Saw a shadow in the house from afar and said, ""Wait""
Got out the car, opened the gate
Walked in the house and her fucking ex sealed my nigga's fate
That was my best friend, bitch-ass nigga
Walked out the house and shot Kim right in front of Alissa
Then he saved the last shot for him, blast!
Now you better hope I don't go to hell, because I'ma be on your ass!

Take a drink, it's more than what you think
I gotta let you know, don't plan on letting you go
But if you have to leave, that's where we'll end the scene
This is the Martini, last shot's for you or me

Fire in AC,Boiling Point: K.O.D. Collection,2012.0,"Shh, psycho over there
Here he comes, here he comes
Hey James
(Yeah?)
You're killin' us with that wild red hair, bro
(I like to kill people, people like you)

I'm a college student sitting next to James Holmes
His mental light ain't on and the lovin' him ain't showin
So I gotta invite him to study at my strange home
Cause he needs to be flame thrown and repeatedly banged on
'Til his brain gone, you think you Bane? I put my fangs on
Then it's game on, for the pain, gonna break his dang bones
Cause James wrong, get him a hook to hang on
And drain Holmes veins; get em to switch his insane tone
You have entered the dungeon of real killers
Demons they will fill us, with drillas and steel millas
He'll pay me with his life, cause this animal's real crazy
Cause this motherfucker don't even care if he kill babies
I wish, this would've happen like it happened in my mind
Instead of what occurred in theater number 9
My condolences to the families that mourn
All humanity was torn, for what he damaged see some horns, motherfucker
Burn in hell for eternity for what you did
The depths of Hell gonna swallow your ass!

Gone, baby, gone, never made the dawn
Never had a fucking chance to turn crazy on
My fire in AC he stopped you, shocked you
Aurora Colorado, I got you

Raa! Dirty Wormz
This is Amityville horror Aurora, I make him feel the flame
For the respect of the families I mention no names
And I can feel your pain; you see the devil's face?
Look at him smiling on trial, this is a closed case
Mister Yates, let him in, close the gate
This is the date for his fate, there will be no escape
Duct tape, zip him up, strap gim down
He's graduatin' here give him his cap and gown
Turn off your cell phones, no talking in the preview
It's the last midnight show and you know just how it end, too
It ain't no part two, this ain't no cartoon
Watch em start screamin' for god when I put this fire to him
This is the murder show, order the blood bath
A psychopath that murders psychopaths actin' bad
And walk away like I'm Dexter man with my bandana to the back
In all black like I'm Batman
Dirty Wormz


Hahahaha, here's Kali!
What you want me to be a, killa?
Wish I can fill up my voice with some incredible heat
And no catchin' me slip, and I stay on my feet
Call up Brotha Lynch and I tell him go eat
James, your brain will be dangling from strings if the
Strangers could change it, at yourself you would aim
I wish a nigga would, run up in the movies
While I'm in there with my kids and my boo
I would be popping them back at you
Cause oddly they life is through
And I'm godly but might get stupid
Psychotic ain't no excuse
Cause I'm there too and I can prove it (Okay)
We hold him for pressures, it ain't effortless
For Holmes to count his blessings
Cause he gotta deal with the rest of us (Okay)
And I'd love to take his chest off the rest of him
Arrestin' him ain't good enough, let's make him a vegetable
On second thought, I'mma pray for him (Nah)
Hope the angel of death opens the gate for him (Yeah)
Better tell him if you bust in Aurora
All the nations reppin' Snake and the Bat will be aiming for you (Kali)
In the immortal words of Tech N9ne baby
The sands of time have already begun to pour against you


I got ya, Colorado I got you
Tech N9ne got you, Smackola got you
Strange Music that’s our biggest market
We love you, our condolences to the families
That lost their loved ones to this punk",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-fire-in-ac-lyrics
Lord of Weird,N9NA,2019.0,"When I first started out
Thought to myself, ""Spread your heart about""
Never thought that people look at my art and doubt
Wanna bar this mouth, then they darted out
Then the same energy let it charted out (Chyeah)
King James, that show you things change
To the Queen Waymon with Keen Wayans from Ving Rhames
The scene came from extreme brains to teen lames
Get your green, mane, while I fling Strange in a bling lane (Chyeah)
So I go dye my hair rojo
Way back in '99, homies who saw me call me homo
But then the rumors started that I worship Jesus logo
Flippin’ it upside down but no-no, so many fear this wicked bozo
But now it's accepted like they finally infected
With the formidable Tech shit, like it's normal to go mesh with
The darkness (Chyeah)
I was on a mission blacks feared
20 years ago, but now they love it
Isn’t that weird?

Oh, Lord
This thing is
So (Weird, weird) yours
So bring it
Home, Lord
This thing is
So (Weird, weird) yours (Weird, weird)
So bring it

I'm the nigga that started this
But I didn't swish my hips like a bitch and dress like Spartacus
My art is sick, bombarded with retarded quick
Nice flows for the psychos
They don't like those with the tight clothes
What they want is Tecca N9na when the light goes
Way low, the K.O.D. shit
Fatally spray on these hits
Place go like Dave-o, Waco
When I ain't flow, he pray on these tricks
I'm the nigga with the spiked hair
Painted face with the robe, might scare
Many people think 'cause I was quite rare
But tonight, there for the nightmare

Oh, this is not, lost what I seek (Spirits, spirits, spirits)
Oh, this cigar up my sleeve
I am here to muzzle who
Those who think their hustle new
They're not any trouble to the L.O.W
I am here to muzzle who
Those who think their hustle new
They’re not any trouble to the L.O.W

She Devil,Absolute Power,2002.0,"And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her to Adam
And Adam said: ""This is the bone of my bones, and the flesh of my flesh""
 I want you to take this
 What is it?
 Something that'll make you feel real good
 Aw, damn, girl, give it here

Often they blow your top
Watch when they hold your jock
Shocked when they're not sold crotch and you lost composure
Soft for the hoes, you're not stocked for the row
You walk for the hot shot wanna cop and do lots of doja
She-devil, her greed level is hella high
Speed rebel exceed pedals with a devil's eye
They call girl and strip, they all twirl and trip
In y'all world and dip and all thorough and hip
Hustlers, they sluts and drug smugglers
Money they double up, throw that stuff up and bubble up
Best believe when I get you I'm 'bout to strap it down
'Cause by the time I tippie-tow in your cappy town
I got to have it now
Tech N9ne, it's a habit, got to stab it, I'm a savage hound
She-devils are incredible, out for thy dough
Where the krilla is skrilla, X and tapes of Tae-Bo, yo

(Sin with me; I warn you)
She Devil's in the house lemme here ya (Heeyyy)
Off top I gots to get near ya

Today my wife left, I don't give a fuck
Bitch that's why I'm paying you 150 bucks
(How much for me and my man?) To suck, me and Kuniva
Let this diabetic dick touch your saliva
I think I'm bonin' crazy,  to 48
Ever since we've fucked I've been coughing and losing weight
Stank ho', trying to creep
Bitch pick up your son, he been at school for a week (Mommy!)
You fucking freak trying to get the best of me
Kidnap your ass, leave you lost like Kelly without Destiny
You stank trick, you suck dick
Jason Williams, (Whaddup?) Shoot this dirty bitch

(Sin with me; I warn you)
She Devil's in the house lemme here ya (Heeyyy)
Off top I gots to get near ya

This devilist bitch is so succulent
Taking a piece of my soul every time
That I bust a nut she's like a succubus
A nymphomaniac laying me back on the filthy mattress
Cum stains on it smelling like catfish
Still I hit it, yeah I did it
Her pussy travels, she doesn't have a pivot
I remember when she was timid
Your scandalous ass taking the pastor's cash
Got him on tape suckin' your tits, snortin' and passin' hash
I still had to grab that ass
Had to laugh at stories about your ragged ass lickin' maxi pads
You silly bitch, she used to be a nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fuckin' 30 kids

Now besides being on X, and regardless me loving sex
We getting close to your lex, it's grindin' every kick
Two fingers up your pussy, your hands rubbing my dick
As soon as my wife push me, your man's fucking her trick
(You don't care if she know I trip)
But she's starting to get hip to it
'Cause she's finding matches inside of my pocket that say I strip
Which means I might get caught, lose everything that I've brought
The house, kids, and the car, I know this sounds bizarre
But we should give her a call, and see if she want it in
That way it's three-way sex and we can all be friends
I know you done if before, don't act like you haven't whore
I'm 'bout to lose my wife I can't afford a divorce

(Sin with me; I warn you)
She Devil's in the house lemme here ya (Heeyyy)
Off top I gots to get near ya

Fucking with your pussy is a handful (for real)
You think I'm drowning, then you're clowning
So basically bitch you a damn fool
And that's a given fact
Plus I remember back when you was young
I could see a 100 niggas through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that, that's embarrassing
You stuck with 30 children, 70 miscarriages
In and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is
Fucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it, but you did

Devil is she, she never to be (faithful)
Credit to free, it's better that she (tranquil)
Even her apple, my cock unlock the keys to your asshole
Stop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow
Cock the Glock at them, kings in the castle
Fresh out of school with a disease in the tassel, skeezin' is natural
You just my (ho') that's the reason you stack dough

(Sin with me; I warn you)
She Devil's in the house lemme here ya (Heeyyy)
Off top I gots to get near ya

 Shit, this feels good baby, whatchu say this was again?
 Don't worry about it, just relax
 Ooooo.. Here, let me lick on this
 It's gonna cost you
 I got all of it, baby
 Well, that's exactly what I need
 All of it (*repeated until fade*)",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-she-devil-lyrics
We Are Free,Strangeulation,2014.0,"They way that we drummin' make you think what's one hunit
Plummet we don't want it son its the dumbest
We done and wanna get from it
Havin' visions of Eden, while this evil is breathin' inside a demon
Deceivin' with light I'm even this season
Companies kill my culture, suckas sit on they sofa
See the soul of a soldier, I'mma go to Zack De la Rocha
And awaken rebel sound that'll break that fake label down
Gotta vacate this able now, everyday fate from a halo crown
If they oppose it, give 'em hell is the key
Well is the free, we ain't practicin' celibacy
A relic you think we anghellic, tell it to me
We'll mail and sell it to fellowships and telekinesis
When occur the people movin' develop diseases
Sick on your symphony some get hella facetious
When searin' your shows I'm somberin' the shell it decreases
Light for the lord of love a lot leveled is leaf lit
Free (styles), free (life), free (reign)
We (wild), we (fight) for these (brains)
Beguiled, she likes the eased (pain)
He's (mild), he gripes cause she's (Strange)
Take off your shackles people come along
Fuck a fraggle nigga become a Khan
We keep it cooler then when summer gone
Cowardly critters not with the strong better run along

We are free, we are
We are free, we are
We are, we are free
We are, we are free

No time for killin' time, because it's killin' time
I'm an American hustler sedated in my prime
Pray for the 99, ride with the 88
Spinal 1 percent life is just a numbers game
Fame for us psychos, Jackson's to Michael
Missiles for silos, no stones for the high road
Army of 5-Os, for half O's of hydro
Drones over my home, no phone tap to spy on
And though they say there's nothin' to fear but fear itself
I keep a bottle of spirits near my bookshelf
Because a runaway slave will never sleep well
I self medicate the frame in my brain cell
Married to the matrix, that bitch got two faces
She gave me all I got and took away all my acquaintance
Travellin' the planet walkin' on so many stages
Made me realize dimensions gettin' jumped through on a daily
He's an alien, Eddie Arkadian
In love with money and fame there ain't no savin' him
But I'm the fuckin' last dragon spittin' radiance
Walkin' a planet I created in my cranium


I rewrote this verse mad times
One for every single instance somebody denied me my damn shine
One for the brick layers, one for the winning team with injured players
One for the ""He's gon' be the shit"" sayers, keep me on my toes
My fanbase rattlin', the speakers on my bows and my sneakers on the stones
You give me props and I'mma keep 'em in my soul
Cause I'm MVP'n on these cretins down below
All this world's gone catnip, rattlesnake bat shit
Critics eat a fat dick, vinegar and cracked lips
Citizens get it in, gimme ten seconds in Atlas
And I'mma show you even on this bitch front to backwards
Breakin' down codes, bro True Detective
Ridin' to some Wrek shit, could change up your perspective
Don't just take my word for it, check up on the guest list
Jesus and the Devil rollin' dice up in the flesh pit
Free speech, free souls, free press
So we preach to seek goals and leave stress
Beneath streets, we reach hold and breach depths
To the mothafuckers we bringin' ruckus with each breath
As if the sales stop, been stay
See Ten K was just the entry, my pen slays
My next album's gonna be bent shades of dense graves
Death to the shackles around my ankles, I been free",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-we-are-free-lyrics

And bang where your head is, I bet y'all will beat it
Oh Dean, that's my dog, them words y'all will eat 'em
My power circlin' small, I think outta the box
And try different angles to wreck tables or not
My shot's wet as a whistle, I'm on fire fam
Y'all don't even know that's my column in y'all's diagram
Who they want, Godi or Donnie, ya better choose wisely
Greet 'em with ketamine and then that Adderall IV, try me

The story of my twin and I, Pisces not a Gemini
One of us is underwater, other floatin' in the sky
Highs and the lows of me, violence in the poetry
My evil twin we goin' in, I told him to let go of me (Nigga let go!)
Don't let nobody close to me, drunk when I'm not s'posed to be
I take a sip, start to trip and won't nobody know it's me
One bottle Jameson, take it to the face and then
Now I'm talkin' 'bout the bodies buried in my basement
Spirits talkin' to me, I can hear 'em, I can see 'em too
Lookin' in the mirror and I tell 'em it's just me and you
One of us is goin' out, the one that's always showin' out
I put my fist right through the glass and told that bitch to close his mouth
Hand bleedin' needin' medical attention
I'm feelin' no pain, I'm in a whole 'nother dimension

I've become a scumbag fuckbuddy needed to wipe after
She got me and my lady's cum rag, that's just one of the things I done bad
Like when I put Dulcolax liquid mixed it within my brother's rum flask
I can make a love potion, give you the ocean
Then you wake up in a pit gettin' instructions on how to rub ya lotion
You think I'm jokin' while listenin' to Drake's ""The Motion""
I put syphilis dick down her throat and that's without her havin' a notion
I'm playin' I don't dare summon them other suckers
That tell me to do bad, there done and them under covers

I'm a real one, fill 'em, up, I bust and kill 'em
Didn't have to sell my soul to sell some fucking millions
When I drop this Bou Lou drink, it'll put me up in billions
The ceiling never could stop this KC, MO civilian
How ya didn't know we had the green when I'm all up in yo' magazine?
So focused on the flow, fo' fifth, yo' bitch throw shit, that's flattering
We ain't like you others, we got a very sick disease
And, if you get this bug, it may result in making cheese
Made a lot of Technicians, gettin' mo' is the next mission
We got the colleges, the suburbs and the 'jects trippin'
Off of this wealthy, foul-mouthed trigger
Don't even bother to get your wicky styles out, nigga!

Everything in my head, all these words that I said

These bright lights, show my life {nobody cares}

Put-put a chastity belt on yo' spouses (Ugh-huh!)

Y'all saying the same thing, mainstream in trouble now
I'm on my grown man, growin' a little stubble now

Murder was the case that I gave 'em
Damn her with my grammar hammer, nobody could save 'em

We on tour and we on some penny pinchin', ""give me more""
If I die today, I'm comin' back, nigga

Cause we resurrected with people been disrespectin'
No equal to this direction, when Kali, people can check it
We be the choppin' and Tech get it poppin' in every Metropolis
Tracks, we be toppin' as boppers, they flock to us, niggas be jockin' us
I flow, beware, rappers don't be goin' there
Maybe I'm just blowin' smoke in the air and no one cares


I been (dope, d-dope, d-dope, dope, dope)

Bitch, I been out here poppin', been up in these streets
Since I came up out that water, been the illest nigga low key
Got yo' bitch up all on my Peta, bendin' on them knees
Bitch came back around and got backed down
And done fucked around and got beat, it's that, shake down!
Strange, so you know I make cake now
Want to know where's the house by the lake down?
I bought the car, it was the model and I'm make now
I kick back, my feet up, cramp down and re-up
Talk shit and I talk shit, this boss shit, nigga, G up

In the world of MTV
My name is too gangsta huh, hahaha
Man, Strange Music
 we got this baby
This year we got this one baby
Red hair, red everything
It's Tech N9ne baby like it or not

Never been a harder rhymer in my region or globally
That's holdin' me, I'm totally hard and bossed up
Why you think that the majority of the rap musical authority
Sword me and barred and crossed up
'Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in
Then spit his hymns, begin a grim religion
Of rhyme, forbidden my isms are hidden
My mind to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne is playin' you, slayin' you, sprayin' you
Permanently delayin' you, swayin' through, it's the gay in you
That's hatin' who, something's that hella beyond us
(I love Kanye, his shit is bombay, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my retina, that I won't be lettin' ya
Threatening us better respect Tech the messenger
Too dope on ‘em for this to be history, listen it’s a mystery
Why they spittin’ and dissin’ me

This is me (This is me)
I'm a king, I'm a clown, I'm a G (I'm a G)

What you sow, so forget what you know this is me

This is Tech bruh, for years I've been the next to
Collect a plethora of checks let's get extra
Is what I set ta Travis let's go select the
Baddest rappers infect the planet leave 'em in ecsta-
Sy,
 I'm a vet the powers don't really wanna let the best
Come and wreck your sets and test your sector
Instead of rawness like Inspecta Deck, the
Eldest rather set they specs on Mason Betha
Slept on my records If you knew my music's Hannibal Lector
What the hell you callin' for Funkmaster Flex for?
Don't pester me I won't sweat you be on a quest to
Investigate your techma respect the
Chakra tease in hop to these
Hot degrees me and Mr. O Apostrophe
Never listen to these pop pussies 'cause they suck!
(I love 50 Cent, he gritty when he vent, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my demeanor
The Tecca Nina will blast arenas, the grass is greener
Made it ma, top of the world
Kiss me, miss me (This is, this is me)

And make a fort fuss, 'cause you went out on Sam Goody
On F.Y.E. with their money and you support us
Strangers, Shadys, Psychopaths and Juggalos
Losers, Shootas, College women and gutta hoes
Rock it for precious dough, drop it, just let it flow
Cop it don't knock it you block us stop at the record store
This is Aaron Yates,

This is for little Donnie this is for all Lacoya's pain

Far Out,The Gates Mixed Plate,2010.0,"The following entry has... uh... seen mankind complete its first evolutionary steps into the universe, leaving the planet Earth and going forward into the universe

Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out

Find me, I'm off in low Earth orbit
I'm far out, know I'm talking 'bout
Gotta get rid of your gravity to come towards it
I skyscrape, jump up in a cloud and absorb it
Rain down on you niggas like a storm hit
I'm headed for money and I'm sure of it, important
You know that I am dumb fresh, super fly, stupid high
About business like suit and tie
Tryna get paid like that YouTube guy
I'm one of them dudes, that get to running your dudes
You gotta give him his dues, I'm incredible
You never gonna fill in my shoes
The unforgettable truth is
I'm a beast when I get in this booth (Ah)
OK, OK, they know me, now don't they? I'm glad to say
Tech gave me the track and turned me loose like ""JL, bomb away""
So you know I gotta do it like I'm spazzin'
I really get it crackin', never would've imagined, back when
I was on the block, I'd be rappin'
With one of the illest niggas ever to make it happen
I'm off to my zone, that's that fly zone
I don't give a damn about a hater, I'm gone
Eyes on the motherfuckin' prize and
I won't get disturbed and come down from my throne
B. Hood, full effect Strange, you digging it?
We living it up, man, it's all about the bigger shit
Ready for the benefit, hands in the air if you feeling it
Why would anybody wanna do it any different?

Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out

I think I fit this track so perfect
Tecca Nina gave me a chance and I deserve it
I been putting in my work in, cutting it like a surgeon
Urging my people to rebel like an insurgent
I grab my sword and shield, jump in the field
To feel my enemy's pain, the look in his eyes, surprised
Realized denied by the stand up guy
You don't really want it with me, please don't try
(Wait a minute, aren't you that Romanian guy?)
Damn right, dirty, you can bet your life
And now it's time for me to make a sacrifice
So leave it like I see until my afterlife
If this is wrong, then I can't be right
They wanted me dead, but I stayed alive
Enemies who post like my favorite five
I'm dumping at 'em, then I wave bye bye
I'm off my noodle, ain't I?
And my secret ain't mine, gotta play fight
Ain't white, hate night in the daylight
You don't wanna be the one to catch that stain, right?
So please proceed with caution, and just don't speak too loud
'Cause they go headhunting, in the Mississippi you found
They say I'm far out, I'm a giant in this large crowd
Get the fire with my heart out
I feel your hatred like the far south
See the truth is everybody wants the money
But they faking to make it if you pay attention
Look at the way I'm coming out the middle of the map
And attacking the track with the ways of a gremlin

Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out

Sim-sim-salabim, that don't mean anything
But I can make it mean get a lot of green
And make everybody get up and sing with the Nin'
I'm a menace, they wanna put the Nina in Guinness
'Cause I'm in the percentage of killers who finish
Any nigga without a limit, they get it 'cause I'm sinister
This ain't a gimmick when I rip and damage a mimicker
I be like a meteorite, I'm blazing everything
In my way so quick, you hear me humming
But the scientists gotta get multi-million
Dollar machinery for me just to see me coming
I'm far out, look at the people with the eye of an eagle
Tech, now look at the steeple
It's Tecca Nina and B'zle coming to defeat and
Diminish an evil, hit you with the strength of a Diesel
I – fifth street to Grain Valley, Spain to Cali
Can't hang if you ain't strange, nigga, bang bang, you in pain alley
Another dimension, you better repent
And you never ever let a nigga discover the tension
I gotta, sever the punk another was sent in to Allah
Given away today but the lynchin's tomorrow
Potato, on the end of a barrel, I pop it
And have a motherfucker living in peril
I damage a devil, never doin' it for dinero
I'm taken out of his body like a nigga's on Cuervo
Tecca Nina gets colder with them
That'll mean everyone of they whores kissed him
On the tip of his big one
Dig it because I'm truly beyond the solar system

Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth

They gon' have to let me through
Let 'em react like this is something new
What you think, I don't do this shit for Zoo?
Overdo this and my whole city  wanna see
Others look at me like, ""Oh, he's the one, is he?""
Bitches hit me up like, ""You need some company""
I could be at 'em like two to three once a week
Come up and at it and ain't nothing fucking free
Assumptively it's time to up the fee
Momma questioning what I would grow up to be
Tryna get in and got everything but the key
Hard work and dedication, nigga
Hear the passion in my conversation with ya
Put the hate away and come and take this picture
Think it's safe to say, it's what the faith will get ya
Sippin' sake, share the celebration with ya
Pick who sit beside me play no babysitter
Sick as ever, make a way to get to where the money is
I'm able Jay da table fixer
Been impatient taking sedatives
Ever since I been chopping up these messages
Always been light years ahead of this
Ready for fucking bread is where my fetish is
I know that enough it never is

Just Die? (Intro 1),ENTERFEAR,2020.0,"Enter (Enter)
Why
Do I give so much to those who don't know what it takes to be I?
It takes so much focus, but they say this lotus I grew should just die
Why do I read? My art is starting to bleed and receding, it's a lie
Even though I'm woke up, this so sucks, how 'bout my throat cut?
(Chyeah)

Just a thought, excuse me while I get this off
Tech is lost, read this then accepted naught
Gave the game this, twenty years of strange shit
And I still retain this sick language I came with (Chyeah)
Tech has fallen, bitch, shut up (Shut up)
Death is callin', nigga, what up? (What up?)
Your text is causin' me to nut up
Crawlin' in the gutter, I'm coughin' my blood up (Rah)
What if you found out you made me? (Chyeah)
'Cause critics were drivin' me crazy (Chyeah)
This kinda thing shouldn't phase me
But it could be easier D-E-A-D (Chyeah)
Easier for me, though
To another dimension and place we go
When I smother and weaken a Yates' ego
I'ma taste blood when I'd rather taste a Cheeto or burrito
Life can be testing to stop in a hurry (Chyeah)
I'd be investing in stock then the jewelry (Chyeah)
Gives you the effing, not what you expecting
When I chew a section, you cop and you bury (Chyeah)
I'd suppose I'd die for those to buy the old
And get the newer shit to fly the throw
I give 'em cooler hits that I compose
Why the code dissin' me? Can't deny the flows
All the naysayin' won't tempt me (Chyeah)
And I ain't never been wimpy
But it's a thought when my tank is low and just about empty

How 'bout I just die, die, die, die?
It might stop the sorrow, taking tomorrow away
Run from this shit, bye, bye, bye, bye
When my spirits are low, no need to borrow day
How 'bout I just die, die, die, die?
It might stop the sorrow, taking tomorrow away
How 'bout I just die?
Inside, I just cry
Fuck that shit

Let's get off, all this shit 'bout Tech is soft
Exit cross, how could you not respect the sauce?
Take your time after time when you come for me (Chyeah)
Spit your swine at my rhyme for everyone to see (Chyeah)
You don't even need a mouth
Hit me with the keys of deceit and I'm bleedin' out
So this is the heated route
Been feelin' defeated when reading, can see the doubt
But you can't fold up, 
Strange Music soldier
I thought I told ya, my 'bows are like boulders (Chyeah)
I made ya (I made ya), but I'll fade ya (I'll fade ya)

The savior (The savior) awaits ya (Awaits ya)
You traitor (You traitor), I'll break ya (I'll break ya, chyeah)
Talkin' 'bout when I bust, I'd spit, like when I crush my zit (Chyeah)

Here come the seven after what's my six?

Psycho Bitch,Anghellic,2001.0,"I want you to quit
Callin' me, callin' me
Followin' me, followin' me
Why do you trip with me
After you get through swallowin' me
Never knew this Bianca would explode (like this)
Now that I know this I must reload (gat clips)

How many ever met a psycho bitch?
Down for the minute but a major twist
Came with a bit of game
Met that bitch sickness
Everybody peep the evil symptoms so you'll know
When sexual activity happens and tears start to flow, it's time to go
They come with a big package in back, chest is twice that
But the fatal attraction would only get you ice packs
Better watch what you do when you sleep
With a woman that's on the edge in yo bed
'Cause you'll be restin' in red (killa killa)
They'll find the number through your residence
Non-hesitant, unprecedented
Ain't no mystery to her steez, she's demented
Ain't ever gonna get myself in another mix-up with a psycho bitch
Millimeter with a master plan, so you won't be off in the ditch (like this)
Wild child
Runnin wild, behind the smile is a frown
That'll make ya lay it down, quickly, she shifty
Killa strictly, out to come and get me
From a rose, to .357/.360
Psycho bitch!

Never ever do it down low with a (psycho bitch)
Better never ever go out with a (psycho bitch)
Everybody better learn to see a (psycho bitch)
'Cause your bitch might be her (yeah yeah yeah!)
Whatchu gonna do when they pop at you Glock at you
Fill 'em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
Whatchu gonna do when they pop at you Glock at you
Fill 'em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)

I was holdin' her, huggin' her
Rubbin' her, suckin' her
Kissin' her, pluggin' her
But she thought that I was lovin' her

All the lovin' was gone when she found out she was wrong
Callin' my momma's house at 3 AM (Quit playin' on my phone!)
They say the Psycho Bitch was made from us (Psycho bitches)
Some say they get nathan but hate from us (Psycho bitches)
From the Anghellic, you ravenous (Psycho bitches)
So stay the fuck away from us (Psycho bitches, Psycho bitches)
She got my gas cut off, but I don't know how
She got my phone cut off, but I don't know how
Bitch even got my lights cut off, but I don't know how
Wish I knew back then, what a nigga know now (Crazy bitch!)
Follow me to my main thangs domain
This dame brings mo' pain
Door chain broke after the door rang
Must be on cocaine
Insane 'ianks, will mess up yo thang
No brain bitches will have you stressin' using Rogaine
Didn't chill wit' her, deal wit' her
N9na had to get ill wit' her
Trick tried to kill Mrs. N9ne
So I had to hit her with a grill splitter
Never do sex with a psycho Bianc
Anybody with her better pop yo trunk
Run, better get a gun, when the bitch come
Better know she a psycho (Killa, killa)
Hard, when he hit that piece and then get her up and out with a dis
Scarred, when he knows that he's been up in the mix with a psycho bitch
Hard, when he hit that piece and then get her up and out with a dis
Scarred, when he knows that he's been up in the mix with a psycho bitch

Never ever do it down low with a (psycho bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (psycho bitch!)
Everybody better learn to see a (psycho bitch!)

What you gonna do when they pop at you Glock at you
Fill 'em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho bitches, Psycho bitches)
What you gonna do when they pop at you Glock at you
Fill 'em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho bitches, Psycho bitches)

As the smoke clears
You wonder why this woman packs the most fear
She keeps a broken heart and a three-eighty close near
From me to you, if you sense she's psychotic
Better watch what you do, what they do
They say the Psycho Bitch was made from us (Psycho bitches)
Say they get nothing but hate from us (Psycho bitches)
From the Anghellic, you ravenous (Psycho bitches)
Stay the fuck away from us (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-psycho-bitch-lyrics

Eenie meanie miny ho, choosing bitches at my show
Tryna get you at the mo,
 poppin' x and smokin' dope
Eenie meanie miny ho, come in here and close the do'
On the bed or on the flo', I'm about to let it go
Do you solemnly swear to put that bottom in the air
And do you promise it'll be bare so I can bop it?
Twist it, pull it, hair is in my palm as we share
Pull off the magnum
 and teach prayer and then I get off it
Who else wants some, who else wants some of debo?
Where'd she go, the one I saw shopping at the little bitty waist 38 double D though
I've seen more H O E's go home with me, holy toledo
I greet those thickest ones with the homeboy Frame and Krizz Kali-ko

Which one? Pick one! Anybody know?
This one that one if she wanna go
If she trippin' gotta let her know
It's 10 bitches right outside the do'

Eenie meanie miny, eenie meanie miny woah
Eenie meanie miny, eenie meanie miny ho

Girl gimme that, okay yeah I said it
Come here let me fill you with some of this here unleaded
She's a magician cause nobody knows right where her head went
I hate the strip club cause I never know where my bread went
I'm the best thing since squozed milk, I told her, hold her
Let me see one of them over the shoulder boulder holders
And if she lite-bright then we might fight with the lights out (Okay)
Tell her I might bite her in the pine, take my slice out (Okay)
Kali baby I got chicks in different zip codes
They love the way I Busta Rhymes, like I'm from Flipmode
 (Huh!)
I know I'm fat, I'm not trippin' girl get me exposed (Okay)
If you ain't with it I'm moving onto the next ho
Move onto the next chick! (Hey) And get her ahh and ooing
Take her to the room and she know what I really be doin' to her and
Like an hour later, some now some later
I know ya shake ya hips for tips but I'll be damned if I pay ya, tell em!


Eh, just got gnarly, cause one just said
To her friend I hope he don't card me
You're not invited to my swar-ee, SORRY
I mean 
soirée (What's that?) Party!
Didn't ya see, Weird Science bitch, we're the defiant clique
But we fear the lyin' chicks tryin' to get N9ne's dick
On to the next one step into my section
Get some, flesh done, in bed I'm redrum
I ain't even gotta cake these ladies, well I'mma cake a little
So I can lay these, but she don't
Require cake, straight wanna take D's

We did a lot of shit together, man
On this music tip, man
Beautiful shit we did, dog
Remember when we went out to L.A. man, with Quincy man
Made all that shit pop, Yukmouth and everybody, Dubb C and everybody
Had a lot of good times, dog, know what I'm sizzlin'?
But that shits about to come to an end, dog
You know? Never have I ever crossed anybody, y'all niggas know me
The sands of time have already started to pour against you, dog
So listen hard, 'cause I speak real softly, like this:

Just think: What if I could just, just blink your shit away?
Niggas think: Because a nigga bust, I got grips and grips of pay
The pain grows in fame and kangos we're changin' strange hoes
Who bang in Range Roves for thangs same shows with lames
The rains goes will stain and insane foes who drain
And hang rows with brains
If you caught it, that means you got it
And if you brought it, that means you should have shot it
'Cause I'm about to drop the ray and Nina locked to kill a liter
Propped to meaner nigga I pop the millimeter
DeMarco I'm 'bout to spark flow ya bark so hearts with parts
Gonna make ya heart blow (heart blow), blood
And don't be was-in, Cuzin' me buggin' me
'Bout dubbs I be muscling these clubs really lovin', me
It hurts my nigga, the hurt my nigga, but hurt my nigga
Is what's inspiring these spurts my nigga
At first my nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Yellin' you gon' slap the taste out my mouth
Nigga, I never scare
Savoir faires everywhere
If you need me believe me it's easy
To put hoes in chakrateasie
Watch the wizie, these Glocks'll talk fa' shizie

Some say I should worry and watch where I walk
Yada, yada, yada, nigga, that's just talk
I'm a friend, if I was a foe I would be
Knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knockin' at yo' front do'

The Industry's faulty, industry's salty (man)
The industry cost me, industry brought me (pain)
The industry taught me, industry caught me (strange)
And you niggas know that the industry's awfully (vain)
I ain't a snake nigga, all I did is make niggas money
With Sonny now it's funny, you playa hate niggas
Over some cake the fake of a show me state nigga
In my face will be Don Juan The Great to late nigga
I don't speak a lot I peep a lot I creep a lot
And people who speakin' usually weak and out for peace and no beef a lot
Remember we used to kick it like bros
Now you niggas act like bitches and hoes, with ya licorice souls
Tecca N9ne I got the wickedest flows
No kid in this MO, no misery will ever get wit this Rouge
I'm pissed in this hole
Little façade, a crypt in his soul
Instead of a rap I should have twisted his nose
Who kept Short Nitty from killin' you? (Me!)
Who kept Diamond from drillin' you? (Me!)
Who kept villain niggas from bill dealin' you? (Me!)
So now you can take away me and keep on talkin' crazy
And I'mma let 'em know where you keep your baby and where you stay, D

Knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knockin' at yo' front do'

You can't turn enough motherfuckers against me
You can't find a harder rapper that'll convince me
I'm with the Canties, the Ashbees, the White Bears
La Zhunes, the Harris's, and the motherfucking Timleys
The theories, the buyers, the Kennedy's
You know the families that are known to be bad for humanity
Can he be bad? Can he be tough? Can he be rough?
No cream puffs are considered to be rough enough
Nobody likes you not even ya bitches, I'm a witness
They sick of yo disrespectful way of speakin' explicit
Always talkin' about how big yo dick is
Better hope Anghellic go multi-platinum to get yo riches, blood
This is the end of men who were once friends and then
One asshole thought he was somethin'
When punks bend over they get fucked! (Get fucked!)
Hand over them Tech tapes or get stuck! (Get stuck!)
You must think I'm soft for talkin' to Icey Roc 'bout knockin' the Nina out
I'm trippin' without a doubt
I'm a tell you really is yo friend
Mail Bakarii and maybe you and him can get together and tell like it is again
It's over mane, I hope you brought your Novocaine
I know the pain, is slowly takin' over brain
So calm that motherfucking wombat, I don't need no Don Juan tracks to come bomb on rap

Gon' cut ya nose off and stick up ya ass so you can smell that shit,"" man

Kick It with Myself,Planet,2018.0,"Turn the beat up a little bit more in here, Bengineer, please!
I guess I'm doing this one by myself
If you can't just be good with being by yourself
How you gonna be good pairing up with somebody else?
Love your damn self first

I was the only child 'til I was 13
Rather be lonely while dealin' with Earthlings
Still I am reclusive with drug and liquor abuses
Having a solitary time was never the worst thing (What we doing?)
Dedicating time to the craft (Yeah), levitatin' lines in the lab
Never hesitatin', rhymes hit the pad, when they resonate, N9ne get the bag
Then I medicate, the mind is the first thing (Woo!)
Yes, I live in my encephalon, I don't need all the rest of 'em
To stress the one blessing 'em, they're what you insert a speculum
Open it and hope you don't choke on something is gross in it
Jokin' this vocalist was by himself when he wrote this shit
I survive livin' in my mind, that line is for the people servin' time
Kickin' it wit' myself, created N9ne over time
That's why I'm one of the best at rippin' rhymes (Nina)

Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else

I done made millions (millions) livin' in the clouds
When I'm out within a crowd I am still one
I go to a sacred place like a pilgrim
In the mind, I'm on an island like Wilson!
People see me drift away
When the brain is workin' I never hear all the shit ya say
Why they pissed today 'cause whatever they say to me ricochet
They don't dig the way that I laugh after a big delay
I don't need a shrink, I need a sedative
I just need a drink to be repetitive
Lotta people think I need some etiquette
In payin' attention, I get 'em red a bit
And that'll get you nothing but cussin' at somebody breaded bitch
Sick and twisted I can kick it, we're just lickin', spliff get lifted
Some say I'm a misfit by the way that I'm drifted
But this gets the business, chips, bitches I'm gifted

Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else

Leave me by myself, watch what I'ma do
It won't be sittin' around watchin' Donahue
All I need is liquor and some ganja to continue to twirl top of the world like Obama do
And I might need a triple X video
In case wanna see her playin' with her kitty though
I know the ladies can't relate, you don't need nobody to bait
Lotta pretty hoes do it in my city, yoooo
Why am I alone?
'Cause people started rushin' me the day after I grabbed a microphone
Incognito, drinkin' my Pátron
You say you can't handle this, then you should probably play the xylophone
With me and my music, nothing could limit me
Just leave me in a baller suite with all the amenities
One is full throttle saloon 'shine from Tennessee
And don't forget the lemon, the Sprite and gallon of Hennessy

Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else

Losing my mind, yes I'm
Using my 9 this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?
Losing my mind, yes I'm
Using my 9 this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?

Ever since November hit, I can't remember shit
Unless I was in your chick when I picked her, she was a limber bitch
She say I sent her quick and treated her as cold as Denver get
That wimper shit's for simpers, don't enter this cause I'm winter, trick
And I like my hoes cold, young, dumb, lungs done
Now she's an old soul, ate her like Lambert's throwed rolls
Shorty come and shorties go, this skinny chick orgy blows
Horny bro, looking for a thicky, hunt her down like Laurie Strode
I'm plum stark buck naked in my white socks
Might pop my top and hype the block when the light stops
Just call me cyclops, I see what others might not
The white cops are on me, oh, man, we’re in a tight spot
It's ironic though I’m bad, yep my mama grow the lad
Who rob the Conoco for cash up in Monaco
I’m half native got a relative named Jeroni-ho
And this persona's ""Fuck the drama, only honor dough""
I know who died plus and who did it
Kansas City Cyrus, can you dig it?
Cut off your arm and fan you with it
Some listen to me and say “Damn, you wicked”

Losing my mind, yes I’m
Using my 9 this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?
Losing my mind, yes I’m
Using my 9 this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?

I made the cookie on the lady she applaud that
And got the foreplay feeling fengshui
All gas baby tell 'em over haul that
And I be digging real good in the morning
Text to your girls that booty fire
She'll be reminiscing thinking that she love me
Forgetting every nigga that she been with prior
What is it? (Make her feel this way)
What is it? (Tell her climb on me)
What is it? (Let her ride that weave)
Baby had a very long D
I told her she could get it in time if she ready
She wanted stimulation and I'm trying to break the levy
I got her face down ass up on her belly
I'm tugging on her hair make her breathing all heavy
She fuckin' with the plug so the plug put the pipe down
'Fore them other niggas pussy on strike now
She got a creme de la creme nigga tight now
Said she want it right now, came in a night gown

If I apply pressure then the rules gon' bend
Consensual fornicating fucking with grown men
And everyone of y'all ready to be wet up
I'm on another level I ain't ever gonna let up
My homegirl rolling got to help her keep her head up
And know I got her MO trying to get her out her get up
I get up, she get on and we on some other shit
And she know what I'm on it's beyond she loving it
And she don't need that top or bottom
Unbutton it, I slap it, I flip it, I blast it
I'm rubbing it and when I'm up in it
She wetter than a T-2
No I don't need another player just me and you
I'm going off at the offence, D-2
Ain’t met a type flight nigga like me, true

No, no (I ain't hanging out, nigga I'm reclusive now, what!)

The gun drops on the one
If you bums cross then you're done
Don't get redrum caught in your lungs
It's electric when the Tech is finna get plum lost in the drum, let's go
We gotcha, he want it wit' we 'cause we don't see nada
Gotta be solitary or prolly wit' me partners in a B chakra
Flea's off, ya gotta bleed Mothra

Gaga ball pit, slit, bitch, split, slide
You can dip wit' them guys that wanna hit the spliff from inside

You gonna catch shit like a porta potty

Never am I pleading my case, got an angel 90 feet in my face
On a cloud nine, 'bout time to get out rhymes with devout lines

Levitation,Planet,2018.0,"Every day I wake up
Even if I don't feel like it
I push, push myself

It feel like I’m a champion, yeah

When I work, I feel like I can fly in the sky
All the love they give Ninna get me high, ain't no lie
If I wasn't such a killa, I would cry, not that guy
Levitation, dedication in my eye 'til I die
(Whoa) people know I got it from the dirt
(Whoa) so rough when I started man it hurt
(Whoa) but all that struggle paid off
I'm a business owner now I can't be laid off (hell nah)
Whatever you do, do it every day
And do somethin' different, if it's true it barely pay
Don't be a jack of all trades and a master of none

'Cause when I wanted to end it, no success felt like I'm finished
But my friend with the other percentage said, ""Let's go get this money""
People really care 'bout how I feel and it's real
'Cause I put the middle finger to a major record deal
For this independent label had to peel hella skrill
Now we all around the planet makin' mills, how that feel
(Whoa) like it lit a fire in my soul
(Whoa) got a push it higher 'til it grows
(Whoa) levitatin' like I'm David Blaine
Yellin' loud, ""I made it, mane,"" 'cause we all created Strange
I'm thankful for y'all dedication
And rep Strange though, with no hesitation
The white black and the red is waitin'
To dead this hate until it's devastation

Sex To the Beat,Bad Season,2010.0,"Aye, a nigga came to party
151 Rum, Bacardi
Pineapple juice and Malibu get it started
Then, Oh Lordy, I seen a big booty shawty

To the beat, sex
I'mma beat that
To the beat, sex
I'mma beat that
To the beat, sex
I'mma beat that
To the beat, sex
(Knock, knock it out the bottom)

I got rhythm
When the women see me on stage
Later on we sexually engaged, that's what I give 'em
Strokes full of energy
Beat it like my enemy
Watch a nigga centipede on lemon, Sprite, and Hennessey
Pumpin on the thick woman is my thang
Crunk on a bitch, bumpin to my game
57th Street, got the legged D
Cum on a big 
Tech's immaculate, but when I style, checkin' all the bitches gon' KNOW (cha)
That I pump the magic, when the people ask, when the meat's molasses they GLOW (cha)
Hit it hard, then it's scarred
Dig it til it's split apart
Get it when it's witted
Clitted, pivots, quit it when it's dark
Then wake up in the mornin'
Straight to the beat we bonin'
No, we not kiddin' so I guess you can say we grownin' (kids cheering)
And you can smell that
Steamin' hell cat
Cause I swell that, long dong
Play wit it like her own toy
If you can feel that
Run and tell that, run and tell that, home boy, ho ho home boy


Yo young baby what you do-lien, do-lien?
Yeah, you heard of me
That Mr. Bunk Rock, hit your funk spot
Long dong home-no-lien
Got a sex jacket for screw-lien
Too-lien boobies and booties

You done sauced it, Porky Piggin' you from the back

Beat-deet beat-deet that meat-deet
'til you start twe-deeking out ya sheets
Once you beat-deat then I'm gon' skeet-deet
I'm out gon' be screechin down your streets
To the rhythm of the kick drum
Bitches wantin to get their clits sprung
Hen and Bacardi gets the dick numb
That was the old me
To all the women who know'd me
Promoted by word of mouth to the noseys
Life was like pickin' up women off
I was pickin' up different bitches nightly
More off to stick my dick in them, YEAH
I was quite sinister, all ya hoes I remember ya
But
Now that I'm married got a wife that I be hittin up


Look, bizzle, naw
OK we looking for the peanut butter milk shake thick misses
Throwing dick all up in your bitches
Young Bizz from the middle of the map
With my nigga Techa Nina better guard your chickens
I'm due for a little bit of sticking
Might even do a little bit of licking
Gotta be bad for that treatment, you tell a soul you might end up missing
I be giving them hell in the sheets
Might feel like your pussy inhaling a beast
Don't be up in that thing for weeks, but give a bianca an hour at least
Gotta pop that P when I'm in that V that let's me know you G
Stay with me sexing you is all i need fucking to Jodeci
Bang bang like pops
When I'm in the pink I don't stop
If your pussy good when I pull up out you better guard your grill or get shot (Blaow)
Ain't no discussion when them Vickies drop I'm going in
Setting your ass up to knock it down like a bowling pin
Pistols between the mattresses going off while I'm tapping it

Active,N9NA,2019.0,"Going to a funeral almost every other week, you know I'm sayin'?
That's the reason why I stopped going to the funerals
'Cause all the young homies were always turned up dead
I left the block at 17, so I didn't see them for a while when I left
That saved me
Because if I was gonna do that, I was gonna do that to the fullest

We ain't the only gang members
We ain't the only ones with the insane tempers (Nah)
So many levels where Bane enters
And hit the people with evil
Leave 'em with pain whimpers, yeah
We ain't the only gang members
The only stealers and killers and family name enders
So watch your back when the action is brackin' or crackin'
'Cause your cool little faction got flame embers, uh
They kicking and they pushing
Spitting and they mushing (Who?)
A Christian and a Muslim
Pay attention to them bangers, not a rarity
And our dark age is filled with ignorance and barbarity
No clarity, fight against the faith and the infidels
Holy wars having so many people sent to Hell
Religious leaders went to jail, just like us deep in the cell
Spent the bail, get out and show hatred on God is meant to fail

If you choose a side, motherfucker
Better know what opposition, you can die, motherfucker
Although organizations wanna deny other ruckus
From the suckers, they don't care or wonder why brother buck it
Christians calling Muhammad a terrorist, ain't it? (Nope)
The game split a long time ago and they can't quit
Boonk Gang had it figured it out (What's that?)
When he stated that it's a whole lot of motherfuckin' gang shit

Everything is active, blame it on the rap shit
Blame it on every fucking thing but the stacks and the taxes
Don't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God
Active, everything is active
Everything's a gang, it's a gang and it's ashes to ashes
Don't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God

We ain't the only gang members
It's still a fight against the black, white, hang genders
Deep in the south, summer all the way 'til it became winter
Now the boys in blue, they kill the black cocaine vendors, yeah
We ain't the only gang members
White presidents and black leaders were slain, 'member?
So watch your back when some wack man attacking the black skin
Ain't no calm or relaxing life when strain hinders, uh
Republicans and Democrats in a spat
Since the 1800's, it's been attacks, then it cracked
And still do, different views will kill you
That is fuckin' mildew, they uplift the steel too
Lot of gang shit in Charlottesville
Unite the Right rally bought a car to kill
Ain't no togetherness
White supremacist and black will fight 'til finished
But all their rights diminished without a life replenished (Dead)
Just like my homeboys
All the different groups in life packin' chrome toys
If you feel me, holler back
Now it's gang colors if you wearing a MAGA hat (Word)
'Cause the message of talking good old days
Usin' force and more power, you know, them good old ways
But I know that flag is serious and if a man tore it
That'll be his ass if he kneel and don't stand for it

Everything is active, blame it on the rap shit
Blame it on every fucking thing but the stacks and the taxes
Don't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God
Active, everything is active
Everything's a gang, it's a gang and it's ashes to ashes
Don't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God

You know, my brain like, ""I wanna build a spaceship""
'Cause man is gonna blow this fucking place up
This spaceship has to be massive, it has to be like a football field
I wanna build a spaceship, maybe like 180 thousand seater
Maybe we can build something
My brain is thinking like, ""Okay, how are we gon' fly away from this motherfucker when it blows up?""

EMJ,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"The sadness gets deeper, and now my body's growing weaker
To EMJ this is dedicated; through this, you'll never belated, bro

I told him, I ain't know you rap nigga, you cold blooded
The way he busted his flow on stage wasn't slow was it
My nigga was flippin', he grabbed the mic and was rippin'
Until some idiots was trippin' and then I heard bullets whistling
Then I sang 'em, I just want to celebrate, he laughed
Cause said he's ""writing a song called Reno 911 straight on they ass""
Far as words go, it's crazy them were the last I heard
EMJ on this emotional musical journey

Come ride with me, it's so sad to see, still ride with me
So join me, let me share with this world as I live out the dreams
We won't be gone for long, I promise you won't be alone
If you lose me, I'm writing the words of this song
My man Michael Jones, on this emotional musical journey
(Yo, this is OG Muggs, wanna shout out to my man EMJ
God took you away, it was too soon man
You're up there with the angles looking down
And watching our world right now brother
We love you, we miss you, we'll never forget you EMJ
Rest in peace brother)

That was my nigga
In the bunk right across from mine
Cracking them jokes like all the time
Hoppin' on stage with him every night
And why niggas
Would ever wanna take somebody's life
Who was living it like a shining light
Man all the homie ever did was smile
I still don't understand it, don't think I ever will
Why I couldn't have been the bitch nigga
That god had let get killed
Instead he took EMJ away, it's safe to say
I'll see your face again someday, at pearly gates
But I hold you in my heart until

At times I'm like
Yo EMJ, where you been?
I know you lookin' down on me like
""Here I am, Kutty!
And I ain't wanting for nothin' homie
No, mourning do nothin' for me
Your love is enough in store in its glory
Or what, so pour me a drink
We can cheer and toast, giving thanks to why
You didn't lose a partner, you gained a gangsta for life
In your heart I exist, but through music I'm able to live
I see the way you floss me all on your wrist
And that's what's up, man""

(On my highest day my nigga, you was there
Now I'm on my lowest day, cause you're not here
I miss you my nigga, love you EMJ)

I seen a cruel bitch, met her in Reno Nevada
She'll have you living your dreams and take 'em all with no problem
In dark alley ways, where devils wait for the shootout
At someone who was special, I told my family about him
I saw his first tour, he told me Tech was his hero
And watched him from the crowd, to then go rock the same theaters
Step out of bounds and rounds can fly, behind casinos
On the night I never gambled and still lost it all in Reno

If I only had 8 bars, to come and deliver to you in the graveyard
I'd say god is shitty for even releasing you behind the 8-ball
The pain's hard, I know you got kiddies to carry your name on
But I'm praying for 'em, so they don't end up just singing the same song
I'm hearing it in my sleep, I'm hearing it in the head
There's whispers on the beat, screaming EMJ where you been
I promise you everyone out here shed tears, until he remembers
High powered mayhem, EMJ, Mayday's 7th member

Remember like it was yesterday, show up in Reno
Off of the bus and to off a Bourbon then we hit the Casino
And then we, we did the show an we was only
It was all that crying and you and Rock was on that homie
Never should have left you lonely, you took six and survived it
Talked to you a couple days ago, still riding
No one never thought there was complications rising
A blood clot inside him, EMJ died I'm like
(EMJ, it's Cross-Eyed Joe man, we all fucking miss you bro)
(EMJ, what can I say man, rest in paradise
Rest in paradise pimpin, we love you)

Michael Jones, I miss you my nigga
EMJ, still tryna cope with this
Still can't believe that you gone and I know I gots to be strong
Revenge is mine said the lord, so we gotta let him take control
But lord knows that I wanna grab the gat
Cock back and land a blow and watch heads roll
You was a talented man, I watched you gravitate fans
Shouted out where you been, people was all in a trance
Then we step on stage, you'd say ""You killin 'em, Rock""
Then I'd say ""You killin 'em, MJ,"" then you say ""Let's put on for Watts""
You strong as an ox, in the bed just laying with shots
Laughing and jokin', meanwhile I'm going through emotions
Then you tell me Jay Rock, you gotta keep goin' on daddio
Your album about to drop, plus you can't be slacking bro
Yeah fo' sho' my nigga, I know this a minor set back
But you told me keep killin' 'em, you gon' be alright
I'mma be back, no time bet that, then I got that phone call
It was bad news at its best and it hurt me
That I lost my friend on this emotional musical journey

Hold up roll up a Swisher, light up and paint a picture
Only if painted different, I would have been right there with you
So instead of cryin', I rejoice and pour out some liquor
Henny straight or mix it with lemonade, feel like I should be ashamed
I had to look you mama dead in the face
She told me everything was gon' be okay
You told me if anything you should be on your way home any day
Soon as we all relaxin' the phone rang, heard her sayin'
I'm goin' crazy, it's crazy, I'm thinkin' maybe just maybe
I'm misunderstandin' what your lady was sayin'
Naw-naw, you can't be serious, stop your talkin' delirious
Got my mom on the phone, you already know where his spirit went
So I drink that Hen 'til there no more left, right that wrong no it don't go left
Write this song try not stress, gotta be strong yet fight to death
As far as visions go that's that was last way that I saw

Fired,Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"(Next message)
Um, I'm sorry, but, did I do something to you that you are not answering my calls or returning my calls, answering my texts, something, I mean how did you go from completely fine to you don't wanna talk at all? I mean, come on, what's the problem? I need one thing done, it should not be that hard,  you'd break your leg for everybody else

I fired her, she want a blowjob back no throw back (no throw back)
You fuckin' the pictures in your Kodak photo jack (photo jackin')
She loco, she loco, she makin' it postal (postal)
She lookin' real bozo, she sayin' she missin' me all on the social
That is a no no

When she was interviewed
She treated big Donnie like dinner food
Was listening to the Carter IV interlude
When she was done I was deflated like an inner tube
She was totally naked with tennis shoes
She looked up and said ""did I win or lose?""
I said you's a winner not a beginner
Her name was Caitlyn, not Bruce Jenner dude
She took the sucking real serious
But that shit got older than Sirius
Too much of me made her a leery bitch
Trippin', especially the week of her period
That PMS did not make a nigga reinvest
In her eatin' that, if I kept her working a nigga be in debt
So you being X'ed ain't no seeing Tech
Before that shit she was a good worker
Really unique shaft and hood jerker
Simply by sucking a nigga would burst her
Into a vaginal ocean but the wood cursed her
She a sug thirster, sucking on my sugar stick
I'm telling you this stupid bitch could murder (a dick)
My security stopped the blood merger
Now she stood further (a bit)
She make my legs sway, thinkin 'bout how she would beg, A
Nigga usually payed when she said pay
My nigga she made some really good headway
She still be trying to segway in my bed, hey
My Jon'll jump
But I fired her even though she never had a bad head day
Donald Trump! (fire that bitch)

I fired her, she want a blowjob back no throw back (no throw back)
You fuckin' the pictures in your Kodak photo jack (photo jackin')
She loco, she loco, she makin' it postal (postal)
She lookin' real bozo, she sayin' she missin' me all on the social

That is a no no

(Yo!) When I met her she was doubtable
She would run it back into receiver
She would drive a couple of hours to clean up the crib
Then fuck me then feed me the type a chick a nigga thought that he needed
She would cum right when she leaving
She love rolling me up the loud and talk real quiet when speaking
This shit was gravy though, kit and caboodle amazing though
Never minded the fellatio, got up on the town
Bad bitches come around, get a freebie daily though
Down the line try to play me bro, wrote down on my profiles
On the socials, got to tweeting out, bitch flipped out
So I flossed more, no more energy
I done sit the box of Frosty Mini Wheats
She replied, ""your ass is offending me, almost spazzed now, Stone you killing me""
She's a bad bitch but she postal
Plus the penny,  they seen the so cold show
She's a psycho bitch up on the social
Bitch I've been tryin' not to expose ya, losing my mind
Tell me how many times (how many times)
How many times I keep tellin' your ass quit hittin' my line
This motion's expired, and no need for any reply
This here is one of the reasons, one of the reasons your ass got fired 
(fire that bitch)

I fired her, she want a blowjob back no throw back (no throw back)
You fuckin' the pictures in your Kodak photo jack (photo jackin')

When they faking with a town hero
They facing total devastation when they flaking
With a hound be though
They crowned me so I'm bound to sound egotistical
Get your ho with the flow, this is no gal she wrote
They pounce emo with the people in brown V coats
So chico you found lethal renowned profound negros
I'm really fed up with people
Really wanna go head up with evil
Anybody wanna dead us to fecal
Never gonna be read up in diesel
Nigga with the OGs
But it don't mean that I won't throw B's still
Put a nigga down more cheese will
And I got a bit so please chill
On that hoe shit, saying I lost my flow spit
When I come so ferocious, such a level of dopeness
But silly folks is saying hip hop is hopeless
But use rappers as host-ess, sweetest lyrics is ghostwrit
Hypnosis, is what they gotta be under
It's like they all in a slumber to lift throat dick
That ain't no bloke shit, rappers need to revoke this
Feminine hocus pocus if you ain't really a broke wrist
So many years making millions, you live to become the villain
For real I'm ready and willing to reach a billion
Right through the ceiling, I left your planet of illing and killing
My planet's chilling your's gave me a funny feeling

I must feed, fanging 'em I had enough greed to help me succeed
I was raised a rough breed that was taught to crush fleas
When they irritate me I don't even wanna hear it lately
Nigga trippin' over here is crazy
And the reason is queer Spacey
So hear it baby never be a day that I fear a lady actions
Weird shady captions, dropping tears maybe

Crybaby,Killer,2008.0,"Yo Tech what you feeling on the state of hip hop?
And is hop hop still alive or dead?
I mean I love the state of hip hop right now you know 
I love it and I think hip hop is very alive you know I'm sizzlin'
Whatever you got brothers and sisters you know I'm sayin
Comin' up out of poverty, you know what I'm sizzlin'
Doing something positive like music, you know I'm sizzlin'
And making money I mean you know what I'm sayin'
I mean where is the motherfuckin' death in that?

I was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO
My mama was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow
When it came to rap and R&B and plenty more
Check it, if it wasn't no gospel, apostle
Or written in the Bible, then it go
So when they tell the baby don't do something
It end up doing it anyway
Like, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today
But, I really fell in love with the sound
That was coming out from the East Coast
So we got it and twisted it up a bit
Now the industry's having a heatstroke
Some say that rap is dead
But when I get the white, black and red
And jump on the tour bus, do 58 shows
Then I'm back with a big black sack of bread
Can't believe that that was said, 'cause I'm here with a stack of fed
And I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg
So, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire
And I like my fans spending grands 'cause we got the fire
I merchandise like 5 G's every half an hour
And you cry like a baby so your mic must been your pacifier

When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?
When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?
If it's negative, I don't wanna hear it
Eliminating player haters with their evil spirits

I hear 'em talkin', they mad at Smurf and Soulja Boy
They hating big in the magazine and don't even know the boys
I know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people
Run up to the car, pull out the Mac Lethal
Man that's a problem with the black people now
What ya need to know is that, in the world there's a lot of dough to stack
And the ones that wanna hold us back ain't been outside their cul-de-sac
Every nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back
But notice that, I can put it right downwards where the shoulders at
Hating on the south? Why? Trippin' off them chips they got
You don't like that it's screwed and chopped
But you wanna get off in they pot
Wanna be MC, you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot
'Cause their 84's be poking out, what the hell is you cryin' 'bout?
Everybody wanna be killer but not for realer
'Bout the method of making money you gotta get the milla
By doin' it like I do it, do the work and believe in it
When you do it to the fullest ain't no problem achieving it
When I was broke, homie I went for mills
Got on the mic with the intent to kill
Stronger than ever, and you a gimp for real
I drink Caribou Lou, and you drink Enfamil CHUMP

When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?

You should be clapping when folk make it up out the ghetto
Or trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guerro
But you don't know how to be manly
Instead of a Timberland,
 
you probably in a stiletto
Better yet in a baby shoe, jealous or maybe you
Sick of me 'cause I'm making dinero
And you don't wanna get clapped at
You want a standing ovation? I thought not!
You say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop
Try to run up on me, 'cause a Benzo will never be in your car slot
Try to step up on the scene, my infrared beam's right at your soft spot
If you was on TV and balling you wouldn't groan and trip
He'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip
Tech got long cream with chrome things on his whip
He wanna stone Nin' with a chrome thing on his hip
But just know your hip will not stop the hop
'Cause when you look at the big picture, my block pops a lot daily
So keep on thinking my Guac stops the shots
And I can quickly bury you in your Osh Kosh B'Gosh, baby

Krizz Kaliko (backwards)
 & Tech N9ne]
Such a cutie
Sleeping beauty

It was a Saturday night me and my homeboys decided to dip to the movies
And you know us
Always on CP time
So we enter the theater and we find our seats
Kaliko wanted me to get something from concessions, so I did
So I'm waiting in line and I get to the register
And I see the baddest bitch homie (Damn)
I mean I was like fuck the food what's your name, nationality and age baby
But I forgot the first two when she said she was, 17!
On the inside I was like, fuck, shit, goddamn it, motherfucker, ya bitch, whore, slut, cunt
When you gonna be 18?
And in the midst of my crisis I heard her say, ""Well I'll be eighteen in a week""
And I was like, ""Oh yeah?""
And she said, ""Yeah""
Man she was a stallion
Ass like pow
Chest like bang
Lips like ooh
I had to have her cat
Deja vu

I'm in the movie and I don't give a fuck about it
I keep thinkin' about the bitch I met at concessions
Really a cutie I wanna get up in her body
But the identity saying she is 1-7
Fuck the movie I'ma go back and spit at her
Throw rap and shit at her like my name is Tech N9ne bitch
When I said it she went ballistic meaning she was with it
And loving my complex rhyme shit (Yes, yes)
I had a brilliant idea to get her back at the crib
And I'll give her some of the bad mimosa
The crib I really went IKEA got everythizzle
If it's comfortable to her then I can hold her
For about week then on her b-day
We can wheezay
She doesn't know that I'm S-I-C-K (Sick)
All she know is T-E-C-C-A
When you're through working baby you're gonna go with me kay?
(Okay, Okay, Okay, O-O-Okay)

I want you, sleeping beauty
I need you, sleeping beauty
So young but such a cutie
I love you, sleeping beauty

Come right in baby, have a seat (Alright)
Would you like a drink? (Sure, I'll have one)
And another, and another, and another
(I don't feel so well)
And then another, and then another, and then another
(I'm getting dizzy...)

Very woozy
We up in the Jacuzzi
Beauty is juicy
The liquor must have been a doozy (Yes)
Cause she talking hella loosely
Trying to seduce me
But I ain't fucking no under aged groupie
But I wish I was fuckin' and suckin', buckin', crushin' and touchin'
And tuckin' my stuff in the pretty muffin
But she started huffin' and puffin' and talkin' 'bout nuthin'
The fact that I won't get no lovin' is fuckin' pushin' my buttons
Bitch with your fast mouth
I want you to pass out
Then I'ma get your ass out (Yup)
Shit she crashed out
Gotta get her out or she'll be dead soon
Drug her to the motherfucking bedroom
Handcuffed her then I turned the music down (Knock, knock, knock)
Then I heard a pound (Who is it?) (Knock, knock, knock)
Knock a little more (What the fuck)
Somebody's knock, knock, knock, knocking at my door yo

Is there a problem officer?
(Yeah we got a noise complaint from one of your neighbors, uh you having a party?)
Uh no it's just me here man I'm a musician
(We know who you are)
And uh I'm scoring a movie that's my projector you hear and the music's already down so
(Well let's try and keep it down)
Uh, I'll keep her - uh, keep it, keep it down, I'll keep it down

I want you, sleeping beauty
I need you, sleeping beauty
So young but such a cutie
I love you, sleeping beauty

Hey I can hardly wait
It's getting closer to our date
It's been a couple of days I had to gag her
Back and forth to the bathroom I had to drag her (Come on)
Cause the drugs I'm giving her make her stagger
Trying to feed her food but it's making me want to stab her (Bitch)
With the steak knife I tried to feed her steak with (Come on)
Okay when you starve to death don't say shit (Bitch)
I'ma set it to the side 'til you're hungry
I see that your energy's telling me that you want me (She wants me)
She said, ""I never knew that you would be the one to be psycho
Why you reading to me from the bible (No)
Get away from me motherfucker I hate you"" (Hate me)
On the morning of your b-day I'ma take you (Yes)
Days go by
And I'm looking in her hazel eyes
I wanna be her sex slave, know why?
Cause you're beautiful lovely (Yes)
Want you to trust me (Yes)
And never judge me (Yes)
Now do you love me?

(I love you, I really love you)
Oh, fuck
(I wanna feel you, I wanna touch you)
Oh yes, oh yes
(Take me out of these cuffs, I wanna hold you)

Look at her sexy ass
Beautiful panties see through like plexiglass
Rip 'em off of her like an animal mesh we clash
At the bottom she put her hand up on my Nestea bags
Heavy kissin' and heavy pushin'
And if this is heaven then I wanna stay
Lord please never take it away
Happy birthday baby this is how I'm gonna be lovin' ya (Yeah)
Then she put the steak knife through my jugular (Shit!)
Now as the blood trickles, my body wiggles
I'm looking up at my beautiful baby while she giggles (Ha, ha, ha)
I never thought that it would end this way (Way)
This is not how I wanted to spend this day (Day)
The webs we weave are so damn tangled (Yes)
I really guess my baby didn't like my angle (No)
I lie in a puddle of blood neck mangled (Dead)
I was done by the hands of an angel

I know you feelin' drunk and tough but you best recline
You don't wanna get stained, it's pain in this lane
I'mma check they temperature, they all up in my mix, mayne

I take on every one of you, what you wanna do?
Don't forget I got this whole club on my side trippin' is dumb'a you
Stop! Everybody, what's that sound?
It sound like a hater 'bout to get the beat down
With the quick and why they wanna go and get me pissed?
When they know I'm with me clique and a real nigga like Mitchy Slick
On this Hennessy, Sprite and lemon, fuck these niggas, invite the women
Busters wanna insight the grimin', now you gotta invite the crimin-nals
Don't gimme that bullshit, nigga don't gimme no looks

I'm callin' askin' why you askin' 'bout me, if for that liquor
She said 'cause she spittin' vixen in a mix of Tech N9ne and Twista
Lip singing and quick sand, flippin' bricks and gettin' chicks mad
Hundred grand they spick-and-span, with Louie V and my whip is wet
Who is she? 'Cause I been there, who is he? He ain't a threat
Who am I? KC Boss bitch, what you doin'? Tryin' to snap back
A hundred degrees, I'm heated, eat it, like it was your dinner roll
You've never been a friend to me, bitch better check yo temperature
Rocky on rocky i'm cocky, catch a lot of bodies
Try to knock me from my hierarchy, straight down on Kawasakis

A poodle tuckin' its tail I ain't ever been mistooken for that
Plus I can read your game plan like my book of raps
Last nigga that tried it caught a right and then he took a nap
Sleep go night-night for fucking with niggas that fight-fight
And some of you suckers be hating 'cause we shining like some bright lights
T-Nutty your street buddy
Tech N9ne and the clique, niggas better act like they got sense
Stop looking at me and go get in a bitch
That nigga stretched the flex but won't flinch
Flipped the script and my nigga bow down
Straight from Cal with a .50 cal wow
Ask around and they tell you blaow-blaow
Ain't nobody tripping off of you, I just wanna kick it and be cool
Half of these niggas up in this motherfucker wanna be part of the crew
'Cause they know we do the fool, go dumb and act retarded

Lil' Myers flow but I don't need the knife (No knife)
These hands ain't no joke, make a devil cry (He'll cry)
I know it's hard for you to do, but bitch don't kill my vibe
You can get it too, get-

Bitch slapped!
Quick cap!
Bitch slap!
Quick-

By the time you hear the truth, the streets will burn
Anyone that looking at what a suicide
Do 'em and may confirm
I betcha
Motherfucker is a prodigal landmine
In the medias, never get a number one
I'm falling down a fucking flight of stairs
Like I'm Jesus fucking Christ
Bitter is the blood of everyone who had it coming
Don't ignore me, God you bore me with your indecisive sermons
I'm tired, tired of avoiding what must still be said
Stealing from the hands of those gathered
Show me where you stand on this matter

Bitch slap!
Quick cap!
Bitch slap!
Quick-

Ayy yo, Tech! Hold up
I got something to say on this shit real quick man
Yo

At it again
Let me find out you been yapping your lips
That's an offense
I ain't gon' stand for this shit, I'm throwing Colin Kaepernick fits
I'll gladly assist you and spit in your face
I'll dismantle your tissue, the issues I bring
Are as tragic as missiles and quick to repay enemies with the pain
Is you afraid? Probably so
Bitch, I'm rowdy and treading where don't nobody go
Lining haters up, eenie, miney, moe, now he goes adios
Then I reload the beast mode to behold the King's throne
Get deboed and be gone
If you don't wanna get bitch slapped, don't leave home, nigga

Bitch slap!
Quick cap!
Bitch slap!
Quick-
Bitch slap!
Quick cap!
Bitch slap!

Kocky,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"Aw shit, Aw fuck
Me, Kali and Ces we go to get bucks
On the path but didn't think we'd get stuck
By some crass lads that's 'bout to get tough
And they play not, temperatures stay hot
And don't nobody be relaxin' when on they block
Like it a yay spot, never let that pay stop
Unless you wanna be trippin' with Kutty and Jay Rock

Bad Flames, Feature Presentation, Raw and UnKutt
All of 'em undeniable classics like who they come from
Most talked about on the internet
Nigga I been a vet
Eleven years strong, still holdin' on
And I ain't finished yet
Red headed-est step child
It's a plague spread to accept how it is
Wanna see me fall get me out the loot
When all I've done is respect how it is
Now I gotta turn into a nigga you once knew
No mo' papers off
Probation I'm a cold case
He gon' sho hate it
When I throw a bomb like Troy Aikman
To do damage you walk in a bunch huh?
When you niggas are really the punks huh?
In the hearts of men, I'm seeing cowards
Where you niggas is at when the funk come?
Smoke a blunt to that
When the funk ensues you resort to rap
Said you was all in, 2 on the 10 you must distort the facts
So I pledge allegiance to only me I only breathe
Eat to shit, the chrome's in me 
The only misconstrued message in the song you see
Is it's not arrogance, this is what it's grown to be

See you can tell be the way that I use my wealth I'm cocky
This the man right chyea as to ya'll out south I'm cocky
And if you ain't figured out what we talkin' about
I'm the one they all talkin' about
And if they hatin' me that only mean my name in they mouth I'm cocky

Pull up to the spot, watch the girls all pause
Like a dirty ass dog house, drawers gon' fall
Bitches get wet when they see that candy paint
Suck yo dick through them boxers 'cuz you got bank
Shout out to them shot callers, niggas got rank
Death to you snitches singin' like Drake
I'm all the way silent, I will never break
Pillow talking to them hoes, you all the way gay
The problem is niggas never know they place
Just know your role, play your part and you'll be straight
But niggas crooked like Deebo eye
And could never ever see why we so fly
You either gotta go home or go hard
Keep a bad bitch with a good job and good jaw
Black strap on me, yeah you can tell when I walk
Pitbull of the leash if you flinch I'mma bark


You thought we through
Stop the bull talk
We rule papi
Smooth
Knock these fools off me
Boo sloppy
How I have they bitches bukakke
Move awfully cool hotty
Slob these jewels softly
Who's naughty?
Shock exudes bossy
Dude's cocky
Soowoo got me blue blocky
When I do shop
At the woowop
I bought the boo jockey
My Gucc watch
Perfuse rocks
And I be loose of the Caribou Lou
Mami your poonani
Saw me and got tsunami
Tech's elated I'm rated
They say the greatest
Paraded my latest
Pages I created
And the news shot me
That's why I'm hated
You faggots is weak and dated
When I spray this place and do away
With this fakin' then erase it who'd stop me?
It is evident, that you wonder why and where her cheddar went
That look on your face I'm seeing I'd rather get
When your boo prop me
I'm a sedative
Cuz I beat it repetitive
Used twat be
All in ya mouth and you never knew Charlie",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-kocky-lyrics
Til I’m Gone,The Storm,2016.0,"I made a mistake
Now you can choose to stay and live with that mistake
Or beat me over the head with it over and over
'Til I'm gone

Beat it 'til it's broke and closed
'Til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right

If you're blinded by the limelight that shines bright
On this individual's residuals fond slitch
Your mind might rip up the mess to design fights
To cry heif, destined to plummet in hindsight
If you feel you in my shadow and females'll get you rattled
With every tale they tattle, you raise hell in battle
Let us jail and hassle when the Queendom fails the castle
She unveils the shackles trying to bail is natural
You still here but complaints they stick
'Cause my life is too complicated and ain't basic
So the saint may split
Stay after that hiccup, you can't play vict
No you can't say sh-

Beat it 'til it's broke and closed
'Til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right

You chose to ride on this carousel
Anything petty, I parasail over
You stay where there is hell
I'm drowning in Seroquel
Embarrassed this resembles marriage under a terror spell
Running free even though the cerebel isn't parallel
I do something you think is shady and you stay
Says you agree with us moving forward and we like okay
But a year later that means you can't take us back to that day
If so, better watch what you say 'cause it'll have us in disarray
Aye, so beat it 'til it's broke and closed
Break me down it won't be smooth like lotioned bows
Chosen souls meet the love potion flows
But when the oceans froze that's when we get ghost and rogue
Baby

Beat it 'til it's broke and closed
'Til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right

Break it, I'll be on my own (Just Me)
Back home, (Where I belong), I'll be good (Yeah)
Break it, I'll be on my own
Back home, I'll be good

Don't do it
Move forward
You keep nagging me over and over

Far Away,Sickology 101,2009.0,"Man, I can't even picture myself not breathin'
But it's certain

I love too much, I love too many to count 'em
So extras and pets, it's easy for me to go on without 'em
Cause everything goes away
Love it eventually gets stowed away
Why does it have to be when you're breathin' when even
And then you're heated wonderin' why is it cold today
Immortal - it's fake and impossible
But every time I look up I'm shakin' an obstacle
What's gonna happen when time is up and I gots to go
Beautiful lands are took away from my opticle
It's not that I'm afraid of death
But afraid of the thought of my people laid to rest
They're sayin' there's six million ways of death
But not even one way to fade the stress
It's certain that a person
Got somebody lookin' workin' to close the curtain
Or maybe something out of some dream
With a devilish soul for hurtin'
Sometime I be wishin' I didn't love
Cause when it's away I be missin' love
Your mother, your father, your children are livin'
To die from the crib then a ditch is dug
From the process I get nauseous
Cause I can't see my death and its causes
Pac he saw it around the corner
But me not breathin' is a pound of balogna
I keep fightin' and I'm tryin' to get right in my mind, Bryan
Cause one day I'm gonna see you
Even though I can't picture the N9ne dyin', I'm flyin'

Far far away from here
(And nothing I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here
(I'm wishing I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)
Far far away from here
(And nothing I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here
(I'm wishing I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)

See, I tried to call for you father, but nobody answered
And I tried to scream out loud, but nobody pampered
But you're leaving tomorrow and I'm just a youngster
And even in sorrow nobody wants to (Die)
Now I gotta try to get away
From the pain I'm never escapin' though
Maybe I did too much to you, you, you by forsakin' ya
And now I see a reflection of you off in my son
Cause he's the same complexion of you, color of the sun
And now I'm done baby makin', hatin' it to even see my baby sleep
Cause he gotta die one day or bury daddy deep
And I'm stayin' too far away from him
Spend too many days from him
Tears steadily fallin' I'm creatin' 'em
And it's gettin' colder, you getting older year by year
Never know when you gotta go far away from here
Listen here

Far far away from here
(And nothing I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here
(I'm wishing I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)
Far far away from here

Suckseed (Intro 2),ENTERFEAR,2020.0,"I just can't fail
I figured, hell, why not
Be what I'm supposed to be?
And then if you can't tell when you listen closely
They suck
I mean they just suck seed
[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & 
Tech N9ne

I love it
, glasses and asses up
I love it
, yeah, we get the bag for what?
Look at me, look at me, woah, 
what the fuck?
Look at me, look at me, nigga, I'm rich forever (Okay)
You get to suck seed

You can suck it, I make 'em puke in buckets
Producin' ruckus, who can touch it?
He fake and losin' ducats, I'm scoopin' up
But identical, I will never be, pinnacle, I'm ahead of ye
Never begin a flow, at minimal, I incredibly rock that
Sit your ass down
Away from the massacre, they gonna laugh at you
Come with the fuckery, A. Yates gonna blast at the
Naysayers yappin', the K comin' after ya
I'm in a battle with enemies and I'ma kick up the energy
With the divinity, nobody malicious can limit me
I locked rap, back in the day the city where chops at
Shocked at some of 'em saying I ain't the top cat, stop that
With your wack sound
They know if they trippin', I'ma come with enough B's
To hit 'em with the stingers, they do nothin' but just bleed
But for now I'ma stunt on them and tell 'em to suck seed

Oh, tell me how to fail
When you look at all I've got
And what's in front of me
And then if you can't tell when you're looking at me
I buss for fun while they suck seed

Look at me, look at me, nigga, I'm rich forever (Okay)
You get to suck seed

Like Monica with a stain on her blouse
My cock got the moniker, bitches keep my name in their mouth
I'm a thermometer, you can't monitor with JVC
While I just lay on the couch and she suck it like it's Tang in the pouch
I'ma get to bussin' like 
a AA-12 do
Having fun with the bullet, get it? I'm playing around
You ain't safe 'cause I'll knock out bodies in the safe, not a sound
It goes up, even when I piss, I don't aim at the ground
Niggas be thinking they better but never could buss at the kings
Steady be rappin' and cappin' just like the gunpowder thing
Niggas don't want smoke, I do like when you run out of trees
Takin' flight on you niggas just like I jumped out a swing
All them suckers by you, 
they can't help you
I stage dive with guns, I jump out and squeeze
Haters treat success like it's a one hour deed to succeed
Never, but here's a bag of sunflower seeds, little nigga

Oh, I don't know how to fail
I've never not been hot
Look what you've done to me
And then if you can't tell when you're close to me
I'm what you'd be if you didn't suck seed",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-suckseed-intro-2-lyrics
Wheaties,Killer,2008.0,"I-I-I-In the mix
You're in the mix with your boyfriend, baby
Bobby Bang and it’s that time for the hot 9 at 9
With Tech N9ne featuring Shawnna
'Bout to wear that ass out ten ways to Sunday
So you better eat your Wheaties

My energy's pumping, it's finna be something to see
'Cause when I be drunken, it's sin to be humping with me
If women be crunk and authentic we jump in the B
Then I'm in it, we bumpin' to the finish, T punching the V
Like a prize fighter, eyes light up, when I glide by the thighs
Try the size, why the cries? 'Cause I be the pied piper
Wide or tighter, I like her pie-diver, prize swiper
Rider all night to the hide hiker
I been away for a long while, sick of just being your phone-pal
You might be needing your long towels, when I get to you, it's on now, wow!
Better gas up when you with the King Kong, gal
Get it, pivot, women dig it, lick it, then I hit it
Girl, that's my grown style!
I'm really gonna be living in what you're giving
I'm all over you like I'm Pepé Le Pew
Give me the goodies, I wanna know if you wanna get on top of me, no I gotta be when I'm stepping to you
Giving it what It needed repeated I fill it up when I beat it
You never want me to leave it, you gotta please me thorough
If you wanna piece of a gorilla, you want it with Tecca N9na
Better eat your Wheaties, girl!

Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
I hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, better eat your Wheaties, girl

I know you want me baby, do I make you horny, baby?
I can tell by your eyes, you want me to ride you, like a horsey, baby
Better back up off me, baby, oh, you're not the type to be scurred
If you feel this, we can do it real big, maybe you can meet me in the back of the G4
We can do it in the 'Lac, on the D-low,we can do it on the track for the people
Seen you looking at the ass, we do it for the cash, I throw it like craps at the 'sino
Never had one like me, shorty, when I'm done when the wife is shouting
Maybe thinking that she's like me, but you see, it's just unlikely, shorty
When I get him, I'ma get in the rhythm, and have him feeling like he never ever felt befo'
Get up in him and I fill him with venom, and have him chillin' and drilling me, from the night to the morn'
Baby, you gotta be taking over me, part of me, pardon me, I think he got me in the zone
Love it when he call me on the phone, he never been in love so much, but see the body in a thong
He like to put the nookie in his face, and every time I get out of line, he like to put me in my place
He put me in the A, or should I say the 745, gotta .45 chillin' in the safe
So what'cha wanna say? Your boy wanna see me, trying to meet me 'cause I'm on TV
Better believe I want you, and I'm finna come through, 'cause I ate my Wheaties

Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
I hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, better eat your Wheaties, girl

Since I gotta super label, and
I got a big amount to pay the hand
So can a nigga get a table dance?
You looking hotter than Zatarain's
And I'm thinking of getting laid again
I don't- give a damn about who that belong to
Don't- keep the N9na waiting any longer
Want- to be the lucky one to get up on you
C'mon, shake your booty, baby, do that conga!
You don't wanna miss it, 'cause I'ma hit it terrific and I be so
Rugged, ya love it, I'm cock diesel
Me so horny, but don't be thinking I'm evil
Please your body 'cause baby, it's 'squisito
Don't get it twisted when you get with a nice cat
Give me what you want, because ya know when you like that
But get up in the sack, you won't be able to fight that
Brace for your neck and in the panties, an ice pack
Eat them Wheaties, and really you can get power
Come in and get at you every motherfucking hour
Give you a lot of it, then we get up in the shower
Then hit Roscoe's on Sunset and Gower
I'ma leave for a minute, but I'ma be back
You can videotape it, can't nobody see that
Eat your Wheaties, 'cause everyday I'ma need cat
So if you looking to see me, you better eat that

I'm coming to get it just so you know
Ain't no prison in the system that can hold a bro, no
And I'm gon' hit it like I told you so
Don't be actin' like you forgot it, you're s'posed to know, yo

Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
I hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, better eat your Wheaties, girl
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
I hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, better eat your Wheaties, girl

Yeah, you better eat your Wheaties, baby
And get the big ol' bowl of 'em too: the breakfast of champions
And if you ain't got that get you some Powerade, some Gatorade,  some something-ade

Mitch Bade,The Calm Before the Storm: Part 1,1999,"Have you ever met a nigga who was pie sprung?
There's a lot of slinky niggas where I come from
There's another missile catcher just like him
His name is Mitchell Bade, Mitchell Bade

What up, Mitch? Is it an everyday thang for you to act just like a bitch?
How does it feel to have a nigga that will kill you for the foul shit you bitch?
Number one snitch, a bitch with a dick, I found the remedy for the enemy
(What?) Bust at the nigga like shootin' at the Kennedys
Cause Mitch Bade ain't really no friend of me!
To be exact, he's that nigga that talk, but he really can't back
That shit that he talk so he gotta walk around with a gat
But a nigga like me, (I'll knock him out with the force of a hurricane)
The penalty for the path if you disrespect the game
Now what goes on inside the mind of a nigga like this?
The nigga pissed, as I pumped off four rounds up in the trick he was with
But it ain't my fault you a little ole' bitch (Without yo clique)
Nigga, run with a quickness (Get away quick, but you bet not slip)
Better off with a Bianca then be stuck (With a AK-47 on your lip)
Even if I'm lifted I can scope 'em from a mile away
(Niggas fakin' like anticipating the doomsday)
Camouflagin' but I can see you actin' like a bitch
Which are the symptoms of a nigga named Mitch!

Have you ever met a nigga who was pie sprung?
There's a lot of slinky niggas where I come from
There's another missile catcher just like him
His name is Mitchell Bade, (Mitch Bade) Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade)
If a Mitch is in your mix you best to check one
And be ret to go for milli when the next one come
If that nigga got a foot off in his rectum
His name is Mitchell Bade, (Mitch Bade) Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade)

(Late night I got a page from Bianca)
She told me her man was trippin', so swoop her 'bout a block up
So I-uhm, got prepared, my conscience told me grab the gat
But all I could think about, was hittin' that kitty kat from the back
All about that hustle, but tonight I gosta kick it
Deep conversation, but it's her first time lettin' a nigga hit
But I'm not alone, It seems this nigga was on the phone
He heard the spot, the topic, wicked, wicked, now it's on!
As I continue (continue) creepin' (creepin') it's apparent
That I'm dealin' with a Mitch Bade, I guess that's why he keeps on starin'
But I'm well equipped to handle a fleet, so nigga don't think I'm sleep
We can talk like men or we can get grim, and handle this shit n'the streets
Don't ever trust no cock
Especially when a nigga like me is rollin' up your block
Bitch Made nigga couldn't see that you was played
So we just changed your name and called you Mitch Bade (Mitch Bade)

Have you ever met a nigga who was pie sprung?
There's a lot of slinky niggas where I come from

His name is Mitchell Bade, (Mitch Bade) Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade)

Cruisin' down the 'spect with five spliffs rolled (rolled)
Passenger seat (seat), Sunday the Ho' Stroll
Went to the park with major loot
Dippin' up on bitches, but the jealous Mitch is ready to shoot, peep
But it ain't complete, the day is foul without a big butt and smile
I need a chick that's running wet like Fury of the Nile
Bumped into, stepped into, this chick that's thick and photogenic
In a minute, I'ma get up in it, with a jimmy to avoid that AIDS epidemic
Get it, got it, good in the hood, shit's all good nigga, so I knocked on wood
Got to her crib, drank some Crown, laid me down, showed me the goods
Then, knock knock, ""Who's that?""
She said her man and he might be strapped with a gat
Put back on my shit, time to show this fool just where it's at
Ret to get wet, she opened it up enough so I can see
She cracked it a bit, but that nigga pushed her, then came after me
Extended arm, and bodily harm
He should have pulled the trigga, chiggas
Bitch-made Mitch Bade nigga!

No really the kid making moves
I do it like checks on my shoes
I don't notice when checks coming through, yeah
She give me long neck like giraffes
I swear that they head from the zoo
Told Tech gotta keep up
Shots to the chest, goddamn, make it heat up
Somebody talking I put 'em right in the carpet
If they starting a problem, I call Muggs, they get beat up
Told him he got four more for sure
Flow cold, snow-globe
More slope out my mag, that's how I treat them
Hit 'em with a Speedom
He didn't wanna do it, but I got a little fluid in me, so a nigga eat 'em
I'm on Ciroc or the Henny, yeah
How much you got? I got plenty, mmh
She from the block just like Jenny, yeah
Swear that I'm on with no penny, mmh

I'ma just sip mine, I'm tryna stay out of trouble
Here's to humble beginnings, then I'm done after this
Or I'm having mixed drinks about feelings now, damn, ain't that about a bitch?
Said they cut off of all beverages
Right back at it like a bad reader
Get shitfaced like an ass eater
You can tell that I'm blown like a bad speaker
Happy to sag with it out, savvier
Got 
bad habits
, I'm a gas leaker
Had a half from 'em, looking magnesia
But don't have what she's had, 'nother bag eater
Can I get a cold 'Bou Lou in a coozie?
Jack D, back to back shots of Coolie
Then chugging the backwash of a brewski
Get the crew, we grouping with a doobie
With the shits, bro, get to it
Get twisted with the whole hood
Once it hits your lips, it's so good

Tonight I wasn't gonna drink, but I'ma do it
Ayy, ayy, fucking do it
Tonight I wasn't gonna drink, but I'ma do it
Ayy, ayy, fucking do it
Tonight I wasn't gonna drink, but I'ma do it, do it, do it
What you waiting on?
Do it, do it, do it
What you waiting on?
Do it, do it, do it
What you waiting on?
Do it

What I'm saying is disclosure (What?)
Y’all are stupid, you get shoulder (Ha)
'Cause your plan was to get over (Whoop whoop whoop)
Since the days of Victrola
All the years of straight lies and deprivin'
Now I’m pushin' to take a dive and connivin'
We should never hear any cries from the guys
When independents we risin', high steady survivin'
Never ever had an artist wanna spray us
'Cause when they do the fuckin' work, they know we pay up
And I see the labels getting set to bust
'Cause them people wanna bypass them and come direct to us
I mean those with no major, mo’ ways to grow paper
For the little mane, they cut out the middle gang
Now you gotta threaten ’em, tell 'em you’ll pull your catalog
We ain't gotta do that at all, we say, ""Ain't that a hog?""

You in trouble now, we that bubble sound
Your record label better get with it or then it’s Hubble bound
I mean to rebel now, so many befuddled clowns in the industry
Then it's me, leaving 'em with muddled frowns
You've been greedy so believe me
Your thievery will indeed hit you right where your cheese be
For years you been dumb and hold the juice
But it's over now, the chickens are coming home to roost
Get a little stupid, get, get a little stupid
I mean get a lotta stupid 'cause y'all dishonor the music
That's why we celebratin' artists cooled as Christmas
'Cause we know without no artists, ain't no music business

We ready for it!

Most of my teachers didn't teach me shit!

A lot of truancy 'cause they couldn't influence me
To fluently spew it, the two couldn't do it congruently
So I learned culture, rock music, rockin'
While I rock up that Coka, Pac on my poster!
So now I'm part of it when I used to fear it
I learned a lot of shit but most would not clear it
Some were scared of me and would not come near this
People failed me but music lifts my spirit!

This education kicked me in my fucking balls
They fighting in the class, fighting in P.E
This education's un-educating me!

I just wanna kcuf and get up
Don't gotta tell me what you're thinkin', 'cause I know just what you're thinkin'
She light to me with a sign up
She just wanna get mind kcuffed

Hey, new pic through, my twit view
Had me wishin' I was next to you to sniff you
So the fact I never met you was an issue
It's true so I'm hopin' it's a get to
You baby what I am creating hope it lifts you
To where you never need a tissue
Just a wet towel when I see it's somethin' I wanna lick boo
Like your eyelids..
Lot of beautiful parts of your body baby this is my bid
Have you trippin' about the freaky shit I did
You're interacting with the poet and porn hybrid
Lickin' things on your body, that they prolly
Never thought of servicin' but romancin's my hobby
I'll lick you like a lolly, from your eyes and I'll leave
Your teeth I'mma sweep with my tongue like it was Molly
Hella beauty wake the N9ne up
When you share pretty pictures of your fine butt
Had a dream I bit your neck and red wine gushed
So I sipped you every time I eat the prime cut
Wanna take you to a spot, no one'll find us
Be secluded, we gettin' zooted, we design lust
You submissive with mental misses and I'm what?
Super dominant, get your ankles, wrist and mind kcuffed

Con-trol, something's wrong with me
I just can't let, go
Let me, let me see how far that you'll go

Now let me kcuf your mind, let me kcuf your mind

I tongue the inside of my mouth all day
So, by the time I get to you it'll be all play
Dancin' my tongue around where your pink drawers lay
We freaks but you creep's y'all wanna peek y'all pay
Yeah-e-yeah, a little bit of crazy there
She will be my lady if she don't look away
She will see my shady stare
Trying to hold your brain hostage
So you listen to every single thing I talk miss
Like ""Let me hit it from the back in a crowded mosh pit."" People peepin' what we doin', think we lost it
Hope you thinkin' what I'm sayin' isn't awkwid
And you ain't trippin' off of me 'cause you a boss bitch
I wanna take a dip in all your sauces
Don't be cautious, I wanna eat you 'til I'm nauseas
Can I suck your tongue? (Let me do it)
Can I touch your buns, when you push your gun in a lustful sprung (Ooh)
With a thrust so hung, I'mma crush yo lungs (Yeah!)
You still reading? I'm hoping for a response this evening, I'm teethin'
I'm hopin' your picture is not deceivin'
'Cause jeez when I look at your body girl you're not even a vegan
Please direct message me
We try at best and then we die in ecstasy
I request that you mesh with me
See why it catches me, she fly as heck to me
I'm the kind that really wants to control your brain
Wanna lock you up in chains
Give you this pain when you feel every fuckin' thing

I can never blame the bitches wanting to get close
'Cause this independent game, we make the most
That's why all the ladies asking me ""Can we get ghost?""
(Ghost!)
Then these ladies wanna fuck down
But they want us all to hush now
Instead of saying she wants her guts pounded, she think of everything to cut 'round it
I'ma just tell you to cut to the chase
You want the D, and you up for the taste
Lie and run away, got lots of people
They rushing for our way like a flock of seagulls
Wanna see you after hours, to cut

Wanna come and make me chowder? drink some Amaretto Sours?

Hate you had to fail, 'cause really it was on groom-watch
Havin' visions of you when I was livin' up in the Boondocks
Bringin' children up in the building, try'na consume shots
Blood-sucking bitches be the reason I keep my room locked
So keep a square bid'ness
The thing you really want from Tech Nina ain't near bid'ness
They really quick to run up and offer you their digits
They got millionaire wishes
They want you to bare witness, to share kisses

Crack I crease sound like a big bitch
In the back trying get up out a little nigga trunk
Turn heads for I even hit the block
Lil kids running up when they hear the beat knock
Crank it to the max whenever I pass cops
Heart skip a beat whenever the bass drop
My shit is quakin got my rearview vibrating
Pulled up next to my gran mammy at the red light got her wig shaking
Hennessey & purple is what I'm tasting
Finna do some baby making
Gotta chop that freak sitting next to me
Bitch look like Sanaa Lathan
Hey sunday morning 'round eleven roll by interupting in the reverend
I'll probably lose my hearing by the time I'm twenty-seven
It's a shame
But I need that bang
To vibrate my frame
ABS my game
Have to do a little switch up can a a player get strange
I tell my biatrice to quit yappin later on we gon' get nasty
You can do whatever you like to me, we can do classy or get trashy
Matter fact we ain't even gotta go to the crib girl we can do it in the back seat
For now sit back relax and let this beat massage your ass cheeks


It's WHO
Prada
Jesus that nigga that came with the heat that you needed
Along waited on, hella hated on
Hungry little nigga 'bout ta eat 'til the plate is gone
Gotta flamer on, 'bout to step into the danger zone
Mind as well go ahead and call the cops
'Cause 'em loud ass next door neighbors is home
Yeah
And we coming to tear the block up
Beat it loud banging like blocka, them bitches jock us
That why these niggas mock us but they not us, and it not just
Music with me and my partners, we done put time in this bitch so how can you stop us

Can I get up in the rhythm of the money
For the woman and the niggas in the city that said
I'll never make it but I'm here now
Got it made now
Gettin' hoes now
Gettin laid now
'Cause when I getta laying down
Gettin paid now
You motherfuckers shouldn't have nothing to say now
Gotta middle finger for yall scratch that I ain't even thinkin' of ya'll Pass that
So pass the gat to the back
Where I'm sitting now with the kitty cat I'ma laugh when I'm gettin' now
Roll down the window and let the beat slap Alan Wayne and Strange you can't beat that
That's what it's all about boy
Don't be hatin' on a nigga 'cause a nigga gotta a little bit of clout boy
Shit talk shit down anyways
So turn my music up and
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth BOY


They don't want me to live in the end of my block

Partyin' with the ladies I pull in Mercedes you know we gonna
BANG BIG SOUND
We kickin' it loud at 3 o'clock on the spot
Pouring liquor around we doin' shots 'til we drop
Every once in a while we get a knock from the cops saying
TURN SHIT DOWN
Yup
My neighbors probably wishin' I resided in hella prison
'Cause they always tell me and Mak to turn down our Television
And we got it hooked to our stereo, you would think the scenario running lights
I got the mic when the bass kick hit very low
I can't help 'cause I like it loud I hype the crowd
I party and I despite the cloud
It might be foul the neighbors wanna fight me now
In the night we growl the woman excite me wow
So with the volume button 'cause I be bustin' the thang
And I don't wanna nobody hearin' us when we bang
So I turn up the music and then lust 'til we came
Now I know the neighbors know my name
Can't help 'cause that's my style
More beat then the law allow
About to get me a crib in the country
Nobody to hunt me tellin' me

Back in the day but now my eyesight's blown
Comin' to see me 'cause of my microphone
'Cause I write songs and now they wanna try right wrongs

Ten years later because a nigga sung a rap

With a pic of they private, then send a kiss

And they see your life is less grotesque
So they wonder how did you get so blessed?
And the envy is up at last, they will bring up the past
Hoping that you retrogress
That'll make you really check those pests
Mad 'cause you kick it with the best, no less

Rhymes shine from a mind, I'm like an Einstein
From the grime, I'm prime, climb on the timeline

Sing crack, do it all for the greenbacks

Buss Serves,The Storm,2016.0,"Started with the blow and went to flows
Listen to me tell my gutter story and it goes

When I was nineteen, I went to go live with my auntie
And noticed she had nice things, the furniture and
All of her clothes quite clean to never be working a 9 to 5
She ran a ice cream, team
She put me on, am I wit' it Simon?
Stay remarkably grown, that's why my pockets be long
Ducked some feds, dumped packs, and then got custom threads
From serving boofas in KC we say let's buss some heads, nigga
In French village, I went 'til it, got the rent bill it
Got so heavy I no longer benched skrilla was a cinch still I had to Vince Neil it
Yell in a microphone and write them songs they like it's on
I let go they life worth of pipe is blown to flowing ignite my home I used to buss serves, now I buss words
Either way slanging or sanging whatever life I'ma just splurge
We had the spot though until it really got hot so
Escape I did like El Chapo
But Nueve still get faded, vato

Prolly find me somewhere rhyming man this flow's absurd
Or maybe find me on my grinding where the pot is stirred
Either way I'm bout my pay I'm tryna stack up my dollars
Ripping the chowder, stomping the powder, dumping it louder, soldier for louder
Necked it to a vato
Jefe, head honcho

Still logged in with the block though
Hit a thang and make the knot grow
Push a nigga push it all bro
Pussy pills to that Pablo
In dark or night nigga I glow
Old nigga with the bag bro
Silly nigga with the mag though
Be careful what you pussies ask for
I'm airing out one of you assholes
Real shit, but the paper quit when the violence hit, nigga beep it bool
Shit bricks and quick licks turned meal ticks, nigga beep it bool
Out here hungry chasing food
All in, refuse to lose

And stop lips, to cop scripts not, wit' a nigga on the block tip
If you ain't-a bitch, thank ya, and you really want gangsta shit
Bang to this, if a nigga ain't soft like a handkerchief, drink a sip
If you wanna come and get the money quickly, and I'm talking brains grip!
If you wanna hunny me and not a dummy wit' me, let's link bitch!

You can miss me with that bullshit, pussy nigga
And I can't hear them suckas talkin' 'less they talkin' figures
And I ain't checkin' for no broke ass bad bitch
Keep your pussy, keep it movin' over there, bitch
Money getters, turf the realest over here, bitch
Far from sucka, never trippin' over that bitch
I'm allergic to these suckas, never had shit
Either hate me or you love me with a bad bitch

If you fed up, with the bullshit, with the pulpit
If you fed up with the bully at school sick
If you enemy and wanna let the tool spit
If you rule shit, and wrong with a crude clique
Who gets everybody zooted, woo chicks making 'em lose it
If them fools rich and taking group pics
Of huge chips on Instagram, tempt the man to go move quick
To make them dudes strip
Put the milli on the loose lips
If you the nigga with the Ruger spitter and you 'bout to come out on a true lick
If you fuck with Tech N9ne in this hoe
And if you always wanted to see him rhyme at a show
So if you bring that greenery and wine in the do'
Baby girl if you get naked and waste no time then you blow, let's go!

You can miss me with that bullshit, pussy nigga
And I can't hear them suckas talkin' 'less they talkin' figures
And I ain't checkin' for no broke ass bad bitch
Keep your pussy, keep it movin' over there, bitch
Money getters, turf the realest over here, bitch
Far from sucka, never trippin' over that bitch
I'm allergic to these suckas, never had shit
Either hate me or you love me with a bad bitch

If a sucka don't fit you if you never be slippin' without a pistol
Quick to run up on a nigga that tried to diss you
Too bitch to say it if you pit bull then he a Shih Tzu
If you like it insane and you ain't with the norm, you with Strange
And you ain't what them stupid pity games
That motherfuckers play try to mess with your brain
Yeah, if you ain't-a stink butt, if you and the name fuckboy
Never synced up
If you mama nem didn't raise a cream puff
If you swing cuts that have they dreams crushed
If you a bad bitch and you inked up
If you ain't faulty and never have a nigga jinxed up
If we broke and you would help me rob a Brink's truck
Then give a clean fuck, baby let's link up

You can miss me with that bullshit, pussy nigga
And I can't hear them suckas talkin' 'less they talkin' figures
And I ain't checkin' for no broke ass bad bitch
Keep your pussy, keep it movin' over there, bitch
Money getters, turf the realest over here, bitch
Far from sucka, never trippin' over that bitch

Brightfall,Planet,2017.0,"I come from it, but it seems impossible to run from it
All the evil I did to people then could none stomach?
No, 'cause when my spirits go up, now every one plummets
I can light all, with this angel but that demon will make the brightfall
When your angle is to reason with those who night crawl
Psycho searchin' so they get even with a life you lost and was leavin'
But it might be costin' this season, when the fight calls
People change their life of sin
Then try to negate the back, they aimed the knife within
A shame, I can win the game, be nice to friends
Then bang, my revenge, it came to wipe this grin then pain
Fight your demons I'd advise it, it's there no matter how you try to hide it
In private, you're runnin' from the people that despise it
Don't you lie and deny this, sick hybrid
Angel demon ain't no leavin' either one
Can't take it back where you got the evil from
This magnitude, the angel will need a gun
So much evil I saw, in the past when I was bad, now I'm right y'all
But evil remains to make the brightfall

God knows I'm trying
It seems like I'm always fighting
For my life, for my soul
This won't bring me down

All I want is heaven but evil forces, they follow me
Plottin' on my body to attempt to torch it or hollow me
I cannot let the depths of Hell to rise up and swallow me
I'm tryna make it where the other angels and God'll be
This is terrible, fightin' the past me is unbearable
Never really mattered if my symbols and outfit were clerical
Judgin' today for past demons make me hysterical
Darkness is blindin', take me back in the city of Jericho
Darkness will not win, my heart is really not grim
But the chances of me becomin' pure angel has got slim
I'm stuck and I'm blocked in, brightness, the plots been
Wanna frolic in God, I'm lookin' for solace but it got dim
How can I detach from the past, the heinous acts
Will I last? Will they attack with a blast?
When the night calls, it's gonna be a nice brawl
For the darkness to come and make my brightfall


Get it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix, rid it out
Don't ever wanna see, what that pit about
We just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out
Get it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix, rid it out
Don't ever wanna see, what that pit about
We just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out

I'm fighting for a bright life
But evil wanna consume me and my soul is the right price
That would literally be a fright night
But I ain't sellin' my soul to hell, angels yellin' propellin' flight heights
Wanna spread these angel wings
But they have wicked entangled things
Like steamin' hot tar with the stench of brimstone
Knee in God's yard, can I repent the sin gone?
Did that, done that, then the evil comes back
Runnin' from myself, it seems it ain't no runnin' from that
Just when you wanna start anew
They judge you on what you used to be, thus makin' it harder to
But I refuse to lose, even if I gotta be banged and bruised
Why do we have to battle just to go the bright route?
Oh well, I'm 'bout to beat this Hell until it's lights out

Alive and I'm well, did I win in hell? The fight just to save my soul
'Cause time and time again, when I crawl to the light, I land in sin
Now my sins so far away, that darkness will never find me
Hideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque
Hideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque
Hideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque
Hideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque
Hideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque
Hideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque
Hideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-brightfall-lyrics

 GODDAMN!

They want madness, 
Anghellic
 and sadness
Fans relish when gladness is damned, devilish and ashes
But I like this cash, this massive magazine ad gets
Crackin', attractive chicks passin', is rap and actresses them asses
They want the clown, the paint and the evil frown
The drink and, the needle now,
 the taint and no feeble sounds
But I need your pounds, your pesos, your people down
With this label and I be so bound for that halo when I be low ground
They want that black magic, that savage with bad habits
And grab at and stab rabbits, the maggot that has cabbage
But I'm at that fast status with swagger that's past average
My glasses and rag matches don't mean flag and it's no blast added
They say bizarre he went, they love him in dark he vents
Toppin' the chart, he sent naughty shit to everybody's tent
I wanna be at the party bent listening to Parliament
Sorry this part of me's a gnarly gent, they call me (

They want the dark knight

Hard bites, art is the smartest thing, in this scarred life

Welcome to everready
Welcome to everready

The Religion!
First thing I wanna say is (what!)
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Y'all can't fuck wit' us

It's the one with a name of a gun
Look at me mamma what I become is a monsta
Gangsta, fast But I want to
Thank ya for the last thirty-three
'Cause everybody's heard of me
And if they say that I'm fakin' mama it's perjury
'Cause your son comes with thunder now
That's why they wonder why we headline when I'm underground
In this mainstream game, my gang brings pain to cowards
Said I'm done, Kali give me the power
Come on wit' it (ah!)
You industry punks, I hope you fakes die
'Cause most of these rappers have a queer eye for the straight guy
Was that shit loud enough to hear?
Loud enough to echo through the city and bust your ears
Patrick Grant tried to sue us for a whole lot of bucks this year
Sell crazy somewhere else trick (we're all stocked up here)
Hey! I think I wanna say it again, y'all
Y'all can't fuck wit' us

Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do

Can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us

Yo! Big Krizz Kaliko
Tell 'em, y'all can't fuck wit' us
Y'all can't fuck wit' us

Fuck niggas that got it in for me
Pretend the crowd's still got its energy, loud!
Rulers finna be crowned
Through foolin' around with ya's
Two hands and both thumbs down bitches
From biancas and biatrices,
 the theatrics is miraculous
You don't want to go on after us (no!)
This is a snippet of ridiculous, can't-get-with-us flows
Actually a little bit of babblin' liftin' your soul up
And we all grown up
And when we blown up
Don't get to frontin'
I'll give you country boys nothin'
You can cut us to thirty we stay on for an hour
'Cause them heads bobbin' in the crowd's ours 
(ABSOLUTE POWER!)
Main thing's taking over this mainstream
The game seems like they been waiting for a new A-Team
Ask Busta Rhymes, he said that nobody had the gift like him and Spliff
But me and Tech N9ne who y'all ain't fucking with

Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us

Yo, but instead I'm gonna say (what!?)
Y'all can't fuck with us
Y'all can't fuck with us

Okay this the benediction (now we got y'all listenin'!)
Whoa, just a fraction of friction from an act you was missin'
If you would actually listen you'd see whose ass you'd be kissin' (MUAH)
You're dealin' with one hell of a relic, ya see
I'm angelic but devils bring out the devil in me
I might pull it, the bullets'll be several, you'll see
A goody-goody get hoody, lesson from messin' with me

This is my testament Tecca Nina's been pressed against walls
Simply the best to get next to this so I represent all
Grab your breasts to this, have mo' sex to this, pop your crystal
Cock ya legs a bit, rock ya bed to this, drop the big drawls
'Tis to men to never wanna take a stand to
You chumps in trouble? We 'bout to bubble like shampoo
You might try but you can't do what Aaron and Sam do
You tryin' to ban who?
No can do!

It's a celebration bitches, yo

Everythang ain't, goochie
You're soft like, sushi
If you owe like, Pookie
Yes you do you owe like Pookie
Yes it's true kiss all that booty
Yes you do you owe like Pookie
Yes it's true kiss all that booty

I'm so drivin', with no license
Cold night when a woman gets wined and dined and it's no pipin
Remember the crackhead on ""New Jack City,"" the low life one
(Yup!) Well his name Pookie (gyah) and you owe like him
At the trailers, thought we began trust
You stand up my hand is on your damn butt you say I'm nuts!
The way I ham up, you said you understand us
And lessons that I can't cut but in the end you jammed up!
I don't take nothin' (gyah) but I expected something! (Gyah)
Cause you stated after dinner and movie next was humping (gyah)
And I was always taught by Momma Nem to respect a woman (gyah)
But you owe like Pookie I suggest you pay when the checks are coming


First T.I. go to jail then Wayne too
Notice a traumatic drop in sales when the lame dudes
Come to try the same, dude remains in the game fools
Wanting to be stars everybody ain't spangled
So how can I be confident and say these rappers will be prominent
Today they grabbin', and put a comical stain on (music, music)
It happens to be looted, you sad, you signin' for lucrative stacks
But when you listen to it in fact (ruins it, screws it)
Up for everybody else, I'mma fuck everybody else
I walk up in the store what to purchase (NOTHING!)
 All by myself
With all the money lost to booty suckers (you owe a lot of people)
Me, you owe yourself, you even owe my mother
So you owe Pook!


It's been a minute, I want my stack with interest
And if you come with that you talking you gon' need a dentist
(Yes!) Money never grow on trees so you disrespecting
Fuck a Smith & Wesson I'mma order you that chopper special
They say you shuckin and jiving from me you duckin and hidin
Let's see you duck and hide from these bullets when I fly 'em
It's been a week nigga takin my kindness for weakness
'til I cock back and squeeze this till I leave yo' ass bleeding
Period! Now niggas wanna act so delirious
When I ask for my paper 'till I do somethin so serious
Like bust a head, break a neck, you letting in some dookie
My advice just pay up, nigga you owe like Pookie

As if to say my performance is why they gawkin'

Then we jet I mean split like a V-neck

When he up the air like Craig Smith, Tech and Nesto
Standin' next to Necro we blessed to let flow, get dough
Even though you know we gets the pest-o

I'll murder yours ya I'm an asshole when its time to shit, nigga

To be throwin' every woman that N9ne
But that's all that be on my mind
I be spending all my time, pursuing that rhyme
I be always on my grind
But when my lady wanna get it from behind
Gotta be breaking that backwards and be shaking the sack
It'll be quick in the crack getting it laid from no slacking
Like Hell yeah! C'mon!
She's scared like I got a gun on
Looking at me like a nigga done wrong
Gonna moan and I hope that it ain't anyone home
I'm 'bout to knock it out the box bitch
Gonna make it blow a shock and
Rock it, bop it, bout to pop it
I'mma never ever stop it, akee-kee-kee!
Cause I ain't had none in weeks, I'm geeked
Scorpio a freak-a-leak
I go deep than peak
Do it in the back of my Mercedes, ooh
You make me spray baby goo
Premature, aww damn girl look what you made me do!

If I had a side piece, I could dump her something
Somebody else is wrong to jump in, always think I'm up to something
Girl I'm only tryna function
You can't hear nothing when I'm talkin' and you sayin' something
Put it in lame and same that your brain just to explain
I can't stain when your gums is bumpin'
You keep on thinkin' I'm creepin'
Whenever I'm leavin' we beefin' and I ain't done nothing wrong
My phone used to blow up on the reggie
Calmed it down a few you do the fool
Still actin' edgy
But I got something to calm you
When you be up at night
How's 'bout you play the plumbing?
And I come lay the pipe (Okay!)
Always talkin' 'bout something wrong
But I fix it real quick, didn't I?
Always singing that same old song
That there's another chick that I'm with - get rid of her!
Puttin' it down like I'm 'posed to do it
My phone ain't 'posed to view it
Something to say and I bet you spew it
It's like this everyday when we go through it
Than it's back to lovin' like we used to
We cool for a minute
Kali baby see right through ya
It's a fiendish plot to make ya scream and stop
Whether I cheat or not
I wish I was loving somebody else
So you can either leave or not (Okay!)

You make me wish I was fucking somebody else
So I can do you right (Do you, Do you right)

Tell Me If I’m Trippin’,Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"I wanted to find my gun, my lady runs to the bathroom
Yelling ""someone"", and when it's done
I'ma treat it like my daughters and son, we having fun
'Till intruders came knocking to come kill everyone
The beat and the kick ringing my bell uncontrollably
Four in the morning yelling my name so they know it's me
Scramble and try to find my nigga's gun, I'm supposed to be
Prepared for the crazy, my lady screaming don't go to see
Fuck it, I'm going down to the kitchen to get the knife
Invite 'em all in my crib and then take everybody's life
Chop 'em all into pieces, pray to God they heat-less
He in D shit, play with their bodies in the name of Jesus
One, two, three, god damn it's just the cops
All the motherfuckers must've scramm' when we hit the block
I was gonna kill am I wrong to feel
For my loved safety I'll leave you permanently still
Trav said he caught them on camera they came to his place
Two teen girls and the guy yelling ""where is Yates""
Damn some fans would've lost some lives on this day
Mistaken, I would've been erasing all of the kid's face

Am I my paranoid or scared
Or is this my nightmare
Were they ever really there?
Tell me if I'm tripping
Am I supposed to sit and wait
While they storm through the gate
Psycho just like Norman Bates
Tell me if I'm tripping

Yeah, it's gonna be the shit, wait 'till you hear this, man. You on keyboard, I gotta get this fixed, man, damn... Alright, there we go. Alright man, sit over there though

Seven o'clock, I was upstairs
I was on the keyboard making that tear
Knock on the front door, C.O. got it
Niggas came in, I said ""Yo, get in the closet""
Hit 'em with venom and run up in 'em while they rummagin'
Too many niggas was coming in, I wanna get me one
Hopin' niggas try me cause I'm finna feel like ""fry me""
Eyes all Chinese, high off reefer
I'ma get deeper, turn to the Grim Reaper
Use a heat seeker when I creep with the heater
Leave a deep gash, bring the heat fast
Hit 'em with the venom, when I get 'em I'ma keep 'em
Giving them an enema, even if it's ten of 'em
Then I'ma, eat 'em like dinner in the cinema
Then I'ma, shit 'em out, get 'em out
In about twenty-four seconds I'ma fuck 'em in the ass
Tuck 'em in the grass, cut 'em up fast
Buttercup, shut 'em up, I'ma cut mass
I'ma cut lass, nigga he got it, he gotta fuck 'em up, yeah
Tell me if I'm tripping

Am I my paranoid or scared
Or is this my nightmare
Were they ever really there?
Tell me if I'm tripping
Am I supposed to sit and wait
While they storm through the gate
Psycho just like Norman Bates
Tell me if I'm tripping

I don't really wanna play this, guys... This isn't something to mess around with
Come on, it's just a game, nothing to worry about, sit down
(Hey, man, hand me one of those beers)
But it's not just a game...
It is, everything is gonna be fine, hand me a beer too. Come on, let's do it

I can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994
And a group of us was chilling at the table, we was drinking  with our fingers on the Ouija board
Tryna summon spirits asking ""Ouija, can you hear us?"" never thinking what was in store
Then the dogs started barking, in the darkness, all of a sudden it was knocking at the front door
Then we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open
Nervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion, no one was there, we went back to the board hoping
That we finally made contact, with the deity, apparition on the other side
Then it started moving out and soon it was spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die
We decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment
On the way home Sarah hit a patch of ice, lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life

Am I my paranoid or scared
Were they ever really there?
Tell me if I'm tripping
Am I supposed to sit and wait
While they storm through the gate
Psycho just like Norman Bates
Tell me if I'm tripping

Real stories

""Aaron is so cute"", that's what they used to say to me
Ninth grade, young female teachers, almost every day to me
That's when I wore the high top fade and curly freeze with bravery
'Cause the gangstas say it ain't the way to be, but all of the women hella thought I was savory (Mhm)
In my Guess fit, popular, you guessed it
Hip-hop dancer and rapper, in the talent shows, I blessed it
Hardly rode the bus home 'cause I stayed after
Displayed laughter with the grade passer, I'm a lay master
And everybody know that I'm a babe catcher
Walking home on cloud nine, a hundred percent man about mine
Then I crossed the way, there was a grown man stopped at a red light hella on shout time, he said ""Hey!""
When I looked I was thinking that I hope this person ain't pistol-happy
Then right before he drove off, the man blew a kiss my way and then he whistled at me
I'm like, ""Mother—"" then he sped off, I was thinking, ""Man, I wanna tear his head off""
Then I stopped 'cause I was tripping, walking, I was almost home, I kept dipping
Got home, then I asked my mama, ""Why did he say hey at me instead of hey at a girl?""
Then my mom just looked right at me and said, ""Baby dawg, that's the way of the world""
Later that night I hooked up with two homies to work on a dance routine
Got it done then allotted some time to holla at some fine and scan boo things
But when my two homies seen two dudes hugged up, now they really mean to feud
I said, ""Yo"" then some cray happened
One of the homies said, ""Time for gay bashing""
The two ran up and attacked the dudes
I don't know what they thought they had to prove
They was swinging with so much attitude
But I could not deal with all that abuse
I said, ""What in the fuck?
Y'all done messed up, it ain't peaceful
You know it's effed up and plus evil
So why in the hell are you doing that to innocent people?""

It feels so sad, I'm not perfect
Always kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing
It feels so sad, I'm not perfect
Always kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing

Sophomore year, man, I lost more tears
'Cause of people hating people and it cost more fear
My school, it was the stash spot for gangstas with rag tops
You'd get your ass shot, that year we had so many mascots
How could we do no wrong? And schools were integrated
How could we do no wrong? Racism demonstrated
Got to be moving on before I'm eliminated
Possibly use the chrome because I've been degraded
Scratch that, I'm not that cat
I would never wanna keep a rat-tat in my backpack
Never had nobody to snap at, I'm a class act
But one day somebody had doom
We heard two blacks got stab wounds
And got beat and kicked, white elites and shit
When the lights went out in the bathroom
Everybody was heated, people been mistreated
It's a damn shame that a Klan came and gave a man pain, a misdeed hit 'cause of skin tone
Them gone to the hospital from a sin zone
Skin domes doing them wrong you can send home, but they been gone
Now everybody on edge
Classroom break to the bathroom, seen hood niggas and they all want heads
Bad moon, hate taking that tune
They said to me, ""When the whites come in
We gon' hit the lights and gon' get they ass""
I said to all of 'em, ""Is this a gag?""
Nah, they wanna break 'em all like Mr. Glass
It happened, the whites en route
Cracking, the lights went out
I laid to the floor
Then I found my way to the door, away from the gore
The hoods came out
Bloody and sweaty, I said, ""That shit ain't regal
In fact, that shit is evil
So why in the hell are you doing that to innocent people?""

It feels so sad, I'm not perfect
Always kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing
It feels so sad, I'm not perfect
Always kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing

It feels so sad, I'm not perfect
Always kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-feel-so-sad-lyrics

Face Paint,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"I be so humble, my regular state
All loving, it's never no hate, a whole 'nother level of Yates
How there isn't when the brain of a rebel create
A fellow with a peddle to break, I'm settled, but this devil is awake
When it's applied, somethin' from deep inside
No longer sneaks and hides, it awakens the beast and pries
Through ligaments, bone and through eyes
No remnants known as true shyness
Rippin' and thrown in to die, given it moments to rise
Then a metamorphosis happens like a lit torch when it's rappin'
Hyped and it's warped and it's fashions
To bring forth war and it's passion
Laughin' wickedly, baby, what's happenin'
We’re smashin' ass, yes, that humble guy’s a has-been
And no they can't, come make me stay saint
When I get that on I black out, it feels like I may faint
Then I feel invincible, never come to kid or play prank
I say what the fuck I want and do what I want to do behind my

(Face Paint) I can be who I want to be
And I know it's still me, but I'm totally free with my

Brian Dennis painted my face back in the day
Like '94, look now, ain't it my taste
I know a lot of motherfuckers think he tainted my faith
But I keep that cross on me I pray and it just ain't at my grace
But I ain't perfect, give me paint and the mic and I'mma merc it
Kent Clark's within me, when I'm up he has no purpose
Tecca Nina the king that will bring the circus to the surface
Shaken the planet earth is a curse if you never heard this
Technicians started me juggalos they spotted me
Allotted me their land to expand this cultural odyssey
I'm their wicked prodigy, being strange is the policy
Anybody talking ill of my family can swallow me
Scenario, the more paint the marry-o a burial for Kent
He's square his ho keep him very low
My appearance to weak motherfuckers is scary tho
They can't even think of touching what I put through the stereo

Here's my analysis:
Since the beginning I have been saying that I'm a angel
But since I accepted the ways of the world;
Money, women, I became a worldly angel
But my mother always wanted me to do it for Christ
So I think the angel inside of me is ashamed
So in order to bring you all this rawness I have learned from earth
I hide behind my
(Face Paint) I can be who I want to be
And I know it's still me, but I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint) I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my
(Face Paint) I can be who I want to be
And I know it's still me, but I'm totally free with my

What is hiding deep inside behind my

Think again, think again, nigga
Huh, the angels been long gone
You full blooded animal (Ha-ha-ha)

So many years with Whoop Whoop experts
Then something got weird just like a blue Tech shirt
Hot 97 compared the two vet's work
Pretty much said, ""They one in the same,"" ooh that hurts
Somebody you can't compare to anyone
All they knew for sure is that I'm makin' plenty funds
I took offense to the incredible sin he brung
It's some Juggalos took it bad and wanted to gimme guns
Death threats from a couple of tough Jugs
When they leader said I wasn't really givin' enough love on the show
To the Juggalo this is not for all of the family but to the few that is trippin' to Hell you can go

They try to take me out the game but ain't no stoppin' me
No, I'll never change it I don't owe any apologies
Yeah, fuck what they thought, I rise and they fall
Got all of these rules just to live by the law
This is my show if I don't get no applause
I'm just bein' me, ain't no way it's my fault, no, no

Last Strictly Strange Tour off in Milwaukee, 3,000 fans, so I feel bossy
'Cause I remember we used to play The Rave downstairs now we up in The Room, it's real costly
All the people, they catchin' the chills off me
My camera crew is tapin' the ill frosties
From the fans, we makin' the ladies dance
And the ladies are elated, not sedated like Bill Cosby's
They just waitin' for the ooh Areola near the end of the show then we do Areola
We didn't see anything but a few aureola
Out of so many women, so that was boo Areola
Only saw 4 from the stage
When they up on the shoulders you can never tell they underage
Next day when the parent was creepin' on her daughter's page
Saw the vid of her daughter flashin' and now she in a rage
She made her daughter tell authorities we made her do it
Yeah right, more like the guy that raised her to it
My partner O' apostrophe called me hostily
Sayin' the cameras got 'em yellin' child pornography
We been doing Areola for 8 years
Now we gotta stay clear 'cause some fake tears
Tried to shut Tech down, so I cut that now, when I bust that sound
But I betcha Milwaukee really fucked that 'round
When the Tech Ninna come into ya town

They try to take me out the game but ain't no stoppin' me
No, I'll never change it I don't owe any apologies
Yeah, fuck what they thought, I rise and they fall
Got all of these rules just to live by the law
This is my show if I don't get no applause
I'm just bein' me, ain't no way it's my fault, no, no

None of this shit is my fault
(So long Areola)
Yeah, none of this shit is my fault
(It was fun while it lasted)
Know they was winnin' but lost
(Damn)
Tryin' to shut out a boss",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-my-fault-lyrics
Keep On Keepin’ On,Absolute Power,2002.0,"You muthafuckas think we gonna stop keepin' on
We shall prevail
Muthafuckas fear what they do not understand
And what they do not understand they try and destroy
Come on now

I hear 'em whisperin' in corners speakin' dirty talk on us
'Bout how we too grown up, that we unknowners
And my persona is Rock 'N Rollish yo' nigga told us
Every word that you quoted
Said I wouldn't be the one that sold it, but HA we exploded
I'm that rap nigga that you heard with 2Pac, Sole
Lynch and Bo, Wake Up Show wit' King Tech and Sway
Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water, Gang Related, Eminem
Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice-1 and them
Hit 'em wit' a venom send 'em down kill 'em when I spit
When I get a bit of scrilla Tech is givin' niggas shit
Love 'em love us but the playa hatin' niggas betta split
It'll neva be another Tecca Nina when I quit
You better kneel when you hear a nigga that's real
I feel 18 when I bust from the grill
Because, (if you keep it young)
Yo song is always sung
So street life taught me to keep 'em sprung
God sent me to kill, lyrical scripts
The miracle whipped you demons and hatas who tripped
Listen I really feel, my Villain T-Will when he spit
Fuck them plus anybody they go get, and shit

You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on

The storm consumes all the sun and moon fall
On you Sodom and Gomorrahian Gregorian chanting RuPauls
Extreme case of blue balls 'cause you bang
Got fruit all in his veins
What I'm sayin' is I will reign murder you all in His name
Biss malla wit' the fist in a pistola
Dismiss the kiss from a hiss giva
Wrist slita male bitch or witch wit' a twist
A glitch man abyss swimma, trick
I will never slide, never fall, never fail
Never the devils side, ever call, never hell
But I got these muthafuckas prayin' for my downfall
But the orange hair means time to clown y'all
Thanks to Jenny I'll get the message to many
The circus is comin' and gunnin' wit' plenty
I heard Vell Bakardy got a poster of me burnin'
To get his earnin' concernin' not I killed him but he ain't learnin'
Nigga you couldn't burn me with acid or in a firey pit
You couldn't burn in a volcano were lava is spit
You couldn't burn me if you damned me to hell where Satan sit
The only way you can burn me is wit' ya bitch nigga

You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on

Why don't you niggas keep ya mouth shut
Without us you clout sucks you doubt us and get ya mouth bust
We veterans and better then you young cheesy cheddar men
Bouncin' across the nation and you home watchin' Letterman
I'm the nigga that got 'em listenin I know it's sickenin'
To know I'm the nigga that got your girlies coochie glistenin'
From listenin' to my shit and when I get her for christenin'
She splits again 'cause I made her spit the nitro glycerin
I'm on you, callin' me a old negro
But I don't know a young nigga that could hold me though
Plus the dough be low, average and I hold the glow
But they want me to fall so they can say ""I told you so""
But if I'm mutli punks would say I just lucked up
Keep talkin' that shit might getcha fucked up
You some Jimmy Rucker, Tommy Tucker type of muthafuckas
Glamorize and specialize in gettin' butt fucked
Niggas think they dope then gonna try to check me
I'm here to let yo ass know you need to respect me
'Cause although you ain't sayin' shit you gettin' on my nerves
I'ma keep on keepin' on mufucka that's word

You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on

They say I don't fit in

You can say what you wanna
I'ma come up from a

Can’t Stand Me,Klusterfuk,2012.0,"Nueve!

The rapper you gotta have in your chatter
You be gathering data, to mom and dad it's a matter
Cause they lad is fanatical, for this Vladic, this radical
Add a skill that brings avid adolescents to drag us
Everywhere in there beats by, they be loving the speech
I teach my beast, I eat when records released by
They favorite artist, invaded they hardest
The way that it started, my latest they'd have paid it regardless
Ever been to a Tech show? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
Then why you stopping and popping me out the deck for?
Hear that I got the best flow? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
Granny clipping, tripping with Ellie and Jethro
For listenin' to my music they choose it, they use it
As therapy they're on me when I do this, they lose it
Mom and daddy wanna ban me, I'm loud like a wild banshee
I'm rowdy and antsy, maybe that's why they can't stand me for real

These are people who can't stand me
Your mama, your daddy, your greasy-ass granny
Who be callin' me uncanny
Your mama, your daddy, your greasy-ass granny
They tell you: (""I'm no good to you,"" but you don't listen to me
I'm the one you love, but your people can't stand me)

She knew this rap kid was a stack getta
But dad lit up, when he saw that the kid was a black nigga
And she's a wack bitch, if you fight back with her
And her mama's mad sick, cause the lad's dick is from Africa
That's why they always act shady, we splat babies right at Brady's
That's maybe the worst for a white lady, that's racy
No longer match-makey, when the blacks
Attack wack, they be watchin' the mac lately
Ever been with a black dude? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
You're prolly thinkin' we all weed and tattoos
Ever thought white and black's cool? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
That's cause you think your daughters' gettin' her back bruised
Your mom's in your business, she's in your business
Can't you see she wants you to keep us niggas at a distance?
Separation existin', and here's cold
This story took place when I was 16 years old, yo

Que soy malo para ti

When I was approached by a lady trying to blend me proper
When she asked if I really was the king of the choppers
Bitch, I'm Mufasa

Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing

Aye
With this bimbo, hit this indo
Said she wanna give me hella vicious then go
'Bout to make the music crescendo
So don't nobody hear me knock it out with the quickness Kimbo
So I had to get the bitch's info
The top was mental, lovely ladies suck it, stay silento
Resemble monkey wrench though
I don't need your credentials
We men though
Leave you in light and leave you in limbo
She chose
N9ne I'm impossible to figure and decode
She wanna really welcome me to the freak show
She fuck with the homies, Sav Siccness and Bleezo
She said that both of my homies they gave her the heave ho
But she ain't never had me killin' it befo'
So I gave her the meat and it was more than Rodigo
She coming to every blur party we throw
(Tim Tebow)
Fakers be oozing illusions
They said they banging; but they moving and grooving
That's why the ladies want the dude with the fusion
Of indica oil and Keith who'd'n and coolin'
Stuffed and puffed like a Cuban
You trippin', she left with us
You get bruised and contusions
Used and abused and fooled
Cos' Tecca N9na, she choosin'

Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down

You know I hold it down

Still wave my finger to the cops

Let me know if you down
I see you choosing

Aye
Choosin' me because I make a knot
Wanna eat my dick up like a brat
They niggas hope that Tecca Nina rot
They never close enough to get a shot
'Cause I be chilling way up at the top
But we never too comfortable and thinking it won't pop
You can bet that the heaters on my family stay cocked
And my governors ready for the petty who said he hot
'Cause I beat, beat, beat, beat, beat her
With the d and not D Jeter
Then I found out she a queef skeeter
When I mixed OJ with the Beef-eater
Your girly's punani it was a deep greeter
Coming at me you'll be a hit by the peace bleeder
I'm a beast I beat beep and she's cheater
She want me in her mouth, I will at least feed her
You know the rules of the game
Your bitch just chose me
We can handle this like we got some class or
Get into the gangster shit if you tripping low-key
Women is never nothing to steal
When you making hella bread and you go from here to Brazil
So you gotta know I'm the nigga that she wanna get to for big thrills for real

Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down

Look at him flashing the signing bonus on the 'Gram like he making it (Yeah)
Been bogie though, him so below figures
Then yield the dough when OVO them, those Pinocchio niggas
Be lying like a rug, he rhyme like a thug, behind brother love
Design quite a buzz, the people get blind by the mug
That's a put on, the imminence front, when it gets funk
Him and his feminists finna get intimate, and a bitch live in this punk
Be yourself
Why he got to act like he solid when he gon' melt?
Don't undo your belt 'cause under your khakis they see your welts
Killed shine, exposing your chilled spine

Fucks given, yeah we do
Sucks, yes, when they busting 'bout success and it's evil
Two and a ten, it ain't equal, pulling a stunt on the people
Give 'em what they want 'cause they so want it blunt that they don't even know that's see-through
Better hide wills when they see you, half mil', it ain't legal
Or a nigga like Trick Trick, Muggs, Big U, so they won't leak you
I see these niggas on IG
Money phones, money long when the camera on
Might be they figures, it might be
Well don't trick, me and N9na drip with no jewelry on

When I bomb and get this low level reconnaissance
Nothing left but a padlock cash box
When a nigga brag lots, ass shots
He the funny man, he mascot, that mosque
Talking 'bout they got a backdrop, a half knot
They tell you fake it to make it
To chase it is basic, so you take it and rape it
You wake in the matrix
With the ape, it's the hate that you place, it can take it to break it
So not a soldier
Who let you come walk in the culture?
You psycho for talking to Oprah
'Cause you niggas is softer than boba
Nigeria day upon these delirious race of dummies
A serious way to come, she suspiria de profundis

Wonder if they comin' for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
And will I ever grow old?

I 'member them high nights, on X we find sites
To climb heights, unheard to man we lined white
Molly up it had to be non-flight
Mix it with weed and wet it's chronkite
That shits beyond hype
Spittin' somethin' we be trippin', seeing some shit
And it's fuckin' up the buzz of me and the clique
So we hop up in the whip and flee with the quick
But the shadow make us swerve and we on the strip
Did you see the shit? (Yeah I saw the shit)
Did y'all see the shit? (Yeah we saw the shit)
All agree that a shadow was crossin' the street
Then immediately vanished we need a hit

I see shadows on the road again
Wonder if they comin' for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
And will I ever grow old?

Is it comin' for me because of all the shit
That I did in the past was bad to people
Mad and evil, 
if you're the A.O.D. I'm sad to meet you
Angel of death when I quit doin' X
Because of seeing you every night on the stretch
So I've been clean for three years
And counting still I'm seeing shadows will they scheme for me
To follow them into the pit of despair
Punishment for what I did in this lair
What if evil spirits live in the road
To take the kindred spirits' polluted souls
I don't know how the spirit thing goes
Real or livin' in my frontal lobe
Will I be livin' life until I'm old?
Or will I be takin' by shadows on the road?

I see shadows on the road again
Wonder if they comin' for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
And will I ever grow old?

I be coming home from the studio
Seventy East real real late, you know?
Damn I see like a shadow walk right in front of the car
Like what the hell, you know I be trippin' man
Like I thought I just saw something
Swerve real quick, good thing there ain't no other cars on the road
Fucked yourself up
And I be thinking like the people that wrecked on the side of the road or something
You see those crosses and their names and the roses and you be thinking it might be their spirits
I don't even know if most spirits exist
I don't even know, I don't know what the hell happened man
Is still haunts me to this day if it is a spirit or whatever it is

Never anywhere near you
They wanna really adhere to the negative
Really competitive and never near true
Up to date shit, face it, your replacement's
Everything but basic laid tricks, flake and fake bitch
You can be so righteous
And totally cleansed from all your previous ho vices
Until she gets friended and all your exes throw ice picks
Oh Christ, it's no niceness
They gonna send her fake baby pictures in yo' likeness

Yeah, so many different flavors
So many different haters
They just after my paper
Bye-bye, see you later
I need me more acres, yeah
So they cannot chase us
While I'm gettin' my cake up (Monjo)

H.O.B
They keep on following me
Don't know why they'll never leave
I think they love me, oh yeah
H.O.B
'Cause they keep coming back, yeah
They keep coming back, yeah
They keep coming back

I got a history of 'em but yeah I'm never gon' trust 'em
I know I'll never, no way

Won’t You Come Dirty,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"Come on baby, try it
Breathe in baby and I'ma hold them buns sturdy

First thirty minutes it ain't been no hit
Thirty more I'm plopping in your shit

Plop, plop, plop 'til the ground breaks
I'm ground breaking when I fuck I pound great
And she ain't got on no pants, no bra
No stockings, nigga, no gown, nothing
I made that frown straighten
Around eight she sound fake but I hound
Make her go down like she found Satan

'Cause with you, you hella boring so she ain't fluid
But when she with me equivalent to straight sewage
Dirty

I'm a black Jim Morrison
Peep the game from a far away glimpse
If I get it I got it, I'm starring in
A motion picture on foreign rims
Strange lane, I could hardly win
A strange change in a car we in
My chain hang through the hearts of men
It's the same thing at the bar again
Strangeland, more women than men
From strange hands, they be giving me gin
My plane land about a quarter to ten
My game grand, living this sin again and again
Bottles of Henn
Chop the hair off my chinny chin chin
We're wildin' in there, bottles and friends
I'm going to drop the top of the beam on my Benz
My team in my hands, hustling ends
I'm along with you and I'm about to go in
On the phone with you like the back of a 4-10
It's on with you from the beginning to the end
You look like some twins but really some tens
I keep them clean, blowing smoke in the wind
On a porch with kin and that's pimp the kin
Or Mr. Snoop my pimping friend, yeah

Won't you come dirty?
Won't you come, won't you come dirty?
Won't you come, won't you come dirty?
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come dirty?

Just let that pootie, pootie drown me
Won't you come dirty?
Hey, won't you come, won't you come, won't you come dirty?
Hey, won't you come?

Well she if come then she eager for the front stroke, back stroke
Deep throat strap and the camel toe swoll
Getting dirty is our motto
Baby girl looking like a model
Very hard act to follow
Got a new shift kick with that throttle
And she swallows
Baby got a mouthpiece swallow
Girls girls they swallow
Got them and done them since Carolina Colorado
Feeling like I won the lotto
Two bad bitch, mulatto
Baby come drown me
Squirt on me today and tomorrow
I'll take that
And when I pull your hair you take that
And I'm a smack that ass you take that
Start cumming in your legs
Get shaken and shaking (ha!)
Callin' her a sexual addict a fanatic
In the pussy enthusiastic
Gotta have it (ha!)

Won't you come dirty?
Won't you come, won't you come dirty?
Won't you come, won't you come dirty?

No Gun Control,The Storm,2016.0,"You motherfuckers keep talking about gun control
First off I'm tired of being controlled
I'm tired of you motherfuckers trying to control me and mine
You better get your motherfucking weapon
'Cause motherfucker I got mine
And I'm not scared to use it, they're not scared to use it
So motherfucker get prepared
'Cause it's 'bout that time to prove it
We're trapped off in these fucked up gutters
Everyday preparing for war
So motherfucker get ready for it
It's about that time to even the score

We on
If you ever test us we swarm
So the devilish best be warned, reform these Don peons
Who keep a lot of artillery
Then taking all of the hate
Applyin' to race
Then innocents get a taste
So take a bullet to liberate, off in the trigger state
We stock up to be with the free, locked up to these pop up
When they tryna penetrate it; we boss up
Don't wanna have to do it but indeed shot ya
How many more people gonna fall from this evil?
It'll never stop 'cause we don't care if it's illegal
But the weapons charges foul and fecal
When the demon is coming after you with a plan to deceive you

Just because we're carrying guns don't mean we wanna use them
People abuse 'em, yeah we all losin'
Look at (you!) 'Cause they all shooting
Uhh, hey, yeah everybody shooting
Uhh, and you should be scared of us
Ahh, they scared of us
'Cause we out of control
We ain't got no gun control

Feeling nervous, got a little trouble on my mind
I can turn a murder around and turn death fear to it
Now damn near do it
Think it's exposed
Just 'cause I'm sagging my clothes and tagging my toes
And beat the peace out of peaceful nigga
Thanks for yanking the breaks off a gangster hate officers
Got a lot of mo', I got a lot of mo'
I see Trump’s got a lot of votes
America is a salad bowl
And you can put the dressing on it
Chop it up and fool a lot of folks
If it's coming my way after trunk 'cause the Trumpers get carried away and I'm thumpin' my thumper 'cause gum bumpin' don't mean nothing if people is out of control

Just because we're carrying guns don't mean we wanna use them
People abuse 'em, yeah we all losin'

So you’re telling your girls the game we play

Rock & Roll Nigga,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Gimme some guitar, K.Lloyd!
Yeah, I like that, keep going mayne
Rock and roll, baby!
Yo, we gon' get real drunk to this one
So, if you wanna get knocked over
Get the hell out the mosh pit, baby
'Cause we 'bout to go, okay

I like big booty bitches, rappin' and Lynyrd Skynyrd
Cases of beer cold as a Kansas City winter
Drink to get drunk then find a chick and put dick off in her
Then make her take me shopping for kicks at Harold Pener
My family gave me rock, my family gave me rap
The streets gave me guap, the streets gave me straps
Black bitches fuck me, white bitches love me
Trust me I do 'em both at the same time rough as rugby
Do 'em both to Bon Jovi and then to Public Enemy
Energy in me definitively, I'm on Hennessey, then I'm on Jimmy B
I used to have red spikes at raves
Then turn around havin' blue and red fights with K's
Your parents got a cold shiver
'Cause a pot of gold hit a father gorilla, that's a dollar go-getta
And he's an awesome flow spitter
Your daughter goes with a guy who loathes millers
Why?

'Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga
They don't understand me, God naturally tanned me
You don't like it, I can be a nigga
Rockin' 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin'
When they eyes hit this rock and roll nigga (Hell yeah!)
And I ain't changin', got my Slipknot bangin
And I swear to God I ain't never ever giving up
Fried chicken wings and Coors Light, nigga what?

High school hung with a white bruja
Came home then I went straight to Jumu'ah
Then after that I put back on my red puma
Then bark at a chick the same height and color as Uma
And we get the lead out to Zeppelin we blow the bed out
Got a call from one of the homies in trouble so yo we sped out
Got to the hood and found a rivalry took his head out
We had to show them evil motherfuckers what that red 'bout
Until we find the killers you know we will search
For those who kill first we gon' let the steel squirt
And this mentality's valid because we real hurt
To ease the pain I listen to Geddy, Alex and Neil Peart
Growin' up it was a chore, 'cause I gravitated towards stuff the homies ignored
Like trippin' off Bad Brains when on my skateboard
Even more, I named my gangsta rap label after The Doors!

'Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga
They don't understand me, God naturally tanned me
You don't like it, I can be a nigga
Rockin' 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin'
When they eyes hit this rock and roll nigga (Hell yeah!)
And I ain't changin', got my Slipknot bangin
And I swear to God I ain't never ever giving up
Fried chicken wings and Coors Light, nigga what?

My momma made me, raised me, played me 80's, made me crazy
My father played me crazy, made me aid me vaguely praised me
But I'm a real with a lot of will
Remember I would kill for a dollar bill
But that all changed with Strange, man I gotta deal
Like every scholar in the game, got a lot of mill
Still a riot maker fuckin' bring the house down
Who that gang bangin' rocker with the loud sound
That's Tecca Nina with the shit that make them broads hound
Telekinesis with my speeches get them drawers down
And that goes for the grand dragon daughters too (Whoah)
And the Neo-Soul conscious chicks they wanna swallow who? (N9ne!)
The show gritter and yo little low wigger
Better not be caught with no sitter

'Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga
They don't understand me, God naturally tanned me
You don't like it, I can be a nigga
Rockin' 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin'
When they eyes hit this rock and roll nigga (Hell yeah!)
And I ain't changin', got my Slipknot bangin
And I swear to God I ain't never ever giving up

Feels Like Heaven,Something Else,2013.0,"Thinking back to all the bad I did (bad I did)
How I was young and evil as a kid (as a kid)
Ok, I'm better now, I ask the reverend (ask the reverend)
Cause of my hell
Will I go because the life I'm livin' feel like heaven (feel like heaven)

Grown better man still I'm in my gang attire
Does not mean I'm going to be cast into a ring of fire
Does it? If so them words you speak I can't admire
The evil's in my past but today the saint is ours
Get and give a lot of love, guess my Allah just follows us
I was stuck, taught us, now we caught up in goddish hugs
Everywhere we go, there he go, went from very low
To unnecessary owes when he carries flows over the stereo
I'm, on my 7 all because of rhyme
But because I played the 6 once upon a time
The reverend says my worldly ways I need to deaden
But I can't tell because this life I'm living feel like heaven

Is it heaven, or is my head up in the clouds
Is there hell for me, cause I feel like we made it out
I put my halo on but then, it done came off again
You don't need eyes to see, that this could be our only heaven

So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down

It's funny, and when I think I'm up there...
They say I fais le cul to much
But they just déjà vu too much
Caught up in the antics
Yeah I'm tied to you because I was thinking semantics
So is it dependent on what your heaven is?
Or how big your 6 and 7 is?
Everything preaches to you, you decipher who the reverend is
This verse is speaking to the ones seeking peace in any form
Far from norm' imaginations, the brain rains when it storms
You say names then it forms, manifest things that were foreign
To you once upon a time no coincidence is gonna rhyme
Make sense in a normal line
Of words you learned them at the time and they remain timeless
Feeding of the dreams that you promised
Before niggas knew you were prominent and dominant
And all those powerful words that back then, to be honest
Were just nouns and verbs; the looks on the astonished
Are normal by now I seen them same faces when I was in Spiderman pajamas

So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down

Heaven or hell?
I never thought that this could be so real
I never thought that I would ever build
My own heaven

So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down

I remember back in the day I had this song called ""My Own Hell.""
It was depressing
But since then, I've created my own heaven, baby!
And it's beautiful!

Incredibly no one deaded me when it was lead at these red Dickies
Nobody beheaded me, let it be, said I'm breaded B
Real light, within darkness I still fight it
But if heaven is love, then this sure in the hell feel like it!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-feels-like-heaven-lyrics

I'ma leave it on the flo' (Leave it)

Who's this opp tryna lose his thoughts?
Not Alzheimer's, but y'all mind us when the tool gets popped
Then all kinda dudes get dropped when they choose this plot
You just watch what I heard 
when the music stopped

Got this fully automatic causing static
Everybody just get on the floor
Anything goes, no foolery
Give us your jewelry, wallets, and give us the dough
This ain't a hoax, I'm ready for war
I'ma settle the score and then split through the door
All of these women are trippin'
I think they been sniffin' up coke, bring me the blow
I'ma need all y'all phones out now
You can set 'em all down right in front of you (Now)
For my accomplice, if y'all pop shit
Then you gettin' hit up with a slug or two
Bullets'll body you, that's what this gun'll do
If any one of you think you can fuckin' move
This shit ain't funny, just give up the money
And if you get lucky, my buddy'll cut you loose
Ask that freak slut with the D-cups
What she's hiding up under her titties
It looks like a key to a safe
I ain't leavin' this place 'til we find it, then shit's gettin' litty
I feel no pity, sin city
My trigger finger been gettin' so itchy
She better give up the code or get hit up for sho'
And no, I don't think that you're pretty
Oh, that's your girl on the floor, girl?
Keep talkin' shit, there'll be no girl
What can I say? I don't come here to play
Fuck you to your face, it's a cold world
Tell the DJ not to be brave
Or I'm takin' his 
tables
 for keepsakes
Y'all keep playin', but I need 
cake
Like every day is my b-day (Haha)
This the part I let you know that there's a twist in this plot
The stickup is hot, but the truth is I ain't pissed off at y'all
I figured I'd just take your shit when I'm here, so thanks, guys

So drop the Luger, my dragon's flames is as hot as Koopa's
This how I'ma do ya, move and you fucked like the Kamasutra

I know grimy boosters who pushin' weight like some kind of movers
Called, they might remove ya, so move unless you kinda stupid
Touch my G, you dyin', don't try it, don't test this kind of movement

Dead shot like a zombie gettin' needles
Hell nah, I ain't 'bout to ever leave you
Less talk, Tech, I'm 'bout to get this weasel
Sounds hella evil, but don't step to people
When there's something wrong with they brain
I'm just tryna make sure my nigga leave in the same way that he came

Let's get the fuck on
My nigga proceeded to bust chrome when the dust gone
Never trippin' 'cause nothin' was crushed on
Now the cut flown 'til we touch home
But these fools wanna squeeze tools
But we speed through what they feed to
The B dude with the cheese move
So they greet gruel, tryna seek food
Chose N9na for the dinner date (Chyeah)
Tryna get away from the heat, we switchin' lanes on the interstate
Clout-chasing ass motherfuckers wanna take my name and break my fame (Chyeah)
Wanna be funny because I make my chains and I state my claim
When I hate, try game (Chyeah), I'ma be killing 'em when I take my aim (Chyeah)
Pass me that so I can end the (Chyeah) energy trying to hinder
When the punks approach, a nigga fend off
Fin' to buss on demons out the window
Injure any demon, I'ma beast 'em (Chyeah)
Do what I do and decease 'em
They better flee from killers, no weak ones
Attitude 'cause I never got a threesome
By the power of my dead niggas, take lead, nigga (Die)
Never stop me when the bullets fly
No matter how hard you try
Fucking weaklings felt the real fire my heat brings
They flipped over the guardrail
And wrapped around the concrete T-beam

Sweatin' so much, I got soaked drawers (

That's prolly why you just penny pushin' and I'm bigger
So you hate on me 'cause you lack paper and I'm gritter
With two Biancas upon my arms like

Oh my goodness is they talkin' shit again?

Haters keep wi-di-shin' I'ma take a loss but I'm finishin'
Killer but scriller just like

no limits then
I aim for digits, 100 percent of my people came to get it
He used to be bigger but then became a midget
Taken out of the game, livin' lame and livid
So we gotta hate on the next man, 'cause he don't got the money
We left 'em at the bottom and now he's the ex Tech fan
Get the fuck outta my face, I'm winnin' it's not a mistake
You gotta be hot at me sittin' watchin' me ex-pand
You take falls, I take her and take draws
They give you the wait stall, they give me the mate calls (Oh Baby!)

Get outta here before you get punished and penalized
I've been advised to stay in this lane homie
I swear when I rap I say it's not a thang phony
I'm icy, I'm shinin' though I ain't got a chain on me
Even when I'm inside of this booth I keep my thang on me
And when it rains on me I don't complain homie
Eliminate the prob so I don't have the strain on me

Despite what they be sayin' I just can't seem to stop
Gettin' this guap I got a lot, partner I'm almost to the top
I gotta cop new watch or fresh grill and new clothes
I'm tryin' to come down candy low sideways on foes
I gotta get that bread it be money over these hoes
'Cause my fans be turnin' into foes and harsh words lead to blows
They mad at me 'cause I'm the shit while they just shit
And I get up off my ass and get it while they just sit
They upset 'cause I'm gettin' bread while they layin' in bed
Even though I started off at the bottom I'm hundred miles ahead
They steady be talkin' blind on me, tryin' to slander my name
'Cause I'm the man mayne, but they washed up down the drain
They hate me 'cause they ain't me but please make no mistake

Cursed,Anghellic,2001.0,"I was born in '71, in '72 I started to walk
'73, '74, in '75 I learned to talk
'76 I tried sexin', that was around the age of five
'77, '78 and '79 I started to ride with my Uncle Ike
In '80 and '81 I was about ten
But the first time a little chick made me cum
Was '82 or '83 my life really came alive
In '84 I was thirteen, but (1985's the number!)

I met this bitch
Who told me if I got tight with her, together we would grow rich
Type of chick that'll make a brother feel good inside
In my mind when I sleep woke, when I walk, when I ride
Gettin' to me in the classroom
Used to follow me into the bathroom and I loved it
She was wild and everyday (People bore me)
Captivate, activate my hormones when you speak to me softly
Offer me a piece of you 'cause (Me so horny)
She let me foreplay and that's it
She said if I would rap and make some dollars for us maybe I can get a hit
I was writin', then I found myself fightin' for the juices
When I found out that our little agreement's non-exclusive (Ah, damn)
She let celebrity status hit, so I'm thinkin' of tactics
How to leave ran down prophylactics on the mattress
So I practice, hopin' to stuff my fat dick in this rap bitch
Knowin' when I put my cactus in that catfish I'mma flat shit
She's turnin' me into a (Killa!)
Devour fools, I'm powerful like (Mechagodzilla!)
She said if I keep rappin' she'll keep clappin', but ain't nobody strappin'
'Til she see paper and then we'll see what's happenin', and I hear her say

You heard of Tech, he's like the best
He built his nest in the Midwest
The boy can flow and he be bustin' like
Boom, boom
It's like I'm stuck, I feel I'm cursed
About to load the Nina Tech 'cause in a sec
I'm finna be bustin' like

I'm finna be bustin' like

'93 she invited me to a party in L.A
So popular, she introduced me to 2Pac the next day
She took me to this party in Beverly Hills
Where me and Chris Tucker couldn't get in
Because of our ball caps and they was all about dollar bills
She was a G and got us all in for free (Ran into Pac again)
She talked about him so tough I knew she was (Cockin' him)
But I never did hate, because I knew heated sex was our fate
As I got clever and a lot better
She started lettin' me and my boys hit together
Me and Pac hit the slot, now it's out in the open
Didn't take long to make her get it on
Came so strong, and ""Thugs Get Lonely Too"" was our slogan
She wanted me and Chino XL, but he backed off and said: ""That's hell""
He don't dip into every female waitin' to exhale with a wet tail
Wish I could be with baby daily
But I recall The Veteran Click sayin': ""Tech, don't turn a tramp into yo lady""
I don't know why I want this bitch, she always diss
And won't let me showcase my shit, this bitch is driving Nina crazy

You heard of Tech, he's like the best
He built his nest in the Midwest
The boy can flow and he be bustin' like
Boom, boom
It's like I'm stuck, I feel I'm cursed
About to load the Nina Tech 'cause in a sec
I'm finna be bustin' like

Fuck this, I'm ready for one on one ruckus
Still she like: ""Don't touch this"" when I'm alone with her
It's on when the bone hit her, get her
Hoeing off in L.A. with my folks
Me and Yuk, Phats, Gonz, L.Q., Max Key
Hella knocking your back out, bitch, long strokes
You a nympho, who the pimps though? (Me and Roger Troutman)
Had you at Juan Momma house (Shoutin')
Through the talk box you exhaust cocks
And you ought not ever get caught hot
Why she always gotta have the vault lock
Kinda mad when I really thought back
Me and RZA hit that ass on the video set Why did we hit (Raw)
Bitch told us how she fucked Eminem, Kool G
KRS, Monch, Xzibit and (All) type a niggas
When Felony fucked he said: What-what-what-what?
I was next in line right after he busted his nut-nut-nut-nut
I heard my homey Rodney say she want me and Lynch to hit
Sac and MO dick and she said she wanted it so bad 'cause we so sick
I saw you at 92.3 The Beat with Jay-Z and Damon
I know at times I'm hella complex, but now I'mma put it in lamens
I wanna fuck you not with Jimmy Jam, not with Terry Lewis
Not with Quincy Jones, not with QD3, just me and you
And I'mma show you all the things that I can do
Go platinum plus get trapped in your lust
So I'm hoping me and you can (Bang, bang!)
I know you're a groupie ho, but I still want your coochie though
Before I go I want you to tell these people yo name: (""Rap Game"")",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-cursed-lyrics
DKNY,Klusterfuk,2012.0,"A young lady was talking to me the other day
Asked me if I heard a new song called B.O.B
(Battery Operated Boyfriend)
And when I think about it from as far back as I can think
Almost every woman I can remember had one
But I ain't the kind of nigga that just take that lightly like
""Oh, that's nothing, that's normal for a woman to have a dildo""
My mind goes to, ""Why do they need it?""
Cause we absent, then I ask myself why are we absent
Then I think about us being taking into slavery
Where learning to read was forbidden
Can't read, won't have a proper education
No proper education, can't get a proper job
Don't have a proper job, don't have money to live and eat
Gotta eat to live so you do the only other thing you know
That'll definitely put food on the table, hustle dope on the streets
Hustle dope, might have to kill another nigga
Kill somebody, go to the Feds
Go to the Feds for ever ever ever, get to sleeping with them boys
Do that, might contract aids
Get out, give that to your woman
She give it to the next nigga
You and that nigga start funking
One of the niggas kill the other
Then it's the same cycle all over again
We absent, dead or in jail
No, I ain't that kind of nigga

I am not a cryin' bitch, I get up out to try and grit
Put my thoughts on tape, I sell it then I'mma get to buyin' shit
Made it up out the lions pit, no fuckin' denying this is
Some high and mighty spit, 
I'm rhymin' in the year the Mayans writ
Destruction, introductions to new Front men
Working for the government, snups and lust they trust in
I was in the Gulf when US had a bust reduction
But for the soldiers stuffed in dust, we gotta turn up the cups then
And party with they families, we kickin' it to anarchy
We granted these insanities The kid would get humanity
Vanishing is who standing in vanity
Damn it, B-L-double-O-D you scammed that T, you die under canopy
I don't, trip off what another nigga do
And I don't, lip off to another niggas' crew
If I ain't got a trigger to I'm tryin' to live a few
They say do your thang, you different kind of nigga, you

Close to my ragin', far from a jiggaboo
Do your thing, you different kinda nigga, you
Over came the shit that they be giving you
Do your thing you different kinda nigga, you
Close to my ragin', far from a jiggaboo
Do your thing, you different kinda nigga, you
Over came the shit that they be giving you
Do your thing you different kinda nigga, you

I'm a different, B-R double-E D
And I live it, see the people lovin' on me
And I give it, my heart away including the arteries
I don't be hollow boy like me if you ain't watersoluble
I do's it, how you gonna change the game
If you ain't got game changin' music
And I lose it, whenever niggas ain't the same
And they plain Jane and April Fools it
I beastly slipped and like my sides is greasy
Till the industry on the eyes I ain't so easy
Lookin' at me like a leper,
 now they lovin' the keffer
Lookin' like I'll never make it, lookin' like salt and pepper
While my music's so Sebastian Bach
When the world ain't thinkin' like I'm thinkin'
Better dummy it up but the cash is stopped
I gotta smash it a, Asher Roth that'll shake the spot
There's only so much time in this song, and I've got to say a lot
Tryin' to get paper fore the paper stop, I'll make a plot
To make my bank account look like Vegas minus the beggin' twat
It's effortless for me to pepper it, with cleverness
But they just gimme a glimpse of the pimps who's they be steppin' in
Got 'em guessing what I'm finna (Do)
Never change my lyrics (To)
Be jeffin' with you jigga (Boo)
Different kinda nigga (You)

Close to my ragin', far from a jiggaboo
Do your thing, you different kinda nigga, you
Over came the shit that they be giving you
Do your thing you different kinda nigga, you
Close to my ragin', far from a jiggaboo
Do your thing, you different kinda nigga, you
Over came the shit that they be giving you

Can’t Shake It,Killer,2008.0,"Another piece that I wrote, about me
Being stuck in my ways, yeah

And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
(I just can't change what I am)

What did I do to be so wrong?
Could I be so different?
Is there a remedy?
Will you be forgivin' me?
'Cause this ain't my life
Or the way it was supposed to be
Waiting here for you to come and tell me
What I do so wrong?

Listen to me, this talent was given to me
By his omnipotence, so dig it
Music is livin' through me
Even through prisons I've arisen he big and is in movies
Is him as if his is a hit, the vision is in beauty for women
When I'm writin' I'm winnin', so excitin' I'm grinnin'
Then you strike and now the fights are beginnin'
I gotta be sharp as a knife when I'm on the mic and you sinnin'
By stiflin' my spinnin', what imaginary life has you been in?
By thinkin' you be the reason, no speakin' to you this evenin'
I'm deep in this music reachin' for the piece I dilute the season
But you be illin' because my attention you truly stealin'
Pursue the millions, come in second-would you be willin'?
Don't think so, you be thinkin' time and I think dough
Love is what you need from me, but in time it'll shrink mo'
'Cause I be on the grind for this rhyme and the ink flow
I go for mine and you think it's a crime, and I think ""WHOA""

And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
(I just can't change what I am)
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
(I just can't change what I am)

Everything in my closet is black, white and red
Most of my homies was bosses but got life or dead
Now I move in they shadows but I got the mic and bread
But this life it seem ya destiny is a knife or lead
Yes I was brought up in a Christian house
But my mother marrying a Muslim threw the Christian out
And what they did to Malcolm X threw the Islam out
So my homies with money seemed to be the glistenin' route
What I found was funerals and I found it was real friends
But I paid attention and then I found it was real men
Takin' care of their families automatically built in
Riskin' they life in the street as long as the wheel spin
So, what I gathered from it is simply my prerogative
I only wish the organization was more positive
I maintain, and continue to gain thangs
I bust and I claim Strange but I'm reppin' the gang bang

And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
(I just can't change what I am)
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it

Fuck ’Em Girl,Everready [The Religion],2006.0,"Whoo, all my ladies all around the world
Get fresh and new dress
To get your man it's the fuck 'em girl
It's Friday night, just got paid
She's lookin' for a little bit of action captain to get saved

So you go straight to the mall and call your girlfriend up
Tell her you bought a fuck 'em dress
Nothing less-more-than-a thinner-sinner-Chris Dior fitter
You gotcha hair did or that there wig
Sho a fitter got your own sitter for that there kid
She's goin' out to find a thick stout to out her dig
That dress' fittin' catcher's mitten is out there big
She manicured and pedicured up and lookin' like you wanna
Your man's hittin' your phone up, say fuck 'em if you wanna
Lip gloss is on her blow that mirror a kiss and if your man
Got you stressin' put on your dress and don't listen and sing
I can't wait til I get there, step in the club lookin' player player
Grab your keys and beat it to the spot where you guess you'll
Find you a nigga buyin' a two for one special
Exceptional sexual healin' is what your cravin'
Your man pagin' you, but fuck how he's feelin'
 (2X)
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
It's your time to get out
No time for thinkin' of 'em

Now this is a story, all about how
These chicks get tricked and don't know how
So I'd like to take a second and explain to them
How all this craziness evolves out of relationships, listen
He never used to hit you, he always used to treat you
With some respect and dignity, and now he wanna beat you
Six months done passed and he's changed
You never would have thought he'd be crazy and deranged, huh
Just the way he approached was so sweet
He let you know you was far away from a (Late night creep)
Mister telephone man when he what'nt with you
Bobby Browny and Whitney, you found you a new edition
Right in the beginning it was grinings from the sit down
'Til he let you know that it was all on a bitch now
When, after you had you a baby, he wanna start
Arguing his excuse to start sipping the Remy Mar-
-Tin, darkening this relationship
Now every lady grab your bics if you relate to this
You need to get up out those drawers
And put on some lip gloss, throw on a thong
Now make your way to the closet and
 (2X)

Feel like I was put here for the female species
Hella listening watching whispering offerings no feces
When the back is obese we double back and go deeply
In her life in her mind never hate but'll go extra time if need be
Easy for me to connect so peep me
In the club I take her some place we can talk discretely
You're creep free definitely that heats me
Your body's wop bobba lu bop so hot baby teach me
How to get up inside it ride it, chakras are now ignited
That's a beautiful smile, don't hide it
Getting Tech the N9ne excited
Stress free I bet she so Nestle
Wanna know how wicked the sex be don't test me
Drink your drink eat your cherry and tie the stem
This is your world mommy ain't said a damn thing about him

Seven Words,Killer,2008.0,"Welcome to The Sextion, where it's all about sex
If horny is what you're looking for, well this is the place
The Sextion
Now, for your listening pleasure
This is Tech N9ne, Skatterman and Krizz Kaliko with seven words
How many words?
""One, two, three, four, five, six, seven""

It's seven words I wanna say to you
""Love it when you suck my dick""
It's the best thing in my world
It's seven words I wanna say to you
""Love it when you suck my dick""
Girl, it's why I'm giving you seven words

You should look at this as a wonderful endeavour
The pleasure of having a bitch go below the belt for treasure
No pressure, I know you shy and I ain't tryna stress ya
Can I undress ya? And get ya to swallow each and every measure?
Damn! You put the ""whore"" in hormones, I might just bust before long
Let's take a pic in your phone of you taking more and more dome
Do it but don't pinch me, don't chew it when you think me
Get fluid then you sink me, 'cause you got to/two it just like pinky
I really love it when you put the hot water in your mouth
Slurping and slobbering about, now it gets hotter in the south
Yep, the water was blazing, it was amazing
And now my dick is shriveled up like a raisin'
You love my leg in third, 'cause I'm blessed with heaven's curve
And I equal the thrill and rush of having sex on X and herb
Never get the lesson blurred, I'd like to rest in her
But not before I issue baby doll my seven words

It's seven words I wanna say to you
""Love it when you suck my dick""
It's the best thing in my world
It's seven words I wanna say to you
""Love it when you suck my dick""
Girl, it's why I'm giving you seven words

For the sake of argument, let's say we call her ""Ol' Girl""
She had the type of lips to make this street nigga's toes curl
It's her world, all I do is kick back, just sit back
She let my zipper down and pulled the head out and licked that
She licked that, sometimes I had to fight to get my dick back
But baby moved to Minnesota, swear to God I miss that
The way she used to grab and smack herself all in the face with it
Looking at me dead in my eyes while she be tasting it (tasting it)
She used to say ""Daddy, you wasting it"" (wasting it)
I used to say ""Baby, I'm pacing it""
But fuck the hot water shit, she used that crushed ice (crushed ice)
If she sucked your dick once she make you nut twice (nut twice)
She was just that good
I could sell her for a stack to my boys in the hood
So if you got you one of these, keep them faking bitches to the curb
Leave this on her voicemail, all you need is seven words

Now as she sucks my soul, I lick her funky emotions
Piercing all the way into her mind so I can feel what she's thinking
Feel me? I know you do
We're getting closer and closer, eruption is imminent
Climax is closing in on us
If you don't get your hands on me soon, I might disappear
Here is what I been waiting on, the best thing you ever heard
The one, two, three, four, five, six, seven words

It's seven words I wanna say to you
""Love it when you suck my dick""
It's the best thing in my world
It's seven words I wanna say to you
""Love it when you suck my dick""
Girl, it's why I'm giving you seven words

Mmm, mmm, you know what I want you to do, right?
(Yeah, I know what you want me to do)
What's that?
(Do you want it with hot water?)
What's that?
(You mean to tell me freaky ass Tech N9ne ain't never had it with no hot water?)
Nah, show me
(Hold up a second)
What the fuck?
(And then you do it like that)
OK, go ahead... ahh shit, fuck, that's wonderful!

Look What I Did,ENTERFEAR,2020.0,"Strugglin' and I didn't really have nothin'
Then I started mad bussin'
Now the money machine got hella cash gushin'

I come from roaches, hardly no chips
Granny on hocus pocus revelations and giant locusts
Oh shit, we was hopeless, folks just on the broke list
Rogues get loaded and served the bogus with a fo' fifth
My G, I ain't always been super icy
Stealing food in Hy-Vee slyly
I see Nike's on Do The Right Thing with Spike Lee
But I could not buy when the size be pricy, why me?
Then my earth sounded, first round
I put the work down and many mercs counted
Thirst found and in a cursed town
And with a turf crown, I eat a surf sandwich
Turn the page and I'm rocking shows
'Round the flock of hoes and my partner rose
Out the top of Hip-Hop with a lot of dough
And I got the soul like I'm Pappadeaux (Lock and load)
Forgot how many time they tell me I'm Forbes, we sell, we encore
Way back in the day I was like, ""Help me, I'm poor"" (Cha)
Millions all around the world, they took what I hid
Inside, I put it in music, made it, Ma look what I did

Look what I did, yeah, look what I did
We got money all around us, I'm a legend to these kids now
Look what I done, yeah, how far we come
Keep running up the numbers 'til we get to number one
I look where I'm at now, we ain't in the background
Running through the crowd, real proud, got my hat down
Look at where I'm at now, money come in racks now
Never faked it, look, mama I made it, that's a fact now

From the trap to this rap shit, nigga, immortalized
They sayin' that I'm weird, nah, certified
I grew up around G's, shelters and in the P's
Feeling helpless, on my knees, help us, Lord, please
Remember turnin' the light on, watchin' the roaches flee
Used to rock a turtleneck in school, they made fun of me
Used to share sneaks with Meech, just tryin' not to make some creases
My moms been deceased, just tryna live with some peace
No boxes, swear conflict is obnoxious, obnoxious
All that hate you do is toxic, self-made, couple bosses (Ooh)
We got booed, came back, sold out every room
Coachella, one more mixtape, overseas we like The Beatles (Trippy)
Highest nigga in every city, pay dues
Bonnaroo's was splittin' a dollar fifty, I snooze
Still sleep, but our prices are still increasing
Ya geek, and ain't new to this
Used to dream of this and we eatin' now

Look what I did, yeah, look what I did
We got money all around us, I'm a legend to these kids now
Look what I done, yeah, how far we come
Keep running up the numbers 'til we get to number one
I look where I'm at now, we ain't in the background
Running through the crowd, real proud, got my hat down
Look at where I'm at now, money come in racks now
Never faked it, look, mama I made it, that's a fact now

You the weakest link, I'm one with them Kansas City Chiefs
You say I'm one of one, but my whole course a million niggas deep
I only see what I want, I struggle for the freedom, too
If you can take portion, be a force, or will you lead 'em to survivin'?
Don't trouble my soul with problems, I got problems of my own
I thought I would weigh my options, but the truth, man, I was wrong
I covered the game with something to say, raised in the slums and I bumped in the Bay
Rollin' me in and I'm pullin' the pin while you grip the grenade

I'm a big boy, she suck me up and rub my six pack
Niggas sell millions, make millions, never give back
Bone crushers, them copper tops that leave your ribs cracked
Born in the trenches, boy, my first words was ""Click, clack""
Revenges, outsmarting forensics
Relentless intentions until the top spot is relinquished
Boy, your top spot my hit list, sweet tastin' revenge
Victory, this shit's delicious, take your swig from the bottle
Wipin' Hennessy off my whiskers
Hit the block, chop it up, bag it 'til your fingers blister
Tag his toe, dig 'em ditches, clean knife but dirty pistol, woah
Shoot his lights out, pass the pistol like a give-and-go
Last time out but I don't need a coat
Splash brothers, wet 'em up
Hit every sibling and half brother
You're dead as fuck, dead as fuck
Yeah, my orange box cutter, keep the world on rotation
Hitchcock, Leatherface and Freddy, Jason
Blood-soaked clothes, mildew in my basement
Look what I did, what I done just to make it
(Look what I did) Huh, just to make it
Look what I did, what I done just to make it (Lil' bitch)

Look what I did, yeah, look what I did
We got money all around us, I'm a legend to these kids now
Look what I done, yeah, how far we come
Keep running up the numbers 'til we get to number one
I look where I'm at now, we ain't in the background

F.A.N.S.,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Okay this how I know you my real fans if y'all do this
DUH DUH-DUH DUH
TECH N9NE
That's how I know my real fans are in the house!
Yeah
Soowoop
I love you
Kansas City you fuckin' supported me, it started here first nigga
Then it spread to everywhere else nigga
You are the reason that I go everywhere I go
You took me to Switzerland
You took me to Amsterdam, nigga
You took me to Australia
You put me on the fuckin' Paid Dues Festival
You put me on Rock The Bells with Damian Marley and fuckin' Nas
And everybody, thank you to all of my fans

I was down on my luck, out of my bucks, growlin' my gut
While in a rut, how I was smilin' when malice was callin' on up
I was proud and I bust loud and enough to rally them up
My style as a child it was roudy and ruff
Such as life, when the dope ain't sellin', the soap ain't smellin'
Ripe dough ain't swellin', no hope but nope I ain't failing tonight
Entered a contest with nothin' in my palm just
A microphone and god next to Tech to bless and I'm set
I won, the people voted for me to take the pay
Was fate the way it happened the show fell on my graduation day
So I chose the show to go open for
EPMD and Gaume that's how it was suppose to go

I didn't know I was chosen, never expected it
But these people saw it while them other haters rejected it
I tore through the hardest part of this art when most neglected it
I poured out my soul on to the paper and you accepted it

You are my heart, you are my soul
I thank you for all you done for me
You are my art, you are my flow
My fans made it for everyone to see
You are my heart, you are my soul
I thank you for all you done for me
You are my art, you are my flow
My fans made it for everyone to see
(Forever Accepting N9ne's Soul)

In Kansas City, a lot of fans is with me
Started doing shows with crazy flows and it expanded quickly
Tech N9na's band of hippies ran the shit we handed strictly
Outlandish scripts that damaged emcees, ripped these calamitously
And I ain't have nothin', not a cent to my name
Man I just had bussin' I just vent through my brain
When I went through the rain, y'all invented my lane
'Cause you went to the strange events to see strength in my pain
You saved my life, damn, you made my life, grand
I love these times with you all even though it made my wife scram
'Cause of all the time I spent, I grind for thine and rhyme again
I sign your skin and find a friend tonight different kinds of kin
Technicians, Juggalos, Juggalettes, Kottonmouth Kings, and queens
Gangbangers, College Kids, Metal Heads they all seen the dream
Of me being the King, this almost brings a string
Of tears meaning I sing to all of you that's been on my team

You are my heart, you are my soul
I thank you for all you done for me
You are my art, you are my flow
My fans made it for everyone to see
You are my heart, you are my soul
I thank you for all you done for me
You are my art, you are my flow
My fans made it for everyone to see
(Forever Accepting N9ne's Soul)

You took me overseas to Germany and Sweden
Australia, Switzerland, Amsterdam, and Paris I'm seeing
Fans in red clothes in Norway and Spain
In Monaco, we honor those that rep the strange lane
Couldn't ask for a better life or better fam, yeah
My fans they set us right so they get a jam and
All of my heart and soul and confusion ready to start
The pollution bring my art from allusion to me rulin'
And I will never let you down, I swear to you
Industry be aware the clown is up in here to scare a few
And stare at you with a glare that shoos the square that's not aware of Tech
And caribou but all hail the fans up forever there for you

I didn't know I was chosen, never expected it
But these people saw it while them other haters rejected it
I tore through the hardest part of this art when most neglected it
I poured out my soul on to the paper and you accepted it

You are my heart, you are my soul

You are my art, you are my flow
My fans made it for everyone to see
You are my heart, you are my soul
I thank you for all you done for me
You are my art, you are my flow
My fans made it for everyone to see

I'm backstage, right before I go on
And I hear voice screaming my name Tech N9ne, Tech N9ne
Just me out like I can't believe this is my job, still to this day
When a sixty thousand people out there, no matter how many people out there
I fuckin' love it!

Freaky,Vintage Tech,2005.0,"F-R-E-A-K
This is for my tail clappers
Mail stackers, ass shakers
Cash makers, who blast Vegas
Yo, this is for the freaks baby
Petite ladies, even my cellulite ladies
This is Tech N9ne baby!

When I was 5 years old, my uncle snuck me into a drive in show
Got in without pay I hid between Jimmy and Big Bro
A triple-X flick didn't even know what I was in fo' (Yo)
I seen some things that made me feel kinda funny inside
I seen some things, that my momma wouldn't want me to see at this size
I seen some stuff, homeboys in the back was huffin' and puffin'
Windows foggy, didn't know when I came of age I'd be glutton fo' muffins
Homeboy when I seen this, I really mean this (I was really shocked)
And my teammate was really fiendish (It got really hot)
Feelin' blank and little squeamish (but I didn't want it to stop)
My uncle said ""Dontez, don't piss your pants""
Everybody laughed then proceeded to watch
Went back to school, yo, the next day
Didn't look at homegirls the same way
Started askin' neighbors can their girls come out to play
Instead of hide and go seek, it's hide and go get it with no delay

I grew this thing called freaky all sex
In my brain it was the best thang
I caught it when I was young and ornery
Just a baby havin' nasty dreams
I heard it was a zodiac thing they say (SCORPIOS)
Are known to be freaks
I see somethin' lookin' good I say ""Dwamn!""
And when I see that ass hop I get gee (get gee)

Time kept on movin' and my shell is closed fly
Lookin at young girlies sayin' there tail is swole
I'm already sittin' and hopin' that hell is cold
N9ne lost his virginity when he was 12 years old
To a girl named Marlene, me and her were starving
Fo' each other, under the covers cooped up like sardines
My hard thing started barging
Thought it was retarded, when it spit on her, we started to arguing
Here's a lesson to the young folks, don't try this at home
Don't start it early like Tech N9ne, wait 'til you are grown
When I was in high school I would wake up
In the morning after I'd take a shower
I'd put on a non-lubricated condom, cause it could be on at any hour
In my brain it's like a disease (Disease)
I see a fine girl walkin' by I'm on her like freeze (Freeze, freeze)
I ain't gotta let her know I write hits or I got cheese
All she gotta do is look into my eyes
Get her hypnotized and watch her open them L.E.G.s


Nowadays I'm off up in adult clubs I cannot shake it
Pretty women I wanna give 'em mo' love, I cannot fake it
Freaky vibe bitches got me up in Lustland, that's where you bring us
Got me lovin' really big butts and that cunnilingus
I still be watchin' pornos, eatin' Digornos
My hormones been runnin' wild since the day that I was born-o
Tossed you, won't get off you, in the kitchen I'mma post you
On the sink we breakin' dishes Micheal Douglas and Glenn Close ya
Do you really wanna get up in a bed wit a psycho sex fiend
If you never wanna do it in the flesh we can do it in a wet dream
I'mma get up in your brain on pain, it will be me and you (Cha-cha)
In a minute before I get in it, I'll tell you boo what I really wanna do
I wanna

Throw you on the bed, rip all your clothes off quick
Six nine fellatio while the wolfman licks
Make it till ya get one, then with a devil's eye
We fuck and it feels so good that it makes you wanna cry

The Long Way,The Storm,2016.0,"(Tech Nina, lets get it)
Mama told me get it and I did
Make a beautiful livin' for my kids
Man, I'm really in love with my gig
Wasn't always known I couldn't take the throne 'till I raced for home and I slid
For my labels flown where I lived (KC)
But the Yates was growin' in my biz (Yeah)
And I couldn't even afford Reebok's
It was Payless shoes and hole-y socks
Then I started to earn G-knots, screamin' F-T-I on TV spots
Livin' the lovely life we chose
Still I'm livin' it by street codes
Pain and poverty put these flows in Beast Mode
Here we go

The road to my success from here was not a block away
On the coast they told me I'ma part with Travis, not today
We just wanted what's hot to play
But they gave me no slot to slay
Even though I'm not Lecrae, every day Tecca Nina would drop to pray
On my knees in a cot
There was multiple beds in my spot
So let the champagne pop, everybody feelin' my gang-gang lots
Took a lot of hard work to get guap, when you comin' from a scarred turf, could be stopped
From the hurtful dirt to the top
Yeah we gonna celebrate today 'cause we got

Let the song play (We got it)
'Cause we done came a long way (We got it)
They know we get that grown pay (We got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (We got it)
The long way

Too big and too ugly, would you ever love me?
Every city we visit, we get it, but people they look at us funny
I feel like I'm way too fat, but what I'm packin' is making them kitties get after 'em
They hearing me flippin' and rip the back up out the track, then they trackin' a pack of 'em
Applause, applause, now we sell it enough to get our house and our cars up
Gotta get them bars up to be part of the upper echelon and hit the stars up
And we did it (okay)
Me and Nina stay committed to our art, we always doin' our part
We get it (okay)
And we knew we gettin' the cheese or we siezin' our G's up, Jesus
Only breaking from making 'em rock
The pushin' manuever been making the block
Indusin', I'm cool when I'm oozin'
I'm cruisin' the planet, they think I'm faking a lot
I gotta get to the money, gotta get to the money, and they think I'm making a lot
I'm keepin' a millimeter pilly under the tummy for dummies, if they wanna plot
New money, I ain't trying to save, 'cause I just made it
Look at my royalty state, thank God for the ones who gave it
Lots of props for the ones who made it
'Cause this road ain't paved
Sippin' till I'm elevated
We made it, so we gon'

Let the song play (We got it)
'Cause we done came a long way (We got it)
They know we get that grown pay (We got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (We got it)
The long way

Yeah, we started this Strange Music in Trav's basement
Now we gonna have our fifth Strange building because we had patience
And I got all these mass payments with a mad cadence
Kill it when I rip it up, I'm makin' 'em listen, not pickin' me up, and I never have a cash craving
We appreciate this, so we create hits
See me lay this, inebriated
And we be faded, indeed we stay lit
From the oddest, to people listen, and look at me Godish
Not a time for Nina to be modest
People celebrate with me 'cause we got it

Let the song play (We got it)
'Cause we done came a long way (We got it)
They know we get that grown pay (We got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (We got it)

It Was An Accident,K.O.D.,2009.0,"I was chillin' with a bitch and I was noticing she was so sadistic
Wanted the N9na to bite on her nipples and twist it
Sucking me off until she lost all of her lipstick
You know how it is when you X-in on like 7 of 'em
With a stick of Sherm and Adderall nigga had to love 'em
'Cause they get you lifted and thinkin' you unstoppable
But what I'm 'bout to tell you is so fuckin' impossible
I started givin' the bitch my dick
She loving the way my jimmy be jabbin' it
Wanted me to cut her up, I said never
She said imagine it with the tip of her butcher knife
I think I took her life
This crazy hooker liked pain then I put her right
Fuckin' high and it's insane how she look at life
She wish a nigga had fangs and he took a bite
I'm beatin' it up but it ain't what the pussy like
The pussy like to be banged like it took a fight
Then she asked me to smack her
Then she asked me to choke her, so I choked her
As a nigga got closer to the nut I choked her
Even harder when I rose up out of the chocha
She wasn't breathing, a horrible evening
Couldn't get her to breathe I really tried to
Did all I could but it wasn't all to the good
So I had to call the ambulance over to come revive her

It was an accident
Ha ha ha, oooooooooo
It was an accident
Ha ha ha, oooooooooo
It was an accident
Ha ha ha, oooooooooo
It was an accident

I don't be findin' trouble, it be findin' me

Shit I was only 16, just showing off
Never would have imagined the gun going off
I was just trying to show these niggas that I wasn't soft
I stayed at 52nd street so that's what all these niggas thought
'Cause they was from Hilltop, where niggas pill pop
So I'm pulling up to the chill spot with the steel cocked
Still not, sure what I was thinking, and back then I wasn't even drinking
So I'm leaving Lincoln High School off Woodland
Headed to the hood to out wit all the hoodlums
Couldn't wait to show him what I was packing
Knock on the door he answered like ""Whuuss Crackin'!?""
I said, ""Shit, just chillin', just me and my bitch""
""By my bitch I mean that 450 sittin' on my hip""
""Wanna see""? He said ""Yeah, let me see""
I pulled it out and gave it a good squeeze
I didn't know it didn't have no safety
Now this man is hit in his chest and he can't breathe
Devil on my shoulder whispering ""Leave, nigga leave""
But I swear

It was an accident
Ha ha ha, oooooooooo
It was an accident
Ha ha ha, oooooooooo
It was an accident
Ha ha ha, oooooooooo

Worst Enemy,Absolute Power,2002.0,"I'ma tell y'all a lil' story man,you know I'm sayin'?
Yo this is a song about, somebody who did me wrong dawg
I thought you was my homie man.. I guess not
Fuck it

You was supposed to be my dawg
Homie, when I first met you, what was told to me was fraud
What a shocker, an imposter! I've been crossed, I lost ya
My best friend turned out to be an enemy that's endin' me
Hidden, no sympathy, no empathy either; homie, I never denied ya!
Nuttin' that you wanted: women? I never player-hated
I hooked you up, booked you up from the beginning
This enemy had love for you, shared blood for ya
When ya wanted to dig? I dug for ya, nigga
But you a double-crosser, nasty hand-tosser
I shoulda known you was evil
When you told me you was cool 'fore we'd be sex fools when we under the steeple
The retrieval: I'm tryna get my life back
No more stoppin' women from puttin' a knife at ya cap
Remember when we was kickin' it? Bitches was givin' it everyday
We did it in every way, but the respect went away
You got a mind of your own now; you're grown now
Can I ask you a question? Did you forget we kinfolks, nigga?
We the same complexion! I'm stressin'!
You was always in front of me so I listened
Everyday you wanted me on a mission
I even let you have sex with my lady like a G
Infatuated with you and not me
I sucked it up, I got back wit' her, you fucked it up
By lettin' her know I was creepin' around with every chick in the town, buster!
I shoulda known not to trust ya!
Listen, I'm losin' my life because of you!
I lost my life because of you! I'm losin' my wife because of you!
I even had sex and a baby with the crazy bitch you introduced me to!
Now I'm straight depressed, I hate your flesh
But fate was just belate to Tech, laid to rest
Every time you got drawers, you made my poor little life fall nigga, ya got balls
You ain't never had a partner like me
Real, I never ever sold ya pipe dreams
Personal? Yes, it might seem
Nigga when you was burnin', I went and got the Doxycycline
Looked out for ya health, and this is all the respect I get?
Hater, ya neck I'll slit, but I can't, 'cause I'm attached to ya
And I don't know why, sometimes I wish you would just die
It would eliminate all this hurt
Maybe I could get up outta all this dirt ya caused me
So strong, nothing could stop you, not even cerebral palsy
I can't believe it; my best homie turned on me
You musta forgot we grew up together
I'm through, life is over now, there's nothin' else to do
Point the finger and blame it on you

(It's all because of you, you, you)
I lost my girl, my world, is upside down because I found you wasn't shit
(It's all because of you, you, you)
Broke us in two, you untrue, don't know what to do, I'm talkin' to you (who?)

Too Much,Killer,2008.0,"From the deepest darkest part of misery
Never seen before
Never heard before
Talent beyond this world
Bow down for royalty
Tech N9ne the King
Krizz Kali the Czar
Kutt Calhoun the Prince
Too much to comprehend

It's not quite enough for me
But anyone with eyes can see

Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya

Prepare for the ending
This is the pinnacle
All hail the king
Tech N9ne

Ain't nobody better, we comin' clever than ever
Goin' head up with competitors and levelin' 'em
We put 'em through the shredder
We got the lever to sever any brethren
Who steppin' with the devil in 'em
I'm sick of everybody thinkin' they ready for the work of a killa
And feelin' they ill and not sayin' a thing
Gotta give it up when the skill is incredible
Death is inevitable if you got trouble obeying the king
I guess when I bust I'm too much for ya
I cuss when I must I'm too rough for ya
Tecca N9na when I'm flowin' it's a rush for ya
Other rappers on the planet you a customer
'Cause you buy it and bite on me put your recorder right on me
'Cause you really ain't the shit and you stuck in debris
Now the people got the light on me I'm about to fight on the mic
And you knowin' ain't nobody fuckin' with me
Automatically haters be mad at me
When I be rippin' it niggas get to trippin' 'cause I'm livin' it up
Got the industry in the palm of my hand
And I promise I can’t offend a fan when I say I'm not givin' a fuck
I'm 'bout the music and doin' it, when the people they ruin it
When they miss it, it be drivin' me crazy
I'm different and people they call me evil and devil
I'ma let 'em see the level of animal it made me
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I just bust your crew up
Leave 'em in the dust, and must chuck the deuce up
N9na, Krizz and Kutt we upchuck the new stuff
Never can ya touch or crush us we too much!

Why do we even do it when you don't get it?
It's like beatin' a dead fuckin' horse
Constantly givin' you elite shit
And only a handful of you get it

Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much

Blood maybe could be the reason you b-b-begun trippin'
A lot of forgotten, too busy, rottin’ in mud rivers was niggas
Who got it twitted thinkin’ they thug niggas
BLEVE and Mountain Dew outta my bodily
City of fountains, you think you hard but you hardly
Compared to a rare brother, I swear there no nothin' nadda
Can weather a liz-thiz-izzle weapon like Dan Glover
Dangerous with this flow
Come and cut you like I'm a
Insane, a beast in beast mode
And know you fucking with the
Mangled beast, the sheets show
And I'll be motherfucking
Damn, the pieces he sold

Oooh-wee

I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that

Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you

Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Ghetto love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, naked ass

I'm talkin' 'bout socks on, socks off, get my rocks off
Big old back end, wax on, wax off
You can have it however you like, thin or go bad
Makin' sure the cookie monster is tight
Ginseng make ya swing from the chandelier
I know I sing but this a real man standin' here
Now that I think cackle
Lay on your back girl, I'll have you thinkin' I'm the king of the world!
When I put my thing in ya girl!
I'm pullin' micro-braids and weaves out, blowin' backs and knees out
Have ya screamin' Kali baby after that I ease out
A predator lookin' for a black and decker pecker wrecker
With better than bed and head and make me wish I never left her
Hey! Hey! Don't tell your girlfriend how I beat it up
And your man, he so cold to ya and I heat it up
Let go your inhibitions, reservations: swallow them
Get some ghetto-ness, I give it to you at your mama-nems

Have you ever all witnessed the ""just been hit with a dick"" stature?
From a nigga like me who licks it then hits in it after
All in your cervix servin' you some of this summer salami
Work up a sweat from passionate sex like performing pilates
Ghetto! I'm lex-er than steel when it comes to real sex in the pill
(Precaution) No step in this fill if you scared of catchin' a dilznick
Real spit or do you prefer lil' dick?
She said ""no I likes it nice and hard to bring the real shit""
And I'll be comin', comin' from around a corner
With a box of Magnums to put it on you
Backpack and Newports, a fifth of Patrón you
Never hear Kutt Calhoun's a loner
I'm not sincere, not me from the bottom of a bad
Motherfucker named Sascha Fierce
Drink, drink your Kool-Aid with a booty naked
Ain't nothin' but some motherfuckin' sex in here
I beat the koochie, I treat the koochie
I never heard a bitch call me a pussy
(Why?) ain't seducing shut 'em up quick
Make 'em cover up dick like she's a coozie
Tell 'em Kutt just what you like little mommy and we can settle up
We'll have you twitchin', feindin'
And constantly thinkin' 'bout my ghe-'bout-'bout my

Girl don't keep me waitin' for that

Get some love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, naked ass

I want you to pop it and dip
Then upswing your hips
Back it up and don't trip
Let your back bone slip
Spin around, get a grip
Of the pole and then flip
Baby that's the way you strip
Here's your tip, not on the lips

Hey-hey the ghetto be missin' me, I had an epiphany
I need some ghetto lovin', so I get where they're diggin' me
They sniffin' and kissin' me
Wanna split with me? All in favor say ye
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?
Whooo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
Heimlich, all over Tech N9ne dick, I'm a organ grind this
Do you know you're beautiful and you're fine miss?
And you two, you three finest, will you never be mine, miss?
I love big behinds, call me your highndness
Heavens to Murgatroyd, I love when you're workin'
You're twirkin' that ghetto booty, even makin' suburban boys
Make a lot of suburban noise, got money in my pocket like I'm a turban boy
So after your coochie crusade, you know she ghetto
If she come and bring you Kool-Aid (Oh, yeah)

Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you

Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, naked ass

I'm talkin about pole slidin', lap dance ridin'
Do something strange for some change if you're buying
But big strippers make big tippers
Show no thankful for all their booty you give us
For just a drink or two, she'll make it wink at you
Drain your change until she think you're through
The ohh she got your booty bopper
Oochie-wobble watch you while she callin' you poppa
The urge to push to thrust, I mean to shove
Takes you back to the ghetto for some ghetto",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-ghetto-love-lyrics
Livin’ Like I’m Dyin’,Bad Season,2011.0,"Living like I'm dying tomorrow, ain't no time for no sorrow
Throw on my platinum Movado, Robert Graham on my collar
Spray Luciana Soprana,
 holla at a mama who's na-nas
Lava hot like carne asada, scholar with a bra like Toccara
Balla, I got a few dollars, hamdulillah, my father taught us to
Follow Qu'ran and not Osama bin Lada,
 my mama was not a-
Part of Islam but God is her water, so why does the-
Sickness got her like a llama just shot her
Goosfraba, woosah, I gotta get outta this rah-rah
And fly to Hono-lulu, inside a grotto
'Bou Lou and five la matas
No yada-yada, they ride on this rod and bob you then swallow
Sun got us all the color of Shabba
Then I pop the bottle of Moscato
Ride away on my Yamaha
Vamonos, I promise I'm never the one to be monitored
By the blue collar copper, we call him Erik Estrada
Got a wad in my Levi's and a nigga never got to borrow!

I'm living like I'm dying tomorrow
So I gotta do a lot of living today
I think I'm gon' drown in a bottle
And party like I think about to go in a day
I'm seeing lots of pretty women so you know I'm going in
They gon' blow this whole world up so I'mma party until then

Man, I has partied harder than Diddy in Gucci, Louie with Henny
Like I'm dying when I'm gone won't be taking none of it with me
As sure as my name is Bloody Kutty Cal, you can picture me
Partying like it's going out of style
I- I Feel I'm the best who done did it, 
most underrated and hated
But if I die then so be it, then in my head I'm the greatest
It ain't a bitch I ain't christened, city or state I ain't mentioned in
If I die then my eulogy will be held at the Kemperman
I done smoked, I done drinked and then popped my pills to extremities
(Still do it!) 
Every now and then I pop more than Yosemite
Keep my foes and my enemies and the ones that pretend to be (Close to me)
'Cause honestly them the ones that'll hinder me
So henceforth remember me, this voice is finna be
His choice of energy, by him I mean all men
Party like it's 1999, smoke my wood tip wine
Giving all my things to God then say ""Amen""

I'm living like I'm dying tomorrow
So I gotta do a lot of living today
I think I'm gon' drown in a bottle
And party like I think about to go in a day
I'm seeing lots of pretty women so you know I'm going in
They gon' blow this whole world up so I'mma party until then

'Til summer's end, if the winter comes
'Til gray days turn to yellow ones
I stay grinding for mine, I tried to tell 'em once
To travel to the moon you gotta face the elements
And battle any goon you gotta cage the elephants
It's elementary, I speak with a certain eloquence
I smoke hella blunts, a habit I been developed since
I was a young boy playing the silver ball
See 'em stand, feel 'em fall, 
Metallica, kill 'em all
Huh, living like this is my last moment
But a moment could last forever
Snap a picture and Nat Cole it
Get whatever you gon' sip in your glass, hold it up
Hit the side on mine, get to tipping it back, throw in
So many days we was sitting low,
 better get busy living 'till the day
You giving in and get to go where the sinners go
Pulling the cash and spend it slow
Gotta make it fast, but them should know
Matter no money yo, it's all expendable

I'm living like I'm dying tomorrow
So I gotta do a lot of living today
I think I'm gon' drown in a bottle
And party like I think about to go in a day
I'm seeing lots of pretty women so you know I'm going in
They gon' blow this whole world up so I'mma party until then

Hold your breath, count to three I'mma kill it
Killer commitee city chairman
Strapped with a gramma Glock and the trigger, bitch, a hair pin
Three round burst, I'm aiming at your brain
Spin it, when I cock it I kiss it and call it 
Sara Jay
Living like I'm going down tomorrow, sit down and drown in a bottle
Go out and get another bottle
I don't lead I don't follow, If I don't eat I get hollow
I don't even play lotto, see chief I need every dollar
Y'all don't see me with a model or rockin' a lot of Prada
I don't smoke like I wanna, I'm stretching this marijuana
Fuck it, I call it karma if I wake up in Nirvana
Blood is thicker than water, the mud is even more shallow
Shit, I live in the moment and pardon every opponent who pass
But I put the pedal to the metal, I got both feet on the gas
This could be the last verse that I'm writing, like it or not
Everybody's taking a rob and they put you right in a box

Wohoo! That's Ces Cru! Ubiquitous and Godemis!
Y'all ain't fucking with that, boy!

I'm living like I'm dying tomorrow
So I gotta do a lot of living today

Must be that vodka that's making me hot as fuck

Look at me I'm sweating like I hit a sherm stick
Fishnet, hairnet to cover my perm bitch
That's how I feel right now, I ain't concerned with the germs
Here to kill right now
I come to terms with the loss of my swisher right when I passed it to a bad bitch
Maybe she'll let me take home that ass, hit and casket it
Functional drunk and I masted it, fast with it
Asking if this chick wanna dip and dap and let me smash it a bit
Talkin' bout wet? Gave her the woop wap she shoutin' out ""Tech""
Nina bout to see the proper thing that brought the cream
I'm bout the jeans and I'm bout the zing zing leaders spot
And flee to the block and I free her like a stream
Whole team keep it's hot grits, I do not spit shit if it is not lit
So much liquor mixing in here I might be toxic
Sweating like fire, and bombing fluids where I drop sticks

My hitters'll get ya, tryin' flip, ain't tryin' to get to the tool
We ain't boolies, when we bickin' we bool, we on the couch we Tom Cruise
Spillin' Bom booze on shoes
Anybody that test us, you gon' lose
So let's spark a blizzy, take a drizzy, pop a pizzy, get so dizzy
Grab a brizzy, then get busy, Kansas Cizzy in Missizi
Cause the way, my bank account is set up, I can't pay the tab
But after 12 AM I can bread up, then it's on
We'll be gettin' zoned to their moans
DTF ladies comin' to make a poan, we record it with a drone

I ain't spilling nutt'n

Don't ever try to be me

We Won’t Go Quietly,Planet,2018.0,"Just a little ditty I wrote while flyin' high in the sky

Somebody gotta say something, that somebody's gonna be me
People rather have separation than to come together livin' freely
All the tragedies we see on the dark streets and the TV
Make it difficult to grow a glee tree when the love level back in BC
We will never see racism done away with in our lifetime
When the parents hearts full of hate reproduce, then it's sent down the pipeline
If their kids want to fight crime, and they talk to others of the right kind
That'd be terrifying facin' nighttime and the steel is the only light shined
Jesus, not present when things seem so egregious
But if we just set aside all our differences and try to ease up
Off of war with each other, please trust, we can be just
When the hatin', killings enough and the anthem will have everybody takin' knees up

No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly
And everybody say, ""No, we won't go quietly""
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly

Yo, too many people of power afraid to say things
'Cause they don't want consumers to stop their pay streams
If they don't agree with your way of thinkin', they takin'
Your cake, cream, no love, no life is all that hate brings
I stand by love so if this don't enhance my buzz
And the fans die and my blood, the world is ran by thugs
That just want to ban my blood that runs with an angel flow
What they bleed ought to be equality, never been the angle though
But one day soon I wanna look and see the people lovin' then say,  ""Bravo""
'Cause now I see a lot of killin' and fightin' like Rocky and Ivan Drago
All good to be in Cabo, I'm rollin' in your Murcielago
But we just say a prayer if you will to stop the ill drills off up in Chicago, please

No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly now
No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly

Yeah, wishin' we could be rid of all terrorism
Like is there an 'ism' for the good? I'd say heroism
We are the dauntless in the midst of demons, we see in swarms
So mind your business unless you see somebody being harmed
I learned to love from my mother
I feel an angel around me, I know she hovers
Impatiently waitin' for you to discover
That people all need each other
When you see me, I'll call you brother
Never mattered, whatever color

No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly
And everybody say, ""No, we won't go quietly""
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly
And everybody say, ""No, we won't go quietly""
And everybody say, ""No, we won't go quietly""
No, we won't go quietly

If we didn't fear each other, we could stand near each other

And somehow you never get it back
And you can't go get him with a gat

They wanna replace my mind
Skinheads, cops, gangbangers
And it's all in the devil's design
Just to get me, gotta get the money quickly
Before my mother is a wonderful history
If I can't make it before that
I will never ever forgive me

But it's melancholy
And it's dim-foggy and dark like Fangoria

So I hope my mother's alive and me too when this album releases
But the time is tickin' and my kids

Torrid,Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"Your light, casting back the dark night
Even faster than we, could fly
Hotter than the sun before me

I been burnin' in my own hell for the duration
Of escapin' this place and it swept across the nation
That place is pain and tribulation
Instead of wastin' this achin', I give it awakening motivation
Yeah, I burn so you won't have to
I rap through fire flame you wouldn't wanna adapt to
This trying is totally tough, Tech is turbulent
I further vent to the masses who are watching on this obscure event

Your light, casting back the dark night
Even faster than we, could fly
Hotter than the sun before me

Feel as the fire consumes you through
Know that it's scorchin' just for you
Burnin' the way that you want it to
Only the torrid make it through

My pain lessens theirs because it puts who they put on a pedestal on a level playing field with them

I go through hell and I share it with you
Arid quick to cleanse me and get the merits you care to issue
A therapist who sweared to get you through a crisis
Soon as I write this, you invite this terror to view
So much death around me, stress to drown me
You get the sound we invest checks to crown me
The frown free, but no matter how loaded, I'm down D
Double E-P in amidst of a mess, N9ne is tougher than bounty
Torrid

Your light, casting back the dark night
Even faster than we, could fly
Hotter than the sun before me

Feel as the fire consumes you through
Know that it's scorchin' just for you
Burnin' the way that you want it to
Only the torrid make it through

Why is it me that gotta be the light source
Through my darkness, I created a bright force
The book told me, ""Behold a white horse""
But I didn't fear the death, I'd just report it, I am your life's torch
The pain shows and fame grows
Angel Heart and Evil Brain chose insane flows
To try to control the direction the flame goes
It aims low, then it build up and the thing blow
I don't know why it's the darkness that they desire y'all
Hotter than mixing 151 with grain and fireball
But that emotion made my entire empire ball
I guess I was a chosen one so God gave me this dire call

She Fell,N9NA,2019.0,"This song is rated sex

She got lonely so she phoned me
To my home, she say she hungry
When she told me she so horny
She fell on my dick, she fell on my dick

Like if she a real, uh
Lost step in a drunken race
Like a nigga is ripping the head of a creepin' bullet, gave her a pumpkin face
Nigga, she jumped in haste (Fell)
Like off in Cali and something quaked
Like I went to pick up a teacup
Hit it with a tablespoon and she fell into a sunken place
All the bitches wanna know me
Heard I'm hella hammer with the Moby
And I represent up in the Show Me
Boldly put the Gorilla Glue up in the stogie
Wanna put my hoagie in the cannoli
You gotta keep it bare, baby, Yogi
They wanna try and lay up with me cozy
Solely eat a nigga dick up like Bertolli
She fast to fall on it, what?
She asked to swallow it, what?
Like from a bottle, bitch
Gobble thick model chick
Bobbing this rattle spit-up
She like it tall in her gut
She like a ballin' nigga
Calling the bitch with his log in her pit
Hella talking the shit while he clawing her butt
She on the stinky and the 'caine (Yeah)
Really wanna try to lick me in the thing
She say that she needed somebody kinky in the game
So I told her that I wanted the pinky and the brain
Bitch, it's fucking incredible
Especially when you boost the feeling, good on the medical
Edibles, when it's over, she not feeling regrettable
Just let her go tell her homies that your dick on a pedestal
Bust it open, let me see your blossom, blossom
Pretty one, a nigga be like awesome, awesome
'Til I get it, N9na never stopping, popping
Kill it, I put the pussy in a coffin, coffin
Ayy, I really like thick females
Hit it, then she run and tell the dick details
I can tell you how that big V smell
And how quick she fell, she fell

She got lonely so she phoned me
To my home, she say she hungry
When she told me she so horny
She fell on my dick, she fell on my dick
She got lonely so she phoned me
To my home, she say she hungry
When she told me she so horny

Hella lit, delicate
Never with celibate
Tell a bitch swell a dick
Chocolate and vanilla, black and yellow, thick
Hella lit, delicate
Never with celibate
Tell a bitch swell a dick
Chocolate and vanilla, black and yellow, thick (Fell)

Like it was a problem with her bungee (Fell)
Like she's pulled back into Jumanji (Fell)
Like people playing rock and dressed in grungy (Fell)
Like when you hating the new but love the yummy
Always got bad bitches among me
Hungry for the dick, I know they having the munchies
So tongue me, kicking it all over the country
When I pump thee, look like her legs doing the Humpty (How?)
Deep, deep, making her skeet, skeet
Fuckin' and suckin', she loving to get my elite meat
The N9na's a V beast, I never knew defeat
Drilling like Chief Keef 'til the 'nani is deceased
I can tell when they want this thing
Bring it up out of me, baby, don't get stained
Having your nigga tripping at home, disdained
Tell him he really don't wanna funk with Strange (Strange Music)
Jacking the divas
Making 'em believe in a nigga, then I'm tapping the beaver
Making the horny women who be acting religious
Say Jesus, give her the keys to them bitches, arriba
Let's go, nigga (Fell)
Like the darkness (Fell)
Like a carcass (Fell)
Like a cheating nigga that's really heartless (Fell)
Like a starship fell on the rare tarpit (Fell)
Like your heart when an old bitch yelling Marcus

To my home, she say she hungry
When she told me she so horny
She fell on my dick, she fell on my dick

So fear and stress sets in as the other groups approached the slaughterhouse led by the farmer. See, the farmer knew that the cattle had something valuable; something he wanted, so he attacked and the result of the attack was beef (beef)
B-E-E-F: bitter emotions envy and fear - beef
Ain't nobody got no real beef with me, nigga what? Every time a motherfucker come along and do something. It's always another motherfucker that wanna come along and stop his ass. Ain't nothin' strong enough to stop fuckin' Tech N9ne, nigga. Ain't nothin'! Ain't nobody got no motherfuckin' beef with me, nigga fuck you!

Better watch your language!
Niggas jealous when the women feel us
We famous
Gettin' with us, ain't an option haters, 
send the killers, bring 'em
Straight angus
Grade A hater!
Hatin' niggas that change up
You don't wanna get banged up
Fucking around with them strangers
It better be about money ('bout money)
And it bet' not be no bitch
Better go fish, I don't wanna hear all the lip
And if he trippin' hit 'em with the 
four-fifth
Wanna take it there and it's so sad
Thinkin' he packin' a pair of the gonads
What you got a little beef with me?
Well I got a big fat meatloaf for your ass
Bow down haters, turn around niggas
Go and clown if you like the way it sound - beef killers
Wait a minute, nigga, why you lookin' at me
Like a motherfuckin' bald head when I got a head full of hair?
Eyeballs red with a stare, put a nigga dead in the air
Fuckin' a family believe it I'll take it there
Stuck in a wheelchair never gonna take
Another step again, a weapon and the specimen
I left him in a mess and then I gotta
Give a nigga the metal medicine and holler
I ain't never gotta wipe my tears
Never need a gang when I fight my fears
It stops right there and continues right here

If you want beef, it's right here, here, yeah, yeah

See, ever since the beef I've been havin' these dreams
Of killin' ya, triple beams is spillin' your blood
Out your umbilical, I-I never been the killin' type
But gimme the gun and I might just pull it tonight
I'm willin' to fight, but if you got a nine mill' I got another
Nine millimeter that'll get you like BLOW! (blow!)
Why you talkin' loud now?
Thought that when you was facing me I would gracefully bow out now
Can get grim on this nigga (yeah!)
Catch him comin' out the Peach Tree and 
stomp my Timbs on this nigga (yeah!)
That shit that you talkin' ain't nothin' but gum bumpin'
Bumpin' the gun pumpin'
Most of you niggas don't want nothin', nah
Me and my people, we done frontin'
In fact, if we take it from wax to the streets you done done it
Want beef nigga? Better say that shit
'Cause from around here, nigga, we don't play that shit
Don't let part of your speech make you lose part of your teeth
Cause you ain't hardly hard to me if you want beef from me

It's right here, here, yeah, yeah

Beef is when a nigga run around town talkin'
About you owe him a hundred Gs
Beef is when a nigga tell somebody
He wanna get you when you hear about it overseas
Beef is a nigga that's sinful
Draw a wicked plan out with a stencil
Tell your homeboys falsified info
And that's so he can turn them all against you
Hatin' on you, the bitches and niggas sayin' you wack
When everything you got workin' is play in the back
Go back to crack, go back to sprayin' the gat
'Cause your bullshit rap don't stay on the rack
7th Heaven gonna have to put the shit on auction
Cause the shit ain't poppin', nigga knew it was shockin'
When you was sellin' CDs out of the trunk in Joplin
And I was on tour fuckin' bitches in Oakland
Regime Life nigga, fuck everybody else
Deuce Click-Deuce Click
Damage your body health
Sayin' nobody feel me, well nobody feel you
Police tryin' to tell me how to kill you
When you feel you really wanna jump in the mildew
Ain't no tellin' what niggas with kids will do
Travis O'Guin you know he got bills too
We ain't the ones trippin' nigga it's still you
Never thought I would see the day that I would be speakin'
About a nigga that I called my bro man
But then a nigga really got to thinkin'
I gave 'em 25 thou of mine, Q gave 'em 50 for no damn reason
So the pub I gave you for 25, a hundred Gs, I say we even

Me and my faithful right hand man
Tie up a Muslim and shoot him with liquid pork on Ramadan
With force, I'll make a Christian read their kids The Necronomicon on Christmas
Don't trip on this lyrical syphilis
I flip this so the yonks will catch vapors like mentho-lyptus
I'll feed a dominatrix patient pain pills
Give Wu haters permanent fang grills
Trick the artist formerly known and give him the same slave deal
I'll lift a couple of Dr. Dre's reels
Sell em' to Snoop and No Limit Soldiers just so I can see how paid feels
Hazy Shade of decayed hookers with grave shields
Where AIDS fills the carcass
Bet a milli on it Tecca N9na be the darkest

Rogue infested, more vicious than Cujo
Fraudulent tested, the punks arrested got the neck slit exit

Then stuff him in the front seat of a Yugo

Called it ""The Helifino""
Throw Chuck Manson off in a pit of militant Jews banging hella opera

If you ever break up with a (Psycho bitch!)

Don't gimme that shit but a nigga don't care, never coulda be there
That I was up in the middle of a game of double dare
When I woke up I was in a motherfucking nightmare
How you gonna fuck me on Sunday
When you wanna say you love me on Monday, you bugging!
Thinkin' everybody gotta bow down 'cause you offered your loving
If you on your telephone and then she lose it when you using it
If you sleep don't leave it on nigga, for true she will go through with it
If she, call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation is not lewd, the bitch is ludicrous
Mad when you got a better bitch around
Sad 'cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never woulda got up in the woman
If I knew about the menace then I'd never wanna dick her down
If she taking Seroquel or Celexa
The bitch probably stop and then try to catch ya
Sleeping with a beauty itchin' to get ya
You better hope you never leave in a stretcher
If you with a psycho don't go through with it, be through with it
Right in the midst of happiness her mood'll switch, she'll ruin it
You think that you know women and you're just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga didn't think at the end of this, you will have to shoot a bitch

Please, don't bring no psycho shit to me
(I love you, why don't you love me?)
Never ever go down low with a (Psycho bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho bitch!)
Everybody better learn how to see a (Psycho bitch!)
Never know when your girl might be a psycho
'Cause your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
Your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
""I want you in my life forever""

Yo! She poppin' up at the club
Lookin' for you when the roll is in
And when the push comes to shove
Here you go on the floor with this ho again
Psycho bitches never let it go, trippin's inevitable
Be ready to get up and go (Why?)
'Cause Tecca N9na just said to the so!
Break in my crib, sniffin' my drawers
Lookin' for white bitch hair on my balls
Trippin' wit' you when you out with the family
She get it poppin' right there in the mall
Fuck with the bitch is definite, better watch who you steppin' with
Fuck attention deficit, better watch who the fuck you messin' with
Just because I fuck you, that don't mean we getting married, ho
The way you sit around the corner from my house is scary though
Psycho bitches when it comes to relationships are very slow
Bitch'll never understand it's over 'til you buried low
No, don't be up in the MySpace flippin' out
Trippin' with strippers you think I'm diggin' out
Me saying that I'll never be taken by the hands of another man is a bad omen
'Cause you never know, it might just be the hands of a woman, psycho bitch

Please, don't bring no psycho shit to me
(I love you, why don't you love me?)
Never ever go down low with a (Psycho bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho bitch!)
Everybody better learn how to see a (Psycho bitch!)
Never know when your girl might be a psycho
'Cause your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
Your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
""I can roll my tongue, ""

Stop callin' me, never really wanna hear no heartfelt shit
You ain't healthy for me and bitch I'm on a health kick
Psycho bitches are self-destructive, weak and helpless
I'm done with you, bitch, now you can let somebody else hit

She so sick with it, I stick hit it, and dick fitted
Never did I think for a minute to quick quit it
Chick is only living and driven to get hitted
Turn around and flip and get you in deep shitted
But she wasn't better to get you indebted
You can make paper and money of men sinning
You can run a bitch by adjustin' her antennas
But if she's demented you better forget it
She's psycho like Michael, you might go wake up to knifes and rifles
When your eyes low she's liable like I know to move on you like Tae Bo
Even I know this sly ho like rivals be and turn you in to 5-0
Either that you turn your back and the bitch attack with a blade up in your spinal
She'll illicit them phone calls, don't stop with them harassing threats
When the vision was them drawers and me plottin' on havin' sex
Got me trippin', fist in a ball, somethin' gon' happen next
I'ma kill this crazy bitch, and give her back to Tech!

Please, don't bring no psycho shit to me
(I love you, why don't you love me?)
Never ever go down low with a (Psycho bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho bitch!)
Everybody better learn how to see a (Psycho bitch!)
Never know when your girl might be a psycho
'Cause your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
Your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
Never ever go down low with a (Psycho bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho bitch!)
Everybody better learn how to see a (Psycho bitch!)
Never know when your girl might be a psycho

Of all niggas who wanna be Nina
But listen

Motherfuckers who's being murdered by the big bad wolf

If you think you trying to bite me, taste me; listen to me
Not Gorilla Monsoon, a wolf, so I howl at the muthafuckin' moon
I can smell a rotten fella, cotton dwella; hella props to the jailer, my nigga Loon
Two little pigs, niggas who wanted to be the big bad wolf, Tecca Nina clone
That's why this little piggy hit the carpet and the other little piggy stayed home

Hit me with a silver bullet and get it outta me
'Cause a weak bullet is only a milli Technicality

You little niggas, you can't fuck with the wolf
You a devil with hooves and death books
Came to a Tech N9ne show and got took
By the lyrical anghellical voice that's shook
Satan, the lord rebutes ya, the power of Christ compels you
To get the kcuf away from the ish
I'm spitting; you're losing, I'm sorry to tell you
Who the man now? Who the man now?
Motherfucker, you a student, put ya hand down
Tryna growl like a wolf, tryna pop like a Tech N9ne
Little nigga, you can peck mine
I'ma hairy motherfucker with whiskers and I flips a
Hella script from here to Lamaviska
Kiss the fist of a nigga who walks so hard on niggas like you

You Don’t Want It,Misery Loves Kompany,2007.0,"When you see me smilin', I'm really frownin'
You think you're really wildin'? I'm killa clownin'
Meaning I don't give a fuck about nothing you say that you do
Because stupid is how everybody sounded
Nigga you think you know me, but only if you knew me
Homie, you would leave me by my lonely
I'm thinking death and destruction
Images of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble
Thinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging
(That's just the devil, just the devil)
Block it out and keep it moving
I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing
Gimme the bible, yes I need it cause Tecca Nina's in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin up when I really don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly
I'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me
The holy father must have flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy
How to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)
Any sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall
The taste of blood on my tongue makin me want to brawl
No sentimental shit, death is the penalty
For any bitch you try to re-kindle this
It'll get your temple hit
Bout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get
Send it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit
So teeter totter mothafucka if you want it
But just keep it to the left of me, crazy til the death of me
Pussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe
Having hella drama for Nina is a necessity
Good and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee
Shit is looking like it is evil getting the best of me
Bitches think I'm pleasant and really wantin' the sex with me
I'm promisin' you I'm losing it, you don't really want to mess with me

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)
Cause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)
And I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it
One of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael
Push it you'll see what I'm talking bout
You don't want it with me

Betta load up your drums
Load up your guns
Everybody better get to runnin'
You don't want it with me
I'm a lyrical cynical rippin' ya pinnacle
Damage anybody when I see they really want it with me
Techa-ninna told me nigga get money
And never been dumby
Shit on a nigga when he comin' funny with me
Follow the beat follow your feet
Gimme the weed keys G's
And a quarter pound of bullets with a machete
Mister Reese known for getting it poppin
You niggas be droppin'
And when you do your albums be floppin
When ever I spit it
Man better yet when ever I drop it
Your wifies gone cop it
She even tell you nigga go cop it
You don't want it with me
I'll fuck your life up like a disease
I'm hauntin your dreams
With a fully auto choppa them beams
Mayne yadadamean
Ya life ain't shit but a dream
So just remember when your breathin' you don't want it with me

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)

One of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael
Push it you'll see what I'm talking bout
You don't want it with me

And you don't want it from me
See I'm believing that people are really angels and demons
Instead of human beings
I'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding
Causin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles
Keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows
As I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums
It's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run
I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony
Oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds
The Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)
Cause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)
And I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it
One of us ain't gonna make it out

Musical,
 
omnipotent
It's time to go, brothers
11 years and we're finally here
Beyond the stars, the trinity
God status, let's go!

Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe?)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Gods!

Me and Tech and them started on a quest for
M... O-N-E-Y, we touching so many, why?
'Cause we spiritual, feeling every syllable we spit out
We angels, that's the way we telling demons to get out
So bled out, baddest nigga representing the Mi-ddle
Feeling like the world cannot live with-out, Ta-dow!
Now we immortal! Somebody open up the portal!
Rap is  when me and Nina was caught on!
We God status, God threw a task at us
Told us he make us angels but our mission's to kill the baddest
So we gotta blast the bastards with our rapping apparatuses
Never let off the ravage on 'em like rabbits on radishes
We're like the Grateful Dead, our fans are the new dead heads
Repeat every word we saying like it's a pled-edge
And when you hear them gods and love how it sounded
When you see the king, kneel to the ground, make a fist and pound it

Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?

I told you I'm forever, didn't I?
The highly exalted the christen (your souls)
Those grounded I aspire to lift 'em up
The holy goes through the frequency of your audio speakers
They're set on all that can reach us, by now we're adios
Witness the blessings, beliefs and hopefulness I bestow
Upon a fan or foe, man or those opposing the Chanet growth
I plant it so everyone on the planet can evoke
The entity sent to be this music industries' manifold
I manifested; it's been suggested that I arose up
From under the sheets of God's baby cradle sent down to pose
A threat to Masonic rappers, protest against moral lackage
Invested in this infested depiction of worldwide gibberish
S-suffer no more here it is, a little experiment with Jesus
Blood and mortal when the spirit mix
Drink it, it's so refreshing - just like the air of my message
The breeze carries and once you inhale it
Then I will ask you

Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe?)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Gods!

Exalted, bosses, can't off his office with crosses
That's what he fought within darkness' mosses
No caustic losses 'cause the brain's embossed with the word auspiciousness
Feed my fam flows fluidly, 
they would never leave my land no truancy
'Cause I am the reason they stand for unity
Unlike me with whackness you give your fans no immunity
I am the air they share, I am the heir to the throne
Where no compare in my own zone, this lair is home grown
It's rare but it's on strong
Beware: long gone if you dare got the wrong tone
Now! We are beyond those who got fame
Gave my heart and many souls were obtained
So my lane will definitely not change
Cause G.O.D.S. means the Great Omnipotent Doc Strange

Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe?)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe)
Do you believe? Do you believe?

Like I Died,K.O.D.,2009.0,"HEY-EH!
Been waiting too damn long on a side
Don't know how many damn times I've tried
Ain't got too many good things to say
So here's a message to mister DJ!

Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried

Ay, treat it
Like I was coming from Billings on the way to Spokane
And you found me twisted and mangled inside our road van
Like it's so ugly the paramedics say ""Oh, man!""
There go Tecca N9na with no life but more fans
Like in hell or I'm in heaven, just fell in from 9-11
Propelling from high and dove in the concrete
Like my name was McVeigh and I check the mail and a bomb beeped
Like having Griselda’s dope and sell it beyond cheap
Like I was in the mood for set tripping
Fights begin and Rugers get splitting
Like my life is through and death slips in
Like there's no air left and my chest stiffens
Like I'm in the church and I'm preaching
Loving the way sister look and after service we creeping
Play my music like we was in the telly deep asleep
Then got murdered 'cause her husband was the deacon

Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music

Like the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music

(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)
Like having super pneumonia with out taking my z-pack
Like me off in a C function flamed up with a B hat
And I'm pattin' my pockets yellin' ""Where's my piece at?""
Like an ink session getting a snake and the bat tat
Got a gun and kicked in the face and I ran to the back ""Skat!""
Through the alley under a ladder tripped over a black cat
Fell in the street got hit by a Toyota with a hatchback
Play my music let everyone know that I can rhyme
But I got shipped to Iraq and I stepped on a land mine
Like a wild bull let out the cage and it's ram time
My job is to be the circus clown but I'm damn blind
Like I had the cube and I accidentally called pin head
Like I'm Matisyahu in a room full of skin heads
Play my music like I'm permanently in bed
I'm sure the DJs are with it with him dead

Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music

Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried

Unless I left my vest and I catch the magnum
Like they let Tech rest and toe-tagged him
After the beat him, tied him to the truck and skull dragged 'em
Like I died of lupus, cancer, leukemia
Epilepsy, m.s. or sickle-cell anemia
All at the same time and the call is a slain N9ne
Caught by a serial killer with a saw and it's pain time
Guess it really does pay to get caught with a stray
That's what it cost, what you pay in a way that's all for the say
'Cause when you rapping your ass off
Skill is their last thought
Realler than real spill but you get killed and you blast off
Play my records like I'm takin' the big ride
Like a deadly virus killing me inside
I know you sucker DJs got a lotta pride
All jokes aside even though I'm still alive

Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)

Cause I'm grim a bit, I am at the end of what I'm finna get
Intricate, I finish it with a diss for the hiss, but I get no benefit
I am not a demon cause I'm always beamin' and on some sinner shit
This shall replenish this menacing glitch that men have set
On my syndicate, this genesis will spit and diminish it

I done took all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
When we bust they clap their hands, clap, clap, 'till the hands are sore
And possibly, could you be afraid of me? (Afraid of me?)

I can't stands no more like I was Popeye

When I rock the spot my, plot's to be shot high
In a dark sky, in hopes I! Will not die
They really are scared of me, they said that T would not fly
And credit was deaded, but he kinetically sped up and guap rised
Off the top I, will not lie, bread is my fetish
And I really get it, that's why I'm a dreaded hip hop guy

You start getting a fuckin' attitude that might piss other people off. But you don't give a fuck, because the things that they do or the unjust shit that they do, makes you anti as fuck -- anti everything, anti everything they're about -- cause it ain't good, anti everything they fuckin' breathe or eat or whatever the fuck.

And I see a crazy nigga yell let's burn this bitch down
Why niggas, you fuck up the O'Reilly's
The BBQ spot and then the beauty supply niggas?
Depreciating, for justice keep waiting
'Cause you burned up everything except the police station
I'm anti stupid shit, for ladies participating come and loot this dick
They been out and murdered Kendrick Johnson
And covered it up, watch my sin get Compton!
You hate me 'cause tough and freely's the tone
I ain't never shopped on Black Friday, nigga, leave me alone!

Used to love turkey, devour Thanksgiving about
Jack your land from the Indians and murk 'em on it
Make it bigger, then get the niggers to come and walk upon it
Give 'em drugs and guns and excuses to never be
Better than a C-R-I-P or rep the letter B
Show you you can YouTube it and make fights
Vatican at it again, bangin' for they gay rights
And I'm supposed to follow YOU to the Promised Land?
I ain't got no insurance, leave it in Obama's hand!
At 19 I slapped the shit out a cop!
Now Ferguson had me murderin', burn down a donut shop!
You dumb niggas! Ooh, you'll be the only bum niggas
Get your ass out the street 'fore I shoot me more than one nigga
Bill Cosby? WHAT THE FUCK?
I was ridin' with you, till the 20th bitch got stuck
I guess the Jell-O Pudding Popped her
My mellow, he couldn't stop
He would give 'em the Spanish Fly
But fuck it, so would I!

I'm still smiling
While I'm crying

The Answer,Dominion,2017.0,"Yeah, I think they got me fucked up
Everybody better hold up
Cause they don't be feeling you like they feelin' me
And I think I'm the answer

I really had to break it down
I really had to keep it simple
I had to run up and down the court watching y'all like the league official
I never had to keep a pistol
If I did shoot, I'd shoot to kill
Talk is talk and that's cheap to me
But nobody really know what I do for real
I am what I always been, white kid with the rapping skill
Maintain that I'm self-sustained
Still CES came as a package deal
Run shit like in track and field
I'll pass baton in decathlon
Search around and go find a verse where I came soft and I was slackin' on
Puff puff and I'll pass it on
My team strong and we here to win
Repping hard for the underground, I'm an emcee and a lyricist
Many men tried to mirror this
They was scheming on me like a pyramid
But they theory is full of bullet holes
Period point blank I shoulda known

Yeah, I think they got me fucked up
Everybody better hold up
Cause they don't be feeling you like they feelin' me
And I think I'm the answer

I rap until my tongues tired
I spit it like it's gun fire
Anybody tellin me I'm not the best it gotta be I wear a mask like an umpire
Sayin I should hang it up in music you're a plum liar
A dumb guy or you're a bum sire tellin me I'm inadequate knowing it's not anyone higher
(UP)
That is where I am bitch
Up in the clouds eating a industry sandwich look it I can spit cutting em up
And this fuck it I'm feelin funny bout fair weather fan shit
Kansas, City King has landed
Anything remotely close to nope when I quote you're choked with a velvet rope, Janet
Is he crazy? 
Sho Lia
 
wicked like Fangoria
Fool is hatin cause he don't understand my communication, Nokia
Tecca N9na spit it so clear like Ho sheer
When I get to rippin this flow here
All the women go ta grabbin their crotch they all screamin OH DEAR!

Yeah, I think they got me fucked up
Everybody better hold up
Cause they don't be feeling you like they feelin' me
And I think I'm the answer

Armed and dangerous
Kali baby, y'all can never hang with us
Y'all strange to us
Y'all niggas be gambling or rambling
Count another mil', it's chump change to us
I'm joking
If I'm N9ne I keep that pistol smoking
By design to find your prime time if their eyes open
Sign of the times ain't dependent on the rhymes
Quoted rockabye to smoking on the pipe but doing lines of cocaine
I don't rock that shit
I'ma drop that dime like they committed to crime on divine lines that I've spoken
So get up if you can get the picture
Only hurt ya if the shoe fits ya
I really can't stay on my time zone
I ain't user friendly word to iPhone
A different creature, every feature I get on is my song

Well I, Well I know you got me fucked up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, better hold up
See they don't be feeling you like they feeling me
And I know I'm that answer

Too old for this bullshit
Zoned out, turned up
The 
gross
 must pass through fire and that's why
I'm burned up
Hell all in my head, peace (Got a)
Gapin' hole in my heart too (But I)
Won't pray to no savior (Why?)
These days I'm too smart too
I ain't came up for no air yet
I put dough down on a fare bet
Niggas hood rich, I ain't there yet
But I got holes like a clarinet
And I chug lean and I pop pills
And they hate Dean 'cause I got skills
If these pussies don't shoot me, you can bet that the punk cops will
I give two shits about who's with you
Laugh loud when that boom hit you
On the role, like I'm too cripple
Getting twisted like two nipples
My soul's darker than nightride but no night light, I write all day
I get busy with them blades in, and leave blood stains in the hallway

Yeah, I think they got me fucked up
Everybody better hold up
Cause they don't be feeling you like they feelin' me
And I think I'm the answer

Wake and Bake,Strangeulation Vol. II,2015.0,"Uh-huh, okay, light it!

Wake up in the morning, hit the porch and puff a doobie
Wake and baking got me coughing up a lugie
Make a quick mimosa, now I'm feeling kinda groovy
Got to find that chick that got the biggest booty
But she got to have the facial features of Karrueche
Easy sex, she got the diamonds in the coochie
Get me girls to gift to guys to grip and give them Gucci
Living lavish, looking loving lot of Luchi
Got to give a shout out to my other mother Ruby
That's because she's always been an angel to me
Plus I wanna give one to my O.G. brother Scoobie
Packed a punch that'd make a sucka nigga woozy
Loving leaf and liquor ever since I was a juvie
Now I need another, no, I'm not a newbie
Smoking reefer with the darker nigga from the Luniz
Piece of hotter head is stuck off in her booties

Got them vape toys
That creates joy
Such a great choice
Wake and bake, boy

(Wake and bake!)
When I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Puffiing on the loud, we gon' make the clouds bigger!
(Wake and bake!)
Gotta get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Oh no, no, no, no, can't sleep! I got the ""ooh"" weed, ah!

Open up my eyes and eat some roaches for my breakfast
Don't know where I am 'cause lately I been living reckless
Dig 'em out the ashtray, smoke 'em 'till I'm breathless
Soaking up the high and try to focus on my next shit
Toking on that lion 'till I spot other dimensions
Fuck a GPS, my dude too high to get reception
I been on a mission, just to get us all that necklace
Hitting every city with the motherfucking vengeance
Maybe it's in excess, maybe it's expected
Maybe you can blame it on material possessions
When I'm getting high it's when I tell you my direction
But if it's up to me I'd rather lie and give y'all guessing
Every single morning I'm just smoking on my blessings
Mix a little coffee with my cannabis and exit
I know it's infectious, a spiritual connection
I get when I wake up and turn into the smoking session

Got them vape toys
That creates joy
Such a great choice
Wake and bake, boy

(Wake and bake!)
When I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Puffing on the loud, we gon' make the clouds bigger!
(Wake and bake!)
When I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Oh no, no, no, don't sleep! I got the ""ooh"" weed!

Waking up, I'm baking blunts, I'm going, somebody stop me
I fly my definitions higher than Hitachi
Last night I was drinking, got my thinking kinda choppy
My girl came over knocking, calling out for papi
Fly as Nicaragua and dressed in Louie and Versace
I bent her over and I fried her like hibachi
Feeling high and cocky, balling out like Bocci
She brought a friend who had a tight end, Jeremy Shockey
Matter fact, the volcano was loaded up and locky
Vaporized the weed and dropping treats like we were Rocky
All the brothers bringing over trees was kinda sloppy
But ¡Mayday!'s packing pens that's got your friends acting like zombies
Nakatomi Nazis, die and hard to proxy
But fuck a middleman, you know that Joanie only Chachi's
Rappers's butts are pressing us to snooze, bitch, watch me
Wake and bake and take it to the face like paparazzi

Got them vape toys
That creates joy
Such a great choice
Wake and bake, boy

Puffing on the loud, we gon' make the clouds bigger!

Angel Baby,ENTERFEAR,2019.0,"I was young when she told me I was divine, yes
Not even nine yet (Tech N9ne)
Ran away then got into a life of crime next, Pyrex
Made it through the
Close calls, even I evaded shooters
So if anything go crazy
Everything works for the angel, baby

My first and for sure brush
With death was on the school bus, danger almost made my stool gush
Because the substitute driver caused the truck to cruise by us
Would've been crushed in dude's tires 'cause this fool's nuts
Sun shining, 'bout to have a more dark day
Told 'em drop me off on 63rd and Swope Parkway
That ain't my regular stop, but I can leg it for blocks
To my grandmother's,  ""Will do"" the old fart say
And what's a little strange
He didn't pull to the curb, but he attempted to let me off in the middle lane
And the bus stairway extended my right leg
Then a truck flew by
If I woulda stepped sooner then I'd be quite dead

Walked right out that fire while death was knocking at my door
Angel baby, angel baby, everything works for the angel baby
Praying that my angel's watching over me, keeping me safe 'til I get home
Angel baby, angel baby, everything works for the angel baby

At my homie Davie house tripping, shrooms
Dark rainy night but on a mission, soon
It was me, Davie, Grant, Jake and a bitch
To get some more, we gonna be dipping, vroom
Jumped in her car, hit the highway
Doing 65, hey, thinking ""This is my day""
She speeding, we tweaking, slick from sky spray
Hit a bump on the bridge, and the shit went sideways
Left, then right, then left again
To a girl with Tech and friends, this is where death begins
Hit the wall on the bridge hard, stopped in a quick sec
A little faster, we woulda flipped over and fell to our death

Walked right out that fire while death was knocking at my door
Angel baby, angel baby, everything works for the angel baby
Praying that my angel's watching over me, keeping me safe 'til I get home
Angel baby, angel baby, everything works for the angel baby

Southwest High School nighttime
Martin Luther King Day talent show, fights climb
To another level, takes the Devil to incite crime
No bright minds, ain't no telling what you might find
Whole lotta gang shit
Somebody wanna bang with the homies I came with
6512 Wornall Road was dangerous
Some lames couldn't hang 'cause I gang thick
That's when I saw one of 'em pull a pistol on us and aimed it
I was in the wind, just like the bullets that whizzed by
Running for blocks in the night, but never did die
Things go shaky and I'm sane more lately
But I guess mama protected me naming me angel baby
Thank you mama

Walked right out that fire while death was knocking at my door
Angel baby, angel baby, everything works for the angel baby
Praying that my angel's watching over me, keeping me safe 'til I get home
Angel baby, angel baby, everything works for the angel baby

Everything works for the angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby
Baby, baby
Angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby

Sho Nuff,Planet,2018.0,"Hella faded
You wonder why everything so celebrated
And all of our team's dreams shot down
But made it to the top now out of Hell and above hard ground
We spreadin' our wings, all of my team make the Planet Rock, don't stop now
Was supposed to be a ghost, now when we party, I'm the host
We made it through the rain to the fame so I wanna make a toast
""I'd like to thank everybody that showed up
Now we 'bout to get poured up
'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough
So is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!""

I been at the bottom where they fought and then they shot 'em
Was a problem summer, winter, spring and autumn
Gotta pray to God is what they taught 'em
Havin' not is what they got, so you right up in the column
Unless you got the will to go and get it
Unless you find a lick and go and hit it
I didn't bitch, I didn't march or picket
I just kick 'em something wicked then it turned into a ticket
Went from fights in school
To partyin' on stage where the hip-hop junkies Nice and Smooth
Way back in the day then Quincy J gave me a brightened view
Told me to rap what you know, took his advice then grew
Sick mother with no father, but still I made it as a scholar
But now I got to pop a collar, 'cause I started deep in squalor then I made some million dollars
I'd like to thank everybody that showed up
Now we 'bout to get poured up
'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough
So is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!

Even though we had a lot of nothin,' were we poor? Sho Nuff!
Did we find a better way of livin' through this flow? Sho Nuff!
Coming up feeling good right now
Lot of love in the hood right now
Tell me something if you ain't a hater, do we go? Sho Nuff!

I remember rubber sole footies on my feet
In the dead of winter, freezin' cold, walkin' in the streets
Off to 7-Eleven, only had enough to eat
A bag of Doritos with the chili and cheese inside 'em, it was cheap
Momma in the hospital, 17 I got little copped vittles
Pushing the bricks, scrubbing off the hot griddle
Too much struggle to tell y'all
But it ain't so much that I quit and stop makin' my mail tall
Aw hell nah! Made it through the rainy day
Never liked the devil and the games he play
Even though we in a gang, we pray
Yeah we broke the chains and the money and the fame, we slay
Use to be a man with no hope
Now to all my many fans I'm a G.O.A.T. (I'm the G.O.A.T.)
My struggle was a blast in the past
Now I'm gonna lift my glass 'cause I wanna make a toast
""I'd like to thank everybody that showed up
Now we 'bout to get poured up
'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough
So is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!""

Even though we had a lot of nothin', were we poor? Sho Nuff!

The Waitress,Killer,2008.0,"(Hi, may I take your order?)

Dwamn!
Hey, that's all I'ma say right now
I'm at a loss for words, girl, you, girl, gon' take that bow
You lookin'... boy, my lady would hate this
If she knew that I was out with her but I'm trippin' off the waitress

Woo shit! Who's this? Baby, why you do this?
I'm sittin' here with another female and it's 'posed to be exclusive
Beauty, fully loaded booty hips and thighs
I want a raspberry lemonade, baby, and whatever yo name is on the side
You speak unique, beautiful teeth I just peeped
It's makin' me weak to the point I can't even eat
'Cause you give me butterflies, them butter thighs need to be publicized
A wonderful face and waist that's great and there's no mistake that I love the eyes
Never like them other guys, 'cause when I want it I'm on it
The way I'm watchin' you feel uncomfortable, don't it?
But I'm thinkin' you should be in movies and this you need to quit
Then suddenly under my table I got a kick

I'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress
I'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress
Can't think of eatin', man, my girl will really hate this
I'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress
And I like the way the waitress (work that, work that)
Come get your money, girl, and (work that, work that)
I really like the way you (work that, work that)
Can I get you on the floor? (Work that, work that)
The waitress got it goin' on

Take my order anytime, I come here many times
A week so she can give me mine, baby girl is plenty fine
Business meeting, Capital Grill, was sippin' when she caught my eye
When she came over to us I said, ""Can I get yo number on the fly?""
Smell like no other, look like she strip undercover
Wish I could follow her home and just say thank you to her mother
Another interested brother who'd love to become your lover
Burn rubber to the spot to tell my dogs how much I dug ya
Outta here but I'm not gonna leave this place without gettin' in yo face
I'm not a disgrace so I gotta see how you taste
And I move at a puma's pace
So baby please if you find the time to get up out the weeds
I wanna make you my squeeze 'cause these other chicks you supersede
I call her waitress and homie, I call him server
The waiter's a bloody murder, I never wanna hear no murmur no further
'Cause she's bliss, I'm tryin' to get in yo mix
I want you so my order you can 86

I'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress
I'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress
Can't think of eatin', man, my girl will really hate this
I'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress
And I like the way the waitress (Work that, work that)
Come get your money, girl, and (Work that, work that)
I really like the way you (Work that, work that)
Can I get you on the floor? (Work that, work that)
The waitress got it goin' on

And don't be tippin' her below 20 percent
She need plenty for rent, leave her with pennies, then see her vent
To get money's her purpose, you don't tip, go get burgers
Believe her's is for TEPS meaning Tuition Ensuring Prompt Service
I'm nervous 'cause I'm gawkin' mom's curvage
I'm beyond flirtish, us hookin' up we both concerted
Where you get that smell from? She would never tell one
But she told me this, she say me she liked me 'cause I'm well done
Now your girl lookin' real, real stanky, ain't she?
'Cause she know you lookin' at the waitress thinkin' hanky-panky
Her attitude is wonderful, even got the strength to thank me
Even though she a single parent breakin' her back but ain't so cranky
I had to make her my girl, now she gon' eat with me
Southern booty, mane, I truly never need to flee
I'm stayin' focused, the waitress got me posted
But dwamn, look at that booty on the hostess...

I'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress
I'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress
Can't think of eatin', man, my girl will really hate this
I'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress
And I like the way the waitress (Work that, work that)
Come get your money, girl, and (Work that, work that)
I really like the way you (Work that, work that)

Should I Killer,Boiling Point: K.O.D. Collection,2012.0,"To the people I might offend with this song, forgive me
It's just, some sick shit that I was thinkin'
When I was dealing with some real shit
And it's called ""Should I Killer?""

I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)

The condom busted, upon this fluff chick
Really bomb and lust when vagina's thrusted and I'm disgusted
Can't come in the club bitch, dumb nigga trusted
I won't hit a gust quick, son should've clutched it
What he spit, what he gunned this let it in her rump and erupted
She say she know no pill, she stay thinking on your scrill
She know you're sold your mill and you Tecca Ninna with the solo deal
So what you think she's thinking?
If you fertilize the pink one, sinking your linking
Nothing but the jinx, now I gotta write her off like an ink pen
If she fattens, she said that it won't happen
Steady laughing at him, mashing, splashing ass, should've had it fastened
Night is over now, she ain't showed around, town about a month
And I gotta call saying she gotta tote around
Something extra from when I sexed her
My nigga, that's the, moment I had a heap, a whole plethora
Of homicide thoughts... Can I kill her? Why not?
Cause if wifey find this out, she's gonna take everything I got, nigga

I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)

Killer shit, I played it out, abortion, yes, I paid it out
But every time that I call to see if it's done, it's like she waited out
Like, ""I got to be further along to get that""
""Somebody's calling my phone, so hit back""
I guess I've been having a dome to click clack
Bone to pick, that's wrong to sit back
And let yourself protrude from something else, no food
What, you're gonna tell your dude that you're having my baby?
What the hell? That's rude!
But you took my money and all my calmness from me
But you reassured me saying she's gonna be taken by her mommy
When her mama took her, she said it kind of shook her
When her mother cried and told her that God had wanted this baby to push her
To be a better person, read a verse, then yeah they burst in tears
Dead is certain, I ain't shed and cursed in years
And as sick is here, make a nigga wanna drip a tear
Man, this is fear, cause I already got kids and the missus near
So I'm vicious, steered, twisted admist this wicked sphere
Think I'm gonna clip this weird chick
Really quick and the bitch just disappeared

I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)

If I kill this woman, I gotta apply my stealth
Cause if my family finds out, wave bye-bye my wealth
And if her family finds out, they're gonna make this guy cry help
I guess it be way, way easier, for me to just die myself
(Hey, just calling to let you know, everything's done, my mom took me)
(You know, if you really loved me, you would have let me keep it)
(Alright, talk to you later)",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-should-i-killer-lyrics
Slither,Absolute Power,2002.0,"A stallion
Ass like pow
Chest like bang
Lips like ooh
An angel, mane
But she had the devil's eyes
I had to have her cat

Pass me the 151 and coke cat
Then later we'll find where the dope at, but hold that
I seen something so fat
That I wish I could've drove back to get my Kodak
Strip teasa
Loving who got the VISA, got it and she will please ya
Nada then she don't need ya, Prada, Gucci, Felecia
It's a duty to feed ya
Amnesia, Caribou and tequezia
Off the turnbuckle, baby bubba had the booty and boobies
It was nudie so cootie was a cutey
I gotta get nearer, I got mucho dinero
Look at her look at herself in the mirror moving like Shakira
Made my way to the front of the stage
100's for days, big body I wanted to praise
Will she get with a nigga? Maybe
She bent over and said thanks and I whispered in her ear

I love the way you make it slither baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like something that I want to run through
You want some or...?
You know I want you
Baby we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like something that I want to run through
You want some or...?
You know I want you
Baby we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither baby

Well she asked me for a lap dance
And Trav said she too fine, fat chance
Boy I'm Tech N9ne I rap and
I slap hands with millionaires and plus I got stacks man
She approached me slowly, holy moly
Chef Boyardee, cheese and beef ravioli
Hold me close, nose be ope
How much evil can dough provoke
How much she told me nope
'Cause this one was on her
I'm hoping I can get the chance to put it on her
She slithered on me, put the booty in my lap and got to gyrating
Was I waiting for the pushing, grabbing and vibrating
But this is really when my pupils got to dilating
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing
Over and over tried to explain it the best that I could
She put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said
Hgrrrrrr

Shit
You like that baby?
How about me and you leave here baby so we can do that shit you just did over and over again

I love the way you make it slither baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like something that I want to run through
You want some or...?
You know I want you
Baby we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like something that I want to run through
You want some or...?
You know I want you
Baby we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither baby

Said she needed 400 to tip out
I whip out the grip so quick so we can dip out
The trick house, told my homies not to poke they lip out
I'm going to rip out the guts and try to throw my hip out
Now it's time to trip out, got at the bitch house
Was three fine female roommates my homies missed out
Took me to her room and threw me right on the bed
Got right on the head, what a wonderful night it was said
Then along came three 36 double D's
Sizes kissing and licking on me
And they coming to do what? Wake my dude up
But one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood
Then the other and the others
Instead of bud lovers I'm trapped with blood sucking motherfuckers for eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga
All because I said to a stripper
I love the way you make it slitha",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-slither-lyrics
Question Mark This!,ENTERFEAR,2020.0,"Shit was all good just a week ago
Fiddled with that middle the best
Then you reject, give a little respect, like Aretha, yo
Damn
Gotta stop it, I'ma drop it if you pop it outta pocket like a pita, though
I need a ho that gon' let the cheeba grow then receive a blow
Instead of pushing me in a Living Single Latifah show
Hear me out, though
Should be normal, I think you're severely out your noodle and really groucho
Your silly mouth go illy on the milly until we shout so drill me 'til it kill me and should be outro
PMS-ing me, nothing but a demon recipe
I'm seeing that could be being a threat to me fleeing effectively
You don't get to be effing me when you wrecking me
Guessin' we on confession regressin', 'cause we in a mess debris
I'm 'bout to issue a check for you to follow connect to who you swallow or excommunicado
Into the bottle, regret, you threw the lotto in Tech, 'cause boo, ya hollow an ex, you blue in sorrow
I ain't tryna paint a dark picture
But I think that I needed a heart to heart with ya
'Bout when the spark hit ya thinkin' that your bark sicker
With that imbalance this smarty art nigga
Never been a fart kisser
I mean I can only take so much
You say some ill shit, I'm like, ""Hold up""
Never fails, every month, girl, you go nuts
Snappin' right out of it like nothing and be like, ""So what?""
Actin' like it ain't nothing when I'm so sick
From the cold diss that you spoke with
I'm 'bout to kick you to the curb like I'm Colquitt
Or let it roll off of me while you bringin' up old shit

Why? I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
You actin' a ho, girl, no, girl, don't know what you be going through
Question mark this, what's the matter with you? It's like it's a habit with you
If I ask you don't call, don't text, I can't take that PMS shit

Look
Shit was all good just a week ago
Now you 'bout to see repercussions from when my heat explode
PMS PSA this a message to you weaker hoes
I be the best in LA, it is not a fucking secret, yo
I am not the female no-one, I'm Lex Bratcher
But all these captions like, ""You should gas that, Lex"" huh
Spittin' with the illest and I be killin' niggas feelings gotta go drilling
Nah, fuck it, you can have that Tech, ha
She throws, these little niggas know I cease flows
Decrease the peace from the West to the East coast
Keep killers with me, they from The Bay, they lethal
G's with me doin' more GTA than Niko
Why the fuck you talkin' that shit? But I peeped, though
Copy my raps and that's facts like they're at Kinko's
I'm in my bag, so get mad, 'cause dad you had your grasp
But fumbled your sack like at casinos
I know that my flow is vital
I be the IV to half of these pie holes
Try me, they sorry, s-s-stutterin' high notes
I never thought I'd collab with my American Idol
But Tecca Nina hit me up 'cause he like the way I be rippin'
Spit more content, got more fire than Scottie Pippen
If I'm honest, niggas will probably never get this
Gotta be rockin', mama said keep them pots and pans in the kitchen
Like damn, you were supposed to be my G, ayy, man
Now they chalking your body dead in the street, amen
All these motherfuckers sleep, uh
I'ma have to Lowrider George Lopez to my 3 AM
Hoppin' on your bros, where they do that at? Question mark
I don't know but 'round here we act serious
Head all bashed in family saddened
I'll leave a pussy bleeding and that's on period

Hey Tech
What's up, Mel?
Why you gotta flash on me like that though, man?
Tech, when have you ever known me not to flash on you like that?
You feel like that's cool? You know what I'm sayin'?
Why you gotta snap on a nigga like that though?
Man, that's what the fuck I do

Why? I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

Pain Killer,The Lost Scripts of K.O.D.,2010.0,"(The Hole)

My painkillers' in my dresser, right next to my rester
What insane brain would agree to this gesture?
To unjest less stress left with no extra
View's a mess, true depressed steps can infect ya
I'm a product of some shit gone wrong
Even though I speak to many with a hit song tone
Even though I'm famous and I'm giving chicks long dong
Man, I feel like the coppertop just a sick stone throne
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
, then he cashed some beaucoup checks
But he was not nearly stable to crew new Tech
As a, phenomenon, but karma wanna noose dudes' neck
Designer of death, get to choose who's next
Is it real to you?
But if you got evil you kind to come and steal a few
Condemned souls, cause of what the old painkiller do
Keep having these dreams of me taking my nine milla
Who can help me execute this desire to pop a pill or two?

You can't give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need some thing to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D, but he has none in store for me
So when the raining pours on me, my dream fulfill us
Painkillers

My pain comes from me, being a fuck up
With Strange Music we, really we lucked up
'Cause being a lost soul got my bucks up
Even though my cerebral cortex and spirit needed a touch up
Everybody around me hurting and shit
While everybody on TV, kicking it, reject, jerkin and shit
I be the one on stage and studio stressed out working and spit
This shit to the people that I know that I got a lot of evil lurking and quick
Women want me-want me, so they flaunt the monkey
Even during sex sometimes a heap of stress still wants to haunt me
When I grabbed the yalk she couldn't talk and it was no humpty-dumpty
Even though I'm sick in the head we kicks it like a donkey, don't we?
My apology to everyone who've been labeled a victim
I be losing my mind, I just picked up the .9 and I gripped 'em
And I put it off in a direction like I was the Kiss one
I always think about the day when I'm able to pull back and I click 'em

You can't give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need some thing to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D, but he has none in store for me
So when the raining pours on me, my dream fulfill us
Painkillers

No meds for me, just lead for me
Any light inside of my head is just too dead to see
Any kind a way out of this whole, can I pull this darkness out of this soul?
A lot of people wanna know how it's sold 'cause a lot of motherfuckers having doubt on this globe
And I'm one of 'em, you can see it on the television, everybody trippin', it's a ton of them
Straight feeling that pain, go insane then bang and it ain't no none of 'em
Many ways to end these days when the darkness make you wanna shun the Sun
Ten million ways to die when you constantly cry and the gun is one

You can't give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need some thing to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D, but he has none in store for me
So when the raining pours on me, my dream fulfill us

Abusin my unit, just wish they love me more then my middle

Your first lesson given to you by (Mr. Smith!)
KC MO stand up, young niggas represent

Ey, ask me what I wanna be when I grow up, I ain't just gonna blow up
I'm a star I got astronomers tryin' to get a close up
Telescopes and cameras, rappers wanna use glamors
But I'm gleamin' from the planets, homie, mine is called Kansas City
The cloud in my pocket's gotta rain on 'em (Tell 'em!)
Such a star I saw Heaven's walls and wrote my name on 'em
So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed Everest
You might as well say the boy is Himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon, Mr. Smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin' me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is Craig Smith Airlines
A ride from Kansas City to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices, my votes are
Twice as high as Obama's and I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as Tech's tour bus, the light skinned one
So if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun

I'm in the air
High in the air

Yeah, don't mean to brag but I froze my piece
And I'm gettin' higher then a nose bleed seat
Don't bring her to my session, if your ho sees me
She'll drop dead in the studio like ODB
Yeah, it's the owner and I'm very cool
Plus this weed keep me higher than an air balloon
Copy cat, like what I'm wearing dude?
I'm so fly, I walk around with a parachute
And even rappers lie too
But I'm the only human with an astronaut suit
See yo entire verse? Say that your iron squirt
When you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)
If suckers still on that hatin' shit
I'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips
I'll bend they ass up like a paper clip
Tech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip

I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air
High in the air

I ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is
Why call me underground when I rock the stars?
And even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars
My hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars
One-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight ajar
You want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system
Cause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die
Mack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?
Civilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor
Blasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma
In the air like Dancer and Dasher
High in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska
Higher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya
Super-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture
The wack, I will cast ya down below those who get caught up in my rapture
Don't be callin' me ""dog"" cause I want you to say it backwards

I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air

It's probably 'cause they make it hop and twerk the pole

Bounce to the techno festival, see lots of lesbo

To the bedroom or up in the bathroom
Givin' me and my homeboys a show

Overwhelming,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"This is so, so crazy
This long journey
Look at all the love you gave me
You gave me the strength
To keep on moving forward
Pushing me past the stars
Now the light I'm running toward

At the bottom of the barrel, I was like the rotten apple
And I never graduated, no gown, no cap and a tassel
But I stole my education, now I got my teachers baffled
Wonder why I filled the title of number one independent
God picked my name in the raffle
I was dealt a bad hand, wasn't gonna amount to nothing
Thank god that I had fans, keyboards, mics and percussion
Cause with that yo I elevated, now I'm just celebrated
Whenever Tecca Nina hit the public
Taking so many pictures, signing my autograph
Leaving messages on your voice mails and I love it
With all this new success I can't believe this love level
Specially when they thought that I was devil
A painted up psycho brother who loves metal
The response is overwhelming, for the love can't thank you enough
Dedicated to all the people who got me out of hell
Ya'll saved my life and stuff

I opened up my heart, showed you what I had inside
An ocean full of truth, too deep for the lies
You made it to the pain, had to swim through the pride
There's nothing else I need to survive
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)
So overwhelming!(So, so, so)
(Yeah, ay, it kept me alive yeah!)
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, its so, so!)
So overwhelming!(So, so, so)
(Yeah, it kept me alive yeah, yeah, come on!)

Back in the days I went through visions
In my head, dreams that you'd listen
But my wonderful fans they came
And made it all come to fruition
Sometimes with the females
I'll straight show my gratitude through kissin'
On the cheek, for the youngsters, foreheads
Or a legal pound for the fella's that screw vixens
Way back then I was bitter, was unused my music is litter
So mad and I'm mad I got jitters
Didn't consider that in a second I would be bigger
The label found that I was a hard hitter
I'd give'r shit was delivered hella hard from a spitter, gritter
Recognizing all the humongous love I'd get
On Facebook and positive messages on Twitter
This is how I tell you, thank you
To all of my fans, I thank you
And you can tell all those suckers
That hate on the Nina they just upset that they ain't you
Cause their favorite artist is lame
And neglects his fans, he does do
But your favorite artist goes out of his way
To show you that he loves you


So here's to all of my fans
You're making my dreams come true
You helped me create this land
By believing that this one new
That one is N9ne, you brung
His time to everyone and rhymed
All though some is blind you brung
His lines to the sun and shined
Technician hunts, keeping my every condition pumped
Giving you what your suspicion wants
Waking up these hissing punks
To the early Strange fans
Thank you for feeling my pain man
But for the newbies - I'm so, so glad
That you made it, welcome to Strangeland
The tattoos, the tears, the gratitude, the years
My life's my debt through sound
Thank you, cause Tech you found
Just know that I'm thankful and
I will never ever let you down


Wow, thank you to all who love me
I mean it more than you know
I love you for feeling my music
And coming to every show
And I will forever be there
Through rain, sleet or snow
You're right there with the stars

Red Byers (Say Som’n Do Som’n),Planet,2018.0,"Say som'n, do som'n, that's the way that I was raised
But we living in different ways nowadays
But no matter what you was taught
Every man must hold his own

Pac told me, ""Reach the block, homies""
When the thot's know me then you get guacamole
Still gotta watch police even if you got dough these
Haza's will not scold me, 'cause I am not Toby
I am a king, I made my mark on this planet, I am cha-ching
That's my Asian name, I get dough from rhymin' supreme
I was poor, now I am a thing, I was low as slime in latrines
That's amazin' man, I put the 'woop' on it, a few moments
Then you gon' get a new song with 'soo-woo' on it
The youth want it in groups to use the loop on this
A bad man, that's what I am, an odd one
Never ask me what your broad done
I'ma say to the brethren Wagwan
Solid as Haile Selassie, so it's nobody to stop me
Plus I got Maudie to watch me, free from the thottie's debauchery
Stay away from fed's wires, come fake with us and you gonna get lead fired
'Cause we known to say som'n, do som'n (what?), Red Byers

And if I ever started to fall
I'd land with both feet on the ground, makin' me ten feet tall
Looking like, ""Wassup now?"" Say som'n, do som'n
""Wassup now?"" Say som'n, do som'n
Ah me? Say som'n, do som'n
Still OG Say som'n, do som'n

If I said it I meant it, this how I live
I'll die for it, that's how I am

You can't send a suburban black or white cop who never been to the hood, to the hood
'Cause the perception they get from all the killings on the TV ain't never good, in the hood
So it's nervous when they give service, no courage can lead to murders
The squirters make them assertive and the hurt; it can't be refurbished
When the word is ""We deserve it"" 'cause someone alerted
We flirted with purges, leavin' us dead and deserted
Permanently dirted, inserted in a pine box, I'm not dyin' shot
Tryna make my time stop, N9ne got them slimes that mind pop
And they never do dime drop, born on N9ne' block to crime dot
Then the rhymes locked, where they find bop
I can still walk on Highland, walk on Wayne, claimin' what I ought to claim
Soft and sensitive simple suckers, they take the walk of shame
Heads wire, like if they bled, ours, the dead flyers
Because we say som'n, do som'n, Red Byers

And if I ever started to fall
I'd land with both feet on the ground, makin' me ten feet tall
Looking like, ""Wassup now?"" Say som'n, do som'n
""Wassup now?"" Say som'n, do som'n
Ah me? Say som'n, do som'n
Still OG Say som'n, do som'n

All I got is my name
Long as my name is good, I'm good

Feel evil, really though, sinister shit for illy blokes
Who milly tote for silly folks, bustin' 'til they chilly most
Kill these broke enemies, finna be until he croaks
Leavin' 'em wrapped in a drilly coat
Crossin' him with a chin like a billy goat
We talk this way 'cause we been through so much
Impossible to have no guts
Anybody fakin', we say hold up, we got our street and city sewed up
That's from all the fightin' and bumpin', we found the light in the sunken
Hole, down is plight and dysfunction, plowed us right into something
Hours frightin' and then funkin' but the cowards pryin' and punchin'
And the pal is tryna trump him, now we flyin' and bumpin'
Flyin' higher than med tryers, we bred sires and they bed lie-ers
They get nothing and we got everything, Fred Meyer
I salute the triple OG, Red Byers",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-red-byers-say-somn-do-somn-lyrics
Too Many Girls,The Gates Mixed Plate,2010.0,"See she the object of my affection
Nah, I take that back
See she the object of my erection
I gotta use protection
I'm way too paranoid, so I'm avoiding the infection
To get her in position I use different voice inflection
How you doing?
That nannies high on a pedestal
I need an intervention
Attention I need is medical
They rev me like an engine
I'm itchin' to get my antidote
So give me an inch and I'm into it like it's cantaloupe
Be girls, be girls, be girls everywhere
I can't help but stare
I'm just hoping that they share
Overseas they call me KaliBobbitto Frejo
He called Mr. Bookoo Speedy Labito
Do 'em in then they ask for me to do 'em again
I ain't playin' with them girls but they like to pretend
Like I'm their boyfriend for the night so I treat them a little meaner
It's been too many years and surely been way too many girls

I do way too many girls
I simply, plainly have too many all around the world
So if you trippin' with your lady
She might be-be with Tecca Nina or with Kali Baby
I do way too many girls
I simply, plainly have too many all around the world
So if you look and you don't see her
She might be with Kali Baby or be with Tecca Nina

Hey, I really like you so maybe we
Can go half on a baby see
Countries take a chance with crazy me
And I never wanna be shady
T don't give a damn were the other ladies be
Andrea I mean Damicica, damn
Man I think I got ADD
I'm callin' you to say I think I've seen the light
Reg should come over right now and just sleep with me tonight
Sarah please I mean Teresa Jeez I steady keep losing sight
Cause they bodies be hella tight
Even though it's wrong the feelings right
My bed is so ready to get run up by incredible sex
I just wanna set up and get ate up caress your straight edible breasts
Do you hear me Loretta, sorry bout that Gina
Would you give me that thing I really want you Stephanie I mean Katrina
I get calls from Lacey, from Amber, and sometimes Sabrina
They all over my demeanor
So they stand in line for the wiener
From Christina, Pam, and big booty Jay
The one with Jareeta
And the Louse beauty queen and Tayaneeta
Said you got too many girls Nina


I need a girl Nina
Ain't no sense in me lyin'
I'm like Biggie you buy her wine
And I just creep from behind her
Say she wanna be on my team
Lickin' clits and vagina
Never mind me you'll never Kevin Federline me
Too many girls, girls, girls around the world
They wanna eat my pussy buy your girl diamonds and pearls
I need a girl Nina
I like her but shes scarin' me
Sextin' me she like bury me
Since prop 8 bitch wanna marry me
I need a girl Nina
I ain't it but I'll bet a fifth (she's Strange)
And I like it Pam and Kandy wanna do me
Jessica wanna make a movie
Tiffany will buy me Gucci if I let her lick my coochie
I need a girl Nina
To put me in her moutha
I got these girls gone
Mind lost like Jimmy Hoffa
I need a girl Nina
These girls is Tecca Nina crazy
She says she wanna lick me and have Krizz Kali babies

Tappin’ In,Planet,2018.0,"I got a story to tell, 'bout when I ginormously fell
Won't say no names though, 'cause it ain't no game, bro
And it ain't no angle makin' no woof tickets for me to sell
It's about two buddies in the middle of bout due
A lady on the daily puttin' out to
One of the buddies, she told him never let his mouth spew
Don't let your boy know what's happenin'
'Cause we were together, plus shackin' in
That's what you call get some back in friends
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
[Verse 1: Tech N9ne & 
Joey Cool
]
I was twenty-one
She was 40-somethin', say she wanna give me some
So I started puttin' Tecca Ninna in the lungs
Of the photographer that my homie Brian B'zle brung
But it was a catch, she didn't want a nigga to rack
'Cause her and my homie were together, he'd give her the scratch
After every photo-shoot but he'd have a bitter attack
If he knew his colleague would shoot me then deliver the snatch
So I kept her secret like a dummy, keepin' it professional
I didn't tell my homie but I was full of regret, you know?
Ridin' out with my homie, out my mouth, ain't no decibels
'Bout when she finished flickin' me, we'd bang out on the sectional
I used to throw him hints sayin', ""I really wanna smash her""
Then he would look at me like I was done it with laughter said
""She would never do it, I don't know what you after
Out of your league, man you young, broke and plus you a rapper""

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne & 
Joey Cool

She would pick me up for photo sessions
But I didn't tell my homie we were low-low sexin'
Man this lady had a body like she was SoloFlex'n
So right after work, she let me give her a pogo lesson
No confession never told him, I was grindin'
On his workin' roommate, I was slimin'
But I messed up and told my other homie Big Nick
But when me and him fell out he told my best friend
That I was lyin' all this time and then my homie said
Why is you playin' me, I'm hearing too many rumors
Yo you got something to say to me, man?
You know about my affection for that woman that stay with me
You supposed to be my homie, why you fuckin' and fakin'?
And then I gotta hear from someone else
You selfish man all you think about is your fuckin' self
You and her be together, I don't need no one's help
I'm feel like I'm finna lose it, I don't know what I'ma do
But I swear to...
Hold on my nigga, you can't be callin' me trippin'
I'm with my family and I don't know what the hell you talkin' 'bout that's fuckin' insanity man
Why you lyin' to me bro, you know these people be talkin'
And their stories sound the same and you makin' it awkward
And I ain't finna be the type to act like this don't really hurts
What am I supposed to do 'bout it when I'm at work?
You and her, we supposed to be brothers that make it worse
And he told me everything y'all be doin', don't do me dirt
Don't deny it homie, really you oversteppin' your turf
Told me y'all was snappin' photos and you removin' her skirt
Even said I shoulda known this fuckin' chick was a flirt
Well how you gonna believe every damn thing he say?
Dog you for real? You shoulda told me without a delay
We was like fam, now you got me dealin' with hearsay
And everything that he say, she say
Oh, I gotta go

So that is how me and my best friend fell out
'Cause I told another homie something he had to yell out
All of our bidness ventures and dreams was the hell out
And I'm left with underhanded things that I can tell 'bout
Lost my best friend, 'cause I was young and dumb
He lost his life to another brother with a gun
I never got to tell him that I was sorry, I was sprung
My other homie just died of cancer, I'm numb
So the moral of the story is don't
Lie to get something that you really want
Always keep it real, though a lot of people don't
That's why they always in funk

I'm gonna one day soon be the best at rap like (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But did I lose lots when some people in my life didn't act right? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But now when I rock, every show I see the venue be packed like (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nueve

I've been down that road and I've been thinkin' lately
Through it all I made it through the pain, yeah (ayy)
I been rockin' for a minute, think I'm crazy
But they'll never catch me outta line

Yeah, strange at birth
Born to make a difference when I came to Earth
But Mama never warned me 'bout the pain, the hurt
In the heart and the brain when the game flames ya church
Why do they make road blocks, when the flow's hot?
They said, my music will never fit in the pro slot
Probably why I sell out the cities when I globe trot
Now my wall of records are in platinum and gold box
(Platinum and gold box, platinum and gold box
Platinum and gold box, platinum and gold box)
The game can't kill a nigga ego
When they want it from a hundred to zero
I know the man's plot bury take a below
But you can't block Curry at the free throw
Look how Strange came in the game like Deebo
In the beginning, we did a show in a gazebo
Now we got hits and takin' pics with the people
But they won't play me if I don't mix with the Migos
If you tell me that my music didn't fit they program (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said, that the music I make wasn't fit for the broham (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, I've been down that road
At the crib, checkin' out every sound that sold
'Til I found that soul of a clown that flows
Then it got her to slither and spin around that pole
So many haters were tryna drown Tech's rolls
And stoppin' him from blossomin' nigga, now that grows
No blockin' him, lockin' them wit' a frown that froze
When he bossin' then he lost 'em when the underground let go
They wanted to hold down Tech's blow
But people ain't keepin', they chiefin' a pound that's Dro
Even seepin' around Death Row
Increasin' my releasin' to many towns, that's dough
But some people wanna delay the bag
Even though you kill everything when you display the gas
Spray the mag, Ninna blast like a laser tag
To who paid the cash, thinkin' I'ma stray the path
Ay, did they doubt me often? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But now when they talk about Tech, will they all take caution? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
For the price of fame and what you gain, is it worth what it's costin'? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Am I gonna be the real deal still 'til I'm laid in the coffin? (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Anywhere,The Storm,2016.0,"Anywhere but here
I'd rather rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Question: Anybody ever feel
That some people around you claim to be solid but ain't real?
In relationships, business, family, in the end it's about they bills
And everyone of them wanna cheat and steal
Time for me to have no chill
Come and get ya meals and they really will with zeal
All is needy, y'all is greedy, I'm falling freely
This gonna be scogging me, we brawling easy, had a lawman seize me
Get the hell on stay, what ya gonna do but if it's a fail on pay
Loved ones exude hella rude when it used to be smooth
Like the face of Janelle Monáe
She's got the glee stopped
I'm in a pit of animals really making me bleed lots
Fatigue I wanna leave then my knee dropped
When I breathe not 'cause she needs guap
So extract me from this place full of hate that attacks me
Pass the sack 'cause I'm trying to get to happy
Exactly people are feeding  they call me nasty at me

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

Listen
They don't love you no more
They discover your flow
But I'm feeling my fans trying to shudder don't slow
Leaving the clown now I'm nothing but a bozo to 'em
Give my all in my sessions
I never thought that I would fall in regression
The music business now we call it recession
We bawl and we stressing 'cause y'all is divesting
I feel it when I ought to be top of these
Where the hip hopper be and The Rock put me
At the forefront but galore won, nothing but the Pac could be hypocrisy
They forgot about the prophecy that I keep the lock and key
But they talking ""He soft"" and flee now they wanna coffin me
Y'all can be treacherous, I'm the best at this effortless
But with Tech it's been deficits
Wanna fly away like a Pegasus
I feel like the scare is near, they don't care that Tech share his tears
At this moment, at this point in time I'd rather be anywhere but here

I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

I'm sure to be
At this rate, a nigga that fades into obscurity
I can't take bein' treated like an amateur
This is impure to me
In closing, it's messed up when you know you one of the chosen
But you can't have a show when nobody rose and all the people go when everything's frozen

Crap for making that mistake she make the splat evaporate

Lives when you think better dead it, lies what you hate hella wet it

Flows be constant, I rock from here to Wisconsin
My killer flows makes me jerk my Johnson

He's strange and I like it
He's strange just the way he is
Tecca Ninna, Tecca Ninna (What's up?)
Why you so damn psycho? (Couldn't tell you, baby)
(Makin' rella, baby, flippin' hella, baby)
(Ask your nearest fortune teller, baby)

Mushroom headed, keeps me prophetic
But that slow-motion makes me see life like a movie
The Bombay brella with a ganja stick it'll get you stuck
If you let it calm me, but no calming Aaron Dante
Just call me the strange or Stran-gé, bombay
Distinguishing the kcuf from tihs
From hip-hop come this
Apocaflypse got control of your hips
Its beautimous, hella rap metamorphosis
MC corpseses around me
They found me Jacuzzin' with my sorceresses
Fire up the vega, get blowed
And roll to a spot with biancs
Then bust holes in their O's
So different, they wanna kill me like they killed Bruce Lee
On the set, no shit
Saw my bianc with baguettes
Middle West flex flows, likes to sex those
Little wet flesh holes, insane brain frames
Never that plain Jane


I give myself a C-section with a rusty jagged weapon
Bungee wit 100 feet of slack
In front of my kids with no discretion
Strange days like Julia Lewis and Angela Bassett off in a casket
Trippin' with the N9ne
Get your mind blown like a head gasket
Mizzery is in the house for the '99 shot
Futuristic ladies love me a whole whole lot
When demons try to do me jew
They know they wicked
So I bust 'em if you ain't down with 3DQ
Who be you?
Nina Tech, respect, MidWest Side for life
Grab a mic and hurt you like a LaBianca murder
The sound-lab got my microchip screwed
Malfunction, tihs kcuf ouy mub, now I'm cool
Pain givers, slang spitters, hang niggas, insane figures
No shame, aim triggers, lame brain splitters, vein slitters
Gang critters, dame hitters, Wayne livers, narcotical strange nigga",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-strange-lyrics

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
As I fall, and I fall, then continuously fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In the dark, but I saw, so I grabbed and I clawed

Pressure, when pressed against my chest, yes, sir, the aggressor
But if I don't breathe, I'm gonna be on a stretcher
Plugged up like a Tesla, steady gaspin'
Chill bumps like we're streaking in Aspen
'Cause I'm receiving what is the reason for Aspirin
And hear blasting is in fashion but I can't swim
And that undercurrent, I mean riptide
Is strong enough to give a brother an abyss ride
And be a stiff guy that got the fish eyes
That is the grimness but I'm on a sin bliss
The reason I'm in this position
I was trying to contend with the water
But then drips'll put you in endless submission
Steady falling now, but it's better than cocaine
And I'm recalling how this feeling is so flame
Just like New Orlean child, how the feeling'll blow brains
Put you all in clouds, near death but no pain, damn

Hot as hell but like Heaven, bite yeps
A lot in braille on my seven, right hand
When the throbbing swell, I think I got impaled
I leave a soggin' trail, I'm not pheasant, like damn, like damn
Sinking underneath, but what I'm really thinking is I wanna eat
But young defeats the tongue when you gun the teeth
Swung the beast, and everything becomes deceased
Suffocating in the best way

But let's say shortage of breath play
Will get the N9na really going like a jet may

A fresh bae clean is how I get the ex-say
Can't breathe like this, but I don't see crisis
Extremely pipe dick, one of my many vices
It's a trippy time, I wanna hit rewind

And when you sit feline on the dinner with a big behind
I really love it when we 69

Bianca’s and Beatrice’s,Absolute Power,2002.0," Let's go holler at her real quick
 Ooh shit, we gotta do that
 What's your name baby?
 Bianca...
(Tech and Kutt both start laughing)
 What'chu laughin' for?
 (still laughing) Ah nothin', nothin' baby it's cool, you know what I'm sayin

Bianca’s and Beatrice’s are known for wettin' mattresses
And bendin' over in the ill positions
Bianca's and Beatrice's they love the way I'm rappin' this
I dig 'em then I pluck 'em then I diss 'em

I'm kickin' it wit' this chick up in the club I'm off the Lou
And when you're on that Caribou you know just what you do
I called her Bianca, then she said ""What is that Bianca shit?""
I looked and cracked a smile and said Bianca means you, bitch
You's a Bianc' baby, whether you like it or not
But you hot especially when x and vicodin popped
If you trippin' you can hike it and hop
'Cause you know what I came to do
Me and my villains come to strike it and stop
Pipe it and prop, ya leg up and get up
Bianca hold ya head up, ya sex wet the bed up
Everybody's ponderin', wonderin' about my slang that I spit
You can use it when you refer to a dame or a chick
Don't be trippin' about the choice of words I'm usin' on this script
Don't step off in my face 'cause you can bet I come equipped
You wanna know what to say to get the Bianc' to let you blend? (What?)
Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn!


You that new green nigga Kutt Calhoun (Who that?)
You know that big-lip pretty nigga wit' the gold teeth (oh) be rapping with Tech
Heard he just signed a big deal, an estimated 5 or 6 million
That nigga fine if he willing, I'ma blow his mind (bitch!)
Big lips and all the things involved got your whole brain dissolved
You couldn't squeeze in these drawers if you was my dick and balls
I tell you man, theses dames are lame, greedy, raunchy, and dykes
A nigga gets a bit of fame and Bianca’s be like:
(Sow yo' ro-yal oats,)
Beatrice's sayin' (Hell yeah yeah yeah yeah)
But Kutty be like (Ho no slow yo' roll)
Buffoon to busy tryin' to zoom off into the (upper room!)
Claiming they Cath-o-lic, licking asses, off ecstasy
Weed and hashes, and hits of acid, addressing me
Just ‘cause I rap, bitch you gettin’ nasty
Gone wit'cho nasty ass pizzazz ashy slash sassy, Beatrice!


Beatrices means more than one Bianca
They actresses, bring 'em sex toys and ganja
We activists, ain't no yes boys, we monsters
And macks at this, ring ya best noise we conquer
The fact is this: say you don't wanna when you want to
Relax to this ecstasy and Willy Wonka
We slaps a bitch, 'cause me and my niggas are bonkers
We stacks the hits, no Coleco, Tyco, or Tonkas
Immaculate get the motherfucker you honor
A laxative, 'cause they boo-boo bitin' piranhas
My gats'll spit, 'til you player haters are goners
Like Maximus, I'm gladiator for na-na
My raps assist the beat that disturbin' ya mama
They scrap to this, welcome wicked witness the trauma
So clap to this, while you puffin' yo' marijuana
Get back to this, (what) Beatrice's and Bianca's


Yo, yo, yo, baby…
I’m so sorry if your name is Bianca or Beatrice…
I know they givin' you a hard time about it, you know what I’m sayin'? (laughs)
Ey yo, it’s just some lingo, though, Tech N9ne lingo, you know what I’m sayin?

Holier Than Thou,Killer,2008.0,"We been doing this for a long long time now...
This music thing... and touring, y'know...
And still... I ain't met one person that could maintain righteousness
Know what I'm sayin'?

A wise man told me evil was lurkin' and if you found it
Try your best to not put yourself around it
'Cause when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but
Then it’s the sin you begin it, then wish that you stayed grounded
I went all over the world and I done been through it
At the beginning, I knew I wouldn't give in to it
But temptation, oh what the sensation
Women I am embracin', so many of them waitin'
Contemplatin' how to get fornication
At yo door when it's late with the motivation of Satan
So they say, but things go they way
And it's more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today
But lust it sets in, and crush your chest in
For dust you're destined, if drugs are let in
Enough to nest in, prolly make you punch your best friend
And next kin 'cause you let S-E-X win
You mean to tell me you can fight this land
With brightness and walk the path of the righteous man?
Yo, I wanna believe that, itching to see that
If a positive person can shake the negative feedback
That this life has to offer when it's faster
What a disaster if you didn't obey the master
'Cause that's mutiny, it would be new to me
If you was on tour with Tecca N9na and still you could be

(Don’t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you
(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the

How can I move the crowd without losin' out on my faith?
Lucifer out of the way (way)
Or maybe he don't even exist
I ain't gotta trip off gettin' hookers out of my system (get you out of my system)
See that's how he tricks 'em
Get 'em sippin' then a big ol' mickey he slips them (I wonder why)
Music soothes the savage soul
People can lose it when we lack control
Really get used to livin' fast and so
We smashin' women then they bypass they soul
They believin' everything we breathin'
Half of us is Jesus, the other half is heathen
And how we get that bad half out?
We pray the Lord'll cast that out
Hope he got blessings left and pass that out
When we travellin' and pass that route
Keep us under your graces in places where we have that doubt
Where I stand, he's pointin' at me, but it's with my hand
I need you, you holier than I am, I am

This verse was intended for a gospel rapper
That we all admire and he goes by the name of Da' T.R.U.T.H
All we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction
And maybe if he came we could change and regroup
So we laid it down and sent it hopin' he would rap wit' us, track splittas
Waited, and none of his people got back wit' us
We kept callin' and they finally answered, when a month passed
We was prepared to do whatever, give it if he wants cash
But the lady who represent him would never send him a message from a secular messenger
Never be no nepotism, we s'posed to be brothers, on the road to teach others
But the flow would be covered, better mess with the Tech they know that we smother
Anybody that diss us, retired of they weak flow
'Cause this is the pinnacle, nobody flyer than me, bro
If you didn't like it then I admire the ego
And if they never told you, then you better fire ya people
'Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em
But Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims
But they always helpin' in the hood, but y'all closed me out
Y'all didn't even really wanna know what we 'bout
And we bombay, T.R.U.T.H ain’t on this, so the Don' spray
And I had to spit on it 'cause I couldn't afford Kanye
I needed help, your people showed me the wall
Below me is y'all, I guess y'all wasn't holy at all... naw!

Much love to the gospel MC J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation
Even though most if his peers told him not to 'cause we secular MCs
Thanks for giving me Da' T.R.U.T.H. CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro. God bless you, for being so

For her to live a better life, be the wife, living with someone

What if I am not the dude for you that nauseousness comes
Oh wow, shit, save her, save her

And I’m feeling lifeless
Cause I want you happy

Cherish the day, but then roll out when the day go
Ridin' away your pain and sorrow
Live for today cause you might not see tomorrow

Roguish are red and violets are blue
And we all get purple rain when you put together the 2
True, lets talk about this street I know
Meta meta yo is needed when it's time for me to go
I spent my whole life on this KC street
The PASEO where the real stay and the fake sees heat
Gangstas lay low, get the queso and everyday breathe deep
But when the day goes all the broads out cause the baby's sleep
On Paseo I reminisce if they love me then give `em this
Never know when to go `cause this life is so hit and miss
Cry for me? Never just have a ball wit' each other
`Cause that's what I had thanks goes out to my father and mother
And I love you, so mama, if I ever happen to go, mama
I think there's something you should know, mama
I stayed away `cause I was tryin' to become something
Give a house to that one woman

Off '85th came back from Cali then I stayed with Krizz
Off '76th my first baby was conceived
Off '75th was with slow mo in conditions you wouldn't believe
74th and Paseo on the corner, slept with the AK
For my homie Scoob anybody came through that door was a gonner
64th I ate balogna and kicked it with mak and sonya
In French Village I sold dope for my folks in a place with a crack aroma
63rd street is the landin' of Bishop Hogan
Demandin' y'all just keep rollin' expandin' on bishop strollin'
Mastered music on 61st if I didn't use it I would spit the verse
This is how how you find me if demons happen to hit me first
Right on 58th I lived from 12 to 17 with
Basima kechramin, marty, hassan and hakim
57th and 56th I had a ball I learned some tricks I learned some schemes
From my homeboys, y'all know who I mean
RDVs
 
55th paul's liquor try and talk slick if you crazy
Results in getting stomped by doc and stu-baby
Keep ridin' paseo for me if you rollin' solo tonight
Just keep on thinkin' marco polo for life when you're

What's the paseo, hah, 49th street
On 47th is gates and sons where Tech N9ne eats
39th at the bootleg I used to find peace
But at the scottish right on lynnwood masons at times meet
I used to kick it on 27th and 28th Troost Lake
Careful... you might find yourself off in that piece if you hate
19th was my family's church they tried to save me too late
`Cause doin shows on 18th and vine that was my true fate
Mary Lou Williams was my aunt, 9th where I was raised
Wayne Minor way back in the day they used to fight no one was framed
But now on independence ave I hear my son donnie
Sayin' that he hear gunshots every night
On 5th and it scares his momma ronnie
End of the road 29 north to the bridge
If I go im leavin' everything to my wife and my kids
Travis if I go whatever my half is you give her
And no funeral just throw my ashes in the Missouri River

Grip to touch it, was givin' up the Bourbon gluten

Then to hushing, the jig is up and the lip is tucking
Give you the way that's never fit in, I couldn't adjust it
On a psycho-path
Get to screwing up everything like a carpenter
I be scared of myself dead ass
Even ruin our  lot like a card dealer

What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue.. I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Do you feel me? *It's my last words*
What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue.. I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Can you hear me? *It's my last words*

Talk about some of the things that really eat away at you
Like your career, your music...
And don't hold back Aaron, 'cause again these sessions
Are to extract the things that could possibly make you explode

When y'all listen to my music I think y'all take it lightly
But I been raw since the beginning just ask my Uncle Ikey
He will tell you royalty's been planted deep in my psyche
All you peasants hail the king just call me Aaron almighty
So when you critique my music you sound like fools to me
And I don't think you deserve to hear another jewel from me
The industry cheated me, repeatedly cruel to me
So now I act conceited, guess you needed no grooves from me
I've had it, I'm tired mane
You niggas is fired mane
'Cause you know me and Travis was supposed to inherit the entire thang
I'm normal, I've never admired fame
I'm just famous 'cause I'm a fuckup and y'all desire pain
So don't talk to me when you see me
Awfully's how you treat me
Off of me, everybody leave me
It costed me, never was it easy
So say goodbye to the bad guy a nigga don't have anymore to sell you
This might be the last time you hear a bad guy like Tecca Nina baby, let me tell you

What more can I say to you?.. I (Yeah)
Talk until my face is blue.. I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Do you feel me? (Supposed to be more than this, man)
What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue.. I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Can you hear me? (I'm outta here)
See I've been inside out
Y'all heard the best of it
Got no more to give
There ain't no rest of it.. there
I'm all out there but y'all don't care
I got no more to bare, yeah
What more can I say to you?.. I (That's right)
Talk until my face is blue.. I (Fuck It)
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Can you feel me? (I gave everything I could give)
What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue.. I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Do You feel me?
I don't wanna hear nothin' else man, I just wanna
Go somewhere with my children, man
Disappear, like dear God
Make me a bird so I can fly
Fly far away from here...

Not a Damn Thing,Planet,2018.0,"I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
Instead of work, I just wanna play
Plus I pulled away a fat stack anyway
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
They wanna know what I'ma do today
Not a damn thing, fuck what anybody say

What? Where they do that?
Why they do that? (what?)
Why they do that?
Why they do that?

Right here right now
I really wanna know where the smoke and booze at
I'm taking a off day, yup and I ain't 'bout to lose that
I'm finna be absent like Bueller (Bueller)
Now's the time, the time is happening like Mueller (Mueller)
Not a hair has been seen, it's not an embarrassin' thing
Callin' in, lyin' to kick, it's the American dream like
I'm gonna blow a cone by the pool
Smoke up to many songs, I can choose
Then right to my phone, call my crew
Hit up Stevie Stone, Frizz, JL, and Joey Cool
That's diggable, now my homies is with me
That'll tell my chick, hit some hippie
Make thickies, that's less miserable
In Tech's crib you know, everybody gonna get physical
Eat some food then turn on the tube for Netflickables

I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
Instead of work, I just wanna play
Plus I pulled away a fat stack anyway
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay

Where they do that? (what?)

Right here in America, we work until our hands are blue-black
So we cherish a day to ditch, I thought you knew that
Uh, I'm tryna party at home baby, I'm tryna, uh, fuck off!
I'ma be stuck in a zone baby
With a prime cut Don's finest wine to help me buss off!
Yeah, hit the liq', hit the bong
If the missus is trippin, you tell the missus you grown
If it quick as the bitchin', run to the strippers with thongs
Working the daytime shift and ya'll get to sip and it's on
T'was a hell of a ditchin' day, a lie in a biggun way
But the grown up responsibilities, you gotta be the kid and play
I deserve to be ghost to you, 'cause I am King
So today I just chose to do not a damn thing

I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
Instead of work, I just wanna play

I don't wanna do a damn thing today

Show 'em how to Gangsta Shap
'Cause where I'm from, that's where all the gangstas at
And when we come, yo we get to actin' a ass

See we go stewie-ooee, rep from the Bay, all the way
To Missouri-ouri, back it up on me mama
Look what you do to me-ooowee
We do it wrong gone off Caribou Lou-ee-ooee
Or that super dewy-ooee
Cheers!
One or two beers and you shap, it's like
Lean and rock with it, only you don't lean and snap, you like:
Left side, right side, hands about chest high
Then you wink at shorty in the corner with the left eye
(How you doing?) I'm off a little somethin' leanin'

It's too many chiefs and not enough soldiers
For the world wars, standin' on the front line
Tighten my toga, I'm a Greek god
Blood affiliated, Deuce Klik Street Mob
And I put this souly on my dookie brown dickies
Hail to the B side
Capnaptavate these Killa City killings
Nigga you can't calculate big cli-dips long
Inner City menaces, these kids get it on!
We don't fight no more, all we do is this
All we do is this, lately it's been through a bitch
And that's the cost for livin' in the center of Killa City
Where these niggas Willy Wonka chop at any men
Who feeling they really raw, get to pullin' dogs
At the dark da-nin-nin-nents, nobody for you to call
When they do dissolve, just a harsh remembrance
You might've got through it all, but was too involved
And it's very scary, it's kind of pathetic
Nobody is sympathetic, when you dead and buried
We rugged and rigid, no pun is intended
And when them thangs go clap
We gangstas mane, we bang and trap
Remember killas don't dance, man

I remember my school days, when I was a dancer
Back when LL Cool J was walking with a panther
Actually dancing was not, but rap was the answer
But with the shap, it's cool for the gangsta to dance too
Still here we stand with this dance that spread like a cancer
Cool for the man, even the woman or the baby in pampers
Dance that is deep and it's dirty like the crevice of your hamper
Raisin' your hands up high in this bitch 'cause you amped up (go!)
Nike Air Jordan at the bottom in the middle was a Nautica pair
Lot of erotica there, but up top I got the gangsta black
Doin' the Gangsta Shap, nigga thanks for that Imperial nigga
You don't want to see me go speedy, bro need to see me flow
Never get this shappin' up out of me, he better see the dough
We be so cold with it, boy we need some wool mittens
Ladies just roll with it, everything is cool, kitten
Tilt your head like you got some screws missin'
But have that look on your face like when you say you bullshittin'
Gangsta Shap

Ooh man, that Gangsta Shap shit, man
I'm feeling that shit, man
Ya gotta show me how to do that dance, man
Where y'all from anyway, man?
Y'all from Missouri? Ya talking 'bout KCMO?
Roll on Missouri, man
I'm feeling that shit, man

Heavy,Boiling Point: K.O.D. Collection,2012.0,"Deformity, a bodily malformation; check
Distortion, or disfigurement; check
A deformed person or thing; check
Gross, ugliness; check

I don't wanna take this, I don't wanna carry this, I don't wanna lift this
Everyday, when I wake, wishin' was a way that I can rip this
Off of my shoulder off of my back, like a big boulder got me off track
I don't wanna be seen lookin like that
I'm looking at it, it's mean lookin right back
Ugly, bloody, pussin', heavy
Way more sinister than Leatherface, Jason or Fuckin' Freddy
And that shit weighs me down, got me going crazy now
Lazy round me place, cause I got shit right side of my face
How did I get it? How did I grow it? How do I cock back and just blow it
Off? Surgery yes you know it cost and I ain't goin out to show it off
I'm just stuck in here, with this fuckin' weird stuff in near
Crushin', pussin', bustin' till it up and clears
I'm ready, it's wicked, it's gotta be deadly
It's everything you could imagine, bad, twisted, evil and medley
Down into eternal fire, this is where it lead me
Can hardly hold it up because this thing is so fucking heavy

(Ewww, that's gross, yuck, what's that?
Oh my god, disgusting, repulsive, what the fuck?
It's not a tumor, fuck the rumor
I need more to go, stop Staring at this
Mutherfucking side show)
HEAVY (Everyone you love got needs)
HEAVY (I'll shove start to buckle at the kness)
HEAVY (My lord said this slow heal carry
And if it don't then it might get scary)
HEAVY

Cha!
Gotta cover it up, gotta go outside to get food
How when the smell is like shit stew?
The way people are staring and lookin it gets cruel
Bad when I'm shoppin', at the walmart
They be laughin', then a brawl starts
Cause they wanna pick on a muthafucker
With deformities, bless yall heart
I'm sick of it, when it's on my back
I can't even get a women to kiss on this
Face, I don't even want to live on this, place
Because all people givin' is hate
And your really gonna get it bad if your, disfigured
The more these sick gigglers
Pointed my heavy load it gets bigger
They call me hunchback and I wish they wouldn't taunt that
They be lookin at a nigga like I woke up
And showin straight up shittin' in their lunch sack
Kids, grown ups, dogs, cats
All be lookin and pointing at this deformity on my back
Taking over me, I'm slowly, turning into it
This repulsive, nasty, heavy, sick, humongous pile of shit
Under my skin, infecting my blood
Like I have some kind of disease, it's
Big and bulgin out of my jacket and everybody sees it


What is it? With this load I carry there's problems in my life
Got big problems with the IRS and problems with my wife
Got a lot of problems with this music career, problems with my mom
And I gotta solve 'em quick they fallen on me
It's a problem with this shit on, and it's heavy
When everybody depends on you to be the shot caller
And you pushin, tryin to get all of your people
Over the wall, but the shit got taller
But you tough and determined, you rough and you learnin'
You cannot do if you not baller
So you get it and hit it one after another
And look - the lump got smaller",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-heavy-lyrics

Yes, ain't no stoppin' there
Let's go, let's go if you 
choppin' broccoli

Let’s go
If your sittin' at home talking to him on the phone
And he a clone without no style of his own
You wishin' that you was gone, throwin' back the Patrón
?
You ain't wrong because you’d rather be with me in the zone
Let’s go
Sorry, your lady has been taken
You can find us up at the M.O. with the flo' shakin'
And I ain't even the one that’s bringin' her home the bacon
You the one been talking 'bout kickin' my face in?
Let’s go
You can do whateva' you gonna
My rebel persona that got me dressin' red as I wanna,
 ahead ya', stronger
The problem is you dead as a coma
You sick of me, but I’m right here to put the medicine on ya
Let’s go
Got 'em all frightened of the titan
You mice men too light to get fights in with the bison
It's so exciting, my Benz reeled your wife in
I ruin your life when I produce a license

Let’s go
Coming through the do', hella fast, never slow
Got the cash, and the pedal to the flo'

If you wanna ride, let me know
We can slide on the low, whatcha' standin' there fo'?

Posted up, squatin' low like a pit
Ya' know this Patrón changed the whole motion of ya' shit
And I ain't got a desire to proceed without a grip
So we can just do it movin' if it's all on the bitch
Let's go
They likin' the skinny jeans and the kicks
And jewl-e-wels
But I ain't into pleasin' a trick
I'm in the topless Porsche's and keys to a six
So sit back and let the engine breathe a lil bit
Let's go
But I'm highly into hoochie holla harry mode
""Money over beezys"" got it from my uncle Larry though
Superstar to many without playin' on your radio
Addicted to va-gina when she ain't around ve-nereal

Tell 'em it's Raider game
He soakes it up everywhere he go

Well shit, let’s go. Hit that K.C. M.O. straight from the O'
I got that dro, sip that purp. we call it Bow
I hit that burb, and get that urge to knock down all your doors
Get in this car. I’m a star, you ain't noticed yet?
Look at these shoes, look at these jewels shinin' on my neck
I spit that venom, then I send 'em in then remove her denim
And once I'm in 'em, then I bend 'em, not I can’t remember 'em
I stay persistent and consistent when it comes to pimpin'
Your ho gets sentenced from when sin 'tis hit with no repentance
I go the distance when I hit it fuck like I'm demented
Positions switchin' positions shiftin' like I invented
The art of fuckin' suduction we goin' tit for tat
And when she suckin' I'm bustin' I'm tryin to hit here tat

Let Me In,Sickology 101,2009.0," Alright, party night tonight, alright you, come on in
You're good, skinny jeans, come on in, tight shirt, come on in
Ah, that new rock 'n roll gay look, yeah, you're cool, come on in
 What's up, man?
 Hey, man, you can't get in here, boy
 What's wrong with me, man?
 Well, can't you read the sign, boy?
 No French braids, no dread locks, no gold teeth, gold teeth-
Aw, you don't want no black folks in here, huh?
 Can't you read the sign? It says Power and White, I-I mean Power and Light District
 Look here, man
How much it gonna take to turn this all white club, into a nigga club?
 What!?

Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin' there for?
Who I gotta kill or sleep with? Cause I'm the world's best kept secret
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin' there for?
Cause I'm the one that do that music, you feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door

Right now 'fore my goons have to tear it down
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We in clubs and we draggin', actin' brand new
Actin like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Ca$h Image and I'm with Tech N9ne
And 'fore the club close the owner gon' respect mine
We spend a lot of money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's worth a lot of bucks
And you ain't gotta know me, you can tell my dollars up
Poppin' collars in the club, turn the bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy man, you hear my song playin'
And every time we in the club we be spending grands
First deny Tech (What!?), then deny me (What!?)
And I was number 1 on 103 for 40 weeks


You say you hear me knockin', so why you don't wanna let me in?
But I ain't buggin' so tell the cops to come and get me then
Complain about my shoes ain't really talking bout shit
Dude, I spent like 350 on this outfit
NV ain't gon' let me in seein' as he actin' funny with me
What it gonna cost me, homie? I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts, my pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted so now they wanna red flag me
I buy the bar every time, point blank period
The doorman hatin', takin' his job too serious
Me, Ca$h Image, Tech and Kaliko
About big business so what I'm talking to a bouncer for?
The women see me scream my name like the announcer spoke
They actin' brand new this week so I'm about to go
To the block and bubble and get plenty cake
I just wanted women and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck y'all!


I get money from music and I like to spend-spend
When I hit the town I know they're gonna let me ins in
But these other clubs be trippin' like I begin sin
You hear me knockin'? (Aw yeah!) Well, let me in then!
Cause NV ain't so friendly, they got a gay assembly
Of femmes who think the blacks be packin' semis
(That's why they don't sell no Henny)
Stink butts who think bucks
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brink's truck!
Could buy it any day, 2.1 on a new building and lease
Some at The N9ne has plenty say
The rhymin' get me paid so I resign cause NVA
And plus NV stands for no vaginas anyway
They place me and Lil' Weezy, we give no love
That's why when I brought Chingy in there and he peed in your club
Not in the toilet either (No!), you don't enjoy the beaver (No!)
You'd rather plot on how to give a lil' your boy the peter
America's clubbin' phase two, I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando south races they treated me cold
And Lucky Strike in Power and Light won't let the Nina in to bowl
Whoa, guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over one million records sold, lots of money to fold
They should let me in any club in (KC, MO!)
And I'm the biggest tipper, bartenders know me well
And waitresses love me so club owners: (Go to hell!)
You got that blow to sell, but you want this bro to fail
When it really ain't me cause it is your destiny to go to jail
And when you be serving you might see work
On Club Nina when you walk up you might be hurt
You might skee skirt, cause you ain't getting in if you ain't got a
(KC hat and a white t-shirt, ey!)


Only reason I even go to the club is so I can listen to some loud music and drink, holler at a bianc
My neighbors be mad at me cause I be shakin' the whole block with my system
So that's why I go to the club
I gotta work at the club, take pictures and sign autographs, yadada mean?
I don't need to be in your club for real
And club dollars say that I owe them 70 dollars
I paid 125 dollars to get in
Why you trippin I just wanted to drink
So if 70 dollars is owed that means some cats were there after I left
Ya know what I mean ha ha put it on my tab
I don't owe nobody shit",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-let-me-in-lyrics
Table and Chest Stress,Bad Season,2010.0,"I'm about to take it back to sixth grade on y'all
When I ain't had no beats
I just beat on the table and my chest
Like this

I'm here to give you my table and chest stress
Life is so full of fear like an A-I-D-S test
When you’re covered in wet sex
With no glove you're just vexed
Because life is so less blessed
Feel like death is the best bet
I'm here to give you my table and chest stress
Life is so full of fear like an A-I-D-S test
When you’re covered in wet sex
With no glove you're just vexed
Because life is so less blessed
Feel like death is the best bet, bitch

I mean, ain't no way up out of this dream
Nowhere to skip a scene not with all them demons stuck on the screen
So many unrest I bring serene living within means green
But things seem bleak
I'm beesteemed for the kings team
Major corporations firin’ I feel obligated to hire ‘em
Higher desired I’m wired my empire is tiresome
But if she fly I’ll invite her to my asylum
Alumni find relaxation off in her bonsai
This bad season got me in my past sneezin’
Seeing the mother fucka singin' taking the Nina away but I guess they had reasons
’till I had freakin' ash leakin’ nap seepin’ Crash deacon
Givin’ a sermon off my sick and twisted class teachin'
You see now this ain't no fuckin freestyle
My people starvin’ to eat now with the Angela Yee gal and Phillip chow
Niggas is ready to freak out
Yea I got a little money to piece out
To some but the rest be plottin’ on me wanna stick me up like a decal

I'm here to give you my table and chest stress
Life is so full of fear like an A-I-D-S test
When you’re covered in wet sex
With no glove you're just vexed
Because life is so less blessed
Feel like death is the best bet
I'm here to give you my table and chest stress
Life is so full of fear like an A-I-D-S test
When you’re covered in wet sex
With no glove you're just vexed
Because life is so less blessed
Feel like death is the best bet

My Hungarian honey's locked up for manslaughter
Now her mother and father can't even hug their damn daughter
Such an insane part of life really became harder
Only way they saw me in jail was to visit Dwayne Carter
Then I'm off in Spain sort of lame ’cause no dame sought us
Never did play with the labia
All I ate was paella
Then ex bitches its all part of the Tech riches
So I get threats they get vicious
They know I keep with the best bitches
Then I sex with it
To bend her over the table is less stress
With no bra and her breast on the table her chest pressed
My people fallin’ while I continue to jet set
But I got the power to bless
The beat bangin’ yea that's Tech nigga!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-table-and-chest-stress-lyrics

So I hop inside of my Mercedes and let the bass go
On you hatin' ass niggas, I deserve everything I get, a creatin' cash getter
I ain't puttin the 2 on the 10 I'm makin' vast figures
You fags bitter mad wanna be fakin' class with us
How they thinkin' they gonna come and conquer us?
Little Mini Cooper hatin' on a monster truck
Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder stuck
Not a nare not a breath a stutter that conjure a
Nothin', nathin', the ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head it was soundin' like it's bassin'
Boom bing bang on you haters in the game
Strange lane takin' aim ain't a damn thang sane
I get it in, want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction, from beneath you we just a little dust'n
All because I'm bringin' the bucks in

They wanna leave me with nothin' (Uh-uh)

All these pussy niggas rattin' so us real niggas suffer
Not plentiful for me no more it's hoes in the game
Since I smell when paper foldin' man I'm rollin' with Strange
Pour some whiskey party with me tell the Feds if they miss me
They ain't comin' for me now then nigga bet they don't get me
So all you muthafuckin sucka niggas wishin' me gone
Big homie Strange Music Resurrection I'm home


All I do is sell dope and nigga talk bricks
Talk with bananas and tote clips
Ride around and smoke kush with the yurner on me
Drink them champagne bottles with the flower on 'em
All that talkin' loud, will get a nigga a hit
You see them cherry red chucks? Yeah I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out man I hit 'em up
And I'll lock up with you we could get 'em up
I still wear a gold grill 10 across the bottom
They call me 19-5 cause a nigga got 'em
Click-Clack nigga yanka get yanked on
There's been alotta hatin' nigga since I came home
Anything a nigga do homie it's federal
And come with football numbers in the level 4
They wanna bee a nigga dead man but nathin'
Tech fuck them muthafuckaz they could keep hatin'",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-nothin-lyrics
Trauma,The Worst,2000.0,"Welcome to the land of misery
Where my delivery strikes with madness
Hearts explode from the touch of the .44 blastin' (Party)
By the killers from the Midwest
You can scream all you want but there's no help
As I see your destiny ends in the hands of me
Black talons ripping through your body
The sight of a blood scene, murder is what I fiend
For so at the darkest hour, the clock ticks twelve
You feel the wrath of my power

What you gonna do when all these niggas collide?
I got so many mentalities I'll show you outside (Deadly)
Clever killing is my forte
Cutting off victim's nipples, a murderous foreplay
Can't even fuck with mine
I'm crazier than Dahmer, Charlie Manson combined (One of a kind)
Diabolic, symbolic, face the infernal
Evil demon and I can make you eternal

An introduction to my murderous plot
I got so many wicked ways
And they start on yo block

(Two) I let you know
(Three) Execution
Drag you out yo door, nobody to witness
I call it habit, you call it a verbal sickness
Damaging with a quickness
Describe the feeling while I rip you apart
I get evil when the day but even worse after dark

Murda (Murda)
Killin', it just don't stop (Homicidal)
The 12 gauge left you up and down
But another victim called the D-E-A-D
Listen to that underground massacre terror
Seize the streets, feel my heat (Whoo!)
The N9ne Amerikilla got me goin' like Donald Goines
The cannabis got me deep like the abyss
So I sit back relax, warm it up like Kris
A bruised the fist of fury when stepping me
I 8-1-6 that mothafucking ass in Missouri
Or should I say the land of misery
Where life's fucked up

Irritable, formidable
Right now, hit em in the middle of Rogue Dog, straight showed y'all
That I'll be game, anyone wanna know what's the deal
The simple fact is that I'll flip ya, flip ya for real, I'm at ya
But when I get rhymer block, I need some ginacock
Right after that fact I'm like a bull in a China shop
Six pluses believe it I'll be the bomb one day
If my shit was dropping in a week, today is Palm Sunday
One way ticket to necrosis
Focus on music like Mr. Holland's Opus
Notice (I'm) Still kicking hocus pocus
Witchcraft, whiplash, kick ass
Rhyme flows, sign up the timed shows
So I'm not behind hoes
Divine souls, plotting to kill all the demons
Any color many killings plenty separable pillins

Fan or Foe,Misery Loves Kompany,2007.0,"Ay ain't that the nigga Tech N9ne, man
Yeah, that's that nigga
He be rappin' shit, yeah
He cool I guess
 a little bit

Ay, ay nigga ain't you Tech N9ne nigga?
Yeah, what's up man?
Ay, that new shit cool
That shit hot 
Real life bro that shit hot

Back up wait a minute, why you lookin' at me like that?
Do you really wanna trip or you flippin' the script?
Do you wanna rap with a nigga or we bangin' suwoop in the whip?
I don't ever want us to come to bussin' off shots
Nigga misery can't produce enough cops
And I don't know if you wildin' or what
All you wanna do is freestyle in the cut
Fan or foe, (foe) I don't really know, (know)
Off at the show, (show) niggas they know, (know)
What it looked like was a good night
Now it's lookin' like a motherfucker wanna jack all me dough
Come up to me; my kids and me chillin'
Better think twice I'm a 56 Villian
But they wanna talk about a ditty, when I did it
Man, I thought I was about to get a bullet in a minute
You should be careful how you walk up on us
Got a bonus for all opponents if they want it
I know they wait for Tecca Nina moments
Fan or foe they be poppin' up and hit you, don't it?
We don't know if they be trippin' or not
Probably 'cause all of us live on the block
When you rappin' niggas want what you got
Tough as ever when you up on the top
Show some respect when you approach me
Don't you be muggin' me
Might have that drug in me
Pluggin' a nigga for merely shruggin' me
Ain't nothin' wrong with people peepin'
Geekin' whether man or ho
But a grammar so bamber stammer
I don't know if you fan or foe!

If he trippin' we can go
Peepin' like he seekin' dough
Wanna throw or wanna flow
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
Easy how you speakin', bro
I don't know if you fan or foe
If he we can- we can go
Peepin' seekin'- seekin' dough
Wanna throw or flow- flow
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
Easy speakin'- speakin', bro
I don't know if you fan or foe

Now be easy how you speakin', bro
T-Nutty the young floheakin' though, don't be jokin'
Show your ass and you'll be walkin' off with it broken
Run up on motherfuckers in the open
Makin' them shut up wolfin' with that ho shit
Cut the shenanigans, nigga you fakers are mannequins
Thinkin' you slicker than lotion?
Back up wait a minute, why you lookin' at me like that?
I'm just a nigga with a little bit of fame
But if you get to trippin', then I'ma givin' 'em my gang
Never catch me slippin', you can get it out your brain
Mayne, fan or foe
Sucker nigga tryna get his hands on my dough
But if you really want it come on and try to get on it
You can be the opponent chokin' with hands on your throat
Man, I'm a loc, one to pack round from Sactown
Better watch out for the blow-blow
Blackout, blackout, blackout, blackout, brrah
Stay with my killers that be knockin' noodles
Wakin' the game up like a cock-a-doodle
Think you gon' catch me slippin' at a show
Nutt factors lookin' like they Shaka Zulu,
 I see through you
With all the fake shit, you filled with hatred
Hopin' and wishin' you was my replacement
Comin' so vicious, you gon' have to face it and try to taste it
'Cause I laced it like a tennis shoe when I been a fool
Like C-Bo, Lynch and X-Raided but this is a different interview
Factors up nigga

If he trippin' we can go
Peepin' like he seekin' dough
Wanna throw or wanna flow
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
Easy how you speakin', bro
I don't know if you fan or foe
If he we can- we can go
Peepin' seekin'- seekin' dough
Wanna throw or flow- flow
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
Easy speakin'- speakin', bro
I don't know if you fan or foe

It may not be a bad idea if I never go home again
'Cause niggas lookin' at me like I'm a chicken dinner
Lookin' back at niggas like I'm Shauntay Henderson
Are you a foe (foe) so I gotta carry the fo', (fo')
I think they recognize me, I don't really know though
'Cause they walkin' up fast and givin' me doubt
And when they pass me askin'
""When yo new shit come out?""
Me and my dawgs at the picture house
And they be huddled up and got me thinkin' pick one out
I pick the nigga bigger than me, pull the trigga to see
If he tough enough, make 'em what he tryin' to be
But he a fan though, don't know how to approach ya, vulture
Get to close how I posed ta
Posed to know the difference from fan or foe when you muggin' though
Can't even live in peace and when I eat with my peeps in the place
You in my face with yo mixtapes
And if I ain't tryin' to listen to it we get into it
If I'm off of that fluid then it's time to do it
'Cause a nigga from out south out the mouth
Yo girl be lovin' me, givin' me mouth to mouth
And it ain't fair that the music got her doin'
What she wanna do when you ain't there
And you too salty softy
When you see me out you betta get up off me
If ya girl actin' a ho I'll turn a fan to foe

If he trippin' we can go
Peepin' like he seekin' dough
Wanna throw or wanna flow
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
I don't know if he fan or foe
Easy how you speakin', bro
I don't know if you fan or foe
If he we can- we can go
Peepin' seekin'- seekin' dough
Wanna throw or flow- flow

Cigarettes, I'm out of blunts, I won't keep the party jumpin' for ya
Just for ya love (For ya love)

Drinkin' shots to two a.m, three a.m
Smokin' more, you wanted more all until the party's over
She's out the door, yeah, yeah

It's for your love, it's for your love, it's for your love
It's for your love, it's for your love, it's for your love
Yeah, I was gon' split the best part of my pain wit' you
Had I knew you was a bitch, I'd let the gang hit you

You thought you had a keeper
Head dock when you puffin' on sativa
Never thought I'd be a reason to leave her, ya diva
Got the keys for ya love and ya leisure
It's lots of partyin', can't nobody stop the car she in
Got the star, nobody tops your gnarly friend
You bought bars, then it's popped, the scars begin
Thoughts, know nothing, lots like Rastafarians
Got you goin' through emotions
When you find out there's no devotion
It's you she ghostin', when ya girl fled
Was playing in your head again and again in slow motion
Now you feelin' anger and got a grudge
Sick, thinkin' somebody hittin' wit no glove
All because up under anger ain't nothin' but hurt
But up under that, you know it ain't nothin' but love
Stuck
When you finally realize it ain't no us, you don't give no fucks
'Cause the bitch turn around with your boys, givin' up your stuff
Ain't no trust, ain't no fuss
'Cause everybody already know what's up
What you thought was the one ain't nothin' but a slut
When I target other people involved and straight buss
On mamas, for all the dishonor, you might catch a fed case
Really wanna see bloodshed for the parties in your bed
Wanna pump a lot of lead up in they headspace
It's a blessing, bruh, when it don't matter who's sexin' her
Keep the vet in ya, but the women livin' dirty
What you think all the stress and aggression for?

It's for your love, it's for your love, it's for your love
It's for your love, it's for your love, it's for your love
Yeah, I was gon' split the best part of my pain wit' you
Had I knew you was a bitch, I'd let the gang hit you

Don't wanna go without ya
Same nightmares, I wake up like I was just around ya
Another month and I might overdose to forget about ya
I'm goin' crazy, this ain't gangsta, you just took it out me
Hell, you just took it out me
I'm just tryna band aid myself
With another little main thang that won't help
I just had sex all week, brand new freaks
I don't know the names, still can't sleep
And then you call me just to hear me lonely
Say you gon' pull up on me, and never show up on me

You selfish bitch, I bought these drugs, you didn't show up, you left me stuck
You left me stuck, now I give up, I had enough
Yeah, I was gon' split the best part of my pain wit' you
Had I knew you was a bitch, I'd let the gang hit you
You selfish bitch, I called you up to call your bluff, you didn't pick up
The phone hung up, you wrong as fuck, you wrong as fuck

Many death situations but that ain't (Why)
I got the spirit of an angel mixed with demoniac ways of livin'
So this means I'll beat the evil out of a non-believer until praise is given

Torture is evil though it says in the (Bible)
You got to be righteous spirited for the (Arrival)
I'm righteous and wicked but I wonder (Can I go)
If there's a heaven but on earth it's (Survival)
Connected with angels but to demons (I'm vital)

Like denouncing Selena at (Cinco de Mayo)
Certain death (Oh no) Oh no
I'm on the road to heaven and hell
Don't even bother me ever since eleven and twelve
I've been that prodigy though life has never been swell
Somewhere there's gotta be where a good Samaritan prevails
But they get straight sodomy
So I learned the ways of man

Fillin my pants
Gun in my hand
For the demons on the land
On the other hand I really am

I'm half cupid, half relic (Cha cha)
He who treads the path of the beast is also he who sins are repentable

Don't ever do somethin' you'll regret

She all in it then she told a nigga to bite her neck
I'm excited cause the gush will give my nut the right effect
But where will I hide a set of double D's
It I try to get her jugular open, I'm gonna keep with the pokin'
Have to really be strokin' her all night, I'm wet
Sunk my teeth in, bitches in heat send me over the top they get hot
Then I gotta bring the beast in

This might be the day that she die cause she told an animal to..

She phone the kids, she ain't coming home cause she on the dick

I see that snake and bat tat
Then I'm at that, wanna give us head
Around the map, you don't match that
Talkin' bout, she love me now
Now how hard it can get
And I can tell her now she hardly can sit, yeah, yeah!

My Own Zone,UnKnown,2018.0,"When opinions from your peers suck
And know we ain't about tears much
With no fear tucked, we just tell 'em what!

I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown

They say Tech lost it, Tech's frosted
And that's exactly what you find up under Tech faux shit
Put a X cross it cause Tech bosses
And you'll concur if ever you took a pic of Tech's office
Said demons trying to fly
But they cannot reach us because we too high in the sky
Only time we see you slam this is when we transmit
From our planet to get your evil language and shit
Ain't no best lives for you to break up
Tech N9ne's a Gouda maker
With the cabbage I turnip and ya know that set lies in a rutabaga
I blew the place up
Flowing for freedom for real and you the faker my buddha blaze up and my choppin' is in a shoota's nature aye
I'll forever make you shuffle your feet, buckle the weak step into me
I'll give you knuckles to eat aye
In my zone until I see it's trouble ya seek
Knock out a couple of teeth that's a couple's retreat
Yeah

I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown

Own zone, own both homes
Those clones follow me down the road like Todo
Cold flow, kick in the door and let my dough grow
Made a track with Tech, here's another, plus we got four more
More shows' my mojo
Make the people so glow
Everything is fast, I remember when it was slow mo'
If they talking 'bout me it's cause they gotta be insecure up in their own woes
Got iconic songs for the stoned folks and the funny thing is I don't smoke
No phones man, I'm off of the web
I'm where my people giving arm and a leg
Okay the bar has been set
I'm independent, ain't no clause in my check
I had to get it, then I got it, that's the cause and effect
I garner respect, I don't let no one cause me distress
The scars in my flesh is symbols of how hard it can get
The talking is less, I pause 'em when they call and collect
They all get upset, they hating and I'm onto the next

I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown

Sparks of motivation, I'm circulating the product
Glad that we made it, I love that the struggle taught us
I'm bossing up and I'm bothered, they never bought us
Never get left behind, I remember the days
I used to tell them suckas never mind
You get your piece of the pie and bro better step aside
Bottom line we invested, never give up
You won't know if you never try
You'll even start to regret it, cause you get better with time
Just look at Tech, lookin' at me like he ain't never lied
Overtime, gotta show these suckas how you really move
I'm a committed dude that's how I know the journey will improve
Check it
I get to traveling do what niggas would kill to do
Will of man, I could've sold my soul, I wasn't willing to
The shit I battle with most deal with
My door open if you both get lit
Go on tours, in the back room with my baby mama's grocery list
In my own zone if I ain't a legend yet then I'm close to it
Tell 'em I'm ready, forever grateful, I could've gave up
But they wouldn't let me, the people need me
I know I'm edgy but

I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-my-own-zone-lyrics

Blackboy,Killer,2008.0,"And I was told in school I was a fool
And money, I'd never gain none
But I used my flow as a tool, they was cruel
Said I'd be no rapper
But I did work and became one
Now it's a cryin' shame, I'm buyin' thangs
And they got debts they got to pay back
I think I know why my teachers would look
In my eye and say that and why's that?

'Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothin', don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin', I do
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

It must be the way that my pants sag
Or the sparklin' diamonds on the watch my left hand has
I know my appearance is lookin' like I am bad
In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big gratitude
I make more than you, but you got this attitude
Like I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin' to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
That's why when you see us in passin' we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power chakras
I was on top of the indie charts and not a slotera
But I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they won't treat me more propera

'Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothin', don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin', I do
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

Frontline, shoot, soldiers represent that
Frontline, shoot, 
Grand Verb,
 it's the snatch back
Head wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back
Escape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black
With finesse in you, it's the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page don't eat right 'til it all cracks
Blackboy rappin' from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Crack Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin'
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
For me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
And street soldiers to stand up, no choice to get it right
So these Blackboys can finally get they man up

'Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothin', don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin', I do
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

I'm a Blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
And when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
Over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
Little colored boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got and stop complainin'
Ok, weather man will stop the rainin'
On my people head, and start explainin'
What your people said, believe in the Bible
But you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you

'Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothin', don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin', I do
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through

I’m Sorry,N9NA,2019.0,"It's so good to see family
After all of this musical insanity
Chasing dreams and deemed vanity
But I'm back to humanity
Hoping my family don't banish me
Back in orbit to be the PYUNE one
I been prayin' this day would soon come
Man, I love this family reunion
So religious, my family might hand me communion
Sorry I left you to live in solitude
Writing lyrics, chasing spirits, clear as no molecules
Not a ting, badda bing, I paid a lot of dues
And paid less attention to my people, thinking the dollar rules
Three decades living with tunnel vision
When I thought about my family, hoping everyone don't miss him
When I left y'all on the outside looking in
But I'm trully blessed to sit with family and see them cook again
I love you

I have to say I'm sorry
Ain't been home for so long now
I have to say I'm sorry
I been gone, but you gotta know I love you, love you, love you
Been on a never-ending party, ooh
I said I love you, love you, love you
But I have to say, I have to say I'm sorry

A big brother's supposed to be there like I'm your rock
When you want the nightmares about your mom to stop
Since I ran away when you were babies, steady tryna pop
Lost time with Kiraameen, Hakim, Hassan, and Bas
Basimah, I'm sorry I seem like a shady dude
When times are hard for your family, paying your lady dues
You come so far, having a happy family is daily news
Man, I miss you playin' with me, chase me around in your baby shoes
Hakim, I should've been a better big brother
By helping you when it got rough at the house by dealing with our sick mother, yeah
Then I was chasing scrill' and dealing with others
But now that I'm better, wishing that you open to hoping we get further, yeah
Kiraameen, I left before you were born
And that's the reason we torn, and respecting me is just worn
I just wanna kick it some more
My baby brother I be missing galore
Your trust, I wanna try and kick in the door
I'm hoping we can all be fixed and be four

I have to say I'm sorry
Ain't been home for so long now
I have to say I'm sorry
I been gone, but you gotta know I love you, love you, love you
Been on a never-ending party, ooh
I said I love you, love you, love you
But I have to say, I have to say I'm sorry

Reign Michael, my youngest
I know that I been away for long, to keep it a hundred
How do you stay solid when a daddy is all you wanted?
I'm sorry for the time I didn't come get
In the future, time will be abundant
If you'll still have me as your rappin' happy daddy
We'll be back to matching addies if you're having that thing gladly
I'm sorry for the distance, baby, been tardy, no persistance, lady
Been RT on a mission lately, but my daughter, I've been missin' crazy
Lil' Donnie, with you, I created a better me
When I was away for so long, I missed you incredibly
I pray I didn't make you go the insane route
By bein' distant when we lived in the same house
I'm sorry for not helping more with your music
I know I'm half of the reason you choose it
In time, I'll really help you do it
I'm sorry for being immature and foolish
I got you, I'ma never lose it
I'ma push you while you pursue it (Alyia)
I'm sorry for missing your graduation
Telling you I would make it
Not knowing I had a show the same day, your heart, I would break it
And I couldn't face it, hurt and anger would turn to hatred
I'm sorry for everything, want a chance to bring better things
I'm so happy he got you a wedding ring
And I wanna be a part of your wedding in the Bahamas
I finally know time and honor's worth way more in life than commas
I'm sorry, baby
I'm sorry, baby
I'm sorry, baby
I'm sorry, baby

I have to say I'm sorry
Ain't been home for so long now
I have to say I'm sorry
I been gone, but you gotta know I love you, love you, love you

What do you do when you're workin'
Come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin'
At her sayin' ""What you doin' that for?""

This is how it goes when you're hard at work (Hard at work)
I'm with your lady and I'm all up in her skirt (All up in her skirt)
She chose a rapper, cause this rapper know how to tap her
Strap her down and attack her while you sneak in
Watch pornos and jerk (Watch pornos and jerk)
And you can't be mad at me, cause your thick bitch wanna ravage me
Got my big dick in her cavities then it's spit, spit I'm in anatomy
And you can't come badgin' me, cause she sick wanna insert half of me
Straight addicted to the master, he whips the sticks up without batteries
Poetry in motion, I make her water, cause I'm a scholar
I father her twat and bother her I got her
She'll eat anything I want her to eat
She'll swallow anything I want her to swallow
She'll go down and chew on my dog
Doin' anything that'll make me holler
And you the victim don't even know, what's you comin' home to
I'm bangin' it out and she's screamin' like we doin' kung fu
I'm feelin' right, cause you the one she do the wrong to
Now that you know your lady is creepin' - what you gon' do?


But it ain't no need though, cause I'm a G though
I find 'em, then fuck 'em, feed 'em and I let him repo
I understand you're punchin' that clock
But while you're punchin' man, I'm punchin' that twat
Gonna get that overtime, BG Bullet does step over the line
Gotta key to the crib, this pussy's suppose to be the line
This bitch too old to be lying, she done
Told her husband things suppose to be fine
You the bigger man, and I'm her clover leaf now
What about the clothes that he found
Did you tell him you love him, did you tell him you with it
Did you tell him you this love his dick
Everytime that you get it - I don't think so
So I'mma keep things low, keep pullin'
These strings close that pop that El Nino (Yes!)
Cause I'm the best at it, your lady's sex addict
All in the spot when you're not, getting my head patted
But I'mma keep this thing respectable, homie
I'm using condoms in your festival, homie, no need to kill a nigga!


What would you do if your boo crept on you
With me, new tattoo with the letter ""P""
All over her humps like the letter ""B""
Trip if you want to, scared nigga
Never me: your girl has been land-marked
That means that I marked her - that means
That I skeeted sperm all over her twat fur
That means that I got her, where you never had her
Sex game critical, now she is a master
You never got your dick licked, mine is getting tongue-kissed
She could suck a orange through a straw - call her Sunkist
Man, she a cold chick, yeah I know you miss that
Bank account access, yeah, you know I did that
Put it where her ribs at, then I let her slip on it
If ya like it then ya should-a put a ring on it

Specter,MORE FEAR,2020.0,"I want you all to listen to a story of a ghost
That only the truly strange can see
It's about the ghost of Tech N9ne

You heard of Strange and heard the name
That came in to disturb the game
Occurred the lane, preferred the word insane so the murder came
A lot of people they heard of the Tecca N9na
And always said that there wasn't a better singer
But it's so many that act like they've never seen the
Independent pro and never stepped into that arena
But I'm a guap stacker, and sought after
But to many, my catalog are lost chapters
N9cian tell a newbie that I'm a boss (laughter)
'Cause they don't know the story behind the chop master
Who they give the credit to got a lot faster
They say they poppin' Rosé and think I pop Shasta
Looking through me like I'm a ghost I shot past ya
Like when you ever seen my name in the top rappers?

I've seen you with my own eyes
That I feel so alive
I believe he lives forever
Specter, specter, specter, specter

I feel like I'm a ghost, 'cause I be doin' the most
My people try to boast, about the 20 year independent
But they praise another label up on Revolt (F.V.)
They never play O.G., Tecca N9na like I pay no fee
I ain't trippin' or takin' peyote
But I dropped it in '09 and nine years later another artist dropped a record called KOD
Looked over the flow spit, I'm not on a GOAT list if that ain't ghost shit, what is it? (Bullshit)
A N9cian know that I'm so fit to go with the dopest and know they fa sho get the bidness (Full clip)
I am kingly but I'm treated like I'm some kind of genie
Rubbing the lamp and I'm hella dreamy
People that stream me 'cause of ""Caribou Lou"" and the little teenies, they banging the record but never seen me
You heard the handle, claimin' you never heard the jam though
Flowin' I got the words to ramble
I murder fammo, I'm money like a bird in a bando
Mythical, so they burn a candle
When they talk about this person, I'm a sick earthlin'
Heard I was the Devil and now they're disbursin'
'92 rappin' backwards I get workin'
A decade later I hear some gnarly ish yerfin
It’s like I don’t exist sometimes
Thinkin’, ""How is it possible to miss some rhymes?""
That were put together to make a hit, dumb minds
Couldn’t keep up the cadence of the sticks, drum line
I’m down with the stable and got the sick combined
My imagery made ‘em all wanna split from mine
Redheaded when it wasn’t the shit, shun N9ne
Now it’s poppin’, yo can a nigga get some shine?

I've seen you with my own eyes
That I feel so alive
I believe he lives forever
Specter, specter, specter, specter

Beware the ghost of E.B.A.H
If you deny the name
In time the ghost will greet ya
Then it will supply the reign

How else you explain it?
One of the best to obtain it
But so many claim they not acquainted
But they know the name is famous
And Strange is painted the best but never aim to bang it
'Cause of backstory that I'm that gory
Like I got an evil entity to rap for me
On a fat chory but the math surely
They ain't fuckin' with me like I gotta scratch orgy off the list
What does it cost to get the main line to gain shine off the rip?
The hang time to bang mine lost the grip then
The insane rhymes that came flyin' caused the split
Pressure for the large investor
'Cause it is hard to measure carbon texture
Tech's your resurrector, the soul injector
But for the whole semester they closed the lecture for the specter

I've seen you with my own eyes
That I feel so alive
I believe he lives forever
Specter, specter, specter, specter

Beware the ghost of E.B.A.H
If you deny the name
In time the ghost will greet ya
Then it will supply the reign",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-specter-lyrics

To be voided but listen
First I'll make you miss it
Like the senate was missin'
Patricia Hearst
 'cause I been in it for a minute
Put minutes in till it hurt, not for minute will I let
You diminish my men at work
And I been hurting trying to fathom the burden
But grieved not I put in work, inside and out
I'm deserving a clean shot
You people nursing every NERD
You encourage to speak not
Or you'll get murdered, you ain't heard
How the industry seized Pac

Somebody help the fame hurtin'
I won't fall for the bullshit
So fuck y'all wit a hard dick
Drop jaws when we barge in ya turn bitch
In front of hard men most rappers are garbage
Mitch Bade are target how soon de forget that
Strange is the hardest wit a line up of artists
Do it regardless
It's all about where your heart is
You can start this but Strange gonna finish it
Menace rhyme spoken
In every line it presented in

To all you haters in power we say
(Fuck the industry, fuck the industry)
Jack yo plaques put 'em down on eBay
(Fuck the industry, fuck the industry)
And all you boogie ass chumps can't touch us
The industry is some punk motherfuckers
You tell 'em FTI when anybody ask you
Fuck the industry, they the enemy

Fuck this industry man
I'll make it happen boy
With fat change this rap thing
Full of hoes and haters and hat gain
The CEO don't want no part to this do
'Cause if you're fuckin' up against
My firm is squakin' at you mean carcass is through
The A.R. better stay in this car
'Cause I'm parkin' it to
Don't hate Brim 'cause I'm talking the truth
My dogs is barking at you
So you better get your mind right
Deuce clique representation we in the lime light

This ""Rage"" is ""Against the Machine""
Turn these pages and flip till they clean
And what remains is for Krizz to be seen
So I say ""Fuck the Industry""
'Cause the speech that you preach to do people
Is so evil so ""fuck your ministry""
How they ever gon' say what we gon' say
How they ever gon' say what we gon' do
Here I come for the mon and I'm comin' with a gun
Now tell me what I will and I won't do
F - Fear 'em they blast hoes
T - Tear 'em a new asshole
I - Infect their mind wit this lyrical blindness


""Hey Skatterman, I heard you rollin' with Tech""
But I still ain't signed
Cuz I'm a problem for these record execs
How can they market
A young black political target?
Who done took coca leaves
Baking soda and enlarged it
Into crack rocks selling crack rocks for a livin'
From the black top
Where we jack cops for a livin'
So fuck the industry and damn the beats
I ain't just in the street
I'm Skatterman, I am the streets, nigga

You got a smile glarin', 'cause you get it packed
I got yo gal starin', 'cause you minute mack
You got yo mouth swearing that yo hit is plack
You hatin' file-sharing 'cause your shit is wack
Sampled yo CD listened and it was cheesy
No cable box 4 your TV no label watch for your breezy
We ride, feel the pain from inside, fuck yo fame 'cause it died
Said yo thang was about the game claimed then he banged but you lied
'Bout yo artist but yo artist is the farthest from the hardest
But you market this bark at this bunk dirty carpet shit
Game is outsmarted oops somebody farted 'bout to spark this shit
Niggas are retarded look what you've started
Cerami Mark is pissed
I'ma break it down for you clowns
In the industry chain
(Fuck perspective Warner Bros., Qwest and JCOR's name)
Strange, we independent and you suckas
Are the enemy you fuckin' up the industry
You busters will remember me

When I was 5 years old I realized there was a road
At the end I, would win lots of pots of gold
Kindergarten teacher knew I was impossible
Gots to grow dick quick to cock the ho
Evil breed, we smoke weed without seeds
T do dirty deeds, feed foul fiends, what they need
Walk around with a switchblade in 6th grade
You'll get blade, If you display bitch 
or Mitch Bade
Have you ever, sold a preacher
Crack on Sunday, fucked your teacher?
7th grader, under bleachers
Losing data, smokin' reefer
Hasta el amigo, hasta luego
Hasta le fake hoes, after I pop, I stop when I stay low
Damn clown from Kan Town

There's a monster breed here, nigga, stand down!

And it gets shittier, hit me ya

What kind of nigga never think of learnin'?
Make his momma suck dick while he burnin'
Who that nigga chuggin' liquor

She never knew I would turn beast when I grow up
She never thought that I'd know clutch
I hung with niggas in the hood who never gave a fuck
I'm a creature from the black platoon
Pass the shrooms, last for doom
With half a moon
Still howling, Lord knows I been a very
Bad boy fucking little Lory in Forest Hill cemetery
The definition of a bad boy
Use to hit niggas for repping this and never had joy
And I never ever really had toys
So I started playing with .38s making mad noise
Who killed fetuses
Who needed this GHB to get heated, immediate
We get weeded be on some conceited shit

Wow, look at all these women I'mma have a blast here
Cause all of 'em know that I made a lot of money last year
So that means that you got to really bounce, bounce that ass dear
Then maybe later you can get in a position of a pap smear
Stripping's at a all time high
If it's based on the amount of dollars that fall, I'm why
And the ladies, they love me cause I ain't no small time guy
So we up in the strip club and a chick just caught N9ne's eye (Go)
Mayne this chick got a big butt stainless and this rump that'll make a brother get up
Frame is thick with her ripped gut, strangest thang it jumps I'mma give her hella big bucks
In this thang, when it swang
Steady steppin' up my spin it game
After the spot they wanna go bang with 120 minute mayne
Her beautiful face, insane, and yes, her thighs are gleamin'
And it's spiritual cause her booty'll exorcise the demons
Hey look at that Bernice Burgos, with that humpin' back, And when she do that dance, ooo that booty doing jumpin jax

(Oh) oh she gotta a body with a humpin' back
Lookin like a workout student doing jumpin' jax, (oh)
Baby girl, that trunk gotta lotta junk in that, (oh)
Ain't it funny how much money I'mma dump in that, (oh)
Jumpin' jax, jumpin' jax, booties bouncing like (x3)
Ain't it funny how much money I'mma dump in that

The way she move it seems a little bit appalling
Could put 'em on the poles
They got that feeling so I had to interweave and floss 'em
Losing my composure
You get 'em in the back wall, in the cut
Pin me down, line 'em up
Work it 'til my time is up
This is how I creep (Stevie Stone)
Filling up my cup cup
Thong on the ground
And the vibe done changed since they came round
I got another Goose and the Henny and the Crown
And they bouncing off the walls got them jumping all around
I swear I love your energy, you gon be a friend to me
Your friend can meet my friends and we be friends right now right now
Want you to watch your back, Jumpin' Jack
If ya see it, cabbage patch
Baby ain't got a problem wit' it
Did it well and made it clap
Tail lean down to boogie, climb up on me, sukie sukie
Cool, I'm gone spend a little dough, she gone let a nigga know the way she grinding nookie
HA HA HA HAAA!!
Got them (talking?) to themself cause I know deep down that I wan' get a taste
Got a perrr lil face
Got shit in the hip
To the front and the back and a little bit a waist
Your thighs ? let me slide inside of them
Them things excite a lot of men
Girl you look good you make me say


I wanna see if you're tight enough
See if any one of them is good enough for me to try to
Hide em up, Divide 'em up
She delic' and sweet, put her between my teeth and
Bite her muff
I'm looking them, thick strippers a big tipper
I will, de-liver the big dipper
Can-can, bim bim and then send her, she hard but her back yard is so tender
That booty bouncing, bo-bouncing
Like she doing a dribbling dance
I like 'em with so many stretch marks like she wearing some corduroy pants
So if you got that ""va voom"" have moon and bring it to me
I'm giving out Loonie Toonies
And lookin' for the pimples on the booty
I want you to strip it down like im looking for contraband, I'm the man
Hit the ground, dirty birdy, put that head in the sand
Frequently go to the booty house
We go cuckoo when the booty out
And you, would too, if you knew about
What they, would do, when the money out, hey!
So I'm giving all my checks and I'm expecting
More than just a kiss and I ain't talking 'bout a peck and
We'll have lots of fun and you can come if you get beckoned
The booty bouncing like jumpin jax looking well I wreck it",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-jumpin-jax-lyrics
Pillow Talkin’,Killer,2008.0,"If you seek thunder
From a gun this is somethin' that'll get the heat on ya
When she's under the sheets on that beautiful sleep number
Don't know wake her yappin' when she's off in a deep slumber
If we share a secret and the scare was equal to one of us
Gettin' the chair, do you swear to keep it? (yes)
Meaning that under heat you wouldn't nare leak it
So when your woman's in your presence don't you dare speak it
Pillow talkin' get you caught up and brought up on charges
Shot up a lot and departed, it's nothin' short of retarded
'Cause when you say stuff and then you and your woman break up
You funkin' because your mouth wouldn't stay shut
How could you spread that? Can't believe you said that
Puttin' my life in jeopardy definitely it'll make the feds tap bed trap
What you tell your lady can make you take a dead nap
Fluff up your pillow and lay your head back

You

You
 (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin'

My advice to niggas is this: you can never trust no chick
It don't matter how silky the ho can stroke your dick
It don't matter how slimy the pussy hole gon' get
If a nigga talks to these bitches these hoes gon' snitch
Shit, I used to fuck this bitch
Had a husband with dope money and I had his snow bunny
Climbin' at the bed poster, feedin' her dog meat
In love with the nine inch, she steady calls me
Tells me she's leavin', I know the reason
She know where the guns at, lock box, keys and
The floor safe combo and this here one ho
Was this dude's bad news, knock on the front door
A man in a police suit, a girl with a plot to
Get to the money, she saw him countin' in the back room
It doesn't end here, the man with the cop suit
Shoots at the bitch once, pops and drops dude

I can tell you what the problem is: people try to be monogamous
Tell his woman a lot of shit
And he thinkin' he got him a bottom bitch
Stop with the sentimental talks at night
If you're pillow talkin', then you oughta quit
When the heat come with the quickness
Lookin' for the witness, man your broad is it
Why you wanna spit it? I don't really get it
Givin' your woman the power to speak in a minute
Speakin' about a brother wanna cover your mud up
With the N9na but you the only one know I really did it
When it come back then you feel low
Because everyone know you ain't real though
'Cause them beans you spillin'
You known for squealin' and all you needed was a pillow
""I should have did the dirt, all by my lonely"" like Treach say
But the company that you keep end up bein' phony
So the TEC spray
Never let no chick I hit get with that homie
'Cause the next day, she seein' right through me
Got them lenses on me like an X-Ray
And I'm fed up with these rappers
Who be yappin' to these groupies
They flash them a little coochie
Then you blab and try to reduce me
And it always come back to me
So when I come through strapped with an Uzi
It ain't like ""Damn why'd he shoot me?""
Usin' the Nueve name too loosely

Shame on Me,Therapy: Sessions with Ross Robinson,2013.0,"Tell you the reason why my brick wall is up
I was at her mom's house, in her basement
Waitin for her to bring me some food to eat
She's takin a really long time
So I thought I'd creep up the stairs to startle her
And I heard her on the phone... and she said:
""I know... that it couldn't be Donny's baby
Because me and Donny use condoms""
I couldn't walk, man

Once bitten, twice shy for the nice guy
Always afraid of the beginnin' but the endin' might lie
Women sin just like men I never been like why
Cause my heart has been torn apart and I really felt my life die
Since, then, I put up a wall
20 foot tall, if they climb it they surely to fall
Out of love, but not lust
Cause a thug has got cut
But the blood has been mopped up
Now my drug is a hot fuck
They swore they would never be phony
Like whores, it was never me only
My Lord, I would rather be lonely
Fool me once, shame on you; twice, shame on me

""What are you doing... I want you to come over
I left the door unlocked, and... oh my god""

It doesn't have to mean anything
It doesn't have to mean anything
It doesn't have to mean anything

Hurt me once then I'm an idiot if I stay
Cause I'm hoping that twice that ain't no kinda game that I play
Her knife was jagged but now I have it my way
I just grabbed it without feelin I stabbed it pipe-lay
Yeah shallow, but I'm hurt-free now though
Been suffering silently for so long this is my growl
Now they sayin I don't feel enough
Cause I don't wanna be wonderin if it's real or what
Broke up with me once, I came right back like a dunce
But then the second was funk, now I'mma be really blunt
That really stirred N9ne
We lovers in her mind
Broke up with me twice and you don't get a fucking third time

Listen to me... you don't have to spend the night
You can just come over for a little while
I'm not gonna tell anybody, I swear to god

It doesn't have to mean anything
It doesn't have to mean anything
It doesn't have to mean anything
It doesn't have to mean anything
It doesn't have to mean anything
It doesn't have to mean anything

Oh my god... you look so younger than earlier
And I can still smell you on me
I just wanna taste you, just for tonight

B.I.B.,ENTERFEAR,2019.0,"How much of the trauma did mama get? Ayy
Way up to the highest level that drama gets, ayy
Through the pain of my mother, heartache was on a display
I don't want a sick day to my mama's dismay, ayy
Thinking of all of it, I never wanted a part of it
Remember I wanted to let go, when smoking, I managed to get low
It coulda been worse, like when I was talking to homies on a cellular phone up on death row
When I never had to serve a stretch so, I can still say ""But I'm blessed, though""
But why did I have to hear mama getting beat
In third grade, so I couldn't really give him missing teeth?
But I knew from grandma that what you sow you're gonna freakin' reap
So he robbed a bank and got about 30 years in the pen' for the mission, peace
Blessed to get away, but stressed to this day
When checks hit a nay, no money, depressed and it's grey
But the family didn't stutter to pull her and the kid inside their homes
Sometimes it was butter and sugar sandwiches
Graduated to healthy niggas
Tryna protect this investment, moving like stealthy figures
All that poverty and pain it really helped me give a damn
It dealt me this killer jam, now wealthy I'm living grand, still, I felt these shivers
And the cold nights living through all the stresses
I'm feeling like I had a lifelong baby bib to protect me from messes
Around my neck so I'm safe as far as threats go
From the last row to the best flow, I can now say, ""But I'm blessed, though""

I know it's gotta be an upside now, found somewhere, yeah

On a boat lift the covers and I pet her ass
Never know when I gotta go cause my life is impossible
The way I'm livin' the good things never last
So I live for the minute just want to start to begin it
When I wake up again I'm on stage rockin'
20,000 people they yellin' feedin' my ego
When it's over the groupies they wanna know what's poppin'
Double-O Nina, known for dippin'
From place to place I gotta vacate the mission
Gotta get the money but what do you know I wake up
In a movie theater with my little ones on a big one
Hollywood movie with the Jackass cats
I close my eyes I open 'em and I'm back at rap
In the studio collabin' killin' wack ass crap
But then in a blink I wake up and pack that strap
In the club cause some other niggas want my head
I don't know too much about 'em but they won't buy red
I ain't trippin' don't wanna let the killers in blue start me
Wake up again I'm a DJ Clue party
With Diddy and Jim Jones, Juele and Rick Ross
Cat Fay, Trey Songz and Drake this is boss
Amazing, life's hella crazy
Livin' like I'm a quatro, triple, double agent

Then I wake up again I'm on stage at Paid Dues
This characteristic is made to slay crews
Some tryin' to get at me to battle but they lose
Then I'm wakin' up with my kids on a paid cruise
They callin' me daddy, wake up in a strip club
They callin' me daddy, man I'm goin' hella baddy
Amazing, life's hella crazy
Livin' like I'm a cuatro, triple, double agent


At any rate I'm all over the place
Music and being a father and I know that I made
Got me feelin' moon stricken but Nin' remain calm
Livin' like I'm out of a scene from James Bond
Switchin', changin', feelin', Strangin'
Livin' multiple lifes, robbin' and gangbangin'
Freakin' all over the world Middle West swangin'
Always on the move ain't never time for hangin'
Slick with my shit my grip don't fold
Pick the fly chicks and ditch those hoes
Kiss for my bitch my kids get dough
Ripping my scripts I hits this road
Double-O Nina nigga I love this grind
Doing a lot of good and mud this time
Dippin' all over the planet
Tellin' the bitches my name is N9ne, (Grr) Tech N9ne!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-00n9na-lyrics
On the Outside,ENTERFEAR,2019.0,"It really used to bother me
Why award shows never callin' me?
Was not enough to hold the T down
'Cause I'm constantly choppin' broccoli (Countin' money)
They don't owe me no apology
I'm ballin', gettin' nightly neurology
Even though I got the lottery now
Ain't no thought of me, I do not agree

Staring at Platinum and Gold plaques
""Fragile"", ""Hood Go Crazy"", ""Caribou Lou"", Gold stacked
'Cause ain't nobody never, ever said that Tecca Nina flow wack
And that's the reason for babies' mamas, no cap
I read somewhere I had the most Top 10's on the Billboard rap charts
When you kill more, stacks start, I'm a mill' grower at heart
And I led my people to the bread, I teach you, I'm a real lord, that part
I got the ill for a fact, art, but wait a minute
If you looked up T9 history, yo, the data's in it
In the gang we Strange and we gain big things because we play to win it
But to some my shit seems invisible's the only way to spin it
Kinda like some opp wanna try to play me out like I'm Sega Genes—
Is this stopping us? Hell nah, got a lot of fans watching us
Saying God to us, but if Strange came through the window pane of the mainstream's oculus
It'll leave a lot of rappers with their mouth wide, like ""The Ring"" when people went the TV route and died
I'm without cries, 'cause me and my partner built an empire and we did it on the outside

I get guap, I get guap, I get guap
On the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it
I just watch, I just watch, I just watch
On the outside, here I come now
I get guap, I get guap, I get guap
On the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it
I just watch, I just watch, I just watch
On the outside, here I come now

I get guap still, even though people are not real
When it come to who got skill, some just want a nigga pop pills
I done did it, all fly, tongue splitter, y'all, I swung, hit a ball, dropped deals
Started my own and stocked mills, but I kinda sensed that blocked feel
Very little radio and TV time, that's what the outside mean when I free these lines
Like somebody determined to never see me shine, completely deep inside, I know they really dying to meet me
To be a household name like Snoop, really would feel like felicity
But I think it takes a bit of a brighter image and enough of the right publicity
So as I sit and peep award shows like I'm a forbidden geek
Ignored so 'cause I love and live in deep where the lord flows through the blood of risen chiefs
I love to see all of my peers getting their credit through all of my years
Of eating the mic, I just swallow my fears, when beating this fight, never call on my tears
Even though so many cry over Yates
The music business treat me like I'm a flyover state
But I work this glow, murk this flow, never been a day my clout died
Tech Nina, Strange Music, built that thing on the outside

I get guap, I get guap, I get guap
On the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it
I just watch, I just watch, I just watch
On the outside, here I come now
I get guap, I get guap, I get guap
On the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it
I just watch, I just watch, I just watch
On the outside, here I come now

I get guap, I get guap, I get guap
Here I come baby, I'm coming to get ya (Get ya)
I just watch, I just watch, I just watch
And it's such a beautiful picture (Picture)
I get guap, I get guap, I get guap
All year round, all day and night
I just watch, I just watch, I just watch
No worries, everything's gonna be alright

Stress Relief,The Lost Scripts of K.O.D.,2010.0,"(Anger)

This is for all the times when you just can't take it no more
When all your kindness is gone out the door
When injustice and bullshit talk is yet to seize
Every once in a while you gotta flip out and get some stress relief
[Hook: Tech N9ne:
Aw shit! Motherfucker! I'mma kick yo' fucking ass!
This is stress relief, this is stress relief
This-this is stress relief
Come on and sing it with me!

Who you talking to?
What you wanna do?
What the hell you thinking?
Who the fuck are you?
Where's my fucking money?
I'mma beat your ass!
What's so fucking funny?
Nigga, I'mma need more cash
Why you tryna play me?
I'mma stomp you until you're delirious
You niggas must be crazy
Are you fucking serious!?
Fuck this goddamn job
You know what, I quit
I'm ready to go in on you
You lying son of a bitch
You don't know shit
Don't get your throat slit
Stop moving slow, trick
GO, BITCH!
I don't give a damn, I don't wanna hear
Which one of 'em did it, nigga
Why you shake and shiver?
Pull the fucking trigger!


What you say to me!?

I'mma fuck up this club!
Oh, you wanna push and shove?
You reppin that, cuz!?
What's with it, Blood!?


Yeah
Sometime you gotta let loose and
Flip on a fucking nuisance
Stress release when you can
Not give a damn about they two cents
Cussing 'em out, reduce them
Shout, get it out ya mouth and lose them
Pout, not a route, no doubt, get gruesome
Out and about, get soused then use them
As a punching bag
With my blunt and drunken ass
Want some funk and somethin' fast
Hunt the chump then dump in mag
Got you pumped and mad
Wanna thump and clash
Jump the punks, the funks
So crunk they munch they lunch then dash
We go to jail
We know the sell
It's cold as hell
Po' here go the bail
You know the Yale
If you know that ho a tale
You think I'm s'po' to fail?
Bitch, go to hell!

Going Bad,Anghellic,2001.0,"This is the trip! The best part I, really, really like!
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number!
Used to be good, now I'm going bad..
Yo.. Like this!

Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan
Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan

In the new millennium you can't play with nobody's mind, man
Deliberately messing up a good thing or holding up a grind and
You already knowing life's a big fight against time, man
Crime minds really shine, who's dying is the kind man
When some of us, find that life ain't beautiful, we switch to pharmaceuticals
Your nine to five ain't suitable, for the cuticles
I'm going bad, currently I keep ending up with even less than I had
Record company is dealing me something sad
How do you expect a man to sit and wait with three kids
For you to figure out what Tech S-I-N-G-L-E is?
Going bad, I feel like I just might act a fool when I see 'em
Got a nigga, feeling petty looking forward to per diem
I got some issues, most of these record execs are soft as tissues
Defecate on they self when they here some ""I'm gon' get yous""
Understand this; when a Rogue sat, you trying to hold back his dough sack
And try to bozack and he go cock the 4-4 back, you chose that
So cut these ties and I'll rise, let's compromise
Or else I'll hop a plane with my guys
QDIII said, ""It ain't all good, when you sign with a record label
Who ain't had a hot soundtrack ever since Boyz N Da Hood""

I'm going
Bad
No luck, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
So rough I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
No church, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
Disperse I'm going
Bad
Feel me out now

This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever

No one wants to see an angel in this world in these days
To them I am the epitome of evil
A found soul looking to save the lost
To them I am death and of not wanting an evil man

For living expenses they gave me like thirty-five G's
Picture me in a hospital shot up with thirty IV's
That's what I really needed when I found out this drama trauma
Instead of moving I should've kept all that and continued to stay with my girl's momma
Gutter living got me tripping I'm smoking bud daily
Gutter living got me tripping, I'm going blood crazy
Gutter living got me tripping, I'm struggling like a bad actor
Gutter living got me sounding like The Madd Rapper
The bad influence, the bad apple, the bad seed (That's me, yes)
The bad people, the bad karma, the bad breed
Mushroom tripping, brain's a mushroom cloud
Finding groupies tugging on my zipper while I'm hanging on to my vows
Demons surround me in triple stage darkness and taunt me
They know I'm the good guy going bad so they want me
All my family remembers way back in the day I was good but they doubt now
Disperse, I'm going bad, feel me out now

This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever

To say going bad to most ha
Never been good just getting worst
Thoughts to destroy and to tear things apart
Thoughts to praise, adore and to love
The trick is what voice is telling you what

Mind state of a pirate, I'm irate
Used to be cool 'til some straight fool lit the pilot
Will I be that mid-town bound in the middle of a riot
Or at a warehouse shipping platinum, and I'm shaking hands with Violet
No love for the bane, false foes in the game
The Qwest wreck was a shame, twas a journey full of pain
But Tech N9ne will remain hella brave and untame so make way
For the reign I'm bringing Highland and Wayne
No thanks to Qwest they on the receiving end of the gun
I cursed you, for every time I climb you're getting fired one by one
But taking Juan with me 'cause he knows the true meaning of a modern day hippie
Who creates jewels off mushrooms and bombs sticky
Hog Stylin', Mid West Side and Newday and King Tech and Sway
These are the people keeping me alive to this day (Much love)
QD said ""You can't make rell with a label
Who let Tipper Gore talk shit and made 'em take Ice T's cop killer off the shelves""

I'm going
Bad
No luck, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
So rough I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
No church, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
Disperse I'm going
Bad
Feel me out now

This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever

Right now I can't distinguish which voice I'm listening to
Am I evil? Or just another lost soul going bad?
Or just been bad and getting worst?",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-going-bad-lyrics

You gotta start with a hard ass kick and snare
Add some dope ass music around and a hard MC and you got it

Every night, it seem like we celebrating birthdays (Hoooooo!)
'Cause rappin on planet Earth pays
Smelling like versè, or is it Versace?
You got me sloppy from popping this oxys and shots of sake, copy?
All you ladies in here, I am sharing wood
I just, wanna lay between ya and ram square into it
'Cause, when it come to women, your man Aaron's good
I done been inside-a more woman than Planned Parenthood
I got more bottles, than newborn babies, for your boring ladies
I want you drink up till you horn crazy and rape me
'Till I'm lazy and achey, wanna get shady and tape me?
Okay baby lets say we tape me inflating your trachia
Im just partying I ain't letting the tool spit
I ain't tryna have you haters layin below the pulpit
40 acres and mule sit, in my garage with a cool kit
Eat, drink and be merry man and miss me with all that bullshit
Ain't no telling how drunk and high you'll get

Knock the lenses out my frames and start the ruckus (Yes)
So when I scream through the scene you know you niggas finna crush it
Max out on swagga, not your ordinary rapper
But I do my thing extra, like no ordinary madness (Got ya)
Keep that smooth movement so proper
They keep choosin' on ya dude 'cause I be's all about my dollas
On the baddest bitch swaggin through, its not a big deal
Shit I receive more tongue then a double stacked thizz pill
It's real, what you say you lose the crew and 'scape with me
No need to slow it down you let them other suckas pace the speed, dig it? (Yep)

I need a bunk rock, fresh pair of sucker duckers
It's a party, I'm bullshittin' with muh'fuckas

crooked eye
Battle me? I think your favorite rapper'd rather die
Who you know can spit a flow this clean?
My notebooks to tenth grade, I got so many sixteens
Please, I got a lot of hard tones
That'll fuck up your view of The View like Star Jones
Y'all clones, my style is the original
Half you wack rappers just epitomize pitiful
But me? spittin' classic is a ritual
I stopped liking rap when the lying got habitual
I'm sick of you, the streets turned me to a sentinel
I'm so not Common, but I still see the bitch in you
(So guess what) Shit, can't nobody out-rhyme me
So Tech, call Trav right now and tell him sign me

Take the bets and the beers
Cause everybody's reppin' a kin but you wasn't checking
Tech, messing with his
Rock and roll flow, lock and load boy
I've been busting without a concern
Stoppin' y'all, shoving off in your ho, I stood up then I shot in her perm
Got your lady hopping my wood cause everybody's talking my hood
Now you haters love us all the sudden when you be jeffin I just say I'm good

We getting a whole lot of love for a while now
And the people who hated are super elated, ready to bow down
Now when I walk in the room all of the haters are dead sound
Now they probably all on my nuts, we won't be needing no head now

We don't need no head now
All those fuckers who didn't hear me
Let me all to say it again
We don't need no head now

You disliked me, now you like me
Cause you see that my jewelry's pricy
Never take it lightly when a brother write this
The music and message is mighty
Get up off my deal for real, you never knew I had the skill to kill
But now you know what I conceal is ill
Cause now the shit that I spill get mills
People hop on a band wagon, when you rocking in your damn habits
Back in the day wasn't no hand clapping
Now try to get to me, they ransacking shit
So get in my circle but fakers be hasty, yo
Get the fuck out of my face, I don't ever need your active fellatio

Now I got 'em all lined and ready to suck me dry with a bunch of Bianca's
Pedophiles off their knees cause them triggers'll spit, it's too late for the second portion
Petty crockers and mockers are gaveling cock until I'm a headless horseman

Now you all smiles, I made it and y'all so proud
But bitch I done seen your true colors and now you can't hide 'em, you fucking piranha
Put this on my momma, I'll never be him
Second off for the latest of trends, getting lost in the whisky, you never were with me
Success is the sweetest revenge

We getting a whole lot of love for a while now
And the people who hated are super elated, ready to bow down
Now when I walk in the room all of the haters are dead sound
Now they probably all on my nuts, we won't be needing no head now

We don't need no head now
All those fuckers who didn't hear me
Let me all to say it again
We don't need no head now",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-head-now-lyrics
Poh Me Anutha,Sickology 101,2009.0,"Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha drank
My pocket is full of bank
You want me to stop I can't
It's sho hot in this place I think that I'm bout to faint
So baby..

Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha drank (Do It) 

I wanna couple of dem para-dises
Gimme two of dem sum a dem beetches
That's the 
Hennessy
 at the top
That's fifty dollars a shot
Too much will make you pop to pieces
Cause when I party yes I drink to sin
Gimme drunk enough I'll probably bink a friend
Rumble in my belly
Head is in the toilet
I will never ever get drunk again
I'm talkin bout them other cats
Drinkin a little boo and then they had enough of that
Dark is what I do can never get enough yak
But what I do while they mixin' em
What I gotta ask
Sane lookin man gon make me three
Cups of delicious K.C. Tea
That's Hennesy, Sprite and lemon
If you got better than that you gotta make me see
Off in the club fucked up
And I got all of my bucks up
Twenty women at the bar right next to me
Every one of them just lucked up
Saturday night Voodoo Loungin' it
'Cause P & L club's got boo boo sounds in it
All twenty comin' with the crew who's down to hit
Til the break of dawn wit a new new poundin' it
Last call
Ain't no such
Then we drinkin' one in my clutch
Keep the party goin'
I'm getting your lust up
Everybody we be comin' to lift your cups then


I'm theatre of the hood
When it's lights, cameras, faction
Niggas gon be niggas when it's fight satisfaction
I walk up to the bar smellin' like the Kenneth Reaction
Niggas reactin' like you must be out of his slacks
When I'm undressed I confess I act a foolery
A pocket full of ducqets
Buku bitches and jewelery
I'm buyin' out the bar like my name was Anheusur Brewery
And hittin' bush by the deuce
Like Jesus created two of me
Haters they make me famous
So I'm deservin' an Oscar
Walkin' by niggas notice my swagger's disturbin' they posture
But I don't ever plex, the index got a steady aim
Cause the K will make them feel more hits than Teddy Pain
So I don't have to tease about the way I'm makin' cheese
I know you haties wanna cease and desist
But it will never ever happen
Cause I'm definitely rapping
At the party wondering when will I quit
I simply say


I'm the type of drinker with no mixers in my liquors
Crown Royal on the rocks serve it in your biggest pitcher
I be cocktail pimpin' Potluck too high to talk to women
Just wanna get em drunk shut em up and get up in em
She tipsy off six shots
She's feelin' my Rick Ross
She wanna lick a rapper and roll wit a big boss
Push it to the limit
Everyday's another party
Pineapple mali and Bacardi
 turnin' all the women naughty
Uh-Oh

I be drinkin' everyday like I'm on tour
And I love to get high like bonjour
Take another shot the shit's contagious
Like Nicolas Cage you live in Las Vegas
I'm sedated and spaded
Aimlessly lookin' for faded hoes who wanna get naked
'Cause bitch it's under rated
So pour me another drink
I want one
I'mma take it to the head til they all done
I can barely stand up let alone run
But the name of the game is to have fun
So take a shot with me little mama
I promise I don't bite like Jeffery Dahmer
I'm goin' to the top like Barack Obama
I'm a never slow it down like a comma
So I'ma..",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-poh-me-anutha-lyrics
Be Jealous,Vintage Tech,2005.0,"I'm just a young boy trying to get my money on
Making music in KC
But Mitch Bade niggas want to hate Tecca Ninna
And they won't stop fucking with me
So I'ma fuck with niggas
Na na na na na you cannot fuck with
That nigga Tech N9ne coming with that rough shit
Them niggas know that I deserve it when they heard it
Have the nerve to say it's nothing niggas so I got to bust it

(Be jealous) this is dedicated to all y'all haters
(Be jealous) I see you watching me when I walked in the club
(Be jealous) this is dedicated to all mitch baders
(Be Jealous) you motherfuckers ain't showing Tech Ninna no love

Fuck motherfuckers, buck motherfuckers
Here the pain come nigga wit' a bang, I'm a killa better duck motherfucker
What you standing on? Nada. What you plan to bone? Nada
What you plan to own? Nada. Your shit done came and gone
Blood, sweat and tears nigga, been about 15 years nigga
Ain't never been no fears nigga, all I hear is cheers nigga
That's why I be in the bathroom with the bitches at maniacs
That's why them hoes in the club with Tech giving blowjobs in the back
How many niggas really wanna bust skulls? How many niggas wanna become a wuss?
Fuck with a nigga like Tech get a buzz, right through the head and the grave is dug
Mean mugs, niggas ain't never seen love
So they stream blood when I fiend bud for the green shrubs
And mushrooms I bust rooms open accustomed
To float across the ocean with verbal motion the notion
Is boasting I'm poking with jealous, motherfuckers embellish
The truth to say I ain't worthy for fame, 'iancs and relish

(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding
(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling
(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas
(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming with bitches around me
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Hella lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit

No more styling I'ma start wilding on niggas, growling on niggas
And we smiling 'cause the villain album went 6000 on niggas
In Kansas City alone, leave Tech, Big Dog, Will, Mike and Nitty alone
Midwest Side, Lejo, Melly Mel I love you but it's a pity you gone
Niggas hating on mine 'cause they knowing I'ma do it big
That's why the Tecca Ninna never ever got a problem getting a gig
'Cause I rip shit they like, I flip shit you may bite
When I spit shit I get rich quick, I make heats from dark to daylight
N9ne millimeter guns, gonna be the one making a million when I come
Never gonna be the bomb, where I come from niggas better get some
Tried to be right to these niggas, tried to be nice to these niggas
So now it's time for N9ne Godzilla to make mice of these niggas
You envy me, 'cause your bitch play Tecca Ninna all day
And you see me on MTV, kicking it with King Tech, my nigga Sway
Broke niggas ain't friends to me, you niggas really want me to disperse
Alright I'll leave but when I come back it's gonna be 20 g's a verse nigga

(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding
(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling
(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas
(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming with bitches around me
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Hella lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit

Niggas better stop talking about me, I ain't did shit
I don't rap against niggas stop trying to get me to rap, so y'all could make grip
Agony don't be speaking my name, I know I fucked up
On a personal tip but if you niggas talking 'bout me, better rap motherfuckers better duck
If any niggas over there on the inside, infiltrating on me and my rogues
Them niggas don't give no fucks about how many Tech N9ne units sold
And who ever you bitch niggas is, saying I'm peeking in Lejo's log
Lejo'll tell you I'm original and by the way Lejo my dog
And the jealous motherfuckers won't quit, said The Calm Before the Storm ain't shit
We killed y'all in '96 '97, what about when the new shit hit?
And I heard niggas said was washed up, said the Tech N9ne flow is sleep
That's probably why I got shit in the movies like Thicker Than Water and In Too Deep
Tie you up and beat you down to a bloody pulp son
Got my villains and me mad enough to bust one
I'm the second coming but you don't know 'cause you dumb
Before I go I'll tell you jealous motherfuckers to suck one

(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding
(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling
(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas

Message to the Black Man,Misery Loves Kompany,2007.0,"This song is very close and dear to my heart, man
To be able to say something like this
It takes a hella motherfucker to say it
This song is dedicated to all my people
Its called Message To The Black Man
Check it out

My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records
And peepin' my shows
Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

It started on the slave ships (slave ships)
And field niggas would eventually take the day shift
With house niggas inside loyalty may shift
And it did divide us now we still need a race lift
Fuck a face lift
I ain't changing my identity
For energy from any that's obscenity
Now in 2007 we sick and ain't no remedy
Jealousy envy and murder it's like you ain't no kin to me
Guess we ain't nigga we go hard in the paint nigga
Still when you see me out you ain't the one who faint nigga
It's them other fans from them other lands
They listen to me more then my sister and brother man
I could see if I was a wack motherfucker
Bitchin' about the way that my people act motherfucker
But I do spit my people don't be so fuckin' reclusive
Get off of your lazy ass like you know something about music

My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records
And peepin' my shows
Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

You cry about the way I paint my face
It ain't y'all taste, little homie let my state my case
I'm not a devil or damn jester rumors can fester
Never uplift a demon with the image of my ancestors
African, act like you see me when you be traffickin'
Laughter when you frown up at me your hatred is bafflin'
You watch American Idol my people my paint is tribal it
Symbolizes not evil but the will still in survival
You niggas be so tough the moment we roll up
Your upper lip rolled up you hatin' it so what
Everyone knows us my city is sold up
My shows crush but y'all don't show up
They say it's more than money bitches whores
It's funny this here's war my people at his door
And I'm knocking, meanwhile we rocking
Globally and it's sad man
Light black attendance got my people lookin' real bad man

My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records
And peepin' my shows
Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

I wouldn't be bitchin' if I didn't want you around me
The way you write me up as a demon astounds me
Brotha Lynch, 40 Water, Federation, DMX
Busta Rhymes, Quincy, and X-Clan found me
Brother J homie he with me til this day homie
Who you know that's blacker then that?
With a staff and a 'Lac
My people lovin' that trash and they rap
I'm immaculate maybe they grab it if I was blastin' a MAC
Attackin' my people 'cause I'm black and I'm lethal
With this rap I don't trap, but I'm crack
Why you do be so close-minded when I'm rhymin'
Wishin' you can find it
Everybody but you motherfuckers get behind it
And I'm doper then a ki nigga
Message to wee niggas
Rocking sold out shows is where I'm gonna be nigga
And that's all I sell out, something you should see nigga
Betcha would come and see it if I told you it was free nigga

My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it

My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records

Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

Act like you know I’m your very own, motherfuckers
Hardcore shit, stop buying all that bootleg bullshit, too
Support your motherfuckin' artist
And Big Scoob said, when he finds out who’s fuckin'
Bootleggin' the Summer Edition, Rogue Dog shit
He's at that motherfucking ass
And I’m right behind his motherfucking ass, you dig me?

Killer,Killer,2008,"Lurking in every corner of your mind
Haunting your feeble existence with the rhyme
Your every breath consumed back in
For battle with this MC you'll never win
Anghellic, Everready, Absolute Power, MLK
Scream 'til nay sayers run away
You'll be infected soon even if you've never heard of
This deadly MC, prepare for murder

Ain't nobody stupid enough to get at me
Full of a lot of lemon, Sprite and Hennessy
Better be on my team and not my enemy
Givin' the suckers murder with my energy
See by the way I'm walkin' I'm a killer
Can see by the way she talkin' I'ma steal her
Get it poppin' you watch it take a Godzilla
And the Glock'll pop if you mix up my skrilla
Listen to me when I say that I'ma get it
I know you really lovin' the way a nigga spit it
It don't matter the weather, N9na gotta grit it
And I never will give a damn about a critic
I don't think you ever seen nobody rougher
One way or the other the music gotta touch ya
But if I gotta break it down for the suckers
All killer no filler, motherfucker

The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me

With an arsenal of tongue twisting rhymes
N9ne's music makes for good times

Haters you better be careful when you speak to me
I don't think you really wanna be off in the beef with me
Stupid thinkin' you wanna come and get a piece of me
Flow anorexic and my flow is obesity
Better kneel down the moment that I enter
I'm a veteran and you nothin' but a beginner
Not a devil but you can bet that I'm a sinner
I gotta eat the pretty women up for dinner
I can be a little psychotic on the wickedness
It's a homicidal recital when I'm rippin' it
And you know we get hella vital when I'm kickin' it
It's a fantasy for many but I be livin' it
Do whatever I gotta do to get the mill
I get down and dirty and dummy with the skill
If you wanna come and get it but know the victory
Is not in your favor ‘cause I got the power to kill

The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me

Ask anybody they will say I'm runnin' this
I know I got your lady wantin' some of this
My encephalon ain't no tellin' what will come of it
Night is trouble, I bring ‘em hell even if the sun is lit
Got the prophecy it's takin' over the nation
Ain't no stoppin' me I got the certification
Choppin' broccoli count the money that I'm makin'
Stop the mockery it be funny ‘cause you fakin'
All of my killer homies wanna hit
Put the elbow macaroni on a bitch
Killer killer for real guerrilla with that fist
Let it loose I'ma leave you losin' with a stitch
If you thinkin' you got it better I'ma cut you
Killin' you off and I love it when you suffer
But if I gotta break it down for the suckers
All killer no filler, motherfucker

The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me

So there and beware of what you say
For misspoken words you will surely have to pay
A vial of musical poison will fill ya
You can't resist the swarming of the killer",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-killer-lyrics
What’s Next,The Gates Mixed Plate,2010.0,"Tech: Craig you up man?
Craig: Haha, Mr. Smith, it's beautiful night in Kansas City
Craig: I must say Tech, you gotta check this out
Craig: Haha, it's another one
Tech: Shut up nigga you ain't Tony G
Craig: Hahahaha, check it out, uh

Its a hard knock jaw drop life for me
Last year I was in front of mic's for free
Now I'm winning its nice to see
Because if you ever tried to make it out of here, you would know its all bull
And I'mma show them how to steer with it
Had a clear vision head light deer sittin'
Thought it would be easy because Craig's got a clear image
Gotta shift out of gear LeBron James
They know that I'm a king but I remain in the cavalier
I was a rolling stone and now I'm sky-scrapping
I'm hella dope they high from songs im making
Like a Jamaican and I can BUCK BUCK
What was y'all thinking I'm hot for no reason
Summer summer time James lemonade
I'm in season and springing into the rain
You don't wanna get wet in it
I stepped in it
And got respect
And now I ask Tech what's next

I got my duffel bag, my swag and my A.M.X
I got my girlie all done up for some S.E.X
I keep my heat under the seat in case them fools they flex
I'm taking trips over seas, tell me what is next

Ay yo whats next up on the menu
What show? A different venue
When you thought that it was over no sir its to be continued
Too many people know you
Too many bitches on you
So you ditching on the exact same thing you want to go to
From the outside looking in
They don't be understanding
Because from every fan that loves you thats an inch away from family
My name is Obergeek but you refer to me as Grammy
It's just pre-mental planning maybe you will understand me
Started as a local, haha
Now I'm on the vocals lala
The time it took to do this shit was kinda loco
I know
Put me on the beat then I flow
I'm fuckin' with green because I go
Seems like I speed through obstacles like my life's on nitro
I see the light posts I'm speeding through the night glow
My miles per hour says I should be insured for Geico
I took a stop at Ollie Gate
As as soon as I stepped up in the place
He asked me what is on my plate
I said I got

I got my duffel bag, my swag and my A.M.X
I got my girlie all done up for some S.E.X
I keep my heat under the seat in case them fools they flex
I'm taking trips over seas, tell me what is next

I'm tryin' to make it so the whole world can hear that
Real raw and severe rap
Television showing how humongous my career got
Me popping bottles when the enemies watching poppin' beer caps
They feel severe slaps from here clear to Iraq
I'll near trap but this here's cracked
And I get them chicks with their boobies lifted and rears fat
What me and Travis doing every year after year stacked
Then we off in the Bahamas where the peers at cheers cat
And we don't fear packs cause we standing near straps
Come to me with that queer crap you'll get your vaneers cracked
Yeah I might be a weird brat
But I get them tears from your dear that'll have her speared in the lair when her brazier snaps
Watch who you sneer at
Because if we see a rat he's smeared flat
He's about to feel snakes and hear bats
So whats next is a mere splat
On her face because the P was shear wack, haha

I'm living like a rockstar (Living like a rockstar)
I'm going to places everywhere you are (Where you are)
I do it just like what you wish that you could truly be (Truly be)
I'm fresh, I'm on a magazine (I'm fresh, I'm on a magazine)
I'm living out my wildest dreams (I'm living out my wildest dreams)
I do it just like what you wish that you could truly be (Truly be)

I got my duffel bag, my swag and my A.M.X
I got my girlie all done up for some S.E.X

You see the game ain't the same, man, it's reasonable doubt
Niggas falling off the chain when it's a reasonable drought
In every hood, it's a snitch nigga running his mouth
But I was smart, I took my stash, told my brothers I'm out
Hold up, back up, Via, Diaz

Many consecutive checks you kept I can stretch, that is awful

F.U.N. (Fuck U Niggas),K.O.D.,2009.0,"Are you ready for some F.U.N. tonight?
Ha, are you ready for some F.U.N. tonight?
I wanna have a little F.U.N
You wanna have a little F.U.N
Everyone, let's have F.U.N., the F.U.N.'s begun

I'm different, you can see the Nina from a distance
My sixth sense tell me you're hating on me again
Persistent, jealousy and resistance
For my existence, so I gotta go for your chin
Workin' out, you can keep on workin' out
But your chin ain't workin' out, now your teeth are burstin' out
BAANG! Fowl thangs lookin' how thou came
So I gotta lift up millimeter and eat them like chow mein
I feel like F.U.N., that's why I will never be thus a real live one
The kind of F.U.N. that make them pull a 30 round drum
You givin' me negativity and really sound dumb
When you say to me ""You still rappin'? I ain't heard ya since '01""
Don't make a nigga beat you down like showin' up the Shogun
Then have to glow son, I'm like the chose one
And you not knowin' when to respect the Nina makes it like so F.U.N.!

Any time somebody come and disrespect I say F.U.N
When they trippin', look them in the eye and say F.U.N
When they get the picture they might go for they gun
They been hatin' on me from day one!
F.U.N.'s what ya need to say (Fuck u niggas)
Got guns on me either way (Fuck u niggas)
That's F.U.N. everybody say F.U.N. (Fuck u niggas)
Say (Fuck u niggas) Hey (Fuck u niggas) Alright

Diamonds on my neck, got diamond on my wrists
Pierced diamond in their lips, so it's diamonds on my dick
That's your chick, know when I rock the McRick spits sick
She strips quick cause Nina's big shit
And you say you ain't even heard nothin' new played
Since the Calm Before the Storm and you don't like me today
That's the reason I gotta tell you Uck Fay Ou Yay
And I'm off in El Paso fuckin' a bitch named Guadalupe
I'm straight F.U.N with it, you niggas done did it
Dumb shit is when you compare me to my nigga young with it
Now ain't that sum shit-it, we two different things
With two different schemes, but be off on your ladies tongue with it
And I have her so sprung, when you hate for nothin' nigga
We can get to bustin' havin' them puffin' air out of your lung
That's how the MO run, I be like so stunned when
You don't even rep or respect it so I go F.U.N.!

Ya Killin’ Me,All 6's and 7's,2011.0,"Nigga you came lame, tryin' to obtain fame
Making a damn thing but Strange bringin' you samhain's rain
Put on blame game, when you in it lame, you can't tame
And bane mane with fags that's gonna bring insane pain
 (2X)
(It's so easy) God sent me here to punish you
(Believe me) I'm the wrong one to run into
(I'm breezy) They tell me ain't nobody cold as you
But you, you? Ya killin' me

You thought you was nice, but I got news for you, sorta kinda
But Pill twice as nice as Rice with the 49ers
Can't bring a horror houses, you softer than Dora pouches
Smoke a Joker quicker than Batman and torture spouses
Can't believe that you can't believe that you ain't as clean and cold as this
Drank so we might crank the speed but after we leave you get frozen up, with the lights on
You think that you tight cause you got all that ice on?
This the right song cause I finish beginners as soon as they turn my mic on, yep
But I’ll tell you this, fuck it, I’ll package and mail you this
Now open this letter, you hope it's lil' fellow
They told me to tap you and tell you quick, bitch!
This a mixture of a pistol and some liquor
Wrap your mouth around this barrel, guaranteed you drunk quicker, damn!
On some Smokey shit, it's friday with the coldest bitch
Poke a bitch shoulder then showed her the door and told her ""dip""
Oh my bad, I didn't know that was your bottom bitch
I do the shit easy like after eatin' some cottage cheese, damn!
 (2X)

I feel this shit, I bust to my meal ticket
I'm up and I ill spit it, I fucks with the Pill nigglets
I'm real digits, be walkin' not ville live it
Even though that my scrill vicious
I'm painted up and still wicked
Fuck, my pen just took a big shit
I don’t give a fuck cause I'm gonna rip this
Everybody that call me devil is gonna get a plague
On their families, damnit, he's in the motherfucking red
Tech is sick of people's lack of acknowledgement
He was ripping before wack niggas got a cent
To the weak ones that stack up your dollars
Well, bustin' nuts is where I'm at cause I gotta vent
This industry can truly suck a booty
This rap is how I snap and hack a loogie, sucker sue me
Got straps right in the back, I pack a tooley for ya newbies
I crack your niggas hats for acting tooty fucking fruity
Laughing at you wannabes, I'mma hang nooses
For dudes that's useless, nigga that's fucking (Strange Music!)
We bang to the boogie, don't sleep on this
Stoppin' 'em, a nigga tryin' to eat with a beast
Wanna creep up on it but the beef gon' get
When you rapping niggas never speak on shit!

The Grench,Absolute Power,2002.0,"I hate you, can't stand you
Despise you, detest you

Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise

I can't stand your persona, the drama, your marijuana, or your momma
I really despise your ama so comma I disapprove who you honor
I see what you people can offer, I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G
I would've sought ya, caught ya, and then offed ya
I hate what you become, hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin' your reruns, hate givin' you refunds
I call 'em how I see 'em when I see scum
I free from the legions cerebrum I see none stupid and just really dumb
Hate seein' your whores, hate cleanin' your floors
Hate doin' your chores, won't be in your wars
Funk bein' your poor, haunts me and of course
You punks being endorsed, chumps being assured
Dumped me in the wharf
Detest you like a sickness, I bet you'd like to lick this
From Texas right to Memphis, built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate It would be great For you to skate
Off in a lake a beautiful fate, I hope nobody is at yo wake

Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise

We're livin' in the cold age
Road rage, dark no Solé
No way Jose Cuervo, there goes yo' day
Very scared everywhere knows mo' gay
Dislike is too soft, hate is more true talk
I hate the way that you cough, hate you and your Blue walk
Your crew fought, your crew lost so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off
So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can, under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my fam, I slam you
Samhain, Champaign, your family and you
I'm a monster when it comes to you, conquer every one of you
Trade tours, paid for, your neighbor
'Cause they whores, pray for JCOR
'Cause your state will create race wars

Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise

I feed you when you destroy buildings
And kill millions of children from Black, White, Chinese
To Sicilian
I thrill when you feel sin, dealin' drugs to billions
Awaiting your deaths, miserable until then
I wanna put on my Reeboks, and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Apocalypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was monogamous, doggin' us, you botherin' all of us
Gotta get loose from those who exit to sodom us
I hate what you stand for, hate all your scandals
When your lifespan go, I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle, you vandals
Saw 666 in your blood sample
Yo, the world is very different now, no more hugs
Just shrugs and Crips and Bloods and drugs
Nazis show no love, never we be equal
My name is the Grench and this song is dedicated to the evil people

Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise
Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive

At first, I didn't know what was happening
Enter, enter
And then, I knew exactly what was happening

I was in a daze
It was impossible not to stand there amazed
Rubbin' my opticals with my hands, there's a glaze
'Cause the view is implausible when I scan terri- days
Try to fight the sun, so I try to run
But the heat is so thick, I got no hydration on my tongue
No libation to come
And death is ticking, my lungs
I am stunned when I hear a voice in my head say, ""The fun is done""
Here come the drums
Dumpin' ammunition
Come the ban the -ism because I am the vision
Sent the plan the mission of in-demand divisions
'Cause hand in hand we livin', but man, we damn near trippin'
Caught so many run away from the light, huh
They want they enlightened to pay the price, huh
But I'm comin' like a thief in the night, huh
Stomping the fire when you put the N9ne in your life, huh
Choppers can't stop us today
I got the drop if you spray
Other people that are praying say, ""Tech, please stop""
Opps on the blocks and the cops in the way
But I'm no longer a resident, now I see it's evident
If I am over then am I'm not gonna be a revenant
Or was I really ever meant to be the medicine
But all of a sudden, I heard a voice up in my head
It went, ""Heaven-sent""

Realized the sky ain't falling, but the cerebral lie that I am tallin'
Leavin' thy divide and brawlin'
And made the evil die and lie in y'all sin
Lightyears ahead of my peers
Quite weird with no right-near
Cry tears leaving my fears
Now the bright cheer for the white beard
I've been on a mental elevation, I been awakened
And making all the hatin' and fakin' keep dissipating
Try'na straighten the nation with the faith and the aberration
They're shaking the core of Satan, 'cause I'm safe as salvation
They try to hold me down, but it chose me now
To go enter fear and experience showed me how
Evolution from that abusiveness so be proud
Lot of truthin' what I'm shootin', just load me, pow
Then I enter
Into the river of death and blood where only evil's delivered
I will not stop
I know the force that's within me is bigger
Take all the tension, all the shooting and lynchin'
All the blood I am rinsin' off and commencin'
To reinvent, this is my ascension to another dimension

Gamer,The Gates Mixed Plate,2010.0,"Welcome to G-G-G-Gamer
The game were either you can be the player, or you can get played
Caution, if you do engage and you lose
This may result in severe heart trauma or distort your way of thinking
Play Safely, safely, safely

I-I-I am a dame-gamer
Play the part major heart breaker brain changer
Take her thoughts make her start they insane anger
Then they can march, hate can spark, names danger
You gotta be fine to get in my chamber
Untamed ain't no shame when I bang stranger
But that's a thousand point, one got it, but the thing drained her
And the game hanged her in the strain of a main claimed her
Now what you gon' do different? Wonder how well the picture went
The one I saw was Twitter sent, saw through mommy like Mr.Kent
Lookin like her kissers were whistling to get liquor bent
Or wishing for me to stick her in a position to dip I get her hint
A hundred points she gets cause we connected
Five hundred points for the number that tech direct texted
Bonus three hundred if she come over and get naked
But a stinky crevice took her to nothing, girl take the exit

I'm a game, she the game
I'm a player, you not the same
Who to loose, who to blame
Don't hate the player, hate the game
I can be your super lover babe if you just let me in
Baby it ain't hard to play the game but maybe hard to win
It's a roller coaster ride come on as I give it a spin
Play it right you get an extra man baby

Next player she say shes the best slayer
She love when her breasts bare
With hot candle wax, that's rare
Six hundred points when she say her and her girl is a sex pair
That'll get you an extra man now we gamin on that there

Baby you doing good, stay on it picked up an extra man
The only way to use that bonus is if a sexy friend
Equally fine as you may join us to pass the test
To slam fingers in and then out on your own personal message can
Skype is so exciting and virtual when two tight women ignite
In a delightfulness of dyking in about five minutes
You might just win it yet, but now your girl looking up tight with it
Lack of participation got your points steadily spiking
And if five hundred points is important
Then let your mind body and souls free
Keep your opponents from trying to score these
Mighty sluttin' up with just seconds left on the board 3-
2-1 and on to the next ones cause these bore me
Because


Eleven Hundred points mommy looked smelled and taste good
But lost it from telling it all on Facebook
One got a dinner, the other from Twitter was using a fake picture
And in the end weren't none of them winners
'Til I met this girl from Tagged.com
Got to meet me, whip me, and she be freaky deaky
Got the dinner, a movie and plus a repeat
Highest score ever, but I broke the broad
Say you came close but no cigar my minds primed

Gaming on ya, even if you got some good head
Hood said you keep the pood fed 'til the woods dead
If you happen to get into bed with me
Then you'll spread quickly and do a medley of ooh and yeahs
With me, and that's a thousand points if you get that
Dinner is a thousand mo you can get it if you with that
Good conversation can probably get you diamond knickknacks
But a misshap like bloggin' about how I did that, give my shit back


Thank you for playing Gamer
Congrats if you are the winner
Sorry and shit if you are a loser
If indeed you failed
Please come again
But remember
Continuous play may cause extreme nausea
And often results can be fatal

So hot, I need a wet face towel, Yates style
Kill ’em all up, now I got too many case files
Locked in beats, somebody Rakim'd me
That mean I'm a top MC, tryna be the best the only way to buss
While so many made a fuss, at the same time
When they meet N9ne, they didn’t wanna speak rhyme
You wanna know the first thing they say to us?

They say
""You smellin' so good
I'm so glad I walked by your way""
(Damn, you smell good)
They say
""You smellin' so good
What do you call that? I gotta have some""

I like that fresh-fresh (Fresh), I smell like less stress (Stress)
Every nose get a whiff of the Tech's neck or Tech's chest
No talkin' 'bout special FX, she want sex next (Yes)
’Cause I’m in this splendid, she wanna be blended like Tex-Mex
Aw, so to hell with the sales, havin' mail is to fail
When it comes off my lapel (Woo)
Leavin’ trails when I bail, now your gal's in a spell
When I walk by, this what she yell 'bout my smell
""It takes me on a vacation""
Like a breeze overseas, they indeed love my Creed
My good deed makes me cheese, beggin', ""Please,"" on they knees
Wanna link up, they tellin’ me what they need
Just give me an invitation
A pretty penny is what you pay for Dust of an Angel
All ya gotta do is spray enough
Instead of wantin' you to play your stuff
You wanna know what they say to us?

""You smellin' so good
I'm so glad I walked by your way""

""You smellin' so good

Yeah, she said I smell delicious like a fruit, then pick it (Yeah)
Looks like you hit the lotto, I'ma be your ticket (Yeah)
A scent that sent from Heaven if I let you sniff it (Yeah)
And I'll show you how to ball without dribblin'
Out of like all of my siblings, I done evolved what my feelings is
That I can take any woman you got, my belly's the pot and I'm not really hot but I
Smell like the ink of a stink of a money phone
If I wink at her, she'll get a whiff of this honeycomb
She say, 
""It takes me on a vacation""
Well, throw some clothes together, we can go wherever
The hint of me winnin' a women's attention is what I be into (Yeah)
Quit the grinnin', drop the linen like we go together and
It feels just like mastur—
Aha, hold up, I get in your mind like a controller
She be sleepin' in my shirt, this what I told her
And she'll be thinkin' about me when I'm gone
Askin' me, ""What the hell you got on?""
Then I say, ""Me (Me) or maybe you (You)""

Oh

They comin' to muff me,

Makzilla,
 
Irv
 
and Big Nick
 we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, ""Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky""
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy,
 unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the afterparty)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off
You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the afterparty)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
""Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-"" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the afterparty


When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the afterparty, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-afterparty-lyrics

-Yo
-It's me
-What’s wrong?
-I'm just gonna say I'm due in October!
-Ahh sshh...

I was kicking it with this chick for a minute
She picked me to hit it, real stiffly I sitted
He spit then we quit it
Then I told her to miss me and splitted
Quickly I lit it up, no problem to get it up
Then she called and said she needed me to help her get rid of what?!
A baby! She said she wanted me to kill it
No evidence, blood - Don't spill it
I'm saying at first, I didn't feel it
But then I started to ponder on what was coming up yonder
A baby by a fling made days seem really somber
So we both were in agreement, the baby I seen it
Thinking of killing it made me almost fall to the cement
This ain't a job I can do myself, I ain't got the brain for this
So I called a homie in Kansas who was trained for this
He said the way I rap and make skrill for a living
He said he kills for a living
For the grip span, he's a hit-man
So I paid him a fee, he told me what date it would be
Me and her was down, but I really don't think the baby was G
So we three road to Kansas, baby probably thinking we scandalous
Can't even walk and we band his life
Man is trife, walked in and he told us to relax
I sat and he took her and baby to the back
Before I came I smoked some dope to calm me
They came back and she was baby-less and she was looking like a zombie
Baby gone (Baby gone)
Were we wrong? (Hella wrong)
Gotta move on (Gotta move on)
Let it alone (Yeah)
I dropped her off but she didn't hate me for killing the baby
She said she still wanted to date me, crazy!
I'm riding and I'm thinking ""Why?!""
I took a life but I ain't tweeking
I know God probably thinking I should die!

Real killer (That is me!)
Real killer (That is me!)
Real killer (That is me!)
This is what you call a what?!
Real killer (That is me!)
Real killer (That is me!)
Real killer (That is me!)
I don't really give a fuck!
Real killer (That is me!)
Real killer (That is me!)
Real killer (That is me!)
Know that ain't nobody iller!
Real killer (That is me!)
That-is-me, that-is-me (Mass murderer)
That-is-me! (Natural born killer)

A couple of years later, I'm creeping with this chicklet
Little thick chick, hit it raw and gave her triplets
I need to learn to hold my liquid
So I called my man in Kansas City, Kan
I told him I needed him to do it again
After he put 'em away, I asked him
""Homie, how could you be so raw?""
He said to me ""How could YOU be so raw?!""
We scattered, one year later I splattered in the same chick
She wanted to have it, but I made her do the same shit
So I murdered five kids of mine
I'm 'bout to sit in hell a lifetime bid for mine

Bad Season,Bad Season,2010.0,"Everything was supposed to be all Jesus
Come ease us we really need to be free from evil deeds
Plus negros, hide in thee weeds waiting to see us
And we bust then they will bleed trying to seize us
Bad season, I'm ready to trip for that reason
How your beefin gonna last when your ass vegan?
I ask trees when cash is fast, and weed then gonna have cheese stacks
Then trash bags will have fees then
Yes sir that's why the milli is in thee dresser
For any motha f'er wanna test for Tech will get him wetter
Step into death your ex messing with a keffer
Never let your lover get put in less than a bed with a heffer
The mags breathing, these fags freezing cause cats teased him
And they passed on that evening
I flash B's, and sag my flags revving I blast heathins
If they had me in bad season
 (2X)
These things must mean bad seasons
And they must be for a reason

Hardly time for no hardey ha no laughter
Working them hard I can't leave no starving bastard
Pardon me if you see a star in me it startles me
And I ain't come to party but I'm always what inbottles me
I'm living for the chips for the extra, got too many deaths
And I'm trying to find the way out the selexta
Jokes folks telling me gotta to bless ya
I ain't trying to Busta Rhymes, difference is there calling me Besta
My season is devil people receiving me
They party to my words but I don't think the motherfuckers is believin' me
Half the time I think my eyes are deceiving me
Fat boy that boy o'er there keep there hands in the air
You can do me like a new kid (New kid)
Rocket 'til it's putrid (Putrid)
Articulate to prove it but motherfuckers is stupid (Okay)
Kali baby, and his thing never leaving
Running out of breathe cause I'm breathing the bad season (Bitch!)


Ah! I think I'm out of my mind, they say I'm out of control
Tech let me go! This shit right here is a straight-jacket flow
It's nuts like pistachios, can't you tell? Lyrically I'm spraying shells
Wit my tongue, the devil's my son so I'm raisin hell
Yeah, yeah, say it twice, 
turn you to confetti with this machete
I'm like Freddy,
 
you'll die dreaming like Reggie White
Oh, oh, you in town? People shook when you around
Cut, they know the owner's well connected like unibrows
Big, big, bad wolf, yeah, I came and blew it down (Pff)
This is my newest style, oh, yeah? I'm a mess
Y'all know, everyone got hard flows
Where they at? Cause I can never find them like Waldo
Click, click, blaow! At your stomach feel the pow!
Have you rollin' on the ground, bleeding pleading screaming OOOW!
Rest in peace, this a sad evenin'

And give her pants to me cuz this her jam
Damn

Steer very clear
If he dare to stare and glare that's very fair
Be drinking, Be merry
Where the ladies with the derrière?
More black women popping up at my shows
Like Tyler Perry there
Oh
And they didn't know I won an MTV award?
New York yelling for me like they've seen me before
They know that underground clown come so sick and dark
But they didn't know they'd see the N9ne on 106 & Park
I'm kixin it and the foes can not stop
No hoes can cock block it
My clothes in Hot Topic

Chickens want the business giggling
Acting flirty
Little momma swallowed all of her vodka

Prolly cause she’s all the way in midst of forbidden and I head straight to the VIPer
Or maybe is you wet lil’ momma diggin’ on my feather
Got her dancing like a stripper
We super cold head to toe
We sharp as a machete
We the hottest show in KCMO
The new Malcom & Eddie yeah
It's me and Big Yates
He know my spits ape
Shit so sick he got me spitting on The Mixed Plate
Like a disgruntled employee that just quit Gates
You read the front of the fitted homie and it's

Popping you dick licker

The Worst,The Worst,2000.0,"This is dedicated to my kids
Aliya Renée Yates and Dontez Antonio Yates

As I blaze the PM, I inhale with the scent of a million men
I exhale with dumpin' .17 up in the front, I am
In the midst of a crisis God knows all the sacrifices I made
Might have to heist to get paid despite
But can't just the price that a nigga played bitch made
Niggas think they know me, they don't know me
They phony, funny but they don't know
That I'm that ill type nigga that'll open that gut
Not much luck
I'm feelin' stuck with a capital S
Hit the cess, killed the stress
Rottin' away in the Midwest, I guess
They was right when they said I was such a psycho sight
Sick inside a slight
Deliver that makes me want to go Master P at night, right?
No more pain I complain and pray to God, and stuffs
It was unbearable until I tried Cocoa Puffs
That Chocolate Thai got me willin' to fly up in the sky
But when I lose altitude that high
Makes me wanna just come down and die
Who's responsible for this madness, me?
Who's responsible for this sudden strike of sadness, me?
I can see
I can look into your eyes
Smile and then to your surprise
I'll be yellin', ""Die, nigga die"" when all the bullets fly
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this Earth
Because I'm the worst type of nigga on this here turf
So disperse

Living in misery
The worst, the worst, yeah
They keep tryna pull me under
But I been too long tryna make it over
The worst, the worst, yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do

What it is, what it was and what it shall be
You tell me
'Cause this nigga ain't livin' healthy
Bitches think I got money from here to Sri Lanka
So I'm thinkin' of killin' you when I'm makin' love to you Bianca
Can't you see I ain't you seein' what I mean
I got plenty of mean streaks, my team tweaks
So my future seems bleak
Take a peak at me, I ain't happy she got me
Under child social services and shit for bein' a slacky pappy
My khakis are low saggin' from illegal tight little baggies
Push it to them on top of the world like James Cagney
Feel that agony
People naggin' me
My raggedy life ain't worth livin'
Sick of my aunt and uncle draggin' me
See me drink my life away, smokin', tokin' my life away
Tryin' to put this trife away in the deepest darkest hide away
If I could fly today to the Golden Gates
I could get away from this place of hell and fakes
But it might be too late
What it gonna be? D-E-A-D
Another S-T-A-T-I-S-T-I-C, that's me
Puffin' that stronger W-double E-D that hunger
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this Earth
Because I'm the worst type of nigga on this here turf
So disperse

Living in misery
The worst, the worst, yeah
They keep tryna pull me under
But I been too long tryna make it over
The worst, the worst, yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do

That's why I say F-A-H-Q if you ain't crew
Some busters on my hit list betta hope it ain't you
My pockets thin, about to sin
I got to spend about like 10
To get that Henn, to make that blend
To make that fool come up out his ends
Devilish thoughts, hell is feelin' kinda of crellish
God tell us what we got to do to make the motherfuckin' relish
Spell it out to me 'cause broke is embarrassin'
I'm psycho like Woody Harrelson
I can make a comparison
Like Aaron Yates, Norman Bates, perfect mates
Dippin' up in Ollie Gates
Bitches yellin', head is swellin'
Thinkin' of goin' to hell and bakin' with the beans
Got me fiend, murder for my green
Seems, I'm cursed not first
The last verse
I burst, into a blood thirst, but what is it worth?
No hearse, nobody's turf
Fuck planet Earth, disperse
Because you're dealin' with the worst (the worst)

Living in misery
The worst, the worst, yeah
They keep tryna pull me under
But I been too long tryna  make it over
The worst, the worst, yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do

The worst
I know that it can't get no worst
The worst, the worst, yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-the-worst-lyrics
I Can Feel It,Misery Loves Kompany,2007.0,"(Verse 1: The Philsta)
I missed you so much I followed you today
You keep stayin' out all night and that ain't the way
To keep a happy home so I'm strappin' up with chrome
Telescopes with binoculars fuck I'm thinkin' bout knockin' ya
It's apparent I'mma be a single parent
So I'm hopin' that your snake ass ways are not inherent
To my baby boy a daddy's little angel
When I repave the drive way that's where your remains go
So I can always have you near my dear
And the foo you fuckin' has no idear
Your brainiac maniac widower ex-husband to be
Could buy me a ponto with the insurance policy
Man sprinkle your teeth on the sea shore
Act so natural and put up a fifty thousand dollar reward
Yup diddy-dep few years and he's yours (express sample)
You motherfuckers don't know who y'all fuckin' with!
(Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko)
Play wit matches you might get a fire
Play wit emotions theres tears in your eyes
Playin' with love and fo 'sho you gonna die
She's so broken I can feel it
(Verse 2: Agginy)
I can feel it when my man cheats it's a women's intuition
And when you mess with dogs, dogs go in heat
Creepin' on different days and different hours of the week
A beautiful lie that got my heart caught up in heat
I'm burnin', burnin' for revenge my hands clinched with my emotions
Is takin' over the physically to hurt you again
Watchin' your crib watchin' who comes through for you
Got me runnin' around like a psycho chick two
I'm seein' if ya lies really adds up to the truth
I wanna know this girl who shares a special part of you homie
Hopin' you understand you takin' a chance
Between love and hate expect the unexpected from the gate
You made yo bed now lie in it
That's the seed that you plant so you reapin' what is naturally god given
What goes around comes around what can I say
Cause when the rain comes no umbrella!
(Hook) (2x)
(Verse 3: Tech N9ne)
I'm talkin' about years, years of fidelity
But what happens when jealousy enters to make her yell at me
Tempers flair and we fail to be bindin' lookin' for hell and we find it
Fallin' rapidly no time to rewind it
It's a never ending cycle when people choose to be spiteful
And triflin' losin' lovin' to a stinch of cheatin' is stiflin'
Life's been excitin' when wifein' 'em
No more now you fightin' 'em
Women can be the shit when you wipin' 'em
Now it's rotten relationship trust is forgotten
And a nigga you found creepin' with her is softer than cotton
Cautious she get it popin'
When the city-to-city hoppin'
Extra activities stoppin'
Your bitch can be boppin'
Some might want to lose it and put a slug in his brain
One in her's then yourself and got 3 people slain
Tecca Nina can't live with the pain
That's why I say I'mma playa motherfucker and I bet I'll never change!

Tryin' to break the monotony, get away from my property
Ain't no way that you stoppin' me, at a party I got to be
But the check was a shock to me, that won't let my velocity slow
Wanna party with me let me know
We party 'cause we in pain, we party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane, we party just to escape
No matter how much the cost, regardless of what it takes
You call my phone and it's off I'm tryin' to numb the mistakes

Enter Everready/B.L.E.S.T.,Everready [The Religion],2006.0,"Enter Everready

So we rolling, just left Billings, Montana, did a dope ass show
We in a 15 passenger van, heading to Spokane, Washington
We driving along the interstate, we go over this bridge, hit a patch of ice, all of a sudden the van starts fishtailing
We're going back and forth, I'm like ""Woah!"" Krizz says...

""You got it Sean you got it! I think you got it man""
But we went sliding further and further towards and back then BOOM we hit
We flipped like 5 times, all the windows start breaking out in the van
I'm like ""Oh god, oh god!"" while we flipping, and finally we stop I'm looking around the van to see if everybody is alright
First person I looked at was Big Nick 'cause I see him jumping out first
He runs to the doors 'cause they crushed in and he starts grabbing trying to rip them open like (Grunting noises)

I yank the doors open and I'm yelling out ""Tech! Tech! Are you alright man? Kutt! Kutt! Are you alright?""
Kutt raises up and I see he's drenched from all the bottles of alcohol we had in the van from last night; and I say ""Kutt man, are you cool?"" and he says

""Yeah I'm cool man, I'm cool""
So I'm wiping my face, I'm thinking I'm bleeding
I look at my hands, it ain't nothing but the liquor
So I look around, everybody up and moving
Tech's still on the floor and I'm like, ""Tech! Tech, you alright?""
He ain't saying nothing, I'm like ""Aw man... Tech, you alright?!""
He said something like ""Kutt,""

""I'm fine man.. I'm fine man, I'm fine, I'm fine."" I asked him, I said uh, ""anything wrong with my face? Anything on my face?""
And Kutt was like ""Nah"" So I'm like, I'm listening, and I touch my teeth and I see blood in my mouth, but I'm smiling 'cause I'm hearing Krizz Kaliko saying ""Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus,""
And it felt good to be in God's graces
The ambulance, the people that came, they said that we were all blessed
Ya know what I'm saying, to still be alive after flipping 5 times man
So ever since then, we been celebrating life baby Kickin' it hard Every day's a party baby",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-enter-everready-blest-lyrics

You're just a groupie (Who, me?)
But you mean much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who, me?)
'Cause the things you do to me
She's just a groupie (Who, me?)
But she means much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who, me?)

The Hostile Takeover, oowee!
I met a Apple Bottom, San Jo model, like to swallow (Groupie!)
Huh, wonderin' if mami gon' choose me
Fuck it, let the Grey Goose and Cranberry Tropical lead her to me
Then I'll holla, I'm actin' all non-chalant, you eyeing me
Sort of obli-vi-ous to my dogs comments
You need a mental connection from stress relief (I'll offer)
As soon as the pill kick in watch the panty hose fall off her
And twenty minutes later, mami's on E
And she can't keep her little groupie hands off me
Now her mouth is around my dick
Then we fuckin' and sex-ercising
I'm in her hole, Off in her soul
Lovin' my extra sized (dick)
Whenever I call, I can hit it
She love some Kutta
Whenever I'm dwellin' on that encounter it makes me stutter
'Cause I, I, uhh (Dammit)
Won't even try y'all
Pop it and knock yo shit outta socket like Houston's eye ball, 'cause

You're just a groupie (Who, me?)

Road again, I met a lot of groupies
I got a California, Colorado, Kansas City (Groupie!)
And ooh-wee! Wasn't s'posed to choose me
Somethin' I said to her maybe made her give it to me
Caribou got you woozy too
Got ya doing things you wouldn't usually do
And ooh, I love womens
Gotta find a way to get 'em on the bus and outta their linens
I make 'em strip for me (Damn)
It's the shit homie (Woo!)
Treats me somethin' nice
Beast, we somethin' like
Gimme Felicia O!
Know how to do it right
When you see the Snake and the Bat
Know where yo girlfriend at
'Cause every time you turn yo back
She be with them rapper cats
Let her on the bus to braid my cornrows
But when I start pourin' those, we makin' pornos
To me you much more than a S-L-U-T
(She's a groupie!)

You're just a groupie (Who, me?)
But you mean much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who, me?)
'Cause the things you do to me
She's just a groupie (Who, me?)
But she means much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who, me?)
'Cause the things you do to me

Hey, I was just thinkin' about the time we had on the stairs
I'd have to say, that was a first *Laughs* Call me back
I wanna tell you about this crazy dream I've been havin' about you, baby
This is Shannon from Washington, I miss you

What's sizzlin pigeon? When I'm thizzin' I need a
Supercalianimalistic, sex me à la (Groupie!)
And I don't care if she fair with the long hair
But as long as we there, bare and I bone
And we share squares on the stairs of my hotel
If they stare at us, oh well
'Cause your boyfriend's waitin' while I'm breakin' your swole tail
And your boyfriend hates, while he pace, cryin' a storm in the lobby
When you get to the house you fight like Foreman and Ali
But check it, gave you an autograph
On your calf then I dashed
But I didn't know that it'd be a tattoo the next time I saw your ass
She got on my bus, I was like ""Holy shit""
She laid on the couch opened her legs and said, ""You owe me this""
I'm the answer to your girls groupie pains, oochie coochie dames tempt me
When in my presence they tell me, ""Pinch me""
'Cause I'm exciting baby, if I didn't exist
Sexy female scientists would have to invent me

You're just a groupie (Who, me?)
But you mean much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who, me?)
'Cause the things you do to me
She's just a groupie (Who, me?)
But she means much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who, me?)
'Cause the things you do to me

See I'm tryna keep it quiet
Tryna keep it on the low
Ain't gon' let you bust a while
Open up but what's at home
She's  just a groupie
But she means much more to me
Than just a groupie

Red Necro,Vintage Tech,2005.0,"Follow me into the world of racism

We're on the highway, rolling to Californ-I-A
Seven of us heaven love us 'cause it's evil in front of us
We must trust that G-O-D got our backs on this T-R-I-P
In the van we watchin' flicks and getting our kicks on Route 66
Forty West got us dozin', my eyes closin'
Almost on “E” and so we stop to get some gas
Somewhere outside of Arizona people's persona
Seem like they put niggas in a coma, or bullets in their ass
Fast I went in to what? To get some petroleum
Rodeo circus, these trashy motha fuckers
Trying to show me they tat's on purpose
Swastika's here, Swastika's there, minding my affairs
'Til one shoved me and I said, ""aw this is lovely""
I punched him back and said take that from a black
His posse ran up I threw my hand up, said let loose the gats
They said, ""We're the type of boys that kill 'coons by the hour
Nig
ger one God, one race, sieg heil, white power!""
I said ""Fuck you. Bill Riccio, you spacey ho'
I heard racist were dying and I'm about to increase the ratio""
While we were scrappin' I heard, ""coon, monkey, ape, baboon""
I heard my partner's lettin' loose they cleared the room
I let off a couple inside their racist encephalus
I asked God was I wrong for slaying demons and devils?
And if so, forgive me, but now it's 2 wounded and 3 dead
From shots to the head, these racist mother fuckers bled

Rednecks are the ones who bled next
First they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked
For bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion
This is one of the many, many flaws of this nation

""
Watch that 'boy' shit redneck

I'm just a hard workin' brother at Ford
Report to work pronto amigo in my raggedy Accord
Assembly working no smirking I get the job done
White folks staring at me like I was Dennis Rodman
Fuck it
It must be the bandana I wear, saying black owned
See them whispering everyday but they can yap, yap on
Saw it comin' a mile away and it figures
Somebody took a grease pencil and wrote on a car ""Whites own Niggers""
Paid it no mind, now it's lunch time I'm eatin' quietly
Then a voice said ""you don't belong in society""
I looked then I felt like gaggin' these white trash mother fuckers
I heard that he was the grand dragon
Fuck him, I'ma tag him, skull drag him
But his recruits equipped with steel toe combat boots
This is crazy for four hundred plus we've been infamous
Stigmatism is realism, the idealism is to hinder us
Put his fingers in my face I bent 'em back
He said, ""you fuckin' jerk"" and told me to watch my back after work
I punched out I walkin' to my car, I'm driving
And I see this mother fucker, he's following me from afar
Pulled over like an idiot jumped out and said, ""what's happenin'!?""
We started scrappin' he cut me with his knife, I took his knife, there goes your life
God forgive me because I slit his redneck
Now all is left is the fuckin' dead peck

The demons are gonna kill me, I feel it comin'
I'm a little piece of love, and a pit full of `em gunnin'
The pit is the planet, damnit it's full of killas and racists
If God make it I'm saying, God take it break it
Demoni-acs of all colors, Crippers and Blooders
Arian brothers die, If you fuck with any of us God lovers
A southern wind, hit the Midwest my mother cringed
'Cause her vocalist, keep fuckin' with white national socialists
Everybody wants to be the chosen God's people
When teaching hatred hatred, at the steeple steeple lethal sequels
When churches burn, we purchase germs
Like guns to slaughter all the mother fuckin' surface worms
Be warned, all fronts got the right to fall once
And the racist be the ones we call dunce, down to die!
For my love so before you cease us
You got to what? Crucify me like Jesus leave us rednecks

Fish in a Pita,Dominion,2017.0,"Got me fired up
Might wanna keep that tied up
Get up (get up)
And get goin' right now
Ain't feelin' right, feelin' wrong right now, hold up
Don't need her, don't need ya, won't eat ya
Fish in a pita
Alright then (alright)
I ain't trippin', I'm slidin', wait a minute

She pulled up in car at the crib
This was way before the Nina was a star and I lived
At my Granny's, the girl that stepped out the car she was a whammy
Tight jean shorts, no panties, and her booty was uncanny
Went to school together, how 'bout some food endeavors
I wrote it smooth in a letter
She wrote back cool, whenever
So this is the day
Hopped in the car wit' her to a kissin' display
Later for eatin' now I'm on a mission to spray, okay
Hopped in the backseat
Movin' toward her with that heat
Between her legs, the wings are spread
I'm yearnin' for that cat meat
I'm wishin' to beat her
But I got sniffin' her skeeter
Through her clothes
I quit because she had the fish in the pita, ugh

Got me fired up
Might wanna keep that tied up
Get up (get up)
And get goin' right now
Ain't feelin' right, feelin' wrong right now, hold up
Don't need her, don't need ya, won't eat ya
Fish in a pita
Alright then (alright)
I ain't trippin', I'm slidin', wait a minute

Big chick, pretty face
Okay I wanted to find out how them huge titties taste
Can't remember what city, state
I wanted the kitty space
But I did this dizzy date on the bus after my show with a bigly shaped
Bitch, kissin' on me, chick is only
They told my hissin' homies
Dissin' on me, y'all trippin', nigga this a pony
They laughin' while I'm dashin' to the back
Finna be smashin' my pretty fat friend
Till her ass need a aspirin (hol' up)
Strippin' down, my dick is now (swole up)
Smells a fish and now my stick outta commission how (tore up)
I assume she hate to groom, funk illuminates the womb
Can't believe she let fish in the pita fumigate the room, ugh

Got me fired up
Might wanna keep that tied up
Get up (get up)

Ain't feelin' right, feelin' wrong right now, hold up
Don't need her, don't need ya, won't eat ya

Alright then (alright)
I ain't trippin', I'm slidin', wait a minute

If she sit on your lap and she got jeans on
And you smell that fish in the pita
She ain't a bring home
That really mean the stream wrong
It seems strong to be comin' through her garments
So why would you want that fishy cream on your ding dong
Some women need just to stop treating their twats cheaply
If that's between you we're not eating it's not freaky
So stop mistreating you're not feeding me hot meaty
Fish in a pita leaking to ziti, or tzatziki, ugh
I know you women thinkin' this awful
But you know who you are and you're livin' unlawful (if you're stinkin')
Fellas I don't know if anybody eva' taught you (fish in the pita)

Saw Somethin’,ENTERFEAR,2020.0,"I spent so many years searching for ghosts
For proof of the spiritual realm
I searched all the way up 'til lupus took my mom
Then I stopped
But I wish I saw somethin'

Losin' religion, waitin' for somethin' to come
Spent so much time haunting ghosts, I turned into one
Where will I go from here?
It seems like the coast is clear, but I

Wish I would've saw somethin' (Somethin')
Almost thought that I did (I did)
I wish I would've saw somethin' (Somethin')
'Cause I was tryin' (Tryin')
But the more that I searched, the more that they hid
Like they never wanted to be discovered again
I wish I would've
Really saw somethin' when lookin', but I never did
I wish I would've
Knew that the spirit is close when I prayed as a kid, but it hid

I'm talkin' 'bout abandoned asylums in the nighttime
I was just demandin' to sight 'em when the light shined
On the camera, Canon, the item, never caught no phantom, just hide 'em
Man, I thought it'd be grand to invite 'em in my lifetime
My mother's pain was enough for me to be searchin'
If it was for me to be hurtin', 'cause if nothin', never would be certain
I was cursed then, no spiritual anything outside of my shell
Landed on the doubt side and I fell, damaged a devout ride on my trail
I was lookin' for ghost confirmation 'cause she was sick, bro
Was a whole lot of close observations but never did show
So if you spoke conversations like, ""Do they exist?"" No
Not a spirit, not a host of our creation, but I wish though

Losin' religion, waitin' for somethin' to come
Spent so much time haunting ghosts, I turned into one
Where will I go from here?
It seems like the coast is clear, but I

Wish I would've saw somethin' (Somethin')
Almost thought that I did (I did)
I wish I would've saw somethin' (Somethin')
'Cause I was tryin' (Tryin')
But the more that I searched, the more that they hid
Like they never wanted to be discovered again
I wish I would've
Really saw somethin' when lookin', but I never did
I wish I would've
Knew that the spirit is close when I prayed as a kid, but it hid

You know I get around like a ceilin' fan, I be chillin', man
Go to foreign lands to make fans
And try to get bands, and we make a killer, man
And we do it for the fam
When I run home and come on, she told be she be livin' with a man
Why you do it to me? Damn
Who I gotta put my gun on? Who about to get swung on?
He been eatin' my food
Huggin' my lil' dude, sleepin' in my bed
You been keepin' him fed
Lettin' him get in your head, he about to be dead
But no, he was stuck in my townhouse
'Cause he died young while he was livin' there
Somebody shot him, got him high
Stuck in the sky, and they ain't even give a care
But the soothsayer tell her, ""Stay in prayer
Light sage, and then make a wish""
Said his name started with an M
If you see him there, then you tell him, ""Chris""
Birthday is six, six, '06, so he protect in crystal
Didn't see the ghost myself, but I wish though",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-saw-somethin-lyrics
Need More Angels With Prayer by Brother K.T.,The Gates Mixed Plate,2010.0,"Praise God, my brother, hear me father right now
As I'm asking great blessings in favor right now
For this man of God, Lord, you know the direction that your taking his life
Holy spirit Lord and you have a covering over his life
Continue to bless him, Lord, let him know that his best is yet to come
And Lord, let him know when the wickedness of his enemies try to destroy him
To bring him down, all he has to do is just call on you
Now Lord, come bring favor into his life, favor into his music Lord
Let him know that his best is yet to come
As long as he can continue to put you first

Drama, used to be my middle name, with ecstasy
Sex and technically set me for a little fame, it gets to me
When the people I used to know switch and change, regretfully
I'm gonna say I don't wanna see none of them again, they stressing me
When they think 'cause of my absence I'm playing games
When really I just work in strain to let everybody else feel my pain
And respectfully I gotta say buzz off you and Tech Nina's thangs in jeopardy
'Cause I need angels around me, that's your claim, but you'll never be
Strange Lane I feel this deep in my veins like Leprosy
You attacking my nerves and mess with my brain, it's vexing me
Ain't a angel inside you distrusting vain is your recipe
To complain is necessity, you're to blame so I reckon we
No longer straight that's why I never came when you beckoned me
I need peace in my life, but with you need gangs and weaponry
I'm too busy to have these lousy lames come question me
Man I really do need more angels blessing me

You see we've all done our dirt
God knows that I have
And I know I can't take that back
But I can say today I'm makin' a change
I'ma leave the drama in my past
So if you tryin' to bring me down
Don't you ever come around
I got no space in my life for negative, I said I need
I need more angels around me

Need somebody to bring me a brighter day
Not somebody that when I see 'em comin' I gotta hide away
Like these losers leavin' messages ain't gon' try to say
I went Hollywood when I don't answer so you know I push delete right away
I need the drama gone like I'm at my mama home
Your persona's piranha beyond the haters trauma, holmes
So if you wanna get on us you get the llama chrome
I know that you hear me even though I'm speaking mono tone
That's to the demons who's callin' leaving me death threats
Been a couple of years and my spirit ain't even left yet
Yellin' 'bout when I come to your town I'm liable to get wet
Tech said maybe angels but dump you can bet that
We don't need evil seeds making us get dummy
Wanna breathe the weight of succeed, get from me
Devil breed ain't no need for we to get chummy
Deny your creed and proceed to get money

You see we've all done our dirt
God knows that I have
And I know I can't take that back
But I can say today I'm makin' a change
I'ma leave the drama in my past
So if you tryin' to bring me down
Don't you ever come around
I got no space in my life for negative, I said I need
I need more angels around me

Need sun rays, not a dark cloud
That's why they still lookin' for me like, ""Where art thou?""
Oh brother, they so cluddered and hearts' foul
Ain't never returned they call and they 'bout to start now
Need angel wings, not gargoyles
You bring that beef to me get ready to get charbroiled
I treated them so nice in the past these people are spoiled
Reject them demons and get them all off of our soil
And when the smoke clears in your retina
Who cleaned it up? You gots to give it up to slegna
The black boots and red strings come to bless ya
Let's ya mesh mess and threds bash your ex-o
Dus, yes that's us but my angle
Is to break news to these webs that's so tangled
Such a shame, your name remains painful so change your games
'Cause we were stained but became angels

You see we've all done our dirt
God knows that I have
And I know I can't take that back
But I can say today I'm makin' a change
I'ma leave the drama in my past
So if you tryin' to bring me down
Don't you ever come around
I got no space in my life for negative, I said I need
I need more angels around me

Now, Lord guide and keep him
Lord give him strength and favor
And Jesus end my prayer, amen
My brother I love you, stay encoraged man
And just know what God has for you Tech, is for you
Can always count on me, alright?

Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!
All day, all night (4X)

I wrote my life down from '85 to right now
And my style had a heap of people just like ""Wow""
Schizophrenic, grim and venomous lyrics with a slight growl
I was destined to be Tech, to rip and excite crowds
So my pals think after I rip the mic down
It's lights out and right to the pillow of my right eye brow
But when I chow I stay up and write sounds
I like loud, I stay wake and create late like a night owl
Meeting deadlines, serious as fed time
They said I'm extremely different and I head mine
I wed﻿ rhymes, married to this game and my bread's fine
That's why I'm always rocking classic J's, the red kind
With that said I'm always up in y'all sights
Some think it's all wrong, being spotted it's all right
Thinking that I'm the no type is all hype
I ain't got a problem with being Tech all day and all night
For real

This ain't nothing like a nine to five
A superstar now, it's your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!
All day, all night (4X)

I write my flows and record them, I do my shows and we floor them
And so they go, let's reward them with merch and ticket sales
That's why my clothes I afford them, this love I know never short 'em
So why would I go and abort them and curse and give it hell?
They spot me at the movie, sippin', tryna press a newbie
Getting through these a hectic next to me singing my message to me
But I never get vexed the scroogie when I'm at the Ruby Tuesday
That's a doozie, follow me for autographs when I'm set to dookie
That's TMI, whether on the street or fly
With the need desire to be seated high and this heat is why
Even sometimes I be down and dark they all bright
Lifting me up, being Tech Ninna all day and all night
Yeah

This ain't nothing like a nine to five
A superstar now, it's your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!
All day, all night (4X)

Ey, they even find me up in Wal-Mart
And give me coochie coupons, sexy mamas be all heart
Even at the Mandalay Bay I'm off in the mall parked
Chicks looking for me, patrolling the area like Paul Blart
And it be the same when I'm with the chiefs to gain
People greet me, heat arraign, sleep, they need to meet the Strange
Cat cause he became the creature sent to eat the game
Speaking of eat the pizza came in the beast in frame of the pizza mayne
At the funeral, taking pictures, near urinals
Not only when I'm on tour, you know where I'm stepping, they're sure to show
And it's a blessing, even if I'm stressing I'm durable
And you're to know, to do this like Tech you have to endure to grow

So thick, roasted I dosed it I’m so sick with it
Ladies supposed to get, get it below the clit lick it, I rose to get wicked, ya dig it?
By designer, I’m the kind to climb be-hind a fine dime to slime her
Wine and dine thine is minor when it’s time to grind her
Blind with signs, I’m gonna find a vagina!
Malebolgia came to ground hoes

Curious (What Up Wit Ya Girl),Bad Season,2011.0,"Damn baby, that was real good
(Mmm, do you think they heard us downstairs, papi?)
I think they heard us downstairs, next door to that
And next door to that, y'knowmsayin'? (Hahaha)

Yeah, that was good baby, puss crazy
Could maybe you turn on the fan cause it's a good 80
In here right now, we were steamy like wow
Bangin' like wow, question babe, you my pal, right?
This might not sound right, but your girl is down right
This clowns type and she right below us hearin' our sexy soundbytes
And Kutty is sittin' down there with her actin' like he just found Christ
Tellin' her he's married so I'm in a hurry to get her frown wiped
Listen, I'm ready to do this thing, enough of wishin'
Do you think she would come up and get in our fuck position?
Don't be lookin' at me like I'm crazy baby, it's just suspicion
And I never had eyes for your past homies, but I does for this one
Cause she's a X, the Roman numeral for 10's a X
And the last letter in sex, wanna smash and get her then press
Why you lookin' at me like I'm ig-nant? You should be pitchin' this
To your homegirl then I can do both of you like a polygamist
So are you diggin', it? Do you gotta get twist-ed
To get up the nerve to run to her and get her in this, bed?
Looks like you're stressin' but the Scorpio in me ask the question
I really like sexin' you but the two of you would be a blessin'
 (2X)
What up with you, girl? I want to enjoy
Would you tell your girl, to get up wit ya boy
And I'm diggin' on you, but I'm still curious
You're lookin' at me like I'm playin' but I'm dead serious

Now babe - I'm hoping you don't take this wrong, girl
But ever since you came up in here with your homegirl
I had my eye on you, and her too
And honestly I'm thinkin' that I want you both, girl
I - know it may sound a little bit ridiculous, a little sick and twisted
If you ain't wit it then I would understand
Cause when I'm thinkin' of somethin' a little kinky and freaky-deaky
You seem kind of timid but on the other hand
Know what they say 'bout them shy ones, and it must be true
Look at you sittin' there blushin' hard and you smilin'
While your homegirl's sittin' right beside you
Every time I look up she's starin' into my eyes and I just
Wonder (Hmmm) do you ladies like to share?
Shower with each other, have you ever took it there? (Yeah?)
Teamwork makes the dream work
So how about we take it to the room - you, me and, her?
 (2X)

Uhh, I'm so street when I speak, my speech scrape the sewer
I don't wanna meet your girlfriend, I want you to take me to her
Uh-uh, I ain't mature
I'm gettin' head outside of my ride when I'm drivin', Ace Ventura
I come from mad Mitten, I move two bad chicks in
Like ""Three's Company"" honey, I know, I'm (Jack Trippin')
She like to try and kiss me, she said her name was Janet
I said call me Nickel, now let's go find Chrissy
I'm not gon' lick the box, but I try to keep you happy
I call my nigga Big Scooby, he'll come and eat your (Shaggy)
I know I act bold It's just that me, you and her
Make the perfect combination like a cracked code
I was taught by them eaters to double yo' plate
I'mma be cummin' 'til one of you got the Juggalo face
Woo-woo, I'm just kiddin', though I am persistent, I got a question, listen

Tell you be throwing and mowing and comes comin'
Mumbling something 'bout last night
What was this cat like
Wanna live the fast life
Make the choice let it go you can back it up
And if you wanna get back wit' her maybe you can patch it up
She chose me to approach me to slowly
Poke the back out of her rode the pony and saddled her
Told me it didn't matter if we was unhatted she had a habit
And was an addict and had to have it
Now her boyfriends on to us
And he got beef wit' me

Out numbered got my peeps wit' me

You fished and you found
You still insist to be clowned
'Cause here I stand the lip was in town and dissing you now
I spit 'til you frown 'cause you a trick and I'm bound
To tell your chick to make me rich you swim in shit and you drown
I have no time for the punks I dump
Not eager to stick around waiting for funk to jump
He's mad at the N9ne 'cause I put the crunk in the front
You big then Sherman clump
How many lumps do you want?
Still I don't really know who you talking 'bout
If you don't get out my face you won't be walking out
But in my mind I remember I sats it down and ate it soft
'Cause I laugh when I told her wrench around and wrench it off cha

Brightfall Confession,Planet,2018.0,"I prayed that the light in me to not only be held inside of me
But free the wrong with the right in me
Because the demon I was, they won't confide in me
I come from a religious background being raised a Christian of Barker Temple Church of God and Christ
Also studying Islam from 12-17 after my Christian mother married a Muslim
Mom loved that I rapped, she just wanted me to do it for Christ
But the worldly me began when I ran away from home at 17
And no matter how much better of a person I became
The worldly things I did would catch up with me
And try to pull me right back down
Right back down
Right back down
Right back down
Right back down",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-brightfall-confession-lyrics

His family is folks, they call him Scoob, baby, but y'all know him like

Duckin' dodgin' shakin' the feds
But they missed nigga, so I'm back searchin' for mine
Fresh off the grind, still gutta sick with these rhymes

The way I make it switch it from red to dookie brown
Spot a curve and dope boss dogg and lay 'em down
On the roads and be no lost cause and wait around
Show them hoes there'll be no toss drawers 'til you pay the hound
The way I refrain from hangin' with simps
And never fuckin' with shrimp that ain't deveined
The way I smash for the cash, the way I mash harder (Flash)
Caught a broadcast on the blast with a last broader
Why I'm half martyr, the reason I take showers
'Cause I don't like sittin' in my ass water

Put some hog in they style, dogg and I'm wild

Pussy nigga runnin' his mouth, but for now I'mma changed man

Takin' papers, makin' moves like a grown man
Vill steppin' in the seven first up for the field plan

Everlastin' cashin' a vast stash colder then aspen askin'

Swimmin' in my water tank and drinkin' Henn' and lemon
It's realistic, you got shit twisted, don't get lifted off the feet
I keep 6 clips with my heat like I'm enlisted
Nigga this is far from the Army, Navy or Marines
We forming the gravy, new lyrical criminal team
To make the green, fuck you fakers, my eyes dreamy
For that 2000 Benz with doors like Lamborghini's
Or Carrera Porsche, still enforce ones with flavor
Bitch save the royal, players don't hate an innovator

You got a disease, nigga, so please ease away from me's, nigga
My feas ease Bs about that cheese, nigga
Your Ph balanced for a man, but made for the woman

Fuckin' bitches, money got the riches
When the other Mitches work at Mickey D's
I done seen, niggas straight hate me, mean mug me, wanna slug me
Currency thickness due to the bitch sickness
This Tecca Nina, niggas hate me thinkin' that they grass is greena
They the tortoise and I'm the kcufin' hyena, never dealin' with a bitch

Lace my chucks up, vest up, this life is messed up
They the fake, known to playa hate, low like snake
Beat a snitch to beat the cakes and straight laugh at your wake
You outta shape since '88, you've been losin' the race
Couldn't keep the place, but the hate's just sealin' your fate
Talkin' what you at, what you gon' do, like you the man
Bumpin' two bazooka tools in a dented Trans Am
You livin' dreams, like a crack fiend who say he clean
When we ridin' beams you steam, we drunk off ream
Life for riches, gold diggas havin' finesse
Put a slug to your chest with they bitch sickness

I hit they high I got it, so come get this with the quickness
I'm antibiotics for that bitch sickness
A few plotted, I spotted 'em, scoped 'em, made them open
They mouth to see if my Glock and dick fit bitch
Nip this shit in the butt, split a spliff, twist a bud
Flick the bic, light the bud, let my lips hit the butt
Ain't no tryin' just smokin' Oakland city thug
Leave your head fryin' like your brains on drugs
Investigator on a respirator, rain unplugged
Since I'm ballin' rhyme they all in mine, but it's one love
You ain't knowin', this R&G prodigy is buildin', flowin'
Dope selling to the paper touch the ceilin'

We come back poppin' like bigwom fayzon, player hate on
This Midwest side nigga, we Rogue Dogs on the ride, killer

These niggas copy cat practicin', yo shit is has been
You get choked, blade horse roped, open your throat
With a razor blade, no prints, die slow shit
Chance of livin' lookin' hopeless, you turn to codice
Just 'cause I got the nuts to roll natural you wanna be phat
Where the boss at? My Gucci linkin' learn to floss that
It's best that you get your own dude and wear your own shoe
Do what the boss do, I catch you, it's gonna cost you
This small world, get your own shit, I'm tryin' to fit
Rame and Tech N9ne spit for money grip, we makin' hits
Trip this: I'm from the city where guns ain't shit
Hundreds, think back, you hated fast, but now I've done it, done it

Down For The Block,Bad Season,2010.0," (x2)
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block

Down for the block like Shaq O'Neil
Me and my niggas hitting corners in the Batmobile
My block so hot so keep you enough shots
You slip and you fall niggas get chalked like hopscotch
On my block, I'm in cahoots with what's going on
Take me out the hood but the hood will never leave me
I'm holding on as if I'm falling off the edge of a cliff
If I live to see 80, I'm reppin' the bricks
Real shit, leaning like a syrup sipper
Henny and sprite mix it up get a cup nigga
Pour out some liquor for my niggas who ain't living on the surface
After the bottle we load our clips and put in work
Block shit stay in the house when they set tripping
A hundred rounds hit niggas and wet women
East side 9-double-0-5-9
Watts, California, I ain't hard to find
Shit, I'm down for the block

Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block (Kutt Calhoun: Ay)
Down, down for the block

I'm down for the block like I'm down for my wife
And if you niggas fuck with either, then it's down with your life
I got no mercy for you fuck-ups or the way that you behave (All Blood)
And represent that from the cradle to the grave
On my block when we was taught you had to get it how you spit it
Shoot blocks and throw rocks, hawk spit or talk shit
Killer City better watch ya, might get set up by some hoes
Better do what Alvin Ailey do and stay up on your toes
Got the deuces and the Dre's click-clacking in the pain
A hard method of survival try to shake it but ya can't
Rather win, lose or draw, stand your ground and hold your weight
And if you still can see your ribs, get ya weight up, quit your hate
'Cause niggas know when in a food fight you wouldn't bust a grape
Spike clicks probably better off chopping with the K
I'm down for my block and I love my town
So, Killer City stand up and Kutty Cal can stay hound
SuWoo

Say the word, watch me rush your shit
I'm the realest motherfucker with this Stranged out clique
Suck the willa on the realer, I ain't playing with you niggas
Godzilla with the milla get to spraying at you niggas
Yeah, check my history, nigga, when you mention me
Bet they say I'm in the street, rider nigga for the V
Fuck the industry, fucking what you think of me
I don't give a fuck, bet you pussies be respecting me
I love the block, 'cause my sign in the prime time
You niggas faked your steady lying in your fucking rhymes
Saw a nigga, hella twisted off the R nigga
Gutter butter, I be seeping like a ball nigga
Desert eagle for the people, I be busting lethal
We on the cola from the soldier, but this all legal
For the block, I'll be screaming villain non-stop
5-6 on a mission, take it to the top

Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block

Ay, red drawers, red socks, red everything
Look what they've done to me crazier than I've ever been
Like I needed medicine, I don't think it's eratapheme
That is seen, second lettering
This ho-head plus wanted me to rep the block
Sadly, I missed the block
Badly, and the ones that came before me Dr. Bop and Rock
Daddy, plus being surrounded by real niggas was my big thrill
'Cause I was walkin' by stand-up niggas from 5-6 Ville
They helped me get my cheese up, love my K-I-D's much
Thats why I would never freeze up when its time to throw B's up
We need a Jesus to relieve us when millies bust
Now we're over seas plus with euros and visas
58th, 57th, 56th, 55th
That's my area and I rep it with the quick
How many homies it be grips and they on the sippy trip
Down for the block and it's the same shade
As the homie Mitchy Slick, nigga

The Virus,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hits ya harder than Thorazine
Shock with a bit of that knockin'  Caca bean
Tech gonna eat you minions 
with some motherfucking fava beans
Running them away like Tyrus
Straight gang nigga like Cyrus
No shiners in my iris
Got me a generation hemmed up with the virus
Infectious while even rolling in your Lexus
G, clear the hexes
Creeps me from here to Texas
Let's get deep
Into the pavement, I be the topic
Ultra-microscopic infected agent
No vaccination, Rapidol
Make that information attachable
Leaving spreading throughout the nation's capitol
Ya spouse may house gate, style they, 
an about-face
Can't save you from this motherfucking outbreak, the virus
Infects K-I-Ds, rounds twos and threes
All the way up to OG's with Alzheimer disease
See Dolores tried immigation
But we don’t need no medication for the sensation
Just the marijuana lacin'
Let the music take your mind, press rewind
The venom is in 'em that Tecca N9ne combined
Let my virus up in you, I love fiends
So open up your pores for daddy
And let me swim through your blood stream

We don’t need no medication
You can buy this virus, come and try this
Killa style y'all, hits ya like some motherfucking Midol
We don’t need your drugs at all
Send it to you-ous, stronger than boo-oos
Pick and choo-oose, whatever mo-oves you
Junkie ew ew, what ya gonna do-o-o?

Nigga you puffin' marijuana, me puffin' marijuana
I'm peeping the futuristic ballistic brain bumma
Hella contagious, you've been fair warned
I got a gang of radio stations making me airborne
No bulimia, leukemia nor sickle-cell anemia
My virus may cause encephalitis
But it may cause panties scream-ia
Make 'em wanna give up the vagin-ia
Tecca Nin-ia plus ya blood stream-ia equals no to me
Needy greedy, but a large amount of you are legimia
I'm spreading shit that'll get you exile
Protect our styles 
up in the Generation X Files,
 let's prowl
Through hoes drawers, I told y'all
I'm making rouge dogs, sha-boo-ya-sha-boo-ya
Roll call, bizarre flows, B-R-Os bar codes
Sick individuals that God see and Lord knows
They stay by me 'cause my virus ain't a fake I.D
Snake I be with venom ain't no curing like HIV

We don’t need no medication
You can buy this virus, come and try this
Killa style y'all, hits ya like some motherfucking Midol
We don’t need your drugs at all
Send it to you-ous, stronger than boo-oos
Pick and choo-oose, whatever mo-oves you
Junkie ew ew, what ya gonna do-o-o?

Futuristic Battlestar Galactica, rummage in this
Suffer Lucifer for the busters who fucking with this
Who said I'll awaken the dead
Told me that I would spread like a plague
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
Infecting you in 2K
The year God conquered the virus but to they
Injected fuck up in ya no matter what who say
Spreading hella fast kickin' ass like juve
Let's party nigga
Ladies lift your dress
This new world rapper got you flashin'
Showin' my bar code on your breast
Science'll keep it going when I'm gone
Cheap in '97 but in '90 Nina Tecca N9ne clones
Hopefully Obi-Wan Kenobi will help me spread it
Out your sockets into your fiber optics
Mr president look around
I got a sea of anarchists to shut this motherfucker down
The virus

We don’t need no medication
You can buy this virus, come and try this
Killa style y'all, hits ya like some motherfucking Midol
We don’t need your drugs at all

So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be nigga?
So what's it gonna be?

Clueless,The Calm Before the Storm: Part 1,1999.0,"Clueless (Ohhhhhh, Clueless)
Mindless
Clueless (We're gonna leave you mindless)
Mindless (Divine bringin' on down)

Supreme, all about my cream, can you dig the ish?
Finna be hella rich made a switch to kill the snitch
Turned out to be a nothing but a hater
I pull the trigger, it bites the liver
To the MO; dead on arrival
Homocidal when we ride taking ya title
It ain't nothing but a thing, cause everybody gotta die
Everybody gotta lie, hit the scene
I'm all about the green and the cash
Give it up fast: the no-no, player watch for the po-po
Bring a 'cain diller as I bring the pain killer
On the low low creepin' affiliated
See a chick demonstrate it, make 'em frustrated
Complicated with a buzz, burst until  must kickin' up dust
Crushin' competition, I'm on a mission
Mitch wanna be dissin' at the same time
Ass kissin', hopin' they wishin' that I
Play out, fade out never heard of me, but occurred to be
Greatest, Mitch hate this
 nothin' but a word to me
Really worth to me, gotta rock it up, gotta stuck it up
Upon game Mitch you gotta mop it up, soakin'
No jokin', can't breathe
No more messin' 'round start chokin'
Everybody that I meet (what you doin'?) dealin'
Everybody peep it: the lyrical context to get hexed by voodoo
No tellin' what's next you're clueless

Now what you gonna do? Your time has run out
When the Divine and Nina come for you. Are you dreaming?
Or are you still awake, your time has run out, player
Now where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide?
Death around the corner and it shows tonight
(Cause you were trippin' you got caught slippin'
And now you clueless about your situation
Lights out, we know it's hesitation)

I'm about to hit 'em with a mirror, killer
Gotta get a little bit more of that skriller
What the hell a hater gonna do
When they come face to face with a 9 milla
(Backed up off of ya, none out but you hopped off I crush ya)
See me when I'm comin' with a (Ch-ch-ch)
Better hope you'll never hear the (Hah-ah-ah)
Bust every day, many day, any day
I spray it at hater that claim he's on
Make that hater say hee-hah Dameon
Devil child, devil's son, by the rule of the God with the rebel's gun
And if that trick no like it, suck me huevos hun, hum
Is that killer with the flow not so-so
Never with a Willie Bobo, hot like cocoa beautiful just like Acapulco, poke your ho, oh
She's wet, she's aqua, clueless trick, never had to jock her
All over my sack and nobody, niggaro not even you can stop her
La Cosa Nostra, me fly boast up, ride that track like a roller coaster
Come a little closer, see a motherkcuf like Tech Nina toast you
N9ne Tech come with Divine, just remain mindless
When I flex you, you get next to the real killer
But a Bade Mitch motherkcuf just stay at school

Now what you gonna do? Your time has run out
When the Divine and Nina come for you. Are you dreaming?
Or are you still awake, your time has run out, player
Now where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide?
Death around the corner and it shows tonight
(Cause you were trippin' you got caught slippin'
And now you clueless about your situation
Lights out, we know it's hesitation)

It's all a mystery, check out the history
Follow the trickery, hollow tips are loaded from the Tech N9ne
Known to bust caps everytime, won't you rewind it? (yrlived)
Got 'em blinded, simple minded
Gotta get up behind, stop gettin' wild somethin' like pal!
I make 'em all really wonder how, can we kill em?
Have we deal them?
36 grams up in 'em, like snakes deliver up dangerous
Mess around gotta hit 'em, Tech Nina and
Divine rollin' up can't stop the bum rush
While play haters come to us, victorious, so glorious
Mitch Bade is dumb to us, Notorious
Like Biggie, is she really from Kansas City, Missouri?
Mitch you better be hear me, better be fear me, nothin' but an enemy
On my way to make many G's in the industry, that's how it gotta be
Everybody be useless another murder committed, clueless

You ever dance with a devil in a pale moonlight
I usually ask of all my prey
I'm gonna be level when I'm on a mic
You fool I'm a live round when I spray
 I mean  make a lot of money  sentimental
Never did I make Biancas whine  N9ne
Get spunked, not even I keep kickin' a bud
Never give up the Bianca when they wakin' up in 
Clueless, who less, me and you foolish
This when a nigga do best
But if you bite your thumb at me
Tecca Nina gotta make a punk of you
Much more strand than an attitude
Bigger than the Capulet and the Montegue
Who really wanna get involved?
When I bust like sailor 
Will you do me a favor, get lost?
Or get your head torn off by the flip boss
Killa clown, look around, hella off the hook
And I stays in the killa zone now, milla dawn
Niggas be clueless and more so than Alicia Silverstone

Now what you gonna do? Your time has run out
When the Divine and Nina come for you. Are you dreaming?
Or are you still awake, your time has run out, player
Now where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide?
Death around the corner and it shows tonight

And now you clueless about your situation
Lights out, we know it's hesitation)

We're gonna leave you clueless, clueless
And all you peeps and hustlers wonder why and how do they we do it, do it
Coming with finesse, you're messin' with the best
nothing but music bumped and straight 
Don't try to find it, or even bite it
Just brought the music to your head and get excited
Cause we comin' real smooth, so what you wanna do
Wanna be down with me and my crew?",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-clueless-lyrics

Stomache bubbling a lil bit, chickens a lil curry
The club fin to close so sippen this in a hurry
And plus I'm temporarily fixing to getting married
The party's in the parking lot, looming the mac world
Sobered up and noticed I was stroken on a fat girl!
Ohh ohh no no Santa Clause please say it ain't so!
But I'm still in to kick it though, cup empty get some more
Say I shouldn't drink and drive, I party at the liquor store!


Dun Dealer, Tech N9ne, Ron Ron, got these chicks waving they hands in the air like they pom-poms
Pop the military mind it but I'm calm niggers ask for a little bit of war but I'm nam
Hit the club for an hour then I'm gone to the after party twenty missed calls from von-von
I'm on some shit way over your head, swear to don if I get pissed I'm probally goin faaade

Three niggas on this track, Tech N9ne, nigga
Lebowski, nigga, from Tacoma, Washington
And the motherfuckin' Weapon from Kansas City, Missouri, nigga
Young niggas representin' for Strange Music
All day, all night, you pussy-ass niggas

Anytime or anywhere (I'ma beat you up, I'ma beat you up, I'ma beat you up)
When it's drama in the air (I'ma beat you up)
You don't fuck with me, I don't care (I'ma beat you up)
Anytime or anywhere (I'ma beat you up, I'ma beat you up, I'ma beat you up)

This is anger
This is to anybody who say somethin' derogatory about a Stranger
Meanin' Strange Music, or connected
It's best that you just exit when your neck gets requested to get slit
Niggas be hidin' behind their MySpace
Irate, but get all buddy-buddy in my face
I hate, envious motherfuckers better migrate
Off into somethin' other than my state
If you was better than us, gettin' more cheddar than us
You would be measurin' up, you niggas ain't clever enough
All of you bitchin' because you wishin' you was in our position
Fuck you niggas, anybody, bro, we make the decision

From cyberthug-niggas yappin', shit ain't happened yet
'Cause you fags in check, what do we need to be cashin' next?
That'll be your soul, motherfucka, 'cause yo' ass in debt

This is hatred, and it goes to the next
Person who say Strange Music ain't a team full of patriots
Now watch how Strange do it, huffin' and puffin' and
Get you stuffed in the back of the trunk when I'm off the strange fluid
This goes to those who tip-toe and walk with a twitched nose
(Keep spittin' your bitch flows)
You mad 'cause our shit goes, we comin', you switch rows
Either stay up out of my hair or beware when my fist close
When my strength is endorsed, the force is enforced
And of course you'll be squirtin' the sauce, a burst in your torso
Therefo', I don't think you want it with us
Fuckin' around with my circle means you wanna get touched
'Cause I been goin' through stuff and enough is enough
The intensity of my rage keeps on risin' up
On the mic or on the stage, I'ma eat you up
When caught standin' in my soil, I'ma beat you up

When it's drama in the air (I'ma beat you up)
You don't fuck with me, I don't care (I'ma beat you up)

Get socked through your mouth just for wavin' your hands, bro
Thirty niggas deep, we a squad full of g's
The shit-starter, shit get funky, you can call me Febreze
Yeah, Weapon, motherfucka, I can bond with Strange Music
Nigga, I'm a veteran, put drink in a Strange fluid
Silly little nigga with a criminal mind state
I smuggle in some chops, it's used to raise the crime rate
When shit kick off, you run fast like a cheetah
Choke him out with my wallet chain 'til he havin' a seizure
Yeah, Grey Goose bottle, plus that bitch on yo' forehead
Your bitch with you? Mine too, let's battle 
My homies is mo' dead, I stumped their mouth too
Shake a nigga comfortable, wrappin' they hot shoe
Jeweled up, flamed up, like the boy Messy
Leave your face smashed in like a bottle of Pepsi

My situation got me shakin' back at it since they snatched Yella
So it's time to resurrect a sleepin' giant, you dig?
All you pussy niggas in the game know what this is
This the takeover, big fella come to state his claim
Spark them heaters, spreadin' pack, y'all remember, man
Real spit from a ville nigga with real hits
Real shit, man, I'm as real as real gets
From knuckle bustin', nigga, to let loose of the whole clip
Ain't no slackin', get it crackin', man, that's off the flip
And I got thunders on my word, man, they bring the harm
That's my youngins, I feed birds, man, they love the storm
Gutter fury, I'm Missouri like a fuckin' swarm
Killer City, hella pretty, pussies, you've been warned
And ain't no stoppin' this machine once you've turned it on
I'm tryin' to told you how I mean it through this fuckin' song

Relish,The Calm Before the Storm: Part 1,1999.0,"Some call it money, some call it mail
Some call it skrill, we call it relish!
Gotta make that cream, that green
Ain't got time for all that other bullshit
You know, gotta let that shit work
Know what I'm sayin', cop that Amerikilla CD
Yes, and do it like this

You call it money, we call it relish cause the group is attractive
Quality keep calling me and plus it keep the biancas hyperactive
Superstar in your city pluggin' ze diddies
Even  on top of that you writin' Lexus music
We hit Paseo but ay no we don't fuck with yayo
And they know the brutality will turn they shirt the color of Prego
You can be mo', if you got a big  green-o
Make some relish at the flamingo casino
Follow me no
My chips is steady stackin' got the pimp all sweat and
I’m turning flips like I was Mary Lou Retton. Rollin' sevens
Biancas love it when you winnin' break up and little relish
To get the telly so y'all can get to sinnin'
I know you seen 'em come, seen 'em go
But you never ever seen a brotha like Nina get the dough
All delicious they see my pocket is vicious
The relish be grantin' they wishes whether nice or malicious
I'mma kick it, get that green flavor at her, get fatter
Abracadabra, make it happen to yourself cause it matters
Don't let nobody tell it, get ya product then you sell it
Whatever you got to do just keep your mind on your relish, nigga

They know we got relish  with the enchanced trunk
Ey, yo, come here and let me take you for yo' dance, bianc
We even took a gang of relish down the street to Bazookas
But the thang with Bazookas they filled with whitey galoopas
Ain't got no problem with that, but I prefer my asses fat
If I can't have that, I rather watch my cash stack
You said that bitch has been jeffin' with who? (That owl, nigga)
I bet my bitch won't even come with you (Bladaow, nigga)
You don't understand I'm a relish man
I got your woman hooked and now she's eatin' out the palm of my hand

Inside,MORE FEAR,2020.0,"It's so beautiful in here
Outside now is a no-go
Why though?
Dark in the days so the gray gon' show
Okay?
Everyone seems contagious
Death toll stays outrageous
So in my brain every day is Las Vegas

Inside I-
I'm running and swimming and laughing and flying
I got sunshine and cherry wine
Floating in the ocean of my mind
Every time, yes
Floating in the ocean of my mind
I found myself a pick-me-up
Don't get stuck 'cause this life is fucked up

Health stores closed but not the golden arches
Purchase a gun at Walmart and they see an open Target
If you’re a certain shade
Your working days it’ll be curtains paid for the person’s played jerk and sprayed
See the cursed in graves
It’s really shockin’, how quick we fill these coffins
St. Louis still the top peally spot where we kill we often
Learnin’ that the Bane days they sent the silly cops in
We turn into back to the same page like we milly rockin’ (what?)
Outsiders without pride
Beef with nothing but some stout guys and about die
In my head I never mouth lies, I shout whys
Come outside, it's fam without lies on the southside
Wasn't many we vote for
Cause with grim mean these po-po
I'm Public Enemy's logo
Rubbage been with me so yo
This fucking energy grow though
So I duck within and below low
Really nothing limits me (oh no)

Inside I-
I'm running and swimming and laughing and flying
I got sunshine and cherry wine
Floating in the ocean of my mind

Don't get stuck 'cause this life is fucked up

I am not oblivious though!
Even though I live in my head, the Killer City is so
Over men crazy, cause we can get in the busiest bro
Pity is all I send 'em where the idiots go
My bad, I'm back
In the inside, no sin rides
Nothing but the zen flies
Come out and the ones who wouldn't run and hide
Then die
Evil men tried them bin lies
The devil in stride, your grave o-pen wide and inscribe
Damn
Total chaos, I'm guessing it's strife
And an evil person flexing his rights
They just want Tech and his mic
But if we get in a fight, complexion is right
All he gotta say is that I threatened his life
I'm laughing in my head
But I see the demon staring at Aaron
But it ain't no sparing the chair
When they think I'm glaring at Karen
Another sucker they love to cut ya
And call you an accuser of the brethren
You fucking motherfucker!

Inside I-
I'm running and swimming and laughing and flying
I got sunshine and cherry wine, yes

Before my dick's in your motherfuckin' mouth

Tongue across your gum line

And plus this drink I'm sippin' on, don't got me right!
Now girl, I know this here might sound a little bit eww
But momma don't knock it, 'til you try it
You never know, you just might like it
Plus all this Hennessey, that I've been drankin' makes me feel
Like losin' all in ambitions
Never been with kissin' bitches, I don't know but tonight I
Will make a bit of an exception
I'm a bit intoxicated with the biggest of erections
Plus you grindin' on a nigga, got me feelin' like we sexin'
Frame can make a nigga sin
But gotta face that's straight from heaven
Look good, smell good, plus you got pretty feet

Pulling you pussies apart, my competitor's plain

Some might call me uh paranoid
But I think I would just say that I was very aware of my surroundings!""

Retrogression
Let's go back to an earlier state
Back when a bunch of cats was jumped into this world via hate
Gangbang shit, yeah I'm guilty of it
When I'm looking at the TV, man seem like everybody really love it
Wave they flags high, for the world to see
Even though we know we don't want our son and little girls to be
Nothing like we were, some of these youngsters got no thumpers
Bet they want no funk, but they could get shook up like a seizure
If bangin' retrogresses, now the color's no longer measures
Stresses of rival sets get wet, go get the Tec, and press it
To make sure they get the message, a lot of these motherfuckers
Reppin sets know they faking just like they know the phrase ""Don't F with Texas""
But still oblivious and fancy free
But real life is mo' serious than a damn TV

Like '85 they might be gunnin'
While you living like the Drummonds
Or you sippin' wit' your woman
I can feel the trippin' comin'
When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'
Hey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
When I'm down for the town
In the club beefing with the woman
Hey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'

They was family, used to love you
Swear to God that they would never put nothing above you
It's just to, see your successes, then 'bout plug you
Put slugs to, cause they ain't with you so now it's fuck you
I get so much love, I get to searching
For the evil cuz is coming, I can see right through the curtain
But the haters fill with anger, I can feel it's about to worsen
The bigger that I get, I can feel these tricks is sick for certain
When I'm partying without my body-guardians, I'm hardly and chill mode
Cuz I'm feelin they wanna scar me and fill those
Clips with lead and headed to kill foes
They real hoes plus they fake fuckers like dildos
Envy can equal murder, show love but they preferred to
Hurt her servers, picks alert us, quick with the squirter


Why do I see mayhem?
Cuz when I watch the news I say damn
Everybody living in they last days
Are in hate and waste and
Innocent children, evil it feels the nation
Facin', life sentences are the case man
It's just too good to be true
Or maybe not huh?
Buried in the hood could be you
Cuz you got some
Extra, but next brah, ain't lookin for no kinda lecture
When you sittin on something better, gotta be alert
Or you off in a stretcha
When I'm 'sposed to be here in fun
I'm standing near a gun
Cuz I ain't gotta have no demons
Scheming on me, tryin to tear a lung
I'm just a real one
I keep my eyes open for the bullshit
Never am I clueless
I'm looking every direction
Everywhere it comes

But something so thick will just an occupation will never be
And what she makin' it sounds good like laraby
But she says she specialize in message therapy

Suck dick all day and went kiss on your kids
Now shes kissin' on you
Instead spittin' she true
Tet your lovin' that she ballin' but she twistin' the crew
Pissin' on who? White dudes be frisking your boo
Call girl by the night is what she fixin to do

Bad for brothas like you good for niggas like me

Come place that pretty round brown right in front of me
No disrespect but bend over let me lift the skirt
I'm fittin' to slap some naked ass while i watch it twerk

We watch work watch it pop watch it jerk
Leave a couple thousand on the table you can watch it first
Lil niggas have your fun the skatterman is goin to flirt
Strange lane in the building all the bitches goin' berserk
All day shes a service rep at nextel
But when she get home to you she got that sex smell

If you don't got my paper that chopper split you in 3 ways
My money runnin, it should be in some relays
No candles on my cake but everyday be my b-day
Comin' out that gutta, bitch I'm 'bout my dollas

Who gives a fuck what you think, broke niggas envy hard
Gats in my drawers, guns in the car
Knock a nigga off

So try this ... yeah ... yeah ... you like that?

I saw you back where we began
Then you took me for a spin
And captivated, brought me in and now
See I still watch you from a distance
Lost in you, lose all resistance
Poisonous the way you took me out
Cause yoooooooooooooou ... got the best ... of me
Cause yoooooooooooooou ... got the best ... of me

N9na! I'm like a walking drug
I can make your lady pop X, want sex from a nigga like me
I can feel her nightly, even make her fall off in love
Get away lost off in hugs, stalking blood for an awesome plug
This is addictive, vicious and wicked slick talking stud
I take good gals, recruit 'em, pollute 'em
Put X in they wood valve, to shoot 'em, they chewed 'em up
And true enough, they would be popping, dropping, pursuing us
Plus screwing the crew and such, a ruined slut living through a nut
That was then but now I see 'em, they be on the same shit
Brainless, itching to get that quick trip, wanna be painless
I don't fuck wit it no more, but I can arrange it
I was like Dracula attacking her, when I give her game, hella vain language
It was they choice to trip, I kept her moist and slick
Now she's an annoying chick, I started avoiding Miss
Give her them toys and split
I polluted so many women with bad habits and drugs, I guess I'm poisonous

I saw you back where we began
Then you took me for a spin
And captivated, brought me in and now

This Life (Anghellic),Anghellic,2001.0,"I started out with
No dough, no clothes, no shows, and no hoes
And ended up with
Mo' hoes, mo' shows, mo' clothes, and mo' dough

I used to be the ideal nigga
Preppy like Hilfiger, pretty 'vill nigga
But wanted to make my dollar bill bigger
Turned into a field nigga, not pickin' cotton
But pickin' mics up and rockin', recoppin' so I can feel richer
Then I started drinkin' real liquor
Send me a groupie, and I will stick her real quick
The dilsnick it will hit her ex pills, I can feel, nigga, best deals
You can get the steal if you ill I'm concealed with a
Technina millameter by my side
God used to guide me
Lucifer beside me, evil was lively
Trippin' with wifey, never was treatin' her nicely
What this music got me into?
This is the message I'mma send to, God
The evil shit I've been through
Lettin' me really know what sin do
Listen, cause the hurt cut me deep like a Ginsu

(This life) Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever burn in the flame
(This life) I live in the rain
I'm an angel, but the devil's possessing my brain

This life, full of money, bitches, weed, and riches
Kansas City niggas grind, cook it up in the kitchen
Pay attention to the corner nigga, roguish and rugged
Nigga, fuck it, it's a must I conceal it and tuck it
This life, can make a nigga murder for nothin'
This life, for the money have you fakin' and frontin'
This life, can make a nigga take a deal with the devil
This life, got me rippin' up shit in my kennel
Ya see, I live in the rain, and laugh at the storm
I mastered the pawn, bringin' war at the crack of the dawn
Tottin' the bomb
A nigga with a third eye vision, like a Malachi
Blowin' smoke in the sky
See the world through the eyes of a real nigga
Look into my eyes, you can tell I'm a rider

More shows, more clothes
More hoes, more dough
And no foes yo

(This life) Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever burn in the flame
(This life) I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's possessing my brain

Sometimes I wonder:
How did I survive with all this drama in front of me
Poppa went out like a bitch for runnin' from me
Though momma never lied, she cried
Seen me sittin' in prison, servin' a sentence with bad intentions
Still no repentance
I'm heart broken while chokin' on a joint dipped in water
And high hopin' the future's wide open for my daughter
My eyes are open to all animosity
Constantly falling quickly
The devil calls it a blessing to cross Nitty
Lessons are taught quickly
Hell, my pride will die with me
Then to repeat back to the penitentiary, visit me
Hell bound, coffin dwellin' before a life in the cell yelllin'
Now free me I'm in desperate need immediately
Truthfully speakin'
My life from night to day
24 hours I fight, despite this hell, to pay
Can't wait to see the day when my adventures begin
With this here life of sin, I'm all in

(This life) Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever burn in the flame
(This life) I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's possessing my brain

Is it heaven or hell? I really can't tell it
Half cupid half relic, my life is anghellic
So I dance with the devils, and I fly with the angel
And I stand on a level where mind is so tangled

While you on your Caribbean cruise
I'm payin' my dues
On the corner tryin' to hit licks for slips
Trouble making them flips
So I'm 'bout to smoke a dipped
Now I'm ripped
How could you make a hypothesis on me and my partnas?
With your college degree trying to psycho-analyze me
You can't see what I see, you can't be what I be
When I'm deep in this pit of violence without parental guidance, nigga
Spot, translation cops watching me every day when I'm
Just holding down my block, fuck a ad-hoc
My brother, My fathers' in jail, momma fell
So I'm 'bout to make a sell, what the hell?
Gotta get that rel and then I bail
I smell like Sherman, you can tell
The chemicaly it got me wanted to use my genitalia
Up on this bitch, that bitch
The kind that don't want to bust a gang
Ain't got no love, so I'ma Just hit it and hope she
Don't give me what his name

So momma tell me how am I to reconcile again
Tell you walk these

Of any size, so maybe Macallan 25?

See thy king get lost in your lips and your high beams

Me, I never paid no woman to make me bust
Me, I never needed no other chick to clutch
'Cause N9na was knowing holy matrimony it's a must
Never ever paid and came with lust
My aims for trust
Because my woman's pain is enough
Don't want my marriage ending strange and abrupt
But just here recently my brains corrupt
One night my niggas took me to the strip club Bazooka's
Everybody knows that's not the type of shit I'm used to
It's a juicer, so that means there was no clothes
Got my eyes open wide like I'm on no dose
Look at these bozos, givin' double 0's for ho shows
I was cool
I was drinking my juice I was never really in the mood
Until I was approached by a beautiful angel in the nude
But I flipped my top
When she sat that butter skin on my lap I was shocked
Lips locked feeling like my heart stopped
She was hot!
She was Carmen Electra in the chest
Aaliyah by the waist
Jennifer Lopez in the ass
But she was an angel in the face
She asked me if I wanted to dance on the couch
With the look of a zombie I reached into my pouch
And shelled it out
Then she took me by the hand and lead me to the land
Where a man could forget about all his problems at hand
The scent of a woman, she wearing Chanel
Hypnotized by the smell, a glimpse of hell
And bodily melt down is what I felt now
I came with 500 tryin' to keep it all but she want it
At the ATM to get 4 more that's the limit the UMB Bank let go
Heavenly can't describe this woman beyond that
Our pelvic area steady bumping and grinding in combat
No penetration, no touchin' it's funny
How she didn't kiss me and didn't fuck me
But still got away with all of my money
S.H.E

Took everything that I had
Fiending for the sex hella bad!
Took everything that I had
Fiending for the sex hella bad!

The next day my wife's checking the account
She said your only bringing four thousand a month
So last night you spent damn near one thousand on what?
A new piece of equipment for the studio
She'll never really ever truly know
That I spent it all on a nudie show
I close myself in the bathroom
Lean over the stool and grabbed my middle section tight
Thinking about the way she made me feel that night
I had a lot of fun
Then I got one, then I got one
I want back that life, in the next life, but did I come
Wife pissed because I depleted our funds
She left me and moved back with her mom
I'm borrowing money from all my homies
I knew it was wrong
But this bitch was the bomb
I'm paying the bills at Bazooka's
I slip my finger through her g-string, it was tight
She told the bouncers, now I'm in a fist fight
You put me out I thought you loved me
You said that you liked it rough like me
All these motherfuckers and your man
Can't love you enough like me
I lost my life for you, my wife for you
I miss you so I'm sitting outside the club every night for you
Got spite for you

People are nosey and want to
Know about my life so check this out; this is called ""My Own Hell""
Produced by Don Juan

Nigga, my life is straight conflict
When all I want to do is kick it hard and make bomb shit
Every perimeter I enter is infested with a sinner
Seems like I'm losing and never coming out the winner
Shit, I'm the only one kicking it, everyone else plotting and scheming
But yet they never listen when I say I'm a little piece of love and a pit full of demons

Midwestside was record company comprised of all friends
Who grew up together and shared ends
Nobody stepped on nobody's toes
Diamond was executive producer, Juan had beats I had flows
Scooby and Txx Will did promotion
Got it where Mitch Bade was the shit and got Kansas City open
Juan got that shit to Quincy Jones through a chick named Mona
Three days later Q called us back and it was on
Q told us to wait on putting the record out indy
The record company will make it to where we'll have plenty
So we waited, should we put this out? We debated
But working with Quincy we were elated
So now we on the road to L.A. and it was live
'Til we got to Quincy's and Diamond told Scooby and them to sit outside
That's when the tension started to build
Niggas started feeling unappreciated and then shit got real!
'97 Quincy called back for me and Juan
I told my Rogue Dog niggas just to remain calm
I'm bout to make it so we can bling, get us nice things
And then Don Juan said, ""let's mash for our dreams nigga""
Scooby didn't like the way he spent his money on promos
T-shirts and money to pay Brain for logos
He thought he wasn't appreciated, Midwestside depreciated
Gone for the summer and everybody waited
Bakarii didn't like the fact he was down with Mitch Bade
He felt that he should be the next nigga to get paid
Txx Will got tired of being lectured
On distribution so the anted up and started Hogstyle Records
My niggas wanted me to ride
Hell yeah I'm down, Tecca Nina's on both sides
Hogstyle's like ""Fuck 'em, 'cause they didn't believe in 57
Midwestside's the same, but the love, I'm trynna find my way to heaven

Yo... This is my own hell nigga, this is my own hell
Just tryna make my records sell
Off in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell

We went to Cali to hook with QD3
They wanted the superstar to be me
Kicked it with big Q off in the wild wild west signed me to Qwest
Didn't know I was in for some more Perspective mess
Qwest fighting Midwestside over a single
All the way from the love angel to Kris Kringle
CEO of Midwestside fighting QD over my budget
QD fighting Qwest 'cause he never loved it
Warner Bros. fighting back and forth with my artists
'Cause the bitch who's handling money's retarded
Qwest don't like Midwestside, QD3 don't like Qwest
And I'm sitting in the middle depressed
Warner Bros send me four Gs a month
I'm kickin' it at parties, liquor, weed, and cunts
When everybody's fussing and fighting
I'm suffering peacefully like Novocaine
That's because I didn't know the game
Midwestside, Juan, and QD3
Q-W-E-S-T fighting all over me
Sway and Tech tripping with Q over a check he didn't pay
But I suffer (Man I suffer)
Yeah, I suffer at the end of the day

Yo... This is my own hell nigga, this is my own hell
Just trynna make my records sell
Off in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell

Female friends started not to like my woman
When they found out my marriage was comin'
My wife didn't like my friends from the get go
She say them bitches ain't nothing but fucking famous rapper niggas for the grip hoes
Wifey don't like me hanging out with E and Beans
'Cause when we be seeing E and Beans wifey be seeing things
Beans don't like Sheryl 'cause Sheryl fine as hell
And Beans thinks Sheryl will take the dick to show and tell
Sheryl don't like Beans 'cause Beans rude
She wish Beans would go back to Chicago with her dude
Sayin' he don't like Dr. Wick
But Dr. Wick don't give a shit, Zany got Nicky waiting for the hit
Wifey study entire 'cause something seems fishy
'Cause all my relations iffy iffy
Wifey thinks Big Sonya would try to fuck
Big Sonya knew if she try wifey was down to buck
Now all these niggas in my rhyme are my people
No one can save them not even a steeple could make 'em equal
You're all my sisters, my brothers
But I'm tired of mediating, I'ma sit and watch y'all kill each motherfucking other

Yo... This is my own hell nigga this is my own hell
Just trynna make my records sell
Off in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell
This is my own hell nigga this is my own hell
Just trynna make my records sell
Off in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-my-own-hell-lyrics

Keep It One Hunit,The Gates Mixed Plate,2010.0,"If you at the rink, put ya skates on
Roll with the Nina celebrate and that the day gone
Just because the DJ ain't diggin and pumpin they song
Mediocre rappers pick Tecca Nina to hate on
And they do it all night and day long
But when they see me that frowned up hatin face gone
Ain't no rah uh reason ya fronted ya should've just kept it one hunit Learn how to make ya face stay stone

Why you comin at me like that, is it cause I came up you mad
Cause ya see me with all this cash (Keep it one hunit)
Homie it ain't no changin me
Yeah I'm still the same OG and on my momma I'm always be
(Keep it one hunit)

One hunit that's the reason big dog was called
Representer of the five block
Villian nigga dog
Well respected in the crime 'Dotte
Way back to Paul's
That's my liquor store
My hood
Where I swing my balls
For you young niggas that ain't know that really don't know the name
Check my history eventually you'll get told the same
Nigga big dogs a damn fool a fixture in the game
And I play it by my own rules damned if I'mma change
I was raised in this gang bang
Lived through this gang bang
Homies that done died so I got pride in this gang thang
Fuck nigga bring it
If it's beef then I'mma eat it
I'mma beast and I'm conceded I have yet to be defeated naw
I'm indefeated that's a hard days work
Boy don't make me pull your skirt and show your pussy on the turf nigga!
I'm vill walkin' shit talkin' on this fucking track
Show me's finest
Show your highness how you love that


Im a playa, ma'fuck haters, and this a thin line (shit) but thas what separates us
If they smart, they are the segregaters, 
team of Kansas city chiefs, wit a ma'fuckin Raider
Thats a problem in the makin', a problem in the matrix, people thats unplugged (man) would probably be the safest. So understand I hope this hood shit sacred, hand on the bible I shoot it out to Satan, if he ever did say shit, I really would be finer, ya you heard me nigga, anytime cuz, still serving nickels, step ya grind up, I knew the game was dirty b'fore I signed up, ya this rap shit is circus full of clowns and, otha weirdos acting silly for the croud, then they think we all the same till my pistols get to plowin, so a hunit ain't enough, gotta keep it one thousand


It sounds like they wanna claim KC king
They can't advance in this game cause they weakling
When in the trap making peanuts that can't see things
Like me at marina grog and galey mane feasting
Party of 70 at the (fogo da'chao)
You niggas small time, me and travis moguling now
Holding us down almost everybody know of the sound of
Tecca nina despite the hate you be throwing around
From now on they will not talk nay talk
And they family won't have to walk cross grave moss
I'm the king it because I mob boss pay cost
I pro ball on em they Rock Chalk Jayhawk
So bow down cause the king gets hyphy
If you slight me ain't no stopping the nina the almighty
Don't you see the snake and bat shining brightly
Keep it one hunit if you rappers don't really like me, fight me!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-keep-it-one-hunit-lyrics

They say your kitty cat
Is one hell of a dog catcher
Can I take to my kennel and make it all better?
Can I get you in the parking lot, I mean?
Can I get you out the parking lot
Then we can bend the corner and find a darker spot
Baby can I let the seat back, so I can bark a lot?
Yeah, you can
I see why you at the silver slipper
Cause that ass fat, baby, pass that
Let me smash that, want me jizzum
But I holds 'em back, them courtesy of my player partner
Trojan Magnum, think you pimping your broads
You'll be hold like tagnum first night like I'm mad
I don't know these hoes from Adam
Deep as I'm deep down diamond Joes, I jabbed 'em
Can I come back again and repeat this with you madam?

Can I tell you a secret before you get to answer?
Shadow done already peeped it
It's the freak with reason, the ladies wet in they bed
And she'll probably get orgasmic just from giving me head
Can I bring a couple of my closest friends, get a telly
Play some music prolly, throw you some mens?
Oh, you wanna keep me all to myself
You wanna cum a couple times well mami, can I offer some help?
Can I see the way your body look from the back
She shook form the fact that my tongue motions did it like that
Had her walking like she had a camel hump on her back
And since they say we only mammals I'm the king of the cat
And as long as your ass is fat can I give it a smack
And record the whole thing and play it on track
If you telling me you good with that
I'mma handle some things but is it cool
If I come right back?

Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you that I'll do you good tonight, say

If I tell you that I'll do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Can we get lost mama if I promise
I can do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?

I know you heard of me baby
I'm one they talk about
They call me Kali Baby
Say it while we walking out
And next let's hit the exit, go get naked
Do them things you know will get you pregnant
Or can it be just a fantasy planned to have you panicking
It's your pantin' that's bringing out the man in me
And I'll be gentle at first
And then frantically I'ma damaged the back-a-you
Attacking where your pants be
And I just want to love you now
Can you tell me how I get you home tonight?
Baby let me turn you 'round, look you up and down
Let me see every part I like
And maybe it's the drink making you look better
Or maybe it's my voice making you get wetter
If you like me like I like you girl
Don't hesitate, don't make me wait, tell me

Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you I can do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?

Cotton Soldier,The Calm Before the Storm: Part 1,1999.0,"They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
Let you know when you funkin' they gon' hide from the ride
A cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
You looked on my side, he stood right beside
But who's the first wabbacotton to slide when he die
The cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)

I re-member this fool I used to work with
Somebody I used to trust and even sold work with
Spectacular how people love this black vernacular
But back in your talkin' he's the one who takes the first lit
Unbeatable, seem like was nothing that could stop this fool
Seem like nobody up in the hood could ever drop this fool
I can hear ""I'll beat a nigga, I shoot a nigga, I kill a nigga, I'll do a nigga""
But ain't nobody ever seen this nigga roll up no magazine
'Till one day, on a Sunday, in a Hyundai
Some niggas in the park at back of the ride I stepped outside I was gon' play
I said ""wattup"" they said ""wattup"" looked at my boy said ""wattup""
The toughest nigga in the universe ain't givin' a fuck
I'm stuck in between, heaven and hell and hells seems to lean
My way no heaven's highway this ain't my day-ay-ey!
Punk-ass nigga won't jump at me punk out
Just me and my opponent start to burnin' like ? I'm on it
But check out the way it turned out
Them niggas rushed me and my softie partner burned out
I got my ass beat, in the middle of the street
I was still alive and I told ya 'bout this soft-ass cotton soldier

They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
Let you know when you funkin' they gon' hide from the ride
A cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
You looked on my side, he stood right beside
But who's the first wabbacotton to slide when he die
The cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)

You wanna know, who's made of cotton?
It's that busta with that rich? and yo illegal plottin'
Sittin' at home then thinkin' wondering how much time you facin'
Nigga done told the whole shabang up in interrogation
No escapin' unprotected I'm servin' cause this rat bastard mastered
The art of tellin' from killings to dope sellings
My (?) is stone, aggravation is grown
Cause now I recall when the cops said
Hands on the hood, put down the goods
Keep all the merchandise right here, come on!
Heard the snitch is up in Camerun stammerin'
Cause niggas know a snitch, will end up dead or become somebody's bitch
Think of how it's, funny seein' him singin' ballads
(?) next minute he's tossin' the motherfucking salad
I was told, cotton swab-ass niggas catch blows
Supposed to be rough and then froze
Said he was down but now I'm downtown awaiting trial in my cell
I can't wait to fold your soft-ass cotton soldier

They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
Let you know when you funkin' they gon' hide from the ride

Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
You looked on my side, he stood right beside
But who's the first wabbacotton to slide when he die
The cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)

Just like a Mitchell Bade, you're such a Mitchell broad
Cotton soldiers be from here to Cape Cod your whole facade's
Unbelievable, I'm illegal so, hand me the gat
'Cause this cotton soldier’s making actions like Sammy the rat
If I'm in despair, I expect you to have my back
And kick some ass like a motherfucking democrat
But you procrastinated, now you become belated
(?) Ghandi's hated, I'm gun associated
I stated, the cotton soldiers get the '86 cause ladies shittin'
And shady clicks in '96 will get them niggas highly kicked
In '97 we wettin', cotton swabs
If you had to be rough to work a shift nigga I'd be stoppin' jobs
I spits the real nigglets and I leave your stom like bumblebees
Some of these, like wet niggas go away like tumbleweeds
Go away like humble Gs, don't be tryin' to moulder

Take a trip everyday
Livin' life all paid build an Empire State
I'm doin' it (doin' it)
I'm doin' it (doin' it)
I'm doin' it (doin' it)
Buy low, sell high!

Euro, pounds, crowns, get dough
Red Light District, hoes in the window
At the Green House blowin' on the indo
Then it's to the room and the cab is the Benzo
Yo, then I'm on to the next
Jigga Man style blowin' zones on a jet
High above 20 inch chrome on a (?)
Got hoes on deck, got a home on my neck
Yup, wrist flooded in cruise ship
Two chicks, I'd have pop it like Whoo Kid
Shut 'em all down, no brand new shit
Louie to the Gucci bitch I do's this
What? I get brain (?)
The Last Train to Paris
Like Diddy for them benjies
Black stones and a chain, black Bentley
All black everything flier than a frisbee


Chillest Illest, yaah, yo
I'm doin' it weller than (?)
Globetrottin', I'm hot, I'm a young yacht seller
(?) when I land her
Make it to Japan
(?)
I'm a boss
(?)
Carnival cruisin', exchange currency
All about my paper I'm serious like an emergency
Some of y'all ain't heard of me but I'm about to fix that
(?)
I spits a lot of game you should absorb it
And no I don't pay rent partner I pay mortgage
Checking NASDAQ (?)
And all that you imagine
Oh yeah I'm doing that


Sold out shows N9na make 'em go nuts
They get the dough cut, splittin' hella O's up
Close up to show rush to go to Lust Vegas
The Tower Suites encore doin' for much
Cold days in Missouri can't stand them
So I take the family to Saint Martin just to tan 'em
Kickin' at random beaches then when I land 'em
The bags in the van, wife and kids in the Phantom
Royal Caribbean floating through amphibians
Go to Disney and pig and eat at the Grand Meridian
Wealthy Kansas Citian, pretty women, Henn and lemon or lime
Why she all up in mine? I'm Tech N9ne
And gettin' mo' checks, my life is so jet
I got a Mercedes Benz I ain't drove yet
Order your beast filet straight chewing it
Haters want me to ruin and never stop the N9na cause it's

Full traffic escorts
New market passports
We're closing airports
Do anything!


Okay this means we through doin' it now
This was the mixed plate
Now I'm 'bout to go to Gates and get me a president's tray
Y'all know what I mean, ha-ha-ha
Kansas City baby this album was for you
I don't care what nobody say
I love this place!",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-doin-it-lyrics
The Real Thing,Welcome to Strangeland,2011.0,"Drink, this is unreal, beyond me
The Real Thing cross the path of Suwandi

What is real? You must decide
'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!
This pain is mine, and I’d bleed for you
I cannot lie, 'cause I'd die for you!
Believe me I'd die!
Believe me I'd die!

Hey!
I'm the real thing they can check my stats
All over USA, overseas, and back
I didn't get out of this shit through crack
Education and motivation and just do rap
Built all my fans, one by one
They lovin' the bullets coming from my gun
They do cry for me, digging the alpha me
I'm giving the spirited heart from my tongue
How can you say my life is make believe?
When everybody call me for rent, I paid the G's
I create the ""C"" notes, we dope
So why the hate, 'cause he broke, we growth
When I look around I see jokes
With a whole lot of boss and boast
Maudie taught me to not be flossy
'Cause these copies will doubt me, close

What is real? You must decide
'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!
This pain is mine, and I’d bleed for you
I cannot lie, 'cause I'd die for you!
Believe me I'd die!
Believe me I'd die!

Hey!
They say my shit is glamour and glitz
And all they think I'm doing is hammering chicks
When I'm gone, they'll be slandering this
But when I'm around, you a stammering bitch
Just give it up 'cause our credit is due
Tech lit up and it's better than you
Never in blue,
 better than ruse
Made my money off of summerin' fools
I'm the real thing!
I can rap bitch!
And I don't know nobody that's disputin' that shit
Put on my mask, spittin' fast, get the cash quick
How does it feel to be real?
It's fucking fantastic!

What is real? You must decide
'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!
This pain is mine, and I’d bleed for you
I cannot lie, 'cause I'd die for you!

Payback fo you bustas that laid back
My gats ain't met yo next, so fuck yo vest, we dumpin'
Killin' all that punk shit that you heart be pumpin'
See somethin' I take it cuttin' through the red tape
Yo legs break tryna catch up who who led the race
It's 57, high as heaven, causin' insanity
Whatcha handin' me we'll have you bitch ass postin' the vanity
Pause, gotta recoop fuckin' with these troops
Soon as we see you, load up and we shoot on sight
Turnin' out the lights, my appetite for destruction
Got me in the mood for bustin' dumpin' accross the Mizzou
And get to huntin' for Kevin East the oo-oo
And nigga you knew the Rogue Dogs rule

Made to hit me smashin' on them bastards
Don't be talkin' when they ask you, shit got drastic on that bastard
Left him 'fo the cats that sent them straight to hell
Just like hosts of veil another soldier's tale
Nigga the life of a coward was taken when we bailed

Look I swore to die for bloodline
More heartless than my father brought (nigga)
Load the cartridges with hollow point hard ones
When Rogue Dogs call it's an all out war move
56 marks it 'cause 56 swore to
Heartless insane ghetto hoodlum livin' and never dyin'
Midwest side until my last breath on highland
Why should I lie? I live and die for my side
Ride the city 'til they roll with diddy one last time
Let this nine yell out fuck 'em
Fuck 'em if he's no Rogue he's nothin'
Fuck where he's from he'll even run when I'm dumpin'
Rogue Dog fo life, no fear of death no more

Just call me chakratease awfully cockin' your properties
Dropping the hypothesis make knots and monopoly roll
And it ain't no stoppin' me my stock will be properly watched

Maybe some weed and some Asti Spumante
Boucin' up and down in the bed, like we bungeed
Not Jumanji, everyone I'm tryin' to shock the monkey

Mo dough, mo power, mo motherfucking respect I tell ya
Focus mo on cowards the world don't stand a projected failure
Seek Absolute Power, perfect and conquer the world with it
Use at yo discretion, but knowingly at yo own risk

But use time to gain in my mind frame
I strive for change but I'll die for change when the time came

Gold to the protege his quota be so
But he alacrity rhyme motherfuckers know the design
How you gonna disrespect me when the whole city's mine?
I been grinding like a motherfucker chasing my dream
No longer chasing I'm making my green

Not just some niggas but the hood I grew up with, niggas I grew up Get this (what's that), them niggas is pissed

5-6 the spot homie smoking grass
Pass me the drink watch a nigga get towed down
Tech gave the low down
Now it's time to put the hoes down
I came and questions got the bitch
Guessing 'bout the dick fucked the white too quick
Nothin' but a trick bitch now I'm on another journey
Had no rub', hope the bitch don't burn me
Ten hours away, then I'm on my way to Cali L.A
To make Gs, pretty bitches and palm trees
35 south 40 going west
15 the opposite of north on a quest

Hittin' prospect straight bro
Looking for some Kansas City hoes to poke
But rellish floats my boat
Keep a nigga for live in my pocket I gotta get mine
Keeping suspicious mitch in niggers behind my line
Rewind my rhyme, Nina with many dope styles
Pack my bag now I'm out pal
Kick it with some biancas up in Oklahoma stayin' over for one night
Hit it right then I'm out, no diggity no doubt
Rich man suites, had her face off in the pillow
The next morning dippin' met some biancs in Amarillo
Give me the number bianc so that when we come back through
Play some questions with you two, off in the poo-poo, ooh-ooh
40 west, to Alberquerque on through the

Doing 89 niggas waste no time
Make a pit stop bumpin' old school hip-hop
Midwestside never flip-flop
Niggas get dropped, all about the rellish when we creep
Stopped in Oklahoma City got us a suite
Gave niggas much love, passed much bud
Come here baby get at me show what you made of
12 20 north-west, a little get together
Beautiful ladies, nobody shady
Down-ass homies, nobody phony
Everything was dandy
So wassup to my homegirls Tammy
Tachey and Tez, right too thick
Misery niggas, right too sick
We gotta make that group
We gotta jet, seven forty seven style
Oh shit, eleven hundred mo' miles

L.A. two-way my on
The chronic up in L.A. we stayed high gone
Wake up show flows see hoes on the 405
Already hell alive when I arrive
Midwest style no Cristal just Caribou Lou
Feel like I'm an alien like Mr. Sulu a new crew but who?
Them road dog niggas from Mizzizy
We rollin' on Sunset mobbin' like we on prospect dizzy
What's the real dough, we got that real flow
You other busters coming fake like a dildo
And if you wanna try a nigga from the misery get with me
And me show you what the Tecca Nina kill fo'

Sometimes They Come Back,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Laughter)

Hello again
Its Me
(Welcome Back Baby)
Its me Tech Nina, Tech N9ne
Scriptures
And the enemy said, may he be deceased
May he rest in pain with no peace
Then the Lord said, let there be Tech the resurrected, the resurrector, god reflects

I been through hell
Motherfuckers
Satan sentence me life, in four days I made bail
Motherfuckers
So when you sleeping hit the ruckus
Get to callin' your reverend
Tell 'em I just seen the ghost of Tech N9ne
Less I'm trippin', reverend said
Ya-op I just heard him on the Wake Up Show trippin'
And reverend call Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis
And Terry said Jimmy damn, how do we lose it
The Tech Nina
Jam and Terry blamed
Sharron and kept steppin'
Resurrection of a concealed weapon
Went from Satan to Nathan
And you gotta respect it
In eight seconds here's the story in a nutshell
(Check it)
He was a rapper with a record deal back in nueve two
About to make a mill, but he never could
Make a big amount of paper
Cause he knew it then it wasn't ever real
A break up with the crew, another blow
And Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis had to let him go
Then he had a funeral
And everybody heard
Him back up killing hackers to the finish
And now I'm back with a vengeance
A vendetta
They thought it was a beretta
But never the Tech is severs whatever
Thought I wouldn't prevail, i'd fail
Tell you cronies I'm back in here sending
Motherfuckers to hell

Because
Sometimes
They come back to haunt ya
Taunt ya
Test you don't want ta come to blows Tech n9ne
Hella murder for the bunch of ya's
Sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
They tell you that they will come back
Sometimes, sometimes
(What,What)

I rotted, rested in torment than I got it
Satan didn't want me to see the light but I spotted it
So I got out of it
Wrote raps in a deep dark pit
The more I flip shit with ripped lips
The doper I get
Reincarnation turned me into somethin
Obviously something that you wantin
A nigga to get in somebody's ass when they frontin
They its best to prepare those hoes
I'm the shadow in the field eatin away at the scarecrows
I'm back for blood, I'm back for guts
And if you ain't apart of that love you gots to duck
Blame Ms.Hayward for the way I come
Bullshit I take none
Fuck skin horn management
I roll with Black and Juan Kson
I remember when
Rough house, Tommy Boy, and MJJ said I wasn't right
Now it's a mothafucker here Tecca Nina go bump in the night exorcism
Is out of the question, I'm never gently flown
I went from bum to a nigga breakin bread with Quincy Jones nigga

Because
Sometimes
They come back to haunt ya
Taunt ya
Test you don't want ta come to blows Tech n9ne
Hella murda for the bunch of ya's
Sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
They tell you that they will come back
Sometimes, sometimes
(Check me, check me)

Yo I seen a lot of things
To even things, listen to the ruckus this
Heathen brings this evening
I'm back in this and so happy I can dance
Or even sing, nope I 
Just take a title from Stephen King
To let you know, ain't no holding us
Foes get a rapnophobia
Bow down when I flow to ya
Ya'll niggas don't really wanna bang
Especially with a shutter cane
Ain't nothing but a thing when I whip a
Haters ass like Clubber Lang
Fuck 103
When I blow up don't ya'll be touching on me
Fuck Myron D, and I'm cool with Tony G
And Shaun nigga, we got a bond nigga with the 9 Milla
We can't go wood, we going platinum
Fat stacks 'cause I'm cappin' em
Hail to my niggas in jail
Cameron, Mobiley, El Dorreto
Who niggas pray for my hefty payroll
So I can pay yo asses when you get done with your classes
We can rip shows rubbin' elbows with the masses
Thank god that I'm back when I explode
Imma show ya'll this
Ain't to tombstone in no 6 foot ditch
Been dead for four years
Buried in Necropolis but it must be Easter Sunday
Cuz I'm right back in this bitch

Because
Sometimes
They come back to haunt ya
Taunt ya
Test you don't want ta come to blows Tech n9ne
Hella murda for the bunch of ya's
Sometimes
He shall believe when he busts
He shall appease us on, the needs
Cuz was grievous
Sometimes

Mad Confusion,The Worst,2000.0,"Back to rip shit
Crush yourself, it’s the lunatic
Strapped with my chrome to they domes
And leave your fuckin' wig split
Competition fear me, they can’t get near me
Step into the circle and I’ll take you on a dream through my Elm street
It’s reality that you’re facin'
The funk will surround you, then you’ll start shakin'
Welcome to my concentration camp
There’s no need to try to run, ’cause I’ve gotcha caged like a rat
I know ya feel the pressure, from your head to your feet, wishing that you could wake up from this deadly sleep
But there’s no way out as your heart no longer beats
You breathed your last breath… heh… death, death
Takes ya ’round the corner puts somethin' mad on ya
You’re lost without a clue, bitch, oh, by my voodoo
You wake up with screams, knowing what you saw was no illusion
You’re going crazy from my mad confusion…

Flippin' about ta flow
And about to bust anotha
Hangin' from a noose in this
I won’t be talkin' about no upside down crucifix
No relation with any Satan, me and Don Juan
Never comin' evil like the Necronomicon
My word is bond if you enter
What I’m into is a psycho-flow-rhythmic-hymn with triple limb
Now ya know
Millimetre, nigga, bring ‘em all with the wreck game
Rip fools like Singapore with the wet cane
Fool niggas hangin' under (underground)
The level of madness
Step into some real shit and feel this
Why? 
I have no time for the punk shit
Run it back, run it back
Tihs knup eht rof emit on evah I

Make me wanna smoke something, ya know what I mean?
Ya, that's huge man, in his head, don't call me back!

Do you wanna light tonight? (Strange Music)
Put your lighters up to the sky (C'mon)
Wanna hit it once or twice? (Tech N9ne, baby)
Put your lighters way up high

Strange Music, '08

Hello, the name's Tech, hello, polite fellow
From the height Mr. Righteous and I'm nice and mellow
But when I introduce myself, the least you niggas can do is jeff
I swallowed my tongue so much for punks, that I ain't got no juices left
You tell them your name, they like, ""I know you, you ain't gotta tell me""
Off in the club, full of Patron, and hella Belve, tell me
Do you need a light? 'Cause your spite's not right
You looking to fight, I'm ready to smoke something tonight
And I ain't talking about no pipe to smoke, this get you nice and soaked
Steamin' meanin' demon, your life's a joke
I'm an animal, he think he cocky, but he soft as Barry Manilow
Can a bro go Hannibal so Bozo, then he pop ten shots? He flammable
You like the ganja, we like ya gone for
Please don't make Tech Neez squeeze like anaconda
Pleads, and owe me weeds, you'll see, because you under
Freeze 'cause KC G's breathe bringin' the thunder (July 1st)

I'm the one that you love when it sing (Yeah!)
The evil make the angel wanna smoke something
Brraa! Brraa! Good tidings I bring
'Til you cross the line and make me smoke something

You bless buddha, we get gouda
You envy us, then we get 2s to shoot that fool up
Ooze, when he bust and who's that shooter, steppin' with the Ruger?
Left him twitchin', let this be a lesson to you losers
Ridiculous how you spit at Misses is sick wickedness
His in this, this again, his twisted, this is specific
Dismiss a trick if he slip, no need for the fist 'o' brick
Proceed with a pistol-grip, go deep into a bitch for this
He demon, he shifty, quick to rid me like hicks in Mississippi
Gifted he to no hippie that's iffy-iffy with me
Vividly, visit T and get sticky icky-icky
Trip with me, 'cause bitches dig me like this is Pretty Ricky
Pissed at me? Clip is free! I'ma put that in your life and hope it
Be a little better for the player-hater, just sit in your fright and focus
Take a millimeter to the mouth and get red in your sight and posted
One-hitter-quitter with a trigger, nigga put that in your pipe, and smoke it

And for your shooby-dooby I got Scooby-Dooby to give that groovy
Uzi tooly to me, shoot the booshy bulley through the booty
Then ""Hiyah!"" I'm gunnin' you with the Glock brick in the dash
Screamin' ""Aaah! You son of a bitch you shot me in the ass!""
Diablo got the hollow, never trust us kids
That'll leave you lost, laying limp, instead of fluffed up jigs
Now the reason that I ever have to come home to a fucked-up crib
'Cause I'm creepin', but the haters see my lady and they never have a hushed up lid
Now the reapin' gotta come down rough, like wife ain't enough, just live
But they speakin' hella hated to my ladies because they seductive
Now we beefin', why you do a nigga shady, like selling me crushed up Thizz?
Get to chiefin', put the barrel in your mouth, take a hit nigga, puff-puff give

Some just smoke the Hookah, others hit the pipe up
So when me says you smoke with me, you got to give your life up
Start to runnin' Mr. Gunman, come to see you smokin' something!

To strap a time bomb to myself and hug you until it detonates
You’re 6 feet, I’m 11'8'‘
And if I told you once, I told you twice
I hold the guns, I’m so precise, so run nigga run
When the soldier come, I’m cold as ice
So hold your tongue or roll the dice, you’re done when I come
I’m a poltergeist, I’m givin’ ‘em rhythm quick as a cobra strikes
Kill 'em and kill 'em again
The shots slow your life, you should’ve known the price
Killer that holds the knife to your throat and slice
And when I’m creepin’ by, dippin' the ‘Lac

I'll put you on your back quicker than that

Rip a little snitch when he drippin' now bitch crawl in it

Tell the people we evil that the whole hood cook, that is no good look
The penalty for the pussy that put us in
Penitentiaries, rolled, shook, whooped
His motherfuckin' ass for givin' Po's good crooks

Understandable why your body is flammable
Handle your famo with ammo nigga animaly cannibal
Man oh man I'mma damage every stran' of botanicals
With Barry Manilow playin' man my hand is mechanical
Stuck repeatedly heated me and serviced 'n cheated me
So he bleeded immediately depleted me deity
Creepy I'm feeling deeply when I'm speaking of sleeping
The recently deceased peeps, he defeated so easily
Hush when you're rollin through KC-MO
Better bust or they gonna lose their people

Let's fuck all the faking and let us get us what we want
Pull 'em down turn around by nine down 
I lick my lips to let you know that I'm ready and bite the bottom
When I get drenched, how does it feel to have your nipples nibbled and pinched
When taking every inch, I love it when you flinch
You make me think that I'm using the force
Hold on I'm 'bout to end this motherfucker like a main course
I got you shivering quivering you love it
After I lick it you pull me by my hair, and told me to shove it
Your eyes keep saying, ""Why it feel so good?""
I make you jerk out after three rounds, I'm a still go wood
It's over and shit, I smoke another clover and shit
You spent the night with a G now it's over and shit

Fuckin' school 'cause my teachers a fool for followin' rules
When I make that run, when I make that sound when I pop that gun
Leaving demons numb
Releasing faeces, piss and cum
Now my futures looking manic, satanic, forces ran it
Dammnit, I'm , straight up panic
And it don't matter none to me 'cause Simon got my head
I'm mentally dead
And I'll pump you full of lead
Just because Simon said

Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says

Bitches, Biancas, and Biatchresses is all the same
Simon says he already equipped me with hella game
What did he want from me?
Small deeds
And get nothing, but I'll run up in it, all creeds, planting the seeds
He said I can stick it with no protection
I know flection, with a ho with no J on my erection
It's not a good call, hittin' this fraud wall, I'm just an oddball
Running back and forth through Todd Hall
All, these bitches, swingin' on my inches
Thinkin that they gettin' white picket fences, on my expenses
Simon said no worries
Hakuna Matata, but my dick is heated like an anchalota
Its gettin' hotta
Nobody move, nobody get burned
Bullshit if I more flex, I guess I'm on it when I get dressed in the latex
I bone it
But I don't cum
Niggas like me end up dead fucked up naked head
Just because Simon said

Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says

Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
That's what S.I.M.O.N means
But I heard this voice say, ""Hey Tech what about your dreams?""
Fuck that dreamin' and do this dirt, said that's how I'm gonna win
You gotta act like you want to be livin' fat like a Samoan
Could it be endless listening to Simon
This time I chose to kick rhymes
Get mines, the big times waitin' for me
Was tryin' to get signed
Heard my moms got a record deal with Jimmy Jam and Terry Louis
Prospective, now I'm the straight bomb
BOOM, in the face, I'm on the paper chase
Simon said he couldn't believe I resorted to rhymin'
Throw your shit together
No time for relaxin'
Time to go back to poppin' your 9 milli, jackin'
So what, I'm stuck, but, I'm hearing voices saying fuck that nigga named Simon
Get with a nigga named Diamond
And now, a nigga from the MidWest
Is 'bout to have these Biancas hearing me widespread
Fuck what Simon said

Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says

Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah

Boss Doggs,Celcius,2002," x4
Gun in my hand
Hot 'til I land
Boss Doggs!

Boy this I'm tied
Rebellin' on the corners of Highland
And if I die in this violence rest me
(Gun in my hand, hot 'til I land, boss doggs!)
But if I live past these sirens
Niggas best beware of this tyrant
Cuz I got some true mid-westsiders with me
(Gun in my hand, hot 'til I land, boss doggs!)

Rogue dog, rogue dog 57th street
Bout a craft from the past that was excused by my peeps
The same gang but a new game, no more cocaine
Rap thang we maintain, hot like propane
Up and here we pumpin that fear, lend me your ear
The tightest shit you'll ever hear, at least this year
All my lyrics is simple and clear, and sincere
Full of that beery, rockin them shows, and fuckin them hoes
Like we suppose we dealin with foes, leave em exposed
That's what you chose for fuckin with Rogues, now you know
We bout to explode, now here we go, all my Rogues
Grab your scratch it's time to scrap, rear it rap
You take a nap and that's a fact, all my hogs
Who got my back, where you at, bring the pain
To damage the brain, who's to blame, it's my gang
We full of them flames I won't explain, it's in your veins

King of the hill, countin my skrill, protecting my grill
Gun on my hip, tryin to conceal, this killa shit
That nigga Bakarii runnin that game, hold me back
I'll break them chains, slap yo face, with this strap
More than a rap nigga we hogs, down the brawl
Take yo bitch, make her scream, for them dogs
Murderers you can't touch my style, too complicated
Camaflouged in the bushes, now I'm waitin
Ready to get off in yo shit, feel my vengeance
Soon as you slip I'll make the hit, no repentance
Tryin to be rich and I can't be broke, I'm so relentless
Ask me if it was potent dope, I'm offended
Should've seen me comin nigga, them killa traits
Couldn't detect this boss's greed, that's yo fate
Under-seed smokin leafs, that killa fog
Can't be tweak, so you sleep, on these doggs
 x4

Criminal play, all day, give me relish
You going to war in all ways, max to devilish
Remember when niggas seen me flow, on them corners
Wantin to be like shorty chrome, never done
Hittin em up with 56's, dookie browners
Kickin it with them wicked bitches, all around us
Give me my money with blood on it, cuz I'm wicked
And if the game with love on it, til I'm lifted
Nitty would never be without, my three 80
Given a chance to up and dump, he must be crazy
Ready to roll no matter the fault, if he's seeded
Tell him to meet me at my show, fully fleeted
Hearing shots pop pop pop, at my enemy
It's better than seein that nigga drop, y'all ain't feelin' me
Making my verse my worst then first, are y'all with me
Diggin my dirt for what it's worth, signed Nitty

Crumple this page, 
welcome mitch bade,
 hold my genitals
We in a rage, if we don't get paid, nothing but criminals
Put in the gun, nigga let's come, from the shoulders
Here come the fun, watching 'em run, from these soldeirs
Who be the doggs? Who be the hogs? Niggas on Highland
Doing the broad, doing it for, straight out stylin'
Used to be down, look at me now, makin' them heaters
Niggas they frown, when they hear the sound, of nine millimeter
Flowin in fog, who do you call? Donny Quest's in
Haters with yall, nigga they all, learn they lesson
Bianca zone, at my home, think I made it
All on my bone, cuz it was on, Gang Related
Seeing my face in magazines, up in The Source man
Do we plan on makin that green? Well of course man
Mid-westside, give me the track, and I will attack her
Scoobie do wild, check yo style, and flip it backwards
I'm off on Highland, smoking that bud, drinkin that bud
That Tecca Nina, be up in your fuzz, up in the club
I lost yall, but I'mma return, do you recall?
I'm killin em all, nigga we raw, boss doggs",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-boss-doggs-lyrics

Somethin’ To See,Bad Season,2010.0,"When I was young I used to wonder, why you lookin at me?
Cause I'm gifted I'm different, I still ask why? why you staring at me?
Cause I'm something to see. ok, ok, now why?
Why you looking at me? cause I'm a wierdo, still though ill flow, and so
Why you staring at me? cause I'm something to see

They didn't stare much, before I fucked my hair up
In 11th grade, when I had bare nuts
And the principal told me to get a haircut
Cause I was distractin kids, but when a nigga was rappin
Chumps would flare up
Cause I was dope and plus a sight to see
Mighty twice exciting, the night sky thing, with dykes inticing
A sight, just the mic and me
I bring nice things when I write the fightings, igniting
When a nigga wanna get up in the face of the spikes and see
Cause I'm diff-erant diff-erant, trippin is what this nigga want
This is when pistols get to clickin
The sick one hit the dump
On suckas I bring the chrome rukus
When I go, yeah I'm back niggas on track making stacks, fat figures
Even though strangers rap, we still cap pillaz
I'm miraculous, such an activist, I blast a bitch and cause disaster
If I'm deffinatly trip I'm smashing in shit


Heart throb, never, black and ugly as ever
Black and shiny like pattent leather
However, I stay gucci down to the boots
The booth is the only place I feel I got to tell the truth
Ok
Its like a gift and a curse
Me and people get funny looks from them first, then their women
When I'm traveling get the dip on their turf
See what I'm working with then dip in their skirt
Ima bend em
They used to shake me off like I was dandruff
Now they want me in the middle, like the meat on their sandwich
Mr. two-tone, famous now that you grown, mr. getting to big for the city now that you blown
Used to look at me like I was putting on a side show
Now they know vitiligo, in every city I go
Still the funny lookin fat kid on the inside
The difference is now a niggas world wide


Why do they stop and stare?
Helling to oh me
I'm still the same ole playa, that's all that I can be
Cause when I ride through the hood these days
Niggas don't feel the same, cause when you turn your radio on
Your prolly gunna hear my name
Tell your bitch to pick her jaw off the floor
Shorty been gawkin and starin and all since I walked in
Its prolly gunna be causin a problem
A nigga been watchin and jockin hard and licking her chops
And shes looking at me like a piece of meat shes fittin devour
Now I'm a sensible fella, never have I been a sucka
That's why I'm gone kick the bucket, before a ho game I trust
Because all the same hoes who ain't ever paid me no nevermind
Is all trying to perform a horizontal grind in this bed of mine
Cause they know I'm from another time, I'm ahead of mine
And I'm fittin to blow off all the rhyms from this head of mine
Another nigga ill as me, please you will never find
Someone on my level I'm not yet even in my prime
Uhh, they used to act like they never seen me
Now the same haters looking at me like they never seen me
Yeah and if your girlfriend ain't never seen me
Better handcuff her might dead her if you let her see me

Fucked Up Day,The Worst,2000.0,"Ya
We at the end of this shit
Finally at the end of this shit
My nigga Paul Law on vocals
Midwest side
'Bout to drop a couple light weight verses
Check it out

Be warned
So many motherfuckers in the inner city got me torn
Many niggas have sworn
But don't even understand the storm
So I better move the, hold the press
Never can slow the best
But I'm having a fucked up day so I just progress
When smoking on them green clovers, cess
Thinkin' about killin' a bitch if a bitch insist
On usin' the bottleneck sources
I give her what I mean by death from anghellic forces
Of course it's the fist of fury
Mr. T.I.B.D. and several twister
Uplift a high plains drifter and differ
Mitch bade nigga, display bigger
Next he'll find himself in the middle of a ditch lay with her
Big parade of them slithery things I mean stuffed in grey litter
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this 
So we scorn to  best be warned, be warned

Let me warn you
I'm having a fucked up day today
And I just ain't got no time to play
Let me warn you
This shit's getting worse for me today, today, today

I drench to get drunk, I thinks to get funk
My inks a bit bunk, so I switch my pen and then begin my friend
I blinks 'cause it bumps
RD's give a nigga  without a flaw
We say walla milli dollar, then break a lot a jaw
Alright, where the booze at? Never did think I'd use that
Who's that nigga who don't know then confuse that
I do-es that, really wanna take out this demon
Waiting for God to give me the OK
What niggas really want is a black Keyser Söze, ugh
Caught up in rap I'll never again get caught up with a bitch
Stuck in the intersection 
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this 
So we scorn to  best be warned, be warned

Let me warn you
I'm having a fucked up day today
And I just ain't got no time to play
Let me warn you
This shit's getting worse for me today, today, today

The end of my LP, also end of existence
Novus ordo seclorum, time to get artillery equipment
Riddle me this, riddle me that
Who's the nigga that got that contract
Have been dead like about four years and nueve says
Who's gonna come back?
Who's that one them call the K-I-double L-A clown around these parts of Mizzou who is the nigga that's gonna make many G's
Who sees demons after dark
And skinheads killin' my P-E-O-P-L-E's
Who's said yell Seig Heil but don't fuck double N-U-double T's
God's infinite family trees
About to seize these 
Racist punk gonna make you fall down to your knees
Why am I that type to be cool before I swarm?
Because I like these calmer moments before the storm, be warned
Everybody want to go heaven but nobody want dead
Rude awakening boy, the future tells about too many bloodshed
I said, Satana we shall dismember in the last days
Start this race in '71 November, remember
I can look into your eye, smile and then to your surprise
I'll be yellin' ""Die, nigga, die!"" when all the bullets fly
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this 
So we scorn to  best be warned
The worst type of nigga is gone",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-fucked-up-day-lyrics

Tech
]
Only if you promise to smack me god damn it
I think I'm gonna do the uhh.. hook on this one, yeah
Okay, turn around so I can hit it from the back
No
Come on!
I don't want to
You don't want me to hit it from the back? 
Come on! BIANC!

I like to hit it on flip, don't trip
I make it worth it, if you nervous I got the service
That'll make you work it, you deserve it
A sex spot to flex wet spots with grip
Stressin' now, 'cause ain't nobody throwin' tips
Your hips so amazin', I'm gazin', you blazin'
Praisin' and I no longer shriveled like a raisin
I'm stoned - hopin' that your homegirl I entered is
I'm down, even if is Ellen Degeneres
I'ma clown the punana, pound the pupan
Hate it like a crouton, wise words from God Zoutan
The flip baby, no gip baby
Ninna like the way you strip, baby, no way you dip ladies
See me in your city, be ready, when I'm looking for some fun
I be coming at you, five hundred worth of 1's
Just the trick off, gather your oils to lick off
You and your homegirl rollin' with me, jerkin' my dick off
Not a rip off, just gettin' it tossed the lip gloss
Your lips lost so deep in it, they callin' me the pit boss
I'm lovin' it the way you got me shovin' it
Doggy slip-slide, much obliged
I cried when I hit it on the flipside

(Which side?) Flipside
(This side) Ladies so I can dip die
(That's right)
Ain't nothin' thick about the way I like it
The jiggle making me fizzle when you make it, make it wiggle a little
Stay on the flipside
(Which side?) Flipside
(This side) Ladies so I can dip die
(That's right)
This ain't no ballad talkin' about how I'm in love
This is strictly for the strippers in the club, on the flipside

Meet me in Las Vegas, I'm stayin' at the Grand
Keys under Ninna when you be fightin' with your man
Into it, no undees, get ready to bungy, jump me
Knew you meant business, when you ripped out my Abercrombie
Hormones hungry, like to get me down under like Crocodile Dundee
Keepin' your sex weapons from me, I'm grungy
Not mean and I'm way freaky like zombie
Friday to Sunday yellin' Tech, I love the way you done me
And then I'm Solomon Grundy, you's a flower when I killed it
You wilt it, who got power, call me (Deep Space N9ne)
On  'cause I rocked 'em all with socks and all
Y'all 'iancs, I hit the lots of y'all
Slots, (show 'em, show 'em what you got)
Girl you makin' it hop, it syncopated with pop non stop
This game is silky, I hope you milk me
I'm fiendin', not killin' me 'cause you
Can't touch my vibe, if you jockin' Kenin
I fly in semen, you crying freeman
It feels so well, get chills in Hell Screamin' demon
Before you nut up I want you to shut up
And give it to me face down, butt up
I just die, when I hit it on the flipside

(Which side?) Flipside
(This side) Ladies so I can dip die
(That's right)
Ain't nothin' thick about the way I like it
The jiggle making me fizzle when you make it, make it wiggle a little
Stay on the flipside

This ain't no ballad talkin' about how I'm in love
This is strictly for the strippers in the club, on the flipside

I can heal it, baby (40 to touch, bust and grind)
'Bout to kill it, baby (200 bucks a good time)
I wanna do it baby, stick it baby (Sex on the mind)

Enough! Girl you drivin' me nuts
You and your homie's hype horny comin' back from peanuts
With hokie-pokie, on the brain and we can keep it low-key
B they hottest when they comin' back from sokey
What up to upholstery, listen closely
Lap dance in the corner, I'm all up on her
Two more Coronas, you leaving with me
'Cause I'm increasing the fee, you leasin' to pee
Hella fat like Jackie, pleasing me
I admire, what you do call girls, the way you dance
And strip, deck down to your tips, beautiful lips
You say that you like it way better from a wild style
Nigga comin' sex-crazed at you on the flipside

Can you feel it, baby? (20 to touch my waistline?)

Let me tell you a little story about this nigga I know
From the M and the O
A chemical nigga who says I got criminal flows
I'ma set the record straight for a second
Everybody knows this nigga is hot-headed
And due for a mic checkin
You drew first blood in '94
Trickin with my baby momma
You know the one you called a ho
I'ma let you know
That if you take it back to the past
When I was squeezing hella ass and playin hookie
You can ask my bro, He will let you know
Back then I shared my pussy
You was using music as a form of pursuing
Pussy sneakin in her bed and beggin for a screwin
Who the fuck is you foolin?
I can still make her make you put yo muthafuckin mic down
Straight interrupt yo show
And serve yo ass in her nightgown
Right now
Fuck the rappin, we can fight now
Tight style, Sell for miles
Change the name Vell to Vall
Call him Dame or Gal
Cause the way he came was foul
Nigga that's bitch shit
Tech N9ne you dissed it
But they missed it
Told me that you sold 200,000 with pride
But you lied, I don't mean to hurt yo feelings inside
But you sold 5,000 Nationwide
You a clown man
You niggas think I bluffin, go check the SoundScan

And why this nigga basin his whole life on challenging me?

Midwest side will chase em down with a choppa
Motherfucker thinking Teccanina gonna stopa
Something wrong with his medullah oblongota

Yo
This nigga struggling to be the better man
Why fuck around with a tech milla meter
When you know the nigga is a clever brand
Naw, I ain't never ever seen the niggas video
Cause It never ran
And you got the audacity to say Tech N9ne ain't a veteran?
Nigga, I wrote my first rhyme in '85 right
'86, '87, '88, name me Tech N9ne right
'89, '90, I was rippin shows, don't you even try cat
'90 through '99 equals 15 years and I done rapped with some of the best
Motherfucker can you buy that?
We recognize you wanna be the best rapper in Kansas City
That's small time
That's why yo shit will never be in the hands of many
My shit is clean and packs a punch pal
And yeah you right, yo shit's a sloppy rum and drunk style
This nigga is failin in the biz
Bets step behind this
Don't know where his mind is
That's why the Nina's bout to tell it like it is
Tech Tech N9ne is
Kansas City's Finest
All I wanna know is

Why this nigga steady savin his flows for me?

I'm beginning to see real deal, scrill and real honeys
And you don't wanna get with a nigga that's sick makes you a real dummy
He said I worship satan and he worship god that's why we can't work
Nigga that's a cop out, bout to make yo eyes pop out when I whip my cock out
And say I seen you comin out of Roc house
This is the third round knockout
When you die and all ya piss, cum, and feces drop out
Tellin motherfuckers we bit (Let's Get Fucked Up)
From yo just locally hit (Bounce, Bounce, Bounce, Bounce)
Knowin the shit that we spit (Make bitches wanna fuck)
And make niggas get on they grit (And yo shit don't)
We officially bumped heads at the Lou Ou
Niggas are through now
Who growled at the Holy Temple Bandits Crew style
Niggas are too foul
Sole and Tech, and you can bet you'll never see em wet
You sound like Chuck Rock, with a little bit of DMX
Now I'ma end this by sayin Regime Life and 56 Vil
Said Tech rappin on that niggas payin for him and his kids meals
I feel bad for the nigga, so I'ma let it out
A gift from me to you, Ex-Cousin, Retalliate and go get breaded out...

Why this nigga steady savin his flows for me?
(He wanna get paid)
And why this nigga basin his whole life on challenging me?
(He wanna get paid)
Fuckin with 56 Villain get you shota
Midwest Side will chase him down with a choppa
Motherfucker thinking Teccanina gonna stopa
Something wrong with his medullah oblongota
Fuckin with 56 Villain get you shot up
Midwest side will chase him down with a choppa
Motherfucker thinking Teccanina gonna stopa
Something wrong with his medullah oblongota

Balla position
Regime niggas fuck all'a ya women draped up in linen
I spit this fly shit since I was 5 years old
On some 'ol Osh Kosh Bi'Gosh shit
Toss ya bitch, keep it top secret, lock it
Smoke-A-Lot click, walkin around wit ounces in they pockets
Bitches jock it
We ridin Benz's, ya'll still drivin 50 rockets
Nigga don't knock it
But you need to stop it
Top notch shit
I used to cop bricks
Rock it up an chop like La-Bobbitt
Pushin the 5 whip through the projects til the led 9 spits
Nigga you rhyme sick, but you could never fuck around wit my shit
My click my crew nigga
That hard time shit
Criminal minded, posted on the grind shit
That cone silencer for one time shit
Turnin, pounds into ashes
Drinkin Cristal from the bottle
Fuck ya glasses
Smokin Black-N-Milds to the plastic
The last trial was kinda drastic
Limo driver got his ass kicked, tryin to sue us
BUT YOU LOST YOU FUCKIN BASTARD!
I'm A-1 Yola juss like the package
Delivered in triple wrappin
Niggas get blasted an put in a casket
Ashes to ashes an dust to dust, when they fuck wit Yuk
Plus I got my own record label
SO WHAT THE FUCK IS UP!

When things is usual we pop Christy
An stack them Bentley's
Ya pockets empty pretending to be me
They name me Bossi
My whole click rich like we the Cosby's
Slippin's costly
It's cut-throat so fuck a softie
In head to head combat
You scared to bust back
An trust that
Call the Regime we known to pull gats in black hats
Hop out the company truck
Give a fuck, fill my cup an celebrate wit Yuk
Now that we grown ups
Rock alligators an bumpin slow cuts
Juss like the Sho Nuff, we can't be touched
I was raised ruff
Gang banged an hand cuffed
Fightin thugs always showin my guts, flexin my nuts
Hand me my 'Uervo
Flip work like we was Trader Joe's from Cisco
Optimo, now it's X-O
Fightin my  for death
Pray it's my brother that's kept
When you owe, pay ya debt an we can make it some 

We got it bundled up
Gimme my scratch
It's juss my turn an I'mma take mine
Trap
Nigga don't get attached
Tryin to soak up, listenin
Tryin to locate my donuts an hit 'em
While we juss got on fuckin up my buisness
Never finished
Til we give up the plate
Extra innings
Swing for the fence
You think too little
Your world dance wit mud puddles
My shit Evian, I love trouble
Start wisperin wit ya hands wide open, watchin you huddle
Big every down
Everybody got guns, let 'em ring
You fuckin wit me, let's all go out wit a bang
In this last day, this last hour
Kool-aid chest cowards wit they life in my hands set off the power
Lights out
Swiss cheese the whole house
Wit a gallon of gas to douse
Light a flame an flush 'em out
Every slug count
Miss an get your stripes took
Nigga this is real life wit real names written in the black books!

Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!

Ever since I was a youngsta been wit this slick shit
Tryin to touch a quick one, number one biscuit
Turn an 18 to a full 36 ain't jokin thats how we did it
We was natural born chemists
Ballin wit this, Benjamin big heads in my fist
Got ya life in my pocket an more than that on my wrist
I got my degree in the concreate of S.C
Comprised wit gettin paper, an started investin in me
Utilized my hustle skills beyond my record deal
And time will reveal whose really holdin the skrill
Playboy ya lackin, ain't touchin my tax brackets
You fuckin wit some thugs, wit some multi-million dollar 
An if it's on an crackin then my reaction is clappin
Is you gon' make it happen or is ya high cappin?
Ya betta get to trackin playboy if you ain't packin
Smoke-A-Lot, Regime is distributin max ???
Spent years over the stove in a mini-factory lab
Where illegal pharmaceudicals were sold
I was probably 10 years old when I learned to disassemble
Then reassemble a semi-auto matic pistol blind fold!

1-5-1
They call me Regime, cuz I'm way clean in stay Beam
Never live in no day dream, bitch niggas wear Maybelline

I told y'all, deep in you froze with flows, La Cosa Nostra
Hand me your souls when I approach 'em
Coast to coast, toast to indulge ya
Makes me (*backwards talking*) little backwards exposure
The time is critical, divine spiritual
Bind rituals, people keepin' away from N9ne kickables
Heard he flips 'em, rips 'em
And when he does it may God be with ya, Deus Vobiscum
Rips from here to Quebec, I will wreck in the sec' I met you
Take off, you flex and get vexed in the ledger, so here's your best bet
Give your currency to me, how to be an emcee
Is mucho dinero,
 jockin' juice on mi huevos (lego)
 up against fruity pebbles
I go through the ghetto like heavy metal, pendejo
Flippin' my rapper, killer beats
You non-rapper kill a sour bits
Crowded like Roscoe's on Gower Street
Power speech, I straight devour leaf suckers
Like they stole from my mother on Christmas (Six plus six, lift us)

Lyrical science, mine, backstabbin' emcees to the defiance line
Fuck fools, approve this, the dudes are clue-less
If you ain't with me then you're a true diss
Who likes futuristic Battlestar Galactica rubbish?
Haters discuss it, had the number because I bust it
Like , I know it stings, replacing the children
The changeling, I give 'em a brain wings
Sane dream, the invincible mainstream
Reign things, mental bacterial gangrene
B-boy 2000, we noise, we housin'
Grim display, blowin' the spot up like Tim McVeigh
Swim this way if you don't want my flow to drown ya, found ya
Down pound for pound, Killer Clown clowned ya
Sounds of trigger men, the hunter with the bigger tip
Surpass to your lyrics are igornant, I mean ignorant
The east trippin', the west trippin'
To me the best clippin' is Nina Midwest rippin' (The flippin' Mantronix)

One Night Stand,The Worst,2000.0,"I just want a one night stand

Peep me, uh
I rock and Nina while I get cleaner with pieces I purchase
More glitz and ritz than Versace
No first base, I'm hittin' homers, put groupies in what?
Comas, with a hella boner minus condyloma
When rollin' Sunset or Prospect
We on the lookout for some hot sex on a platter
Who we rock next don't matter, pay attention
You friends say I'm a no hit
But did you know my oral is in ten different posit's?
 one nihzizzy
Sprung from smelling my Issey Miyake
The suns of bizzy when I gun you dizzy
Ride you like Kawasaki
So if you don't try to stop me
You'll have a night of yellin' Bonsai like Mr. Miyagi
Where's the party? (not my place) I belong to somebody
Why am I spittin' 'cause I'm naughty-naughty
Scorpio we slick as ice hockey
When I'm bombin' like a Shockley
We rock these socks of Ewoks
One night nooks, N9na's off the hook

One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

Ha ha ha ha
I know what you want baby, and I'll tell ya again
It's all delicious, we kick it, whatever you want to do, you down?
You down for a one night stand?  I told you that
I had somebody, I had to be real up front
 we can do this

Girl what's happenin' wit' ya?
Lose the Mitchell if he trippin' I'ma take his picture
You make me sizzle gots to get ya, what's the deal homie?
If you're real lonely, let me spank it but don't do an Anita Hill on me
Awful to scare a homie with a lawful ceremony
Demi Moore, Disclosure
In the pen yellin' ""I miss dosia""
All because of one night, but if you woulda gave me the chance
It would've been done right
I would've made the nana sneeze, gesundheit
Will ya come over?  We just met but I can soak ya
Strip poker, unsober, got us tossin' on the sofa
You saw me starin' at you, when ya done ah-carin'
That you never ever climaxed, inside the IMAX
My one night stand can make you call the Sandman
Sprung over the first name of the host of American Bandstand
I heard you say you ain't gon' even call me
That's how it is in showbiz it's in the Bible
Don't ya think?  Though it is bitch

One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

 you can't buy this shit from me
It's all delicious, that's how we do it
I mean, it was passed down to my father from his father, passed down to my father and his father and ah, my father passed it down to me.  How we do this player shit
Like, can I sing to you for a second?

The scene is green exposure
The club is filled with dosia
What I'm about to recruit
Partner picture had the hunter in the private school suit
I seen her peepin' me and since there ain't no type of geek in me
I made my way to the specimen, stressin' it's the freak in me
So I shifted into Barry White mode
The closer that I got homie, the more she was cold
She had a trunk load, I walked up on her like dwam
The record said start, she grabbed me and said that's my jam
You know you gets the nookie after a Luke song
You take the hooch home, so you can get your shoots on
I wanna take you out your normal state of mind lady love
And if they shoot us, they just takin' us out this land of Judas
We can ride the ninth cloud, and seventh heaven then land right
On my mattress and drop you after one night, Beatrice

One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

What'cha mean?  It ain't cruel?  Y'all do it too
You can't tell me you ain't never met no nigga that you just wanted to...you met at the club and you just wanted to, you know, take him home after y'all got done drinkin' a couple of Caribou Lous.  Ya know what I mean?
Do what you came to do to the nigga, ya know what I mean?
We do it every day, you do it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Y'all keep it, at the club and y'all got a good way of keepin' that shit hidden.  You know what I'm sayin'?  Y'all ain't right

I'm short, dark and rugged, and lots of ladies love it
When I covet any object with fur I gots to rub it
I'm mister rapper man, Dapper Dan who's bad
Now they know me when see me in the brand new Jag
Pullin' up on the club scene, you and homegirl's gaze
Heard the N9na flips the tongue in many ways, plus he paid
A super freak, so for the tongue they got to seek
So they come and get a piece of N9na but they fall in love a little when they peak
On the  human hydraulics excites me, hypes me psyche
Tonight I hope I'll be the victor like Nike
I'm poured and now we Motel 6'n liked it, bashed it
Later found out she burns through Jimmys, nitric acid
I fasted on one nights for a split
I'm back and now the Tech is highly hated by the Mitch clique
If you get it Mitch like bitch quick you hitched
But yo if you's a one night stander throw your hands in the air like this

One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

You agreed to do it with me, but now, after we get through it, you actin' like, you know what I'm sayin', that I did something bad to you, that ain't right.  You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, that's what I said, know what I'm sayin'?  I mean, you said, I told you in the beginning that, you know what I'm sayin', I was with a mothafucka, but, you know what I'm sayin', you said it was cool, you know what I'm sayin', but now you're lookin' at me like, you know what I'm sayin', like everything ain't right, so it's...
Uh, what the, where y'all?
Want to  my pajamas?
I have to think about that
Would you do that for me?
I can do that
If you do, we can start with some, Caribou Lou
Ooh, that sounds good

Higher than a mother fucker
Get fucked up
Real fucked up and it's all delicious",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-one-night-stand-lyrics

Up behind a nigga back tryin' to bound us
I don't want that nigga Vell up around us
You the Holy Temple bandit, nigga I'm a killer on candy
Tecca Nina I'mma be the omega believe I'm that
Bomb that landed on your set cause you call me Satan
When I look at you I see skull chips dipped
In ranch dressing lemon chicken with a side of intestines
Induced vomiting backwards digestion
Torn ligaments with Ragu, garlic salt's meshin'
Enormous hole in the ozone to affect my complexion'
Frontal lobes fried in Wesson
Nigga like me sick no need for no medicine
Bishop and Keen (What)
You better believe you gotta leave
Before you get a couple in your belly
Keena better strip in a whole another city
Bishop keep doing songs with R. Kelly
Mentally you niggas can't even get with me
I done lost everything but my chemistry
Macc and Tech we be hotter than hickory
Killin' delivery, livin' in mizery


KC Mizery, leave unsolved mysteries
For fuckin' round with my cheddar cheese
Betta leave these G's alone
Before me and my nigga Tech Nina
Hit your home, split your dome
With the 4 chrome, make a nigga face melt like the ozone
In the mind of a psycho, what goes on?
Colombian necktie with no clothes on
Murder show's on, in the K-Town
I'm the type of nigga that'll beat your ass down
Shoot you in the face as soon as you hit the ground
Hit a nigga, split a nigga, then give you a pound
32 rounds, packin' extended's
Crossin' my niggas is not recommended
Tempted to put you in a life long body cast
You best guard your shit when the shotty blast
More straps than John Gotti had
So sick I sleep in a body bag
Droppin' bombs like Saudi
Had to get low in a Lac on faulty tags
Talkin' trash'll get you took out
Four niggas posted just to look out
Get grips like fierce and have a cook out
Let me show you niggas what me and the crooks 'bout
Thievin', schemin', seein' demons
Smoke so much you kill your semen
Psychoactive human being
Eyes so low I look Korean
Head steamin', funk bringin'
Old school rider gangsta leanin'

Checking my clothes for N-O's
You think I'm all up in them hoes
Who love to be giving me demos
All up in my grill
You making a villain say goddwamn!

Never woulda hit it if I knew this
Never gave it to a celebrity
Better be down with a nigga wit a early 70's mindframe
You all about mind games
Mrs. Sherlock always trying to find things
I'd rather be behind you given ya doggy style, hit so hard you get spine pains
Sluts, is a wonderful thing
But you gotta know I'm a nigga with a lust for green
Your friends say I'm a player, they wanna intervene
But they know they come at me they gotta terrible scene

How you been?
It's been a long time since I talked to you last
I got a question, you still with homeboy?
Y'know homeboy don't matter to me
I'm interested in you baby
We can creep
Y'know what I'm sizzlin'?
Just think about it baby, I'm tryin' to get with you for real

Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

Wassup?
This ya boy Tech Nina
It's good to hear ya, but it's been a minute since I seen ya
Fox demeanor, gots to dream ya
'Cause you stay blocked and locked with hops between ya
I know you got a man, I know you got a little on the side
But I was thinkin' if you down for creepin' then we can slide
You's a hot one, and you look like you need a top notch one
Ya boy couldn't win it with Johnnie Cochran
I know he with you when it's cool, but I'm still tryin' to get you to cruise
That ill behind and your lips and your boobs
Come get with a fool
We can take any trip that you choose
Forget that your dude is waitin' while you twistin' in the nude with this
Boss villain ghetto true mafia
Feel you from here to Czechoslovakia, what's stoppin' ya?
I need it and I don't think that I can deal without it
Strictly being real baby tell me what you feel about it

Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

I know you got time with dude and I'm new
But I'm a true, and I'm tryin' to get into you
I know he probably give you big love, but I don't trip Cuz
Dude's cool, I met him at the strip club
Ya he's good for you, he keeps you grounded
While I pound it, soft and wet is how it sounded
Leave you astounded, from the tongue dancin' around it
That's the angle, search for an angel and then I found him
Right between those eyes baby
I know it gets heated at home
But your homie Tech Nizzle can hear your cries baby
I know it's hell, I put out fires with this
Got him cussin' on your pager and slittin' tires and shit
You don't need that, you need positive feedback
Lift you're skirt up and throw you on the counter and eat that
L-E-G's back, pull it out and I tease that
We release that, have us a drink and repeat that
What you think?

Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play

Yo, yo, check
I need a hardcore chick who can chill on the rap side
Love, money, and keep her scratch-tied
So when your homeboy don't act right
Just remember my face
Is a permanent sittin' spot, for your backside
I'm just tryin' to kick it
Make up your mind you want N9ne to stick it
I'm diggin' you because you fine and wicked
Don't want to miss it, I'm psycho sick wit' it, dig it
I sop you like a biscuit, and I'll hop ya like a cricket
This is a - decent proposal don't ever hate on it
When I see somethin' I want baby, I'm never late on it
You ain't gotta answer now, you can marinate on it
But before I go I got to throw this serenade on it
It goes when it rains and when it thunders
If he treat you like a cheap and he runaway from ya
You can call me on the under
When you need someone to run to just dial my number

Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

So what you think baby?
You think you can do this?
You think you got the borders to do this with me? (Hehehe...)
I know you're thinkin' about it
I know you're thinkin' about it
I see how you look at me
You and me exchangin' looks over his shoulder at the restaurant, remember that? (Heh)
Ya, I know you remember that

Fucking with DC I send that ass into the next life
Have niggas laughin' at you, mashin' on you, talkin' shit
Smack you up, black you up, tack you up, now picture this
This nigga all on stage lookin' raggidy taking mine
I say no words, I play it cool, then I introduce Tech N9ne

And if you niggas wanna bang
It's all Jesus ain't nothing but a thing
Vill life motherfucker Tecca Nina
Leaving every bitch nigga slain

Call me  criminal individual hit 'em with a four
So low under investigation by haters that wake mo' show
For the  I'm  all of my 
Players get busted when haters discuss it, they shake
Lit makin' hooligans with the lyrical more grand
Lookin' over my shoulder for murder again
I heard my kin got popped up over a girl man
Never been a friend to a foe, a ""yes"" to a ""no""
But I stay blessed like pope, make a nigga guess where I go
Yo, we down 151 bottles of rum quick
Performin' on beat, keeping it rockin' like some drum sticks
Label the , yeah, making this your first down
And if you got game chop it up like a pound
Knockin' dust to the ground town no for the mentally verbal assassin
With the D to the L-O-C yelling ""We keep on blasting""
I'mma get up in it with lyrical games
Steadily hell he better be wearing a name
Creep with the milla heat under my seat
Cause haters on

""Why they want to hate us"" is what I'm thinkin' up in my mind
That's the same reason why these bustin' igganas are steadily die
Your people cry, cause they don't know half of the story
Is two sides to everybody's fall
40 deuce finna take 'em all like school time
It's a road call, all you player haters gon' pairs
Got mad cause you got embarrassed
Now you want to tear my head off cause you jealous (Why?)
Is it because I'mma verbal damage it?
Simmer up in the image makin' all my spinach off of selling cannabis
D-Loc and Dalima, the positive the opposite they struggle live
Now that we debated all these haters always lookin' at us
On the rage what we gots to give
Boy, this otherna I'mma k  and alimaday  put dirt on my 
But ya ain't stoppin' no kind of progress
Mob threats with a sideback
Hating got yourself walkin' in Dalima's starting on another project
Hating on me? Look at the buddha blastin' with the G
Sick to the H-A-S to the E, repeatedly comin' to comin' to repeatedly bitch

These young hooligans be fucking 'em like (POW-POW)
Anybody player hatin' on, Mitchell Bading they gettin' (FUCKED UP)
Bitches all be like (WHAT WHAT)
When I hear a nigga
If you ever fuck with one of my villains your ass is gettin'
(FUCKED UP)

This city life how can I get past it
Is scandalous, hectic, drastic and even got to 
How can I escape these snakes I was told to keep faith
Catch a new case some on the run to a new state
I'm livin' real fine, my mind constantly undoing time, smoke me some weed, cut up some green got the finner rhyme mister GC
These kids sold and I can tell (Tell)
And thuggin' ain't make it and tell me what would we prevail
A threat to all you broads

That's become a nigga that hates, so Nina
I've been around the world and I-I-I
That's where my grass is greener
Then the next man, when I'm lecturin'
While had me off in your best friend contraceptin'
Leave it left there, face down, ass up studio westin'
Niggas be mad at me, could it be my lyrical strategy
And they wanna get staticy
Would me and my villains be fuckin' they bitches' anatomy?
It's a lot of niggas vill life'ing on 'em
We tote guns and you knifing on 'em
When I call rogue dog
Best believe, my niggas be bitin' on 'em
But the Tech N9ne like
Of off in the midwest limelight in a rhyme fight

I've been around the world I ya
Freak so many girls I ya
The women I done seen I ya
Some freaky little things I ya
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
Yo, ya bet to know I gotta
Flex a flow about a
Sexy ho I gotta
Let ya know about her
Me next to go inside her
I repped the mo beside her
We did it show at Granada
Sexy dark chocolate
I think her name was Aua Young Scholler Halleljah
What I got to do to get inside the coller
So I took her back to the mo
She rode it like a pony
She was O.G
Young chick it was better than it was supposed to be
Was a Mexican and Italian chick named Mexital Marie
For a minute she wondered about the chance she gets to wild wit me
I'm ridin' with her and she had an enormous fart box
So we pulled over and I fucked it doggy style in the automatic car wash
Later that date she took me to see bait
She bought a nacho plate
But only Tech N9ne got ate
The cerebellum was great then she sat on top of the snake
I didn't even see bait so with my other bitch I had to skate
I got contex
Plus I got bomb ex
So after Grant then it's Kutt and baby I'm next
So we can triple team up and fuck your spleen up
Between us get 3 nuts then you can beam up
Now ya sexual peak is met so don't fret
When I call you up and say what's happening baby it's Tech
I'm callin' to see if you down for heated sex
So we can flex and you can lick the barcode on my neck
(Hook)
(Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun)
Yo, yo she was a black gold, center fold classic
Chirped to Mack mode, that ass kept asking
Provalaks and a double stack bag of exstacy
It's on now exactly (fiesta)
I blasted (fo-eva)
Another mate I can check on chess was best for less dimeanor
A record exec for Techa Nina
Like a man wit no arms
But she let Kutty plow the peach sorta like horses do farms
A true charms tale
Addicted wasn't supposed to see the booty
But I lucked up and Dave Weiner gave Kutt a thumbs up (keep it real)
From L-A-X to sunset
Trunks get the donks wet Beyonks let
Outta towners hunt sex for contest
Rican and black urinary freak in the sack (ol' what's her name)
Janelle used to let me skeet on her back end at the Grafton Down to the Best Western
Let's turn this camcorder on time for some action
(Hook)
(Verse 3: Grant Rice)
She was a supermodel
I met her in Miami
A video girl worl was candy
And she said i'm sour on the outside but sweet between the legs
A freak talked about what got her body hot
Like lokkipops and sheets
I replied like ma
I'm diabetic so i'm allergic to sweets
We continued politicing bout if I got a chicken
And her favorite way of all positions I listen to her talk
Mesmerized by her eyes and the glide in her walk
She was sent by Satan himself
Temptations prayin' for help
But couldn't help it still
Found help in two shots and a pop of a pill
We peeled on our way
Blue Fountain room 318
Close the windows and le me sin blow
Like a whirl wind smoked and joked about each others girlfriends
And it's still a secret mi amor forever ima keep this behind closed doors

Well here comes Tecca Ninna
Imma tell, and I'm a playa
Hey Rob, turn me up, man, so I can get this poppin' in and out, man!

I started small time rap game, that's pain
IcyRoc school of rap, I'm never wack, mane
Had no jewelry, I was broke, but I was rhyming hard
So now you see me and I swerve with bodyguards
Quick hasty, player haters, they face be
Wop-bobba-loo-bop-
popped, we off safety
Cops know we do got knots, we lock pastries
Shock on a new hot knock, Rick Rock made me
Squat in a new drop-top, they got shaky
Pa'tners and crew got hot, you shop Macy's
Cops know that you got spots and got babies
Shots poppin', your ma's loft is not tasty
Plots on the new block, hops, you can't race me
Top scholar who got props, I got 
Stop talkin', you not hot, do not wake me
If you got doo-wops, that does not make me money

Hahaha, that's beautiful!
Another Rick Rocker
If you want it, you gotta go get it
Midwest, dirty south, east and west coast, feel this, man, this history in the making
Come on

Park it, so much power, you can't stop this
Watch list, that's why I stopped jumpin' in mosh pits
Jock this, fella who sell a lotta, that's awk-wihd
Hotness, toxic, homie, how can you not get profits?
So much fetti, baby, the cops get obnoxious
Seeing my merchandise come in boxes
They hopped this status cuz me and Travis are bosses
Frostbit, the ritz, glitz, lights, it cost it
Watch, when I drop this, everybody gon' cop this
Overseas creeds of many vanilla and chocolates
Gimme pennies and twenties, skinny minis and oxes
Big women can get it, admit you hit it for knocks, trip
If you got spit, know that you can get relish
But if you sell it, just be ready when the spot hit
All the beef we got, we ain't squashed it
Cause they know we permanent currency and we got this (money!)

Yeah
I'mma dedicate this last verse
To the late, great Mac Dre, man
We're gonna keep that thizzle dance cracking for you, baby!
And sideshow every chance we get!
Rest in peace, regime life 'til I die!

Furied in Missouri; outside it, nobody knew me
Having no broccoli wasn't groovy
So I had to move to L-(scratch)-A
You got to sell away
So you can get the bills to pay
Cause everybody fails to pay
When you're not a
Rapper who got a lotta
Money or women who steady in them Guccis and Pradas
You just a lowlife maggot gettin' money from Mama
And when you broke, all you gettin' is drama
The world's piranhas if you a big fish
Because they nibble and nibble until you die
Buggin' you 'til you buy
That's why we be stressin', poppin', puffin' until we high
Hysterical cause miracles need wings to fly
My God!
You can put this off in your iPod
After you cop it, cause droppin' rockin's is my job
Look at my wallet, you got it? I keep a nice wad
Gettin' bitches 
and dissin' bitches like Ty Cobb

God forgive for my cabalism and my metabolism and my iniquitous delivery

Banefullness and evil times right back at you the deus vobiscum

The Kraken is about to be unleashed
So everybody with a soul best peep the beats
I try to be lovin' 
A part of me gotta be fucking or smoking a leaf
Thought about cummin' on your sheets with your girl, in your world
Evil tendencies in me makes me wanna turn a holesom bitch into a show girl
God told me I was sinning in the bathroom with satan masturbating but I was thinkin' about my wife and ain't no other bitch
So I'mma gonna jerk my dick until it spits
But as I analyze my little episodes of my opposite 
Turns out I wasn't worshipping god cause I was worshipping clitorises
Like this, we've lost a brotha named Zkeircrow
Cause the way I hung with his chick was sick
Now I'm off up in the rock pick watching her touch her self I like jack my dick and I wonder why my life stay raggedy niggas dream of baggin' me buckin' loads can tell you I was stupid and Dynomack was hurt when he found out that I fucked Agginy
See lust in my eyes, Jesus been alive, in my life of marriage but I don't want the demon in me taking over me and making the love we got parish the wife deserves a better nigga instead of a motherfucker that keeps a lockdown tight and held down

I wanna be alone, so I can ride
Just me and my soul, that ain't gonna dry
In the midst of a crisis, yes Nick Jones
He rang my phone, still ain't no knot in my pocket
Please stop it, thinks she knows that niggas like us don't make it in 
Niggas like us get passed up when your like one of the best nigga carlos
Situations make you wanna peel somebody see a nigga for real become naughty
So, maybe, I should jump behind the wheels and let my petit mal seizures kill somebody
Dyamund Shields, blessing soul, givin' me skrill, for every scroll
But I can't depend on he, to keep me right while keeping this daycare tight
He is not fucking up my family, but me is fucking up my family
Sittin' around broke as a joke tryin to depend on he
Sometimes when it's thundering I start wondering about my quick 
Gift that I got, is a god giving a remedeous to son of asmodeus
Exodus insanus nocturnus
Jesus can't stand us, hot burners
And you wonder why we don't like churches
Generation X stay away on purpose
I only speak for the few not you
Only for those with the beast within
That's the whole motherfucking human race straight written on your face its the S-I-N
So let me end my soliloquy, through, feelin' me

Was like a titanic you know you was inmockable
To the ""T"" you would kill several punks and you were better than, many
But it musta went to your head
Cause ever since you made it your ego what sits in the red
Sometimes I wanna put slits in your head
When you didn't come to Bryan's funeral I should've sent you to bed
You don't even come around no mo
You don't invite me to your shows
You treat me like we ain't down no mo
I bet you ain't seen your son in months
I bet your wife is miserable, and lately you ain't the one she want
Took you in and gave you shelter, made it til where they felt ya
Now I just sit home and watch you bubble like Alka Seltzer, sick
Awhile ago I wasn't concerned, you took my heart
As homie when will ya learn that you burn when you

Told you that I was leaving and to keep my girl company
Soon as I turned my back it was like humpity humpity, damn
I called you, asked if it was true and you lied
Boy I wanted to beat you black and blue til you died
Knew my lady was well proportioned
But you took it next thing you know she was having abortions
Wrote songs on how she used to stutter, stutter
I disregarded every word she uttered, brother
You stabbed me in the back you snake, better yet a worm
Took my lady homie when will ya learn that you burn when you


You're the lier, the cheater, the mistreater
Never come on the block if you stop and think why everybody is hot
Using the buiser, watch what comes outta your cooler
Cuz if I catch you slippin' off up in the streets imma do ya
I made it so people in the city knew who you was
I'm the reason why the Kansas City streets got a buzz
You was broken through the city, not a block was listenin
Picked you up when you didn't have a, pot to piss in listen
Gave you a little money, put you back on your feet
Gave you your first record, put it off in the streets
Now all I hear is you're killing me in your song beefs
So I snuck up on you in the movies
And knocked you out your seat
Til your next rhyme, there will be a next time
When you turn on somebody that helped ya get signed

I’m saying, I’m trying to holler at you
I mean, what’s good?
(I don’t know babe, I mean
You got all these girls over here
I’m not trying to be a groupie)
No, no no no no you’re not a groupie
A groupie comes for the whole group
You’re just here for me, you’re my 1zie

My 1zie, my 1zie
Know what she want, and she know where she wanna be
My 1zie, my 1zie
Girls all around me, but she’s the only one I see
Only in town for a night, my 1zie
So I know it makes you shy, my 1zie
Girl we grown, so come on
You’re nothing like a groupie, 'cause you’re my 1zie

I got a big tour bus baby won’t you come see?
Even though you know a lot of women want something from me
You don’t know me that well cause I’m hella underground like Bun-B
Such fun we could have, it'll be a blast if I could play with you like Jumanji
I’m hood and techie, that’s grungy
She’s good and preppy, Abercrombie
Pressing her would be sexy she's hailing from Montre-al
And when I say “y'all” she laughing at me sounding country
She said she don’t do the groupie thing I’m grumpy
My face looking like Ashton Kutcher just punk’d me
It haunts me when a woman’s just with me
And I don’t get none because she's feeling groupie
But you’re just with me, so you’re my 1zie

They always care about what everybody think
Don’t wanna hook up with rappers on tour with scary body ink
Missing out on a good guy, that when I kiss ya very naughty pink
But some of them be those evil B.O. people, hairy, probably stink
But I ain’t talking about you, because you’re gorgeous
And I don’t wanna hear the groupie thing, it's just me baby don’t forfeit
Just come towards this, extend me like a swordfish
Ignore chicks who say you’re a big groupie, loosen up in gorged dick
How we kiss it lightly, don’t try to fight
These feelings that you’re feeling from this Kansas City iced tea
I shouted sugar honey ice tea!
You’re just with me and not the group
So you're a 1zie, groupie slights me

My 1zie, my 1zie
Know what she want, and she know where she wanna be
My 1zie, my 1zie

Only in town for a night, my 1zie

You’re nothing like a groupie, 'cause you’re my 1zie

And this dude be true, with you I wanna do thee do
But if you really wanna do the crew, that’s cool, cause we do groupies too
I'm just saying that I wanna get it on with think and juicy you
38-24-36 and you don’t got booty dew
A groupie does the group baby, but I am one
I’m a go back to my bunk so try and come
With me and the feelings we denying none
You maybe crying some cause it feels so good
And now I leave you lying sprung
Go tell your girls you did the humpty dumpy
How you layed me down, undressed me, then you sunk me
Jumped off in it like a bungee, down under like I was Dundee
Don't say groupie baby girl you're just my 1zie

And who the fuck is Satan and why is he worthy of my praise? Never have I said ""hail Satan"" in any of my music, dawg! Maybe if I did, *beep* wouldn't have went bankrupt on us and we'd be talking Anghellic instead of Absolute Power

Heaven,Anghellic,2001.0,"You're probably wondering why I only have one song in Heaven. Well, I don't have a lot of Heaven in my life. 
And the reason why I chose this song is because I was blessed to have my good friend Roger Troutman on this song before he passed.

What up, Mitch? Is it an everyday thing for you to act just like a bitch?
How does it feel to have a nigga that will kill you for the foul shit you bitch?
Number one snitch, a bitch with a dick, I found the remedy for the enemy
(What?)
Bust at the nigga like shootin' at the Kennedys
Cause Mitch Bade ain't really no friend of me!

Tech N9ne

To be exact, he's that nigga that talk, but he really can't back
That shit that he talk so he gotta walk around with a gat

I'll knock him out with the force of a hurricane
The penalty for the path if you disrespect the game

Now what goes on inside the mind of a nigga like this?
The nigga pissed, 'cause I pumped off four rounds up in the trick he was with
But it ain't my fault you a little ole' bitch
Without yo clique
Nigga, run with a quickness
Get away quick, but you bet' not slip
Better off with a Bianca then be stuck
Put an AK-47 on your lip
Why?
Even if I'm lifted I can scope 'em from a mile away
Niggas fakin' like anticipating the doomsday
Camouflagin' but I can see you actin' like a bitch
Which are the symptoms of a nigga named Mitch!

Late night I got a page from Bianca
She told me her man was trippin', so swoop her 'bout a block up
So I-uhm, got prepared, my conscience told me grab the gat
But all I could think about, was hittin' that kitty kat from the back
All about that hustle, but tonight I gots to kick it
Deep conversation, but it's her first time lettin' a nigga hit
But I'm not alone, It seems this nigga was on the phone
He heard the spot, the topic, wicked, wicked, now it's on!
As I continue (continue) creepin' (creepin') it's apparent
That I'm dealin' with a Mitch Bade, I guess that's why he keeps on starin'
But I'm well equipped to handle a fleet, so nigga don't think I'm sleep
We can talk like men or we can get grim, and handle this shit n'the streets
Don't ever trust no cock

Went to the park with major loot
Dippin' up on bitches, but the jealous Mitch is ready to shoot, peep
But it ain't complete, the day is foul without a big butt and smile
I need a chick that's running wet like Fury of the Nile
Bumped into, stepped into, this chick that's thick and photogenic
In a minute, I'ma get up in it, with a jimmy to avoid that AIDS epidemic
Get it, got it, good in the hood, shit's all good nigga, so I knocked on wood
Got to her crib, drank some Crown, laid me down, showed me the goods
Then, knock knock, ""Who's that?""
She said her man and he might be strapped with a gat
Put back on my shit, time to show this fool just where it's at
Ret to get wet, she opened it up enough so I can see
She cracked it a bit, but that nigga pushed her, then came after me
Extended arm, and bodily harm
He should have pulled the trigga, chiggas

Aww yeah?
I feel you JP
Let's go

Been at the bottom, but then I got them up into this ring
I beat them up because I never been an average
A flick and a swallow and Tecca Nina get up in this thing
Without a flaw, you're gonna wonder what the matter is
I'm packing my bag with C4
I'mma harass, I'mma blast the people
Tryna bury my class in the grass and dig mo'
Said I'mma be last to be bad, to see dough
But I gas the weak flow
The people who bash the freak show, gonna gag when he (GO!)
Mad 'cause he (PRO!)
I need the natural that'll have release, so as soon as the weed grow, just pass the leaf (YO!)
(I thought it was love)
After all my angel blood that they drew
(I thought it was love)
But I won't come quick and seen it wasn't true
I've got my liquorana,  my marijuana, her great punan in my cheeks
Laughing at everybody who dissed the Nina and treated me like a fucking disease

You pull your gun and never put no fear in us
'Cause we've been done no worse, no one was hearing us
Are we gonna dust if off and drop a tyran, just
Push the pain, we claimed insane and banged it 'til it was clear enough

Now the people wanna get involved, 'cause I'm a killer and I meant it when I said it
And never really read the hidden clause that I'mma bill it when I spit it, I'mma shred it
Never be nothing that's gonna keep me down
I get to busting, I'm gonna heat this ground
I'm thinking back in the day, when I spit with the best in the business, they was jealous, so want to beat me down
Everybody know it's hard to shine in the gutter
But I got up and pushed the line, 'cause I'm a thugger
Was a second away from going under
Room for bum to boy wonder
Passed the days when they threw the shade
They all looked amazed, 'cause I brung the thunder

Yeah, hell yeah, yeah
Are you hopelessly alone, when they catch you in the dark?
You know we hardly shine in the gutter
You're hopelessly alone and now they drag you down
You know we hardly shine in the gutter

Blue Streak,Celcius,2002," (8X)
Got my back, got my back
Got my back against the wall
(Blue streak)

Untamed, I run with a game no time for the fame
I proclaim my name with a shame
It's insane my brain full of pain
Such strange in the game to maintain
My juice but I came with no shame
Hella riches I ain't the game, it's in my veins
I changed from cotton to rugging to raise stay bane
My frame, we give them samhain
Check on their change, situation crazy deranged
Anything goes my life chose was money and women
I had no intentions of gettin' froze
Blows hearts hits to the nose
Use to be like my bros but those foes
Got me behind doors case closed
Three in the row doing it to get back on my toes
Yo, this once gotta go no amateur but a pro
Lettin' you know I'm back and I'm after the dough
Devil with pedal to the floor, gotta get it
 (2X)
Drive through streets (Gotta get it)
Time to eat (Gotta get it)
Pride you're thief (Gotta get it)
Find blue streak (Gotta get it)

Can't trust, no one better bust, everybody's corrupted
For a buck, I get 'em stuck runnin' mugs, so I'mma duck
Undercover and bug anybody who touches any business I can duck
No fool for the mugs, no Chris style for the guts
No ice for the sluts plus
No souls for Satan to suck I clutch a nut
To live plus rocks and suchs
In a rug right after retrieving 'em though luck
Killer generation is my breed
Now I am involved in a high speed
Hard rock double-M Sci-Fi
If any have the halfs of the pie leaves
Thieves fraudecio p's black hearts full of greed
Who need D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S converted to cheese
Lord help me please Jeez 'em me lease
Lost 'em and never failed in the seas
 (2X)
No scratches, no stacks, no kickback
No hit in the back of the Escalade Cadillac
Straight darkness tryin' to find where my shadows at
If I found in deep in the bitch I can paddle back
Undercover blown my riches all gone
Identity prone to look up and break in your home with a chrome
Own one, everybody loves my tone gun done
No more lethal killers to run from
Thieves converted to something you won't believe
Never greave homie handed over the blue streak
With ease no more crime or law when I'm dyin'
No more swine or i'll be in solitary convine
Leave any place like the Floridan keys
With a breeze where you can do no shoes and short sleeves
But I bring my ladies and G-strings blue skies
Watching the blue streak glisten in my eyes

Drive through streets
Time to eat
Pride you're thief
Find blue streak

Mind of a Killer,The Worst,2000.0,"We've got thirty-five or more people out there now killing 20 and 30 people each
Like if I had a Thirty-Eight right now, I could make you do just about anything I wanted to. Just about all my life people have been doing that to me
Yes, but if they kill without conscious, how can they be treated?
How can we recognize them before it happens again?
I think we're all expecting these killers to be frothing-at-the-mouth-maniacs
The scary thing is that seemingly normal people commit these crimes they can act like anyone - your friend, a teacher, a guy next door
I just think we live in such a violent society, I just think we live in such a violent society, I just think we live in such a violent society
Seemed like a regular kind of guy, you know, normal, kind of quiet, but uh pretty smart, h-he just didn't seem like the kinda of guy that would kill anyone you know? I mean it doesn't make any sense
They don't think that you're worth anything, you're in their way

Yo, we're partners against substances baby, like this

I was was hanging around my 5 7 block off Highland
Skies heaven hot and vibing
Off of T-Will, and a couple of fly brotherin off and rhymin
I spit the wickedest, then I scat with the quickness
Flip it the way I rip it's ridiculous man
I brought the pain
Then im out loud cuz I dated baby like harry on the way
I met a chick named Mary, baby doll was very
Persuasive with the way she spoke
She said some things I couldn't believe she nearly made me choke
She said she'd take me to a higher heightened life
I said id rather be grounded
She said that she'd complete me
But I said I was well rounded
She said I never had a friend like her
Take away the pain
Friend like her
Give me hella fame
When I said never baby doll was astounded
I already know yo game
To drive me to insane
Make me spend all my change
Then try taken away my brain
Baby girl had light green eyes and a hardcore frame
She said her name was Mary, but her last name's Jane, I'll pass

Why these niggas tryin to step to me
All I wanna do is rock the M-I-C
I guess they wanna see me in misery
Never do it cuz it's R.I.P

Me and skritch scratch outta Don Juan's puttin down hits (yes, yes)
Til a chick came in with a tight all white fit (yes, yes)
She said that once we kicked it with her we would never quit we go loco
We bow fast, What's yo name? she said Coco
She said she's currently staying down in Chouteu
And hides and various houses just to avoid the po po, Coco's a no no
This girl I'll have you spending mo doe
And never ever date a woman with a set of a horns and a pointed tail as a logo
Now Im trippin cuz she said if I really wanna drop bombs
Meet her homie Rock Mon
He stays in Oakland
Raised in Roxens and he'll keep you hype
Im thinkin I will, Im thinkin I might
She's thinking yes, Im thinking more like triple sike
I already know yo game
To drive me to insane
Make me spend all my changw
Then try taken away my brain
Baby girl was a light light bright
And I couldn't explain
Why everybody called her Coco cuz her last name's Cain, I'll pass

Why these niggas tryin to step to me
All I wanna do is rock the M-I-C
I guess they wanna see me in misery
Never do it cuz it's R.I.P
Why these niggas tryin to step to me
All I wanna do is rock the M-I-C
I guess they wanna see me in misery
Never do it cuz it's R.I.P

Can I ask you a question?
Have you ever had a homie who was high strung
There's a lot of negativity where I come from
Told the homie to never drink and smoke when drivin' my homie disobeyed, disobeyed
Yo, all I wanna do is get to the studio
Im bumpin it to the weirdest chicks they wantin Poppy Chulo
A block away I bumped into another
She said she wanted to take me on a date
And within the night, become my lover
She's lookin at me like a pirahna
Let loose with me in a sauna
Her title was somethin crazy like ghuana hanna bonana
She said she'd flow like liquid
And wanted to go with me
But she told me to call a GHB, I'll pass baby

Hey yo, what's up? This is Don Juan
Anybody ask you to do drugs, tell em I'll pass

Hej ti, ustani i donesi svoj mali mikrofon
Vidiš, ovde je džek, priključi ga na mikrofon
I evo ti papir i olovka, jer ću da te inspirišem
Zagušljivi cepači, lovimo neprijatelje po nebu
Ajde da krenemo, da vidimo ko će da pobedi

Počeli smo u srednjem delu istoka
Sada ćemo da odemo
Preko celog sveta, cine
Da, ovo je vrhunac
Da, Tek Najn

Prati me, preko cele planete, vodim skalu bolesti
Koju nikad nisu provalili, štetimo bez izvinjenja
Smanjiti im paniku, to je manijakalno ali ja moram da budem
Mahnit, ja ću da improvizujem jer sam čudan
Dograbim numeru kao da jedem kod Mama Nakas
Mogu da te sjebem kako treba jer sam partner sa Vaka Flokom
Dajte mi vrh hip-hopa i vidite kako ih teram da rokaju
Kada se zaustavlja šou, aktivira se čakra (Svetski Cepači)
Ako si iko i išta, primetićeš
Tek je na vrhu, i niko identičan nije
Loaded cold as the polar get wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and I’ma chop, he came and he went tomorrow
But I’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up, I be the ish when I split em up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing I be acting up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keeping the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss, fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standing up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

Ja sam svetlosne godine udaljen od mojih vršnjaka
Oćeš malo, dodji vamo
Nemoš' me sjebat, il' ić' oko mene
Pokloni se, krunisali su me kad su me pronašli
(K.C.)
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developing
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but loving every second of this
(Denmark)
De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det beatet jeg vækker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild ""Fucking Chopper""
(Alabama)
What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning, that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peeling pecans
But instead, I'm peeling rappers' heads, making a sand-a-wich
Pick up a 22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fucking beat
And I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne
Twist up the pine and
Smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes
Well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
Wit' an alien probe

Twista (Chicago)
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'mma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly, able to give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
Hopping, I don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwing it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up, should've stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'mma be shining on them haters
I'm finna be using it as energy, watch how radiant I'mma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

(New York)
See, now they ask when I'mma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and when I'ma drop it my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'mma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “what in the world is you proving
When you were already the best” and “what the hell is he doing”
Well, I'ma be chopping and cutting and breaking and beating and shaking
And fucking everything up 'til there ain't no further mistaking
And busting everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shutting everything up, especially the ones who be hating
They loving everything until I got 'em stuttering-stupid
You hear 'em now?
“D-d-d-d-don’t do-do-do-do it
P-P-P-Please
Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest”
And now I'mma come and kill 'em, get them, hit them, and finish them
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat it coming to killing 'em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Thinking “they gotta be feeling him”
Spitting lithium, see the way a nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid to the point where there's no forgiving him
Hoping you're listening and you're paying attention
And you're witnessing the way that I be crushing the mic
And getting in the zone, I be flattening and packing in
People from the front to the back and
They got me acting a fool, I'm Black and
Nigga now I’m home

(Kansas City)
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
I’m choppin' ‘em, call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killing 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any, in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical
(California)
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend em and send em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling 'em with that fury
Get up and hurry, you can feel the Real me
Coming in with that shit, I'm having a fit, and you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And popping often hitting ‘em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathing, you’re fiending
And dreaming to find a demon, name insane, I’m a worldwide (Chopper)",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-worldwide-choppers-serbian-translation-lyrics

World Gone Crazy,Strictly Strange Tour 08,2008,"Turn on the tele every thing so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80's
What's the meaning when your hear an old lady?
Drowns her baby see the world's gone crazy
Walkin' amongst insane terrorists, everybodys a demon so then came your therapist
Know that your therapists are also aware of this state of emergency is lookin' burgandy even your sherriff is
Scared of his neighbor mabye because people are goin' crazy, sick mothers drowning their babies
And why they have to make it where aids be, from here to zambia, and why I got the same last name as andrea
Niggas snipin' shootin' rifles for fun ,niggas fighting grip the knife and live the life by the gun
Most of us are livin' life on the run, sittin back gettin fat waitin for whats in the bible to come
Steady high speed chases, I see racists often inside their sci-fi dream matrix
You might see la-la land but I see hatred, killings and talibans with ??? faces

Turn on the tele every things so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80s
What's the meaning when your heari an old lady?
Drowns her baby see the world's gone crazay
(In your High School)
There's shooting where's the shelter?
(What can I do?)
Modern day Helter-Skelter
(In your residence)
My neighboors taking from me
(Mr. President)
This world's so money hungry
Something ain't' stirring the kool-aid man
Look at the sickness and evil that you made man
Gotta stay creepin' through my city because everybody dieing
Hard ta trust niggas with me because everybody blind
The sign of the time it would be fine to have weapons designed
For half-steppin' in crime, have seconds to shine before they shut it down on us
Some'll clown on us, seems to be a frown on us
My niggas fighting even the sports future lookin' hazy
Gettin money like men but acting like babies
My people lookin' at me shady
Yo somebody fiddlin' with the chicken and watermelon cuz niggas goin crazy

Turn on the tele every things so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80s
What's the meaning when your hear an old lady?
Drowns her baby see the world's gone crazay

Theres shooting where's the shelter?
(What can I do?)
Modern day Helter-Skelter
(In your residence)
My neighboors taking from me
(Mr. President)
This world's so money hungry
Let it be known that theese young men are dying for money
And their family and friends mornings are no longer sunny
Blood shed to the twentieth power they promise you no blood shed, but plenty in showers
We live by an eye for an eye, that's mans death motto
If man is gonna lead us right, then man less follow
And lead us right into war, but damn that's hollow
But the average kid all they know, is Grand Theft Auto
And no matter where you go in the city streets, it's a game
When I'm off in the demons pit I feel the heat for the pain
And the world is a crazy place, and everyone is insane
Why else would they want to simulate JFK's death in a game?

Turn on the tele every thing so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80s

All I Want,Celcius,2002,"You want me cause my shit's together
And the fact I'm clever got honeys wanting to do whatever
Like sit on my face
When you're down, I'm known to keep your head up
You love that I'm rogueish and throw your legs up

You love that I keep my composure, when he holds ya
When he pulls you closer, you and me exchanging winks over his shoulder
He's supposed to know ya, bet he never told ya about the indecent exposure

Tech is vulgur, 

 sex rollercoaster
68, and got you yelling about the 1 I oad ya
Got your man  foreclosure
 blow ya

All I want is to share my life with you
All I need is to know your love is true
 have you by my side
For the rest of my life

Jealous  better stay cool
 I swipe your lady and break through
Eh dude, you don't wanna make the Techa N9na get the spray tools
Stick with your junky hookers, wake up everyday with 
Like the way your g string lets me see things
Feasting on a  thing, nothing but a cheat thing
Wing ding swings 
Creeping kings we bring free flings
 sexual healing
Touching the ceeling, don't need rings
Shows that she's a horney human being
But weaking to the freaking, down for the teaching
Why can't we be seen?

Might try to resort to murder and street sweeping
If you think you're cheating

 your homies we bing


So you wouldn't  bea stings
When you get it it's reaching
You love me cause no weaklings I'm  Pimp brings

All I want is to share my life with you
All I need is to know your love is true
 have you by my side
For the rest of my life

Back in the day they used to play me crookid, act funny
But now what, I got money, I got money
I be looking for purity, niggas with jewelry
All y'all be wanting 
Somebody that's moving up in this life, elevation
Somebody to rub your feat when you eat, reservations
You trying to keep away from us brothers, facing alagations
Probation, elimanations,  perminat vacation
Demenstration, if you was in a situation
With 2 homies, 1 was black and the other was caucasian
And if that caucasian had a bitch you thought was amazing
And a brother didn't have registration
The caucasion would get all your consintration
Descrimanation, I'm knowing money's the justifacation
For you chasing, a baller who ain't ever tripping off inflation
You want me cause I'm the x generation
Breaking the station, got you wanting inpregnation
But I believe in  baby

All I want is to share my life with you
All I need is to know your love is true
 have you by my side
For the rest of my life

Please don't ever leave me loanly
Cause darling you're my one and only
 to live without your love
It's only you I'm thinking of
It doesn't matter where you're going
Just to be content in knowing
Your love is right here by my side till the end of time",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-all-i-want-lyrics
Ready for the Meat Wagon,50 Mc’s,UnKnown,"Look in my eye, I wonder why these buster niggas asking to die

I give a fuck about who, now see somebody here got me fucked up
Shit, out of luck, my painters will blow your block up, what up
I'll put a foot to that ass, give you a 40 colt it
Cuz these bastards out here ain't knowing
Wait I'll stop, I'm looking fly to the T R E B L O C
Fucking shit up, it's an everyday pleasure to me
So what nigga, don't you love the smell of dead flesh in the morning
Nigga got you yawning, your fingertips just can fall on the grill burning
Ripping thugs ass, rip em apart as I blast, your ass won't last
I give a fuck what you have, snatching head from neck
Seasoned, I'm why they in the puzzle
Get that bombay ready, cuz we gon cook em in some Frisco
Thou know, don't be playing, and we ain't lacking, we sizzle
I'm a beast, I wear that motherfucking midwest
Thou know, thou know
Trebloc in this bitch

 can't be measured with eyes
So why not get on the grind, if you got that drive
Sex, money, and lives, that's why these niggas die
And if you got the nerve to ask me why I'm high
And my reply, this ghetto got me crazy, I got these bitches tryna 
Cuz I'm grown to hit the pussy, then I'm ghost like swazey
Faze me never, I'm too suave, I'm too clever
So I advise you and your crew to take precautionary measures
See I'm a player in the game, but ain't no need for you to hate
Cuz if your bitch come my way, she wasn't yours anyway
'Sway the game goes, Ever heard of 
Seems these niggas don't know, So I'm afraid Imma have to show
How these motherfuckers do it up in the midwest
Never settle for less, and don't forget your best
Everyday's a new test, nigga watch your step
Cuz real killers give a fuck about a rep, quietest kid

Or should I say are you ready for the meat wagon?
Toe tagged and body bagged in another session
Smashing, I started blasting
Look in my eye, I wonder why these buster niggas asking to die

You was like my brother nigga, like no other nigga
But you treated me like another nigga, fuck a nigga
Zkeircrow, pussy-whipped Kansas nigga with the square flow
There's no way you can ever come back, falsely accusing
I can't believe that he done that, got em yelling ""Tech, put the gun back!""
Paid you money I didn't have, in the past what a blast we had
Played with packed shows lighting black holes under nigga's toes
But I'm offended, cuz I found out hatred and hurt was intended
Didn't think that I'd get played, mad cuz I didn't let you on ""Mitch Bade""
How the fuck I'm gon let Mitch Bade do ""Mitch Bade"" with me
Nigga, no rhythm having motherfucker, switching on the stage with me, nigga
Your bitch came and told me you gave her a disease that wasn't curable
Thought I wanted to fuck your bitch nigga my dick's into staying durable
On the power of my dead niggas, with the magnets of MJ
All the anger of Cosby, for what they did to his son on the freeway
I'm gonna be driving the wagon, when you slippin
But disrespecting love when you step foot back in K.C. I'm tripping
What's up?

I took chances, advances, towards the dark side
Swallowed my pride and got ready to make this ride
West is where I'm headed, my destinations out of bounds
Off a stick solo trip, but I'm back by several rounds
Mix it and push it down
Clown, a few more till whip these niggas
Help stole a bird, 30 G's, some more goldys
And now my
Mission is to bring the heat, and leave them  thieves
Existence in the form of a plasma stain
And the street bangers sweet
And I got something for your brave and 
My presence's preceded by the black
 spoiled milk, dried is gone and burnt up weed
Waylo's the block that I'm screaming, harmonizing with demons
Beat's hypnotizing, bet you will lies in puddles of blood
Slugs getting dumped off in them food, cuz ain't no love
Plugs of meat getting ripped off them bones, calves and domes
Innocent bystanders getting murdered in their homes
Work until I got it, revere his method, plot it
Something psychotic, futuristicly robotic
Turn up the nation, Toe tagged and body bagged in another session
Smashing, I started blasting round the meat wagon

Yo, Yo, Hey...
Get your tiny violins out
I'ma tell ya what the past ten years been 'bout
It's about sacrifice
Partner, rap's my vice
And it's lookin' like I'm get my reward in my afterlife
Cause down here it's crazy, baby
Gotta deal with a lot of ""If, And's, and Maybe's"", baby
Tryna make it to where I can take care of my babies' babies
Losin' nearly everybody I love, It kinda made me shady
I put, Hella Time in this, tryna shine and shit
Now that I'm prosperin', a sick and lonely N9ne, I sit
I'm consumed with this life and the grit
It's my world
But in turn I lost my Wife, My Bitch, and My Girl
And I lost time with my children
If you see me smilin', no, it's a real one
It's a real one
Cause we done came along way from Simply Sicilian
To my own buildin'
I sacrificed to make a million for my children...

I've been away for three months
Patience wearin' real thin
Been Richter for twelve years
Sometimes just wanna be Tim
Sometimes just wanna be Chris's older brother
Have a regular life, with a wife, who's an expected mother
But as fate would have it, I started rappin'
So that regular life with the wife just ain't happenin'
At least not for now, but I still hope one day
The sacrifices I made will be handsomely repaid...

One the road, doin' shows, yea
I miss my girl
I can't wait to get home, yea
She knows she rocks my world
Put it down for the fam, man
Fam for life, D-F-L
Together forever, We sacrifice
Yea, baby, baby, give it to me raw
Let me give it to you
Like you give it to me
Put it down for ya man
Lemme put it down for you
The sex is so good
I can't wait to fuck you...

Over and over
Over and over and over...

In a warzone, walkin' on a strange land
God damn, I feel so far from home
Every night I spit my life into a microphone
It's what I do, I wouldn't change it for the world
But sometimes, I swear to god I miss my wife and girl
So bad, I think about the other side
A nine to five to survive, just to stay alive
Fuck that! I been there, done that!
No turnin' back, cause we stackin' money into stacks
I used to run with some rough-neck, punk-rockers
With a death wish, pop ya like a pop-locker
Most of them are either dead or behind bars
I got sick of loading friends into funeral cars
So everynight, when my two feet land on stage
I thank God that I live to see another day...

Tech N9ne!
Empire!
You gotta get 'em Tech, it's my shit yo!
Go!

Tecca Nina's full of malice, I've taken enough
Fuck you faggots with a balance, I'm shaking him up
Knocking you down, I'm pounding and waking you up
Fear what I do, hear what I do
Nigga when I drop you I'm breaking you up
Everybody wanna label me, call me insane
'Cause a nigga put a difference into the game
Call me crazy with a k and you can call me bane
Hey motherfucker, you motherfucker
Don't you hate 'cause I'm increasing the range
Music ain't got that oomph and I'm bringing it back
Fucking you with that funk and about make you attack
Hitting niggas with the bomb and put you in yo sack
Irritable, formidable shit is what I got, is what you lack
Empire with a beautiful title for us
Strange Music, we fucking motherfuckers up
All you pussies I'm blatantly calling you bluff
Flow with me, yo shit ain't rugged enough
It gets rough! (I came to bring the pain)
It gets rough! (You fools, you've seen the same)
It gets rough! (You have no green to gain)
It gets rough your stuff, it ain't tough enough, this is rough!
It gets rough! (I came to bring the pain)

Nasty Girl,Celcius,2002.0,"Tonight, living in a fantasy, my own little nasty world
Tonight, make you wanna come with me, do you think that I'm a nasty girl?

So many nights I'm alone, need something to bone
It's Saturday too, I know something goin on
I roll to the spot, with the dimes and broads lay
Got flagged down  by this bitch Minajay
Pushin the Honday, XL
She tells me when she saw me rockin the show on TL
How she know me so well?
We decided to run
Right back to the nest
Get drunk, get high
Minajay said, she had a friend named Twoi
Put 'm together, and it was oo la la
Shit don't stop
Draws drop slow
We made off, so what a life, Pacasso
Fuck until the sun came up
Then I'm on another mission to get it, no attachments, no hang ups
When I swept that hoe, when I get that hoe
Just hit it once more, then I let that go

Tonight, living in a fantasy, my own little nasty world
Tonight, make you wanna come with me, do you think that I'm a nasty girl?

Nasty girls come with us
I know it's hard for you to trust
Nuts I wanna bust
Dreams about us
Lovin it when we doin it
We boning all night
Thinkin I'm never stoppin, you moanin all night
I'm Geed up, so cold, freeze up
So eas up, eat the dick, I ain't afraid to get eaten up
It's all about the satisfaction
You came and I'm gone
Your reaction, physical attraction
We came together like maggets
You had it, you look, then you grab it
I took it, then I stab it
Kick it, baby, won't you lick it?
Ride it, don't you quit it
Hit it, let me get it
From behind, don't be shy
We makin tripple love, I know you wanna, I can see it in your eyes
I reply
I say goodbye
I know you been it before this, I had to come with it
It's on

Tonight, living in a fantasy, my own little nasty world
Tonight, make you wanna come with me, do you think that I'm a nasty girl?

She loves fuckin
I do too, so we a perfect match
Plus she heard that I'm that nigga
Holdin all this cash
The type of bitch that makes me peak is the one
The one that can make me weak when I cum
Damb, now go get a nigga some new Wiskey
Fucked all my dogs, she's convincing
She love to be around the studio clique
Fuck it, turned her ass into a studio bitch
Suck it
Recording lyrics with the red on
Cause the bitch is incredible, making me drop headphones
Honey loves swag money, she on
Grab ahold of a nigga
Lay on the bed, grab my shoulders, put your legs on
Fuck a nigga just for the ice
Time for daddy's little girl to pay the price
You all grown
And well known as the queen of the sluts
So just keep doing your job, while we lay in the cut

Tonight, living in a fantasy, my own little nasty world
Tonight, make you wanna come with me, do you think that I'm a nasty girl?

Hold up, hoes up
Everywhere we go or posted and roll up
More at the aftershows, we get blow trippin off dope
Taken off draws, lickin balls, and ain't nobody gotta know
I was chillin with this bitch named Dr. Wik
At the crib, tryna show me how hard the cock can get
Push me down and pulled my draws down
To my ankels, bit my nipples, to her belly, now I'm all up in her jaws now
She was lickin, I was squermin
Tung like a wet werm, fast approaching my ass
She looked and said ""you know like, you better say that shit""
And I replyed ""I'm Tech a N9na, I don't play that shit""
No rubber, we started fuckin up and down, it was rough
Doggy style and this bitch was saying I couldn't give her enough
In the shower for about an hour, she suckin my dick
When I came, she told me ""yeah, I'm a nasty bitch""
Bitch!

Tonight, living in a fantasy, my own little nasty world
Tonight, make you wanna come with me, do you think that I'm a nasty girl?",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-nasty-girl-lyrics

Get your shoes on!
Get Ready!

Lights, camera, action, that just happened to ya
Defeat we ridin' the glory ride like hallelujah

The spirit of Jim Brown
Get the hand off in a standoff, I'm running through ya
Get in way of fittin' Jim Crow got us sittin'
In the nosebleeds, what you gettin'
Knock of the winnin'
Philosophy been velocity for the brother man
The story ends with catastrophe for the other man

Your weather fence bein' small
Talk just offends me, we all
Come from the motherland
But if you tempt me to fall
I'm OJ Simpson'in' y'all
Meaning I'm taking a ball
Straight through the Middlelands
Get the pedal and throttle, I strive to remember the Titan
Not a thing, achievin' my dreams, pushin' and fightin'

Shut up your cleats, vibe to the beat and put your shoes on

Yo, extraterrestrial, I come from the air up there

Before the clocks over, you crossed over and flaked out
They sayin' he got game us, he must be lovin' basketball
Well maybe it's the spirit of Jesse Owens, I'm passin' y'all
Shakin', bacon, fakin', you players out?
What can you say about?
Black athletes'll never be playin' out
See I'm at peace with the Rock
Your feet gonna stop
When I unleash just a piece
The Caesar is stopped
Blocked by my blockas
Running-back to get my back up
Huntin' for your quarterback inside of slackin' slacks up
The worst on the Earth, and I'm all up on your turf and
Screamin' ""Touchdown"", whole team get to skurfin'
Two steps ahead of ya

Choking from It,Seepage,2010.0,"(Anger)

I'm here because last year, my mom almost died from pancreatitis. When she was 18, epilepsy hit... you know. Couple years ago, whenever that after she had epilepsy all her life, 
taking Dilantin, taking different types of medicine,
 and out of a psychiatric ward, --you know what I mean?--lupus hit her, you know? So my question... to God was, ""this is the lady that taught me how to love... this is the lady that taught me. Taught me how to care, you know what I'm sayin'. 
Yet she's been tortured all her life.""
 And... uh, 
I'm asking God like, ""Why did it have to be mine, you know?"" That's all it turned into",https://genius.com/Tech-n9ne-choking-from-it-lyrics

This real shit right here

See that bitch
She makes me rich, she sucks my dick
She fucks my clique, she loves that shit

Walk with limps, blast those simp niggas
And pull metal triggers
The grave digger on the night shift

Gotta be a tight bitch
When I'm hitting ain't no bullshittin'
She's lookin' to get me back hard after I'm through stickin'
I hit the spot, I serve my rocks, I got my Glock
In case the shit gets hot
You gotta be shot the fuck down
In Kansas City, you clown
Nigga, all damn day we hustle, nigga where's my pay?
A young soldier gettin' older, more bolder
I got nuts and don't give a fuck, so try your luck
With Don Juan Corleone
Blast the muthafucks quick
Tryna play me phony

You wonder why we got more bitches than a petstore?
'Cause we some million mad motherfuckers with checks, ho
You wanna fuck me and my villains, Bianca let's go
The Tech flow be at yo  with sex and XO

How they can start to sink in my dick so they start to think
And look at this

You no liking the way that I call ya, forgot me and my niggas 
Great thing I have clothes to ya
Up in those hookers with uppers that hold soul for ya
Met a bitch named Gloria
MTV watchin' love story-a
Lovin' even more when I hit it in the back of a daddy crown Victoria
Ho flow for novus ordo
For your ho so she can lick me from my toes to my torso
Grips four dicks like the bitch name's Goro
Rode her like Zorro with the strength of Kevin Sorbo, bitch

Making cheese, gettin' skis, make 'em drop to they knees

More bounce, one more ounce of some dope shit

Couldn't cope with a fat dick
Rude boys from Highland, triple life, I rock it
Hit the set and start the motherfuckin' violence
Make sure y'all niggas know

If you really really want it give me back love, suck it
Love the way you let me hit that, 
What? You want your shit packed?
Bitch, give me my dick back
Shit, you nasty
Let the shit pack and pass me
But I like my dominatrix to tie me up and fourty lash me
But as far as it goes, fuck you hard to get hoes
Put my brain up on a record, now I start to get foes
Now I close and packs enormous gonads

Turn that off, that's turnin' me on

Yo, I'm the boy your mama told ya don't go out with
Out for your goodies, I get 'em then get out quick
Occasionally have to come over to help me count this
But mostly you live with losers that ain't about shit
He's the kinda cat that'll get his whole posse swept
I'm the type that I'll never tell where the guap be kept
He probably go out the way that Versace left
I make you open your mouth like a Hibachi chef
I'm why you sittin' with them thinkin' 'bout how to split
You know that I got it when your homie is out of it
You know my place is comfortable, and I'll make you shout a bit
Then hit the plaza, fuck a worst demeanor in Halibut
I see you watchin' from afar, mama
And even though I know most of you women are drama
I'm 'bout to get you off in the back of my car, I'ma
Fill her from the inner then I send her back with no scars on her

What can I do to get your attention?
I'm tryna move to get your attention
What can I do to get your attention?
Making it hard to get your attention
What can I do to get your attention?
Tryna get you to pay some attention
What can I say to get your attention?
Tryna move my body in your direction

Kali!
'Cause if she suck my maybe baby, I can get my holders on
And if you flash me a little ass, then I know it's on
And cash be the reason that you pass me your skirt
But the skirt that you lookin' for to rotate your Earth
And I'm the god, your body's babysitter, I'm in charge
And I'm lookin' at you hard, your backyard so large
Now you got my attention, uh, at-attention
If niggas makin' it rain, lookin' like I'm paintin' your picture
'Cause your lip gloss is poppin', stop baby I can
Take you to places you never been shoppin'
It's crumbs to me, I make your life as easy as it comes to me
Come be my only o in these
Definitely make it effortlessly if you steppin' with me
If I say your body's bangin', hold it against me
Now we leavin' out the back door
She sayin' ""What you stop for?""
I been attentive to the wrong chick
Shit I want that ho (alright then)

What can I do to get your attention?
Tryna get you to pay some attention
What can I say to get your attention?
Tryna move my body in your direction

I'm the reason why he won't bring you to the studio
He know if you see me, your eyes'll bulg' open like Coolio
He know if I get you alone, it'll be a nudie show
Then he question you, wonder why you give it to me for?
You wanna be with me, 'cause homie won't touch ya
Like you wanna be touched, the strength he can't muster
Yeah he a buster, and lookin' like a sucker
'Cause Tech, Calhoun and even Lumberg fucked her
Got your girl givin' Tecca N9na the O face
Got her buckin' naked in front of me: a showcase
You don't like him because he do it at a slow pace
Crying 'bout how you got mo' space like a hoecake
You want me, 'cause I'm not a loser, I'm supposed to win
Make you wanna drop to your knees and get close to him

It puts the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again

You can't get the party started without that!
Let's do it!

You want me to jam I'm finna enter
Brain waves came from insane days

Criminally finna be some shit

Got the whole planet rockin' off the low blows dammit
I show flows and poke hoes that's 'posed to be yo's
Seein' my haters in a dark alley tormented by mind

Now here's the message
Liberate me, Chocolatate'
Take 'em and rock now play
Do the fuck what I say
Throw ya souls in the air like this
Flash ya bar codes while I stick 'em
With another hit up out of the abyss
The Tech N9ne Nina out to find vaginas
Just the playa clubbin' it, rubbin' it
Lovin' that crema streama, might seem a little extreme
My thing when I flips I gots to make sho' that it's hot
And make the whole planet rock like this

See that ass hop, watch that ass hop
All the fellas like to see you make the planet rock

Hahaha you played too much ass for me baby
Slow it down right here

There's a bianc up in my sector, can I bone it?
'Cause all we want to do is get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts, and fuck hoes
We quick to beat a buster down bad
MidWestSide put me in the sound lab
Now I'm (*demonic noises*)
I flip it backwards for you flow snatchers
Blast y'all in the ass, Nina playin' fast ball
Crash all glass jaws
Mad y'all 'cause last call I was in the back of the club
Bangin' the hell outta this bad broad
On my planet we take no haters for granted
They Kris Kross (10 seconds 'til lift off)
Be soaked in pistol grip sauce, ripped off
The technique's complete heat
Retreat 6 feet under 6 feet
Unique speaks, freaks tweek
Never let the BCs can it

A party with the bitches on my planet lookin' crispy
Swiftly makin' rappers do 360s (Never knew three 6s)
Other niggas tryna diss me be (Under these prefixes)
Non ill mal-functional (N9ne!) Rambunctional
Never let up on a heated mic 'til I'm comfortable, Rogue style
57th-56th Street Gang, grips we gain
Anybody wanna trips we bang
Hit us with a what? Lyrical head splitter
Makin' hella hoes get a nut
Make 'em put the rolls in they butt
Let a ho be a slut
Negaro never give a fuck
""Why the attitude? Nina ross you got the sauce""
Nigga, I'm mad 'cause the Chiefs lost, I'm pissed off
In Kansas City, I'm straight from the abyss, Tech N9ne!
I got the planet rockin' with me
Whole planet rockin' like this

Aw yeah, You know it
Caribou Lou?

*Laughs*

4 days straight chillin with some bitches
On the way to Cali, tryna maintain our music and riches
Ludicrous amounts is what counts
Make her switch to the other side
Get 'm all out they clothes, can I
Go in-side?
Lets take a ride where they're sure to get wet
Rubbers and KY my, my, my
Tell them N9ne now what you expect?
My nigga Tech, see some hoes, nigga
Who's that trick?

Ay yo My nigga Don Juan

Wassup?

I want-that-bitch
Titty club body-havin just the opposite of a housewife naggin'
Cool attitude, then jump in the pool, calm with the dick grabbing
Earlier she was screaming that it cost 600 to hit
But imma give it to you for free Tech cause I
Like-your-shit
I do it so well, she tellin me tales about her Caucasian trick, she fucks with rubber strap-on shit
And when I'm laughin about how the homegirls making her grip
She started inching commencing to , sucking Tech-N9ne-dick

So many hoes know about the house
Five thousand, six hundred sixteen ways that we can all fuck
We Rouge Dogs, so it's 57
Nuts to bust, bitch's body full of lust
So baby
Tell me-what's-up

Call girls, and we fuck for days
I'm about the cash, just to get y'all payed
Tech A N9na and Juan, niggas y'all the shit
Don't stop, nigga please, cause we want some dick

She wants my money, but it's far from prostitution
Making it simple in plain, pussy for distribution
Finds the solution
While you niggas be losin
While we're cruisin
Grab my stick, now won't you
Suck my dick
So many licks, she be servin me like a customer
Riding down the highway, commence to fucking her
While you lovin her, I'm pluggin her
You paging and buggin her
Why don't you quit? I'm here to tell you that your hoe ain't shit

Do your friends wanna extend vagin to Tech Nin the raggidy- mouth nappy head friend grim cummer?
With proof like this, I flag chicks within summer
Stinging them like a bee
Like I was
Muhammad Ali
Throwin bolos in the bed, pogos in the head
Hoe go when the bread
Low dough when the wholesale more
Bro get ahead
They don't wanna let go, they know the reason we met, so
They can be some ballers instead of a prospect hoe

We can make more money, more money mo

Can't have a stank
Good for nothing
No money, ho

We talkin plush shit
That keep it on the hush shit

Off in the cut, but for now

Lay back and relax and let us

Bust this nut

Long Overdue (how we do it)
But you asked for it
So now I gotta give it to you, (give it to you)
Get Paid

Let me tell you a little story about this nigga I know
From the M and the O
A chemical nigga who says I got criminal flows
I'ma set the record straight for a second
Everybody knows this nigga is hot-headed
And due for a mic checkin
You drew first blood in '94
Trickin with my baby momma
You know the one you called a ho
I'ma let you know
That if you take it back to the past
When I was squeezing hella ass and playin hookie
You can ask my bro, He will let you know
Back then I shared my pussy
You was using music as a form of pursuing
Pussy sneakin in her bed and beggin for a screwin
Who the fuck is you foolin?
I can still make her make you put yo muthafuckin mic down
Straight interrupt yo show
And serve yo ass in her nightgown
Right now
Fuck the rappin, we can fight now
Tight style, Sell for miles
Change the name Vell to Vall
Call him Dame or Gal
Cause the way he came was foul
Nigga that's bitch shit
Tech N9ne you dissed it
But they missed it
Told me that you sold 200,000 with pride
But you lied, I don't mean to hurt yo feelings inside
But you sold 5,000 Nationwide
You a clown man
You niggas think I bluffin, go check the SoundScan
All I wanna know is

Why this nigga steady savin his flows for me?

And why this nigga basin his whole life on challenging me?

Midwest side will chase em down with a choppa
Motherfucker thinking Teccanina gonna stopa
Something wrong with his medullah oblongota

Yo
This nigga struggling to be the better man
Why fuck around with a tech milla meter
When you know the nigga is a clever brand
Naw, I ain't never ever seen the niggas video
Cause It never ran
And you got the audacity to say Tech N9ne ain't a veteran?
Nigga, I wrote my first rhyme in '85 right
'86, '87, '88, name me Tech N9ne right
'89, '90, I was rippin shows, don't you even try cat
'90 through '99 equals 15 years and I done rapped with some of the best
Motherfucker can you buy that?
We recognize you wanna be the best rapper in Kansas City
That's small time
That's why yo shit will never be in the hands of many
My shit is clean and packs a punch pal
And yeah you right, yo shit's a sloppy rum and drunk style
This nigga is failin in the biz
Bets step behind this
Don't know where his mind is
That's why the Nina's bout to tell it like it is
Tech Tech N9ne is
Kansas City's Finest

Yo, the fact is we both ain't made no real money
And I'm blastin a nigga which makes the situation real funny
I'm beginning to see real deal, scrill and real honeys
And you don't wanna get with a nigga that's sick makes you a real dummy
He said I worship satan and he worship god that's why we can't work
Nigga that's a cop out, bout to make yo eyes pop out when I whip my cock out
And say I seen you comin out of Roc house
This is the third round knockout
When you die and all ya piss, cum, and feces drop out
Tellin motherfuckers we bit (Let's Get Fucked Up)
From yo just locally hit (Bounce, Bounce, Bounce, Bounce)
Knowin the shit that we spit (Make bitches wanna fuck)
And make niggas get on they grit (And yo shit don't)
We officially bumped heads at the Lou Ou
Niggas are through now
Who growled at the Holy Temple Bandits Crew style
Niggas are too foul
Sole and Tech, and you can bet you'll never see em wet
You sound like Chuck Rock, with a little bit of DMX
Now I'ma end this by sayin Regime Life and 56 Vil
Said Tech rappin on that niggas payin for him and his kids meals
I feel bad for the nigga, so I'ma let it out

And I did it, and I sent it back, and he said I bodied it, he loved it, but I guess they didn't choose it for the album, you know what I mean, didn't make the album out of 12, so since it didn't make the album out of 12, I'mma let you hear what I did! How about that?

Plus 5, I bust flies so the wack must die
Trust I to crush live and attack tough guys, when I

And they crown me leader of this underground railroad

Overseas,  rockin' shell toes
Takin' pictures 
 givin' demons, elbows
We be less, behind the B.S
These rhymes have beget T9 and D.S

How I earn all my pay?
Alright, alright, alright

None stoppin' me, it's no one top of me!
