Running through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off

My brother, my sister, my cous' (hah!)
My niggas that was there from the beginning
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all staring at it

Putting it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T. T. blast
What we got coming at you?

(Gold for this) What's after platinum?

And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams
And N. C. outta the water

Tryin' to find me like a diamond
In a pecan grove
I got Ozone
Man I like rock n roll
Like ta bump it
Just as my car come around the last corner
Gotta take it home
Want nuttin' less than the the goal
Get your roll on
Show 'em what the low pro's for
Show 'em what Donald Don
Uncle Brutha' did to the motor

Never time ta' break the rules

Your car ain't the problem boss
The car should get rid of you
I'm a talk to your captain too
Tell him you're killing the groove
Singin' the right song
But playin' the wrong music
My transmission fluid
Cost more than your dashboard
I'm out here e'ryday
When you can't stay long
You can't play ball

Show off that body you got
You got the dance floor so hot

Can't nobody do it like I do it
When I do it, dog I do it

Break it down, put your back into it
Man, y'all ain't ready for the **** I'm doing

Get up, put your drinks down
Don't want y'all sloshing yo' drinks out
All over that cheap blouse
Ain't nothing but a swallow in it anyhow

Still me, I just changed the sound
To the other one I had and just swapped it out
(Switch!)
Kept somethin' in background
Cause you love the song
But you in love wit the background
C'mon let a mama work for me
Make a player wanna spend some money
I don't really like spendin' money
But if you do what you do and do it well I'ma

Show off that body you got
You got the dance floor so hot
You workin' that, you twerkin' that

That good and hot and def make a athlete lose his breath
And if you got ass, move your little bump south
You're gonna need a couple skirts, fallin' out
10.5 on the Richter scale, the highest number you can go is 12
Shorty shake it like hell, we ought to be shame ourselves
The Creator couldn't rock the bed that well
Look at her breakin' it down ridin' this beat like wow!
If I was a jail man I'd gun her down

I ain't never fucked in the back seat of a car before, oh this is nice

Ain't fucking in the back of my Cadillac, and they just reupholstered mine
I could feed fifty motherfuckers with these seat covers (how)
Bitch this is swine (ooh)
Get your ass on the outside and put your hands on the motherfucking bumper ma
Wait! before you do that, come here, bend down, open your mouth
Woo, unh that's right
Show me that you bout it bout it (you like)
Might keep you around a little while

I like little titties, big titties, salty tasting titties
Titties just came out the club, sweatin, them type a titties
Loose pussy, wet and juicy, pussy not too tight
Pussy too tight, Pussy be burning skin off my wood
Too much friction
Too much hair on your kitty, bitch
Here take this Bic, take a razor to that shit (It's too thick)

Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate
Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you
Start an earthquake

I want them 3, to come up here wit me
So I can put em where they 'pose to be
One at the head, one in the middle
And one down by my feet, she keep ticklin me
Neighbors bangin on the wall cause we over here
Disturbin the peace, baby be easy
Rockin the bed so hard we done kicked off
All tha sheets, don't worry we don't need em
A couple hours in the session we done been
Through bout four CDs (about four CDs)
Keith Sweat, Mary J, Brian McKnight, and Jodeci
(They love Jodeci)
By the way look think I need a couple can of energy drinks
(yeah I'm gone need em)
Cuz these hoes go vibratin in they coochie

I like the way yo ass be vibratin...
I like the way yo ass be vibratin...

Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate
Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you
Start an earthquake

Bend over and touch ya toes, blow smoke got ya hoes like you blowin dro
Slide down the pole, upside down do it fast or slow
Round here we professionals, get flexible, real sexual
Make a nigga wanna eat it like a vegetable
When he see that ass rise like a buttered roll
Round here we gangstered out, this ain't no titty bar
We let it all hang out
Break bread till the song played out, show that nigga what a real bitch bout
These cats thank they pimpin like Don Juon
But they all played out like the thong song
Get ya money gul, show em what you really bout
Rasheeda reppin fo the ladies in the south


I can fuck, any bitch in here, lay her on the pillow
Crawl up behind her and cram all of it in her
Ride her ass like a bicycle, hold right there
When I move you move, just like that
Just as show as yo ass is fat, there's some 26 inch rims on a Cadillac
Like spinners, sittin on a sixty-seven
At the car show bumpin Funk Master Flex
I ain't met a bitch yet (and yeah) that I couldn't have
All I gotta do is tell a ho who I am
Pull up to the side and get away from them

I make yo' head bleed
Don't fuck with me
I come to your house in your hood ??
Don't fuck with me
I roll up on ya', ??????
I do what I say and say what I mean
Don't fuck with me

I was sitting home one night when the lights went out
Getting higher than a motherfucker, wildin' out
Nothing much, just tooting on a gram of powder
Since y'all already know my problem, I'm working on it
Anyway, back to the subject
I ain't cut em' off cause I ain't paid him for it
Some lame sum a bitch put a hit out on me
And this was they way of approaching
But you know me, I was ready for em'
Guns are loaded
I just crouched down by the couch, low to the floor
Told my homeboys stay down, I'll handle it homey
This here ain't gonna take but a moment
They done tried it before
I seen a shadow at the window
I ain't bust though
Cause I'm a pro-fessional
I want em' all on this side of the door
So they can hit me with the self defense law
 2x

See I was sitting at Sonic eating my hotdog
Spilling chilli on my white tee, fucking it off
When these dude's rolled up in a rental car
Asked if I could spare a few dollars
Don't this look wrong
First of all, What is y'all driving for
And why would y'all try to insult me
Do you know who I am, answer probably
Look thirsty don't he
Trying to rob me
I'm a crazy nigga'
I'm going to make it easy for em'
I'm gonna see how bad they black ass want it
I get outta the car
Walked over with my shirt wide open
Look down, got two big pistols showing
Cause I'm by myself nigga, that don't mean that I'm lonely
I got thirty-six waiting to floor ya'
I don't know ya'
And I don't owe ya'
Your best bet, turn the car around and floor it
Before I blow the fucking roof up off it
 2x

I ain't a killer but don't push me
Cause I don't need a whole bunch to pump me up to make me will do it
I watch too much forensics stupid
And they teach you what to do and what not to do
See I know how to take gloves and touch my tools
And I know what to do with tools when I get through
See the truth is you ain't supposed to hold onto em'
You ain't supposed to throw em' nowhere somebody will look
You ain't supposed to throw em' away, Look
See that's the first mistake made by a dumb ass crook
See you wait for somebody that's close to ya' to go code blue
And then you take the tools to the funeral
Let everybody pay they dues
And you pay your dues
And stick the tools under the dude
That's your man he would do it for you
Take it to the grave for me homeboy
You know how we do

And la di da da da

Tip toe through the tulips
'scuse me
Looking for a night like q-t??
Bad momma driven like rule me
With a body type type like eww-wee
Couple cosmos and she ready to leave
Don't care where she goin, she just rollin with me
Got her ever so tight in the back of the jeep
More like an Isley brother, sister between the sheets
Over 18, love sex and weed
Won't get mad, if I won't do her but she'll still do me
Want me to spank her while I bang her on the balcony
The more I close hang her, well the more she screams
The car stopping, dogs barkin, the whole world can see
If it ain't botherin shorty, it ain't fuckin with me
Ya know what I mean, oochie-wally sing it for me
La di da da da
Sing it for me

Keep it on the low
Boyfriend sittin at the bar next door
Right there, shorty damn near touchin my nose

But I'm ready to go

AC, king size, on the fifth floor, (you know)
That's just the way I roll
Same way you can roll if you go with the flow
C'mon handle your business and a duck your nigga
Soon as I duck these chickens, we gonna, get the gettin

Good God almighty, hot dog and chili

And la di da da da

Quiero que me evas, contigo, esta noche papi?
No speak espanol;  Ebonics
Bang bang boogie, the chocolate chip cookie
The papa don, the pick and prime, pink pretty
Smother me, tell me you love me, blow my head up
Everything you say can be ??????
Just treat me right, come with me tonight
It's like all good, and a-all right
C'mon baby girl just tell me you want it
And we'll be jumpin til 6 in the morning

Y'all son of bitches, fonies

Think im wrong, step forward
And get yo mind pushed in a science class bucket
She in to tough talkin now that 50 got on
Quit fantisizing bout that man life, and live yo own
You ain't neva be hard, yo mammy titty fed you too long
Probaly still suck it if she pulled it out and showed ya
Tonite were gettin closure, im pointin out folks
Pullin niggas cards, exposin what ya hold
Im sorry if it feels you dont know me no more
Just had some shit on my mind,in my chest I had to get off
You can't judge a muthafuckin book by its cover
But I can spot a bitch a mile away

So I say we should expose these hoes
I think our fans should know we gon shoot up yo shows
O its on now (on now) Yeah I can cummon down
I got a desert eagle wit a silencer

A 4.5 caliber with some bullets that so round
50 took a look at it and told me to slow down
Petey you need me nigga just holla and I got ya
Throw on some Frank Sinatra and order me some pasta
They fuckin with some mobstas
See we can get it done, and I bet you at his funeral
Nobody gon come
I ain't here to be beefin wit no nigga to get a name
If you pussie and show yo panties, im pullin out my thang
Got a habit of smackin faggots with semi-automatics
You niggas in trouble

If you jump off in the club its a jump off in the club
She can tow up just get toed up like I give a good Buck
All the champagne I don bought bitch I done paid for this chair

Look at bonecrusher very first verse he don read (10 ton!)
Thats on everything I love to drop dead (Bitch I ain't never scared!)
Fuckin round get a main artery cut in half
Blood gushin out the side of ur neck bleedin to death
Needin a paramedic to reconnect n piecen you back together
I don seen it happen too many times out here, hate it man
Its gettin crucial out here n you takin this shit for granted
Pussy punk, panty wearin mascara faggot
Blowpop suckin ass,juicy fruity crooked man
Molested as a child, by the babysitter daddy
Backstabbin motherfuckin crabs in a barell
I can't stand em, but I bet I can handle em

I got my homeboy Bryan in the house tonight
We gone represent, Carolina we back baby
Holla atcha boy

We came to fill the gap in the game
The helicopter man took and bought him a plane
Now I guess I'm just gone have to pick me a name
To place cross the face of my new runway
International roller, while y'all still ridin round local
Crusin through in somethin' chopped off at the roof
Tearin up my baby doll new hair-do
Candy painted sittin on some brand new shoes
Ain't studying nothin' lesser than them 22's
Actin a fool, by the hip-hop and the music
Doin tricks, hittin switches like (uh uh uh)
All us sittin on dubs, and all our guls cut cuz
Y'all broke, and can't get shit from us
Besides a motherfuckin dick to suck (C'mon)

Shit, Gotdamn, get off yo ass and jam
Awww Shit, gotdamn, get off yo ass and jam

Carolina nigga got the game on lock
You can tell a pimp nigga when you see his car
Still tickin passin him with two bad hoes
Window rolled down so his curls can blow
That boy from the west coast, naw I don't thank so
I thank he from down south, where they get low
(To the windowwwwwwwwww!) dual pipes and vogues
Sippin gin, head in the wind, you seen it before
You know how we roll, cars both sides of the road
Like a motherfuckin pimp nigga, watch me hoe
Cut that shit down, what he talking bout
He just mad cuz, his girlfriend turned out
Look at that bitch in that truck, bouncin that butt
(Look at that bitch in that truck, bouncin that butt)

Aight, now what we do right now, we gone go back
Way back, c'mon c'mon
Yo momma, yo daddy, yo greasy greasy grandmammy
These girls scandalous, got holes in they panties
Got big behinds like Frankenstein
Breathe smeel just as shitty
And meatballs on they titty
And scrambled eggs down 'tween they legs
Ain't yo girlfriend pretty
YEEAAAAH! This is another Lil'Jon production

You niggas is lucky

Motherfuckers hot for the moment
But when the moment's over
And the roller coaster you been coasting on
Comes to a halt and the conductor pull the handle on ya'
You ain't got shit to kick up the paper
What it cost
And he waving his hand for ya', telling y'all to come off
You ain't got no more tickets and everything closed
You look down in my hand and I'm holding the Row
And you know in your soul
I'm a loner, I don't fuck with y'all
Never have, never will
Nigga I don't fuck with y'all
Them ain't my homeboys
I just spit on their tracks
I sent the call for em'
And they ain't call back
I guess they got caught up in what the hood call a big head
Get the nigga that did shit for y'all for no bread
Next time ya' see me out
Ain't a need in acting scared
Just close your mouth and turn your head
Before I predict that I'm a

Hop, skip, and a jump
Away from the pen
Been there done that
My niggas miss me in there
If a nigga out here fuck up I'm gonna tear in his ass
This nigga here is short a couple cards in the deck

I'm so awesome, I perform when I walk
I'm a monster
No ??? I gotta be responsible for
I hit hard and plus I'm armed with firearms
So alert the security, tell em to get prepared for it
Holy moses, jeeper creeper, this nigga throwed off
I done dropped all of my marbles in the floor of my car
Ready to brawl so give me some church hall
And turn up my vocals dog
And let me kick this track in the balls
Put me in this car before you take insurance off it
And I'm gonna drive this bitch until I blow the doors off it
And while you're at it, run in there, smash on em'
Turn over table, kick him in his asshole
Take the paper, grip him up and stick a lighter to him
Stay there and watch all of em' burn
Tired of talking to em'

You ain't never did what you say you did
I seen so many different changes in the way you live
But I ain't tripping
You know I keep it straight O.G
And everything you think you done that you think I don't see
I don't fuck with these bustas
I don't fuck with these bustas
Let me explain myself
Let me restrain myself
Let me reflame myself

Stick Em Up,Still Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry,2003,"""Yeh I seen him come through here a couple of times...
I didn't think nothing of him, you know... You know what I'm saying?
Then that shit jumped off there man...
That shit shocked everybody...""

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow your head off
Get your ass on the floor nigga, think a motherfucker playing wit y'all?
This right here came from Mr. Charles and naw, it ain't got serials on it
Anytime I got a personal problem its the only homeboy I call

I wonder how many thought about Petey Pab
When I was in the pen
Rapping in the penitentiary yard
Buying any weed outta canteens
Smoking on my roll ups
Stroking on my love meat (Ha ha)
Waiting for the day where they turn me free
So I can get outta here, make Momma proud of me
Do the right thing
Run up on the right man
Pull on the right strings
Put them where they s'posed to be
Had to get a jacket with a game of coke
When the motherfucker slammed they door
""Oh no ""
""Hell no! ""
""Say what?!""
""Get lost""
""Hold up! Wait a minute, dogg""
""Sorry, Charlie.""
Fucked around one night when I was in New York
Met one of the brothers up in ?
Ever since then, money been a real long end
That about ceases it all (Come on)


Oh this? It's just something I carry with me all the time
Just in case one of these motherfuckers lose they mind
And run up on me like I ain't gon hold it down for mine
I can show you better than trying to tell you about it
See once upon a time, I think it was in county
When a nigga used to run up and armed and robbing
And what's this little boy by the name of Mosey
Had to run home to keep from getting his jewelry stolen
Till one day niggas caught a hold to him
Did what they wanted to him
Stole my little Gucci coat
""Oh no""
""Hell no!""
""Shit, yeh they did""
""What you do about it?""
""What the fuck you think I did...?""
Told Grandma, Grandma told Grandpa
Grandpa took the grandson in the back yard (Here boy)
Gave me something, 'sposed take the pressure off
And said he would teach me how to shoot at them all (Awwwe!)


(I'ma get up, got 'em!)
It ain't certified till the nigga ran up in the house
Put the thang in they mouth and blow everything they think out
Running around acting like bitches (Talking about everybody)
You're gonna make me lose it all, (I swear to God)
Run with it, talk about it
But godammit this motherfucker bout to piss me off (HMMMMM!)
And this dick-riding, radio-station-ass
Motherfucking nigga down here in ?
I don't give a fat bitch, big titty
Fat one of y'all motherfuckers play my shit (My nigga)
And a couple of spins that y'all sons
Hat ya did with me came with my mans and them (Devious!)
Man fuck that church boy grab and look
Come on motherfucker roll with us (Crush your homeboy)
And if I said anything that ain't supposed to be said

Baby you have no idea of the things going on in my mind

Let me tell you a couple things about me
So many things I can still tell you about me
So many motherfucking niggas wanna be just like me
And the same motherfuckers I don't like don't like me

They got me twisting up my words like I'm sipping on that syrup
My head keeps hurting because I'm constantly worrying about
Shit that ain't even worth it ; Life's too short to be worrying about
Shit you can't control so give it up to the lord
And I've often been to church but I can't stay out of them clubs
And I can't get back to the way I was because foes still talking about Suge
And I need a little more love from the ones who are supposed to love me
And the ones who are supposed to love me have a fucked up way of showing it


Sitting on that 5% and low-key and everything I'm in I own it
I roll it and I smoke it ; I might do a little something if I got some
You ain't heard nothing ; You ain't want nothing
All the shit around here had been stepped on
I'm a raw dog, you are home grown; Your shit  my rear long
Get back from me before I break your arm
 bacteria and clean your palms
I don't know ya'll and I don't owe ya'll a motherfucking thing
Nigga, motherfuck ya'll
Turn around {?] a pastor on me
Yea, hold up bro, do this for me, shock that up, scoop that up
Give me seven more tracks and turn up my vocals for me
Shut your mouth.  Hush your lip.  Wanna be a pimp?  
Suck a dick.  Lick a clit.  Razorblades - cut your wrists
Swollen up, chest big, steroids, you know it is

Who you with?  You with her?  He with you?  You with them?

At about a hundred
A hundred or something
Or something close to a hundred

Or my Ace could hold it
Or your face could hold it

In every car I roll in

I can't go to the Army
The Army don't like G's
Or Ex Cons with felonies

Doing these crazy things
Getting things with bling
And earrings, gold chains
And everything else I seen on TV

And it might be running too much
And too much might be too much

Learn something

Just finished sucking something
How titty milk smell spoiled
Little boys and girls, don't be afraid
You can leave me around your boys and girls

I ain't forgot about em'
Just ain't went to trial
He going don't worry about it

Just like they talking about Mike

I make moves
I make moves
I make moves

Started in the streets
Came from the Gutter
Little drug dealer making plenty of money
Started selling dime's
Then I moved up
Started pushing twenty's cause ten's just wasn't enough
Dabbled that a few years
Had a lot a fun
Switched up the game
Left the petty shit alone
Time to get this major paper that I really want
Took off my ?
Put on a suit and let's roll
Time to get it cracking somewhere I ain't known
Ninety-five North, maybe Baltimore
Got a bid
Did a 1985, 86, Michael Jackson back slid in the same shit again
Cause the city was a lot bigger
Made me a lot richer
Then I got ""locked up""
And went to prison
Stayed in there a few years
And made my decision
When I get out I'm on a mission


Music was my first high
Sung in the Church Choir
Before I could even speak, I learned how to harmonize
Watching the other guys
With passion in my eyes
Wondering how mine gonna sound
When mine come out
Then I opened my mouth, something spilled out
Then I looked around, I done drew a crowd
Everybody bobbing they head, baby I'm throwing down
Oh yeah, it's on now
The way I'm going now
No looking back for me I got up out my Ma's house
And a few cars just in case we wanna ball out
Cruise around the world till the gas run out
Hit the station automatic window never rolled down
We don't pump gas no more
Tell them to come out
Take this hundred dollar, fill it up if you don't mind
Right back on the road hitting cruise control
Heading right back to wherever I was going

You don't want none, bitch you don't want none
You don't want none, nigga you don't want none
You don't want none, bitch you don't want none

You don't like me, I don't like you
You want to fight me, I want to fight you
Put yo hands up nigga, put yo hands up bitch
Put yo hands up hoe, put yo hands up trick
Fuck these rental cops, they don't run shit
Who run this shit, we run this bitch
Put yo hands up nigga, put yo hands up bitch
Put yo hands up hoe, put yo hands up trick
My back ain't dirty, my lip ain't swole

Put yo hands up nigga, put yo hands up bitch
Put yo hands up you hoe, put yo hands up you trick

I'm from a small town called, whoop a nigga ass
And I mean we'll whoop a nigga ass
And I mean we'll beat a bitch to death
And I mean, carry him all the way there
Take a nigga down the dirt path to the junk yad
Where it's stankin at
Put his ass in a plastic bag, where there's a hole where you blast him at
And I'm talkin bout, tired up witha shoe string
And a fishing hook stuck in his thing
Layin on empty cans, recycled bags, and some pissy as gatorade
Swiss blade, what cut buddy gone enter the damn microwave
Better get you a sharpener baby, cause that thang gone only get me activated
You look hard, but you really soft
You tried to make me mad, but you just piss me off
I ain't scared of you nigga, I ain't scared of them hoes
And I definately ain't scared of tight T-shirt as nigga that thank he swole


I don't blame you, I blame yo mammy bitch
She should've fucked yo daddy, she should've sucked his dick
You's a punk boy, a fuck boy
That like it in the ass, with somethin real hard

So when he come motherfuckers you can stand him up
Ask one of these niggas I was tearin him up
Have them sayin that country boy bad as fuck
Came in here with a heater and had to bust
Put him right back in before I put it on
I'm sayin this game ain't changed much
Still the same motherfucker used to sell the drugs
Still the same one, used to come to the club
See a nigga, leave a nigga in a bag of blood
In the car with his broad when the police come (Gone)
For they find what they lookin for
(Yeah boy) you don't hear me though
Cause ain't nothin that a nigga ain't cone before
And nothin that a nigga won't try again
But remeber what's up and I'm is the man
You gone crazy, feelin froggy then gone ahead and leap
But whe nyou jump over here, try to remeber what the fuck I said
Cause I meant it",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-u-dont-want-dat-lyrics

I said if you wanna bizzle then you can let a nizzle
To blow ya whistle from Petey Pizzle to come on anda...

I can do anything and everything with new flows
Then take this Manny track and tear the game a new asshole
Me and my do-rag half man, with two black hoes
How in the world could it do this, I be so damn cold
I got a rabbit foot in my pocket, uh huh
Come on I needed the other part of the rabbit
To fill up a pocket, I gotta major problem partna
So that means I don't need to be bothered for nada
Um, feel me dogga
My head hot, uh huh, and my body warm
Uh huh, my nose runnin, could you close the door, uh huh
Letting out all granted and goodies sweet G's and deviled eggs
Boiled tater to goat cheese
Y'all don't even remember me
I'm Petey - take ya shirt off Carolina from Greenborough
But what Petey needs to see this evening
You can keep your shirt on - we gon' use these


I tell ya when I come runnin head down, but naw
But naw, y'all ain't hit me
So I guess I had to ahead hit ya with something that could grip yo attention
That make ya yell at ya kids from the kitchen
What put that whistle down! But Petey on tv
Damn it Petey, ya heard what I say
I just love it when I could take a track and have me some fun
Get footloose, and still can put the club on crunk
Make a girl butt bump (ba bum), make a party go crazy, (ba bum)
When the first two bumps come on (ba bum)
I'ma have some, I'm telling ya mayne
I'm the new spokesman for gas grills and propane
When I wrote this I had to wear shades
I had to wear rubber gloves to get this today
Manny Fresh's CD player wasn't even playin
Man we need a fire truck, where my whistle at baby

(Hey, let me hold ya whistle) No
(Uh huh, please, I just wanna blow it) No
(Just a little bit)
Ain't ya proud of me now

Release ya mind, body, and soul
And let yourself become a part of the flow, like the EX roll
And you can try your best to hold it back but you can't hold
And even if you had a cramp, pull these handcuffs on ya
Turn 'em loose, don't worry 'bout 'em , leave 'em alone
He the one gon' look like the button ho
Whistle blowin', and the party still goin' on
And he all upset, mad, cause he too grown
I'm back, I'm ready to take my back
Oh and I hooked up with Cash Money
Now how in the hell did you do that?
Elementary my nigga, I just took this little thing here and blew it
(Ya Petey Pizzle whistle?) Yeahhhhh

Oh, and there he go, fa sho', Petey Pab
Straight hustla, play child, uh Manny Fresh ya heard
Petey check it out baby cakes
Uh you can buy yo momma a house off of this one
You can get yo daddy that truck that he always wanted
You can get yo grandfatha that chromed out wheelchair
And you can just go ahead on and just, glide in the wind
Ya heard, ooh, I'm feelin myself
I wanna thank everybody for givin' me this opportunity to blow my whistle
Blow my whistle, blow my whistle",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-blow-your-whistle-lyrics

Y'all ready ..
Y'all ready ..
Y'all ready ..

One of the illest rhymers that ever came outta Carolina, put this whole shit
On the map
Went back got two states, y'all crammed way to the back
And brought 'em up to the where the rest of 'em at (cause I can do that)
Granddaddy was real strong, daddy was in the Army
I was a bad motherfucker, slightly retarded
Mentally institutionalized, since the age of 5
Buildin tree houses (that the wind couldn't blow down)
Look at me now, holdin it down
Doin it well, I ain't triple platinum yet (but ain't gon' worry 'bout it)
I'm wearin the good damn crown, man I'm the president
And reppin both states (back here in Carolina)
Where the hell did you find 'em? (boy is an animal)
His flow is incredible, style is bananas
I just wanna go to the Grammy's and I don't care if I win
Just to say I've been god dammit (god dammit)

Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And that way you can ride wit a ... (y'all ready)
Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And get your hips on in the big ass truck (y'all ready)
(*motorcycle engine*)

From the world of dirt roads, them big ass pot holes
The land of old homes, the land of screen screen doors
Car in the back yard, dog chain tied up
Ain't drove it in years, sittin on nothin
Spit crunk mosquito buckets, hot wood heaters
Hooked up Honda Accord, with house speakers
Bag, phone and beeper, corduroys and sneakers
Pit Spike Lee's and them shell toe Adidas
You don't know shit 'bout Petey (Petey)
Real definition of the greasy, grimy and gritty
You itty bitty bitches sellin drugs for another nigga
Always lookin at me like your trigger finger itchin
I give ya my best witness, when you come to handle your business
You better be ready to get it, cause I don't be bullshittin
I'm up into plastic bottles cause if I keep on feelin the way I'm feelin
I'mma blow up in this motherfucker
 - 2X - w/ ad libs

Twenty-seven dollars to my name, headed up
85 pissy drunk, Petey still made me drive
Left off from LaGrange, passin through Squattenburg
On the way to High Point and my speech startin to slur
Better tell these sons of bitches, boy to move won't allow for me
To stop and say I'm sorry to this dude and this scout
It was just a little bump, shit you dented my Ferrari
Don't call the law, shit is rented, look I'm sorry
All we have done in the name of the south
Gave these ugly motherfuckers somethin to ""Raise Up"" about
But I'm still unfulfilled, since my daddy still drivin
That fuckin school bus, know that Bubba still strivin
I want me a label, want me a mansion
Timmy can't give it to me, Jimmy ain't spit it to me
Rest assure though, the day is approachin
When these old country boys ain't just playin, they coachin

Get on dis motorcycle ..
Y'all ready, get on dis motorcycle

Get on dis motorcycle ..
Y'all ready
Get on dis motorcycle (*motorcycle engine*)

Part 2,Still Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry,2003,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you today
The new album from Petey Pablo, ""Still Writing in My Diary: The 2nd Entry""
The boy hot now; he been gone for a little while, had a little vacation, enjoyin' life
But that's what you're supposed to do when you get there: enjoy your life
Y'naw'mean, cause this ain't promised to us tomorrow, we can lose this shit tonight
Ya understand what I'm sayin'
But this young man that I'm bringin' before you today, has done it all
He's been at the lowest of the low, he's been at the top of the world
And he still remains grounded, that's a trill nigga, street cat
A fine young man, and I'm very proud to
Be able to say that I even know the young fellow
But without further ado, because I know you've been waitin'
Still writin' in his diary, the 2nd entry
My mama said, ""Can you give her 3 dollars for a 5 dollar book of food stamps
So she can get her some cigarettes?"" (laughs)
Ya see, I go through some shit called voice exercisin'
When I go in the booth, and I go in there
And I just lay a hook now 'n then, know what I'm sayin'
Like this shit right here

Time to take them shirts off again (put 'em back up in the air)
Represent, represent (put 'em back up in the air)
I really need you to mean it, mean it, mean it (put 'em back up in the air)
Start up that South shit again (put 'em back up in the air)

What you want this time, more fire?
No problem, I got it (I got it)
Y'all better be ready to call the motherfuckin' firetruck
To come up in this bitch an' put me out (yeah, yeah)
Petey Pab, back in the house, puttin' it down (I brought this fire, baby)
Stronger than we've ever been baby boy
Y'all in trouble now (now now now now now now)
If y'all ain't ready (ready), better find your door
It's time to go and y'all gotta get out
All up in the wheels and under your heels
And let the best thing to roll you out
If you been there, I ain't got to talk to you about it
It don't get more gangsta, gangsta than it gets in this South


Got another rake, got another lawn mower, got another ho
A brand new weed wacker, with diamonds on the top where you hold
Got a water hose, and the thing you wind it up on
Carolina candy painted float to go with my pose
I be out there in that water 'round them rich white folks
Ain't caught me fish yet, but guess what, dog, I look good in that boat
I'm just as country as the day I was born, I love it
Say my name for me (Mmmmmm mmmmmm P-P-Petey Pab, motherfucker)
Bob your head, get your thang off, show your set
Look around ya boy, if that ain't there the South at its best
We run this shit here, all this shit here, nigga, look at me man
Your Jack ain't why you should be worried, it's the Ace in my hand


I'm sendin this song out to everybody that took the time when I ain't got my shit
Record store, bootleg, under hung and everywhere that my CD is at
I take my hat off, if it weren't for y'all, I wouldn't be nothin' at all
And Carolina would still be two states
Y'all motherfuckers used just to drive across
Do you see anything on my goddamn face that look like I'm playin'?
Have I said anything tonight, that y'all motherfuckin' niggas ain't understand?
Did I leave when I had a reason, talk to me man!
Naw I stayed, cause this where I was born and raised
(And I) I swear on everything I love
I'mma do my best to keep doin' it for us
And I don't need a gold or a platinum plaque
Just some down home country love (country love)
I don't ask for much (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
Just enough to keep my honda crunk (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
Tell the truth, it's really messin' me up
To see all y'all niggas still raisin' up (ooooooooooh)

So Crazy,Same Eyez on Me,UnKnown,"Have you really thought about your part in this participation
My prediction bloody murder similar to menstruation
Now in fairness to conversation
Cause it's your fate, so take the time to contemplate what you'll be facing
Talking that Hip-Hop shit
Don't get shot bitch
Cause you can tell
All in your click to eat Pac's dick
The clip's in, prepare for the motherfucking death blow
Cause every rapper in the industry is history it's Death Row
Not Bad Boy it's Westside
Before I make you bow before Tha Row
Just like them other hoes
The intricate designs of my lethal lines criminal rhymes
From the mind of a thug shaking state time
Take it to the next phase
You had your time to talk shit
Now bitchless busta's getting checkmated
These days motherfuckers talk shit and turn snitch
When you see 'em they ain't talking about shit
Westside

So so crazy
Bitch I'll beat your boy bad
Standing in the midst of my comrades
Bitches can't fade me
Plotting but they ploy's crashed
Fucking with the midst of my comrades

So sick of you sum bitches
You sick ass sum bitches
You trick ass, bitch ass, big bad ass kissers
Wanna dick in your ass, but front like you love bitches
Aids, can't hide, closed doors cross dresser bitches
Take ya' put your mouth on the pistol
And make ya' suck it like a popsicle
Cock the handle back and give it to ya'
Get rid of all you niggas that shouldn't be here
Shit over crowding the system, fuck niggas
????? niggas that act bitching
Probably turn my Air Force One's Pro Shell
Probably gonna sue me, but I don't give a fuck
Every case I ever had settled out of Court
The charges got dropped cause they never showed up
Read between the lines, they never showed up
Chumps make it tough for Gangsta's like us
Cause every time you turn around, I'm fucking y'all up

Test of My Faith,Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry,2001,"It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
Scraping up change in an ashtray
Had a voice said
It's only a test of my faith
It was only..............
(Verse 1)
Damn
This song for dat nigga south
That I was tellin y'all bout
Y'all check dis nigga shit out
Remember the song i told you came on sound like
How he was at a point on his own
And the promblems seem to be takin a toll
That he been fightin for so long
Seemed like erthang he did went wrong
But he found the strength to keep on goin
And wrote  songs about it later on
You know that shit hit me home
Especially when he would talk about the money he owed
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one
Like he put sometin on his light bill
Somethin on his phone
He'll get a lil money
And he'd pay a lil mo
He ain't have a lot so he just payed what he could on it
And somehow he just managed to keep all this stuff goin
It won't nothin but the grace of the Lord
Cuz I remember
I was............

It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy

So it seemed ertime he got himself off the ground
Somethin'd come and knock him right back down
Sometimes he wanted to just lay on out for the count
Fustrated and tired
But he got on up anyhow
And wit a smile I'm talkin bout
Make you ask yourself ""How?""
And then Cuz just  broke it down for me he said....
(Singing and Pablo talkin in the background)
I ain't neva been dis happy in my life
Ain't got a dime more then i had
But everything seems alright
And they say he ain't know...
Havin the joy of a piece of mind
Is more than any problem i ever had at the time
And now I know and I'm so glad
It was only
A sign of the tide
It was only
Askin me why should i cry
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today
Only a test of my faith
(Pablo)
Man that boy can sing that song
Play this shit ermorning
Just ta get my lil day goin
You just don't know how this had touched my soul to find out i won't da only
One that been through somethin
Almost the exact same somethin
Was eatin me up
Knew what it was
Just could'nt put it in words
I ain't neva been the type to really talk to nobody
So all the problems that i had
I just kept em all inside
Y'all had enough of ya own
To worry bout
The lil situation i had goin on
But you know God won't let you suffer too long
I ain't even had da radio on
I was out on the porche
Den Boom
From the Heavens above
Just when I was at that point
When I was just about to mess up
Man Buda played this song fo me cuz and i just shook my head like
""uh uh uh""
(Chorus)
It was only
A sign of the tide
It was only
Askin me why should i cry
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today
Only a test of my faith",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-test-of-my-faith-lyrics
Goodies,UnKnown,UnKnown,"My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies!
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And in my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'lac
And I ain't coming back
So you can put a car right there
I'm the truth
And ain't got nothin' to prove
An you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it
Barricades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back pickin' out baskets of fruit
(I love you boo)
Yeah freak and Petey love you too
Ha ha
You know how I do
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for. I want a
Sexy, independent, I ain't wit so you already know
I'm not being too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mayb' 'cause I talk about it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' 'cause they stay in the jar
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not going home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm
Sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it so you already know
I'm not being too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick
Trying hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not being too dramatic it's just how I gotta have it
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mayb' 'cause I talk about it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' 'cause they stay in the jar
So damn hot but so young
You ain't got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
You ain't got it all
Hey shorty you don't play the game
You think you bad but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you capable of beatin' the bag
I been workin' at it since I came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you once more again
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am
Ain't no chick in here that I can't have
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's trying to get on top
No you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm calling
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mayb' 'cause I talk about it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' 'cause they stay in the jar

To get every boy on his, brother Tim

Out on a limb and to far, to call help

He heard it from him, so he must have done it to them
Wait a cotton-pickin minute (Naw) y'all gone head

This Petey Pablo
April the 9th, 19-2000
Diary of a sinner, huh, 1st entry

Dear diary, this the 1st time
I had a chance to sit and just think with a clear mind
Has a homeboy stressed out for a little while, few things ain't work out
Could somebody come out or it's about 3:29, i'll give it about another hour
I'm over here at your man house
On your man couch, just puttin these thoughts down
Maybe this right here one day will be worth something
Before we start messin up
You know you get big when you leave, it's a damn shame
But that's the way that it gotta be huh
Look at Malcolm X, Martin Luther King
Marvin Gaye, 2Pac, B.I.G. and Big Pun damn this pen messy

A motherfucker had thought
And I had to write em down
It's the diary, of a sinner
A motherfucker had thought
Then I had to write em down
Living life as a born loser
Living in a world that I didn't choose ohhh

Damn, I'm back, I had to change pen, I done got ink everywhere
All over my hand, and on my pants and, how in the hell I get it way down there?
Just can't get it right
Seem that everything I do just fall on one side
But I can say one thing, I don't always get mine, and I don't ever stop tryin'
Feel like I was here before my time
People say when they hear my rhyme
People see it when they look in my eye
It's like , like 35 years on a 26 year life
I done walk so many miles in these shoes
I'm surprise that the bottom ain't wore out
I'm about to go take a walk right now


Mmmm hmmm
It wha good to me
A little walk, just what I needed
Cool breeze, nobody on the street with me
My own little world of peace
But reality gotta be what it gotta be
And nothing in the book said, life will to be sweet
I'm pleased with the life that was given to me
I could of still been sleep
On my way so please when none this here will matter to me
'Cause, know when I messed up, several times
I just done something tonight
And I know I know right from wrong
And that's what kill me
I still do the wrong thing
Am I crazy? Can't believe I got a damn diary

Oh oh oh  ohh
Living life, living life
Ohh a diary, a diary ohh
And it's written on paper ohh
Can't you just see it
All of my life oh
All of my life oh
All of my life
All of 
All of my life oh all right
Oh it's the diary of a sinner

There it is, my life
Right there, right in your face
The diary, I wanna thank everybody that went out and picked up the album
Got the album, and got a chance to understand who, who I'm is
Know what I'm saying, everything I gave ya'll was the truth
Damn I ran out of time",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-diary-of-a-sinner-lyrics

Holla at ya boy, Birdman!
Prrrrrrrrrr
Oh yeah
Uh huh

Ay ay
See I came around early
It was me and Ms Birdy
It ain't nothing to a pimp
It ain't nothing to a baller
Worldwide hustling known shot caller

Yeah yeah
When I came through dippin'
In the Bird Benz
With the Birdman and some Bird friends
I got big wheels
And every time I'm in the club it's a big deal

Mama on everything (oh yeah)
God bless the day and the 20 inches
Came around the corner with the slab on rags (alright)
Think about my dad and the shit we had

Ooh Lord, I remember yesterday
Trippin' hittin switches in a white on white tray
Caught a Bird with the Bird the very next day
Down to Carolina where is Petey

I tried to tell ya'll
It about to happen
Ayo Baby
How we're gonna have the Birdman and the Helicopter
Man on the same track
Yo Mannie, you cut the fool on this track
TQ, I see you boy
You out from West Coast to New Orleans and North
Carolina
Give a fuck what them New Orlean do
You know how I do
Mashin on 22's
I got a caddy to it
And a jag and a Benz and a corvette
Just like baseball bitch I'm on deck, ballin cat
All ya'll should call me that
Took mine, dip mine
Trippled the stack
Who's fucking with that
Carolina, Cash Money
Man, Mannie what you do to this track
TQ, Bird, Petey on the same jam
I'll be GOD DAMNed! It's on now!
And I dont expect you to understand
And this is for grown man
You standing on some dangerous land
And this time I got a master plan
I got a man with papers to handle the pistols
So I don't have to tj-tj-tj-tj
I done had it up to here with this shit
Take this track to the label
Here's your single bitch!

(Petey Pablo baby!) ??all the time, boy

(Prrrrr) Birdman, Helicopter Man, oh
Boy is crazy, boy
North Carolina to New Orleans, baby

We got some questions of my home town
While I was gone working on this album
Racking my brain going through all types of problems
Cause the world would never get passed the first
Single I dropped
The whole album was hot
Bottom to the top
And this time I'm giving ya'll a whole enchilada
Rappin hard I went back to the drawing board
Got me a sharper sword
Jumped on the right horse
Good Lord!
It ain't a game anymore
It's a rain forest of wack shit and I don't want no
Part to it
I done built me a fort I'm prepared for it
If the boat do sink, dawg, I won't on it
I was on the damn flight to New Orleans
And do a song with Souljah from Magnolia
Holla if you hear me
And I ain't dis, trip, flip script on none of my
Homies
It's Carolina till I die, whody!
 (Baby)
Yeah!
What ya'll gotta say about that there

Me And My Bottle,Life On Death Row,UnKnown,"First of all
I'm gonna start off by saying
I am not an alcoholic
I'm a drunk
See, alcoholics gotta go to those goddamn meetings
Every rock star there's a rock star
Or they pill poppers
Or they alcoholic anonymous
But if ya' ? mine and mine and mine alone
Maybe, maybe, ya' get were you're going

I had a older cousin
Called him Uncle Milton
Uncle Milton kept a milk jug of water in there
But I found out later on, that wasn't water in there
Yeah, Uncle Milton was a Moonshine running nigga
And I was just a kid so I didn't know the difference
I mean, I knew the water taste different when I used to sip it
And go to sleep so long they had to check to see if Petey breathing
One day they caught me sneaking
Cause my breath smell bad and my clothes are reeking
Cause I spilled it on my sleeve
Cause I thought I heard the keys in the door jingling
I got a ass beating
See today they call it child abuse
Back in them days it was so legal
And then they did a crazy thing to Petey
They took me in the kitchen
Sat me down and gave me a whole liter
Told me to drink it, made me drink it
Me, a whole liter
I took one big sip of that shit, Ooh

Me and my bottle (Me and my bottle)
Just me and my bottle (Just me and my bottle)
See everybody got problems
But folk's scared to talk about it (I ain't)
I love my bottle
Just me and my bottle
Me and my bottle
I love my bottle
A lot of people got problems
But they scared to talk about it (I ain't)
Don't be alarmed if you see me talking, to my bottle

Now I'm a teen
Doing these teen things
Going to a kick out school
I was pretty bad out here
Hanging with the wrong crowd
Drinking, wild out
? Thunderbird with grape kool-aid inside it
Folks knew about it
Fuck it, I ain't hiding
No more ass whoopings
Cause I ain't finnen' to wild out
I ain't really wild out, until Friday
Cause Friday, and that's when folks got they checks
And they checks was getting cashed
We was right there
To catch that, snatch that
After folks cashed they checks
Yeah, I know we shouldn't done that
I was a kid
And kid did, what kid did
I wasn't no different
Than other folks kids
I wasn't the only one that did it, shit


I drive better after I been sipping
Use all my signals
Especially if the police sitting
I be cautious than a son a bitch
Seat belt clicking
Both hands on the steering wheel
So serious
No swerving, no hitting the curb
Don't wanna talk, my radio going in there
I'm sitting straight up like a nerd
Destination ????
This stop sign ever turn orange
I been sitting here for an hour and it still ain't turned
But I dare not run it cause it's ?
Ain't got but one more point and my license
And my license is going, going, gone
Sat there so long, I done sobered up some
And I'm feeling real dumb
Cause I realized what I'd done
Sitting at a sign and waiting for it to turn
So I take me a sip
And keep on going",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-me-and-my-bottle-lyrics

I was settling down
Through fuckin' round
Most the time I stayed at her house
Spent all my time, with her when we stayed in the town
Thought this shit right here was really bout to work out
Quickly found out, that wasn't her intentions
Shorty phone used to ring e're five seconds
Ain't pay attention
She would always take her calls in the kitchen
Go to the sink, runnin' water like she washin' dishes
Ain't tryin' a listen
I know how them shorties is
Always in somebody business
Gossipin', shootin' bullshit with her girlfriend
One day feelin like a joker
Told her I wasn't comin over
Jive got me on the last flight out to Arizona, what I told her
Went over unexpected
Rung the bell (ding dong!) Domino's (just a second!)
Opened the door with the robe on
She only put on, when she naked as the day she was born
I'm just standin' there with crossed arms
Then her baby car came out

You turn me on and I like it
Wanna get it on but I just can't
Give it up, give it up, give it up, baby
You got it goin' on and I like it
Wanna take you home but I just can't
Give it up, give it up, give it up, baby

6 feet 1, thick as a motherfucker
Sex symbol to some, freaky as a motherfucker
I don't need 'em all but I will lick some
And I don't gotta be that drunk neither motherfucker
Fuck money, I ain't gotta floss to fuck
All I gotta do is let her touch it to fuck her mind up
Peanut butter, caramel
Like 'em brown like a Reese cup
Pantie like paper and I usually tear the paper up
West coast women are a lot different from the East coast
Silicone titty, big nipples, only red bone
I know what they want see I know how to talk to 'em
And I know they want me to slip it in the back door
Only thing slow about me, I got some Luther
You just need to hold on
I ain't tryin' to hurt ya mama
I know it's your first time, tryin' to take it easy on ya

Pants low by our assholes, hats turned back like so
Smokin on ganja, bullet holes in the escalade door, I don't know
But whatever it is that turns y'all on, keep turning me on
So as the world turns...
But you gon' learn, keep playin with fire and you will get burned

Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

I' told you from childhood nigga I will always be wit ya
Through hell or hot water it'll be me and you nigga

Whether Ripley believe it or not, make it happen once in a lifetime
Kinda hard to find, two niggas that growed up on two different sides of town
That get down like I get down, and done his like I done mine
Hit it off first time around, been solid as the foundation under the house
This some, shit for us to brag about (bout it bout it)
We answered the question and never had to take the time to think out
That's why I'll ride for my nigga, cry for my nigga
Die for my nigga
Hold ya one hand in the sky for ya nigga
Tell them you gone always remember

I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

You know you one of the reasons I'm still breathin cause without you I don't know where in the hell I would be
(homeboy)
You know life's been hard at home (homeboy)
That's what made us turn to the streets (homeboy)
I think that's what had us claimin thugs, sellin drugs
Duckin from the fuckin police, indulgin in
Booze and women, foolish niggas
Young, dumb, and off the leash
Outta control, but I wouldn't change it
If I could I would do it the same (if I can do it)
But if it wasn't for the game, teachin us game
We prolly would be stuck with the lames (but DAWG)
Somehow we made it, and I'm glad that I can tell ya today
That my nigga gone always be my nigga
Cuz that's the way it's ‘pose to be

I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

Sometimes I wanna play some ball, Sometimes I wanna walk through the mall
(Sometimes I Wanna play some ball, and just walk through the mall)
Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone
(Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone wit my niggas)
Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and drive till tomorrow
(Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and just drive till tomorrow)
Sometimes I wanna pick the phone, just to see what's goin on
(Sometimes I gotta pick up the phone, just to see what's goin on wit my niggas)

I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone

Why should I worry 'bout what people say, (people say)
When they 'gon talk about me anyway, (anyway)
They 'gon make up all sorta things, (sorta things)
I just got to be the bigga man
And let it roll off
The talk don't bother me
I believe in me
If nobody else does
And let it roll off
Just like the water on the feather of a dove's back yeah
I said
You probably wouldn't worry me so much
If I was out there
Behind closed doors
I was what they called caught up
Stealin, dulgin' in drugs and
Livin' reckless
And takin' advantage of all I worked so damn hard for
Petey needed help
But afraid to ask
Lonely, depressed, or just needed someone there
On the verge of givin' up
Paranoid, scared, I'm totally overlookin how much I've been blessed
I could understand what you say they said
And most of all why they said it
I just nod my head
When you're wrong you're wrong
I'll admit it
I'll confess to anything if I did it
But to spread un-necessary lies
I don't get it
How could you find enjoyment in my business
Ya know what, forget it
Talk my nigga
If you wasn't talkin' 'bout me
I'd probably miss it
(hook)
Petey doin' this
Petey doin' that
I seen Petey here
Well what he doin' there?
Why you don't come and ask
It ain't 'gon make me mad
I respect that more then you doin' it like you have
Bothrin' my family
Scarin' them to death
Why you talkin' to them 'bout it when you could talk to me yourself
I might flash back, lose it
And tear into ya ass
Or I could be a man about it
And talk and clear the air up
But you won't neva know that
Cause you won't take the chance
What that mean
Ya missin' somethin' in the crotch of ya pants
It just make me laugh
Cause sometimes the stories be so outragous
Can't say nothin' but Damn
Ya know what I really am?
Beyond that
Cause momma told me somethin one day
And ain't forgot it
If they scared to lie to my Heavenly Father's precious name
Then who am I to complain

I don't care, go 'head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone (leave me alone), Leave me alone (leave me alone)
I don't care, go 'head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone (leave me alone), Leave me alone (leave me alone)
The rumors you spread
Don't botha me
The lies you tellin'
Don't botha me

And I wouldn't be no better than you

Stick Up Man,Proper Procedures,UnKnown,"1x
Niggas greasy, niggas grimy
Catch you out there wearing them diamonds
Meet the stick up man
In the club think you flossing
Wearing chains and all them crosses
Meet the stick up man

I'm standing outside, I'm waiting outside
As soon as y'all hit the door
I'm looking like a window washer
But instead of a squeegee I got a 44
How hard, is you really is then
Okay to press your luck
Give your cell phone to your homeboy
Cause your homeboy he gonna have to press the number
Call the ambulance, and the rescue squad
To come here and pick you up
Cause I tell you to give it up, and you don't give it up
Than damn sure will tie you up
I hope you wearing one of them little pretty shirts
Cause I'm gonna damn sure bloody it up
Front gonna have little itty bitty holes
But the back gonna be dirty as fuck

Don't tell me I ain't gotta job
Do you how hard it is, to stop a nigga body guard
And then go and get the motherfucker you was trying to get before he break and run
That's why I carry this Mosberg
When the bodyguard see that he ain't gonna run
I'm gonna tell you what you're man gonna get
????
I don't play when it come to money
Y'all spend it like the shit ain't nothing
In the club my Mo Mo, and that Crystal, and that Patron
I wanna spend some too
I wanna do what you do
I ain't got it and the only way I'm gonna get it, is I'm gonna take it from you

Ball players first, then come the rappers
Then come the motherfuckers think they rappers
Then come the c-lo game, then craps
Then come the card house
Then come the Trap
Big money first, then clean up all the little paper
I can teach you everything about cake
How to get em', how to trip em', how to rip em'
How to stick that pistol in they motherfucking mouth
Make em' kiss em', make em' wish em'
Make em' piss or make em' shit
Or make em' sit on the motherfucking ground
Hit em' on the motherfucking head with the barrel
Don't even knock em' out, just scare em'
I can teach you how to rob a motherfucker
With a motherfucker standing on the side of the motherfucker
And the motherfucker standing beside a motherfucker
Don't even know who robbed this motherfucker

Nada nada, get the whole thing
Do it big.. yeaaaaaaaaaaaa

Time is tickin', with a hole in the hourglass
Startin' guns, been five
And I ain't tryin to come in last
Ain't no need for me to be upset
And ain't no need for you to be mad
If a man got his own pad
And whether he want forty-karat
He gonna have to do that there, prove yourself
The greed words, you had that there
What a dream, he would always had
And it ain't right, but that's the way it is
In this life, you don't get to deal
You can climb to the roulette wheel
I want something I can leave my kids
The memories of what they wish their daddy had did
If I could leave them all a couple of mill
And show em how this cruel world can really get the best of a nigga
I'd show em life through the eyes of a demon
The only thing that matters is the root of all evil

Getcha money made (getcha meoney), it's tha come up (it's tha come up)
Not a little bit (nada nada), get the whole thing (get the whole thing)
Gotta do it big (do it big), to sum it up (yeeaaaaaaa)

Getcha money made (getcha meoney), it's tha come up (it's tha come up)
Not a little bit (nada nada), get the whole thing (get the whole thing)
Gotta do it big (do it big), to sum it up (yeeaaaaaaa)
We just wanted it, tha come up

I ain't got time to be bothered with ya'll
I got a hundred problems and there's only one way I'm gonna solve em
I'm gonna have to get my grind on
Hustlin' and using my muscle tryin to bring the prize home
I ain't the only nigga with issues and I know that
But I ain't concerned with nobody's issues by mine Jack
I invented jail, invited(??) em back
Hell, I'm still in that
The only thing left now is six feet of cold black
Flower bringin' and church singin'
In a grave stiffed up and stankin'
And you can tell that I've been thinkin' can't cha(can't cha)
Now maybe you can understand my anger
And while I'm still out there candy slangin'
And while I'm out there, chasin' them banks
And why I gotta smoke a pound of dank
You never know when your day gonna be your last day
Better get this money when it should've been made (maaade)


I'm sorry it had to come to this (to this)
I know I'm really disrespecting your family members
That really love to care
It ain't ya'll, cause ya'll know me better than this
I guess it's just the way that I'm is
And maybe I'm a deadbeat kid
Maybe I really don't deserve to live
Maybe they should have gave me life in prison
Only takin' what they give me
Cause out here, I'm stuck in menace
Cause out here, I'm a threat to niggas
I'm like smokin' and pumpin' gas
Light the fire loose to the filter (whew)
You don't feel the vibe we givin'
Cause if you'd did, you'd done been the hell up
You'd done been stickin' ahead of your business
You'd of been, shittin' embarrassed to hit me
You'd of been, sent them boys to get me
Nah ah ah
And I don't repent cause I ain't that nigga
And anything I done, I meant it (you meant it, you meant it)

What the hell is y'all trying me for
Like I won't come and find you bugs
And do you like some coffee beans and grind you up
And put you in a barber chair, line ya' up
Duct tape, electrical cord
Find your boss man and bind him up
Now what ya' waiting for, you waiting for my time to be up
Man, my time will never be up
Time to shut what we call the fuck up

Pour out problems, add a little harmony to 'em

Wait! let me add something else to it

Good afternoon, my name is thomas jefferson leon-matthews the fourth
I am a resident of the carolinas
And has been a citizen of the united states of america
Ever since the day i was born
Um, i come from a small town called kenansville
On the other side of wilmington, north carolina
And i'd just like to say that
This, um, hippity-hop, um, (rap music) rap music
That they got in the communities today
Is destroying our community
And we could go to the store
We could buy (bread) tomatoes and mayonaise
We could get everything we wanted
And without worryin about driveby shootings
And um, gang violence, and i just wanna ban their souls to hell
I, i curse their names i, i can't stand the motherfuckers

Lord ya' been hugging me a long time
Keeping your boy alive
At times, Lord folk's been done died
Father I
No, first Father why
Cause I've chosen to feel this light
I could never walk in the shoes of the dude 2Pac
All I can do is give it all I got
And all I got
Is a whole bunch a why I'm not
Why I ain't got
What I feel I should a got
When I first got what I got
When I got out and went up top
And signed my name on the left of the dot
Walked out feeling we ain't got no more problems, Ma
Cause your baby boy gotcha
And I did a lot a things to mama
Brought a lot a pain to mama
But, I was always honest
I'm a go get it and give her half of it
But she ain't want it
Cause she knew where it came from
But, some days I ain't even have spit to swallow
Thought I had to go and sell me some bottles
Not cocaine bottles
Pepsi Cola bottles
Back then they gave ya' ten cent for a bottle
And this old man had a backyard full of them bottles
But in my heart, I knew it was wrong

Y'all can't see me no way no how
From the bottom to the top
He's here now
To shut shit down
Y'all can't see me no way no how

And let me lone'
And let me zone while I'm zoning
If I don't know ya'
Don't wanna
Less folks I know
Less folks calling my number
Worrying me to death for money
It's always something
Rent, light bill, car notes or something
Motherfuckers always gonna be motherfuckers
I love em' though I suppose
But then again I don't
Fuck em'

Then I don't owe folks

Me And My Momma,Life On Death Row,UnKnown,"You know I asked my Mother
If it was wrong for me to
Fall to my knee's and pray to God
And ask for forgiveness for somebody else
She got a forgiving heart
So she told me I wasn't wrong
So Dad
I ask for forgiveness for you

Me and my Mom was close
But my Pops was a rolling stone
He taught me how to be like him
And ever since then I been gone
But the difference with me leaving home
I never left for long
Cause this where I belong
And I'm grateful for him leaving home
Cause if he hadn't a left
I probably wouldn't a been able to stand on my own

I ain't get to see my Moms and Pops in love with each other
I only got to see em' fighting and fussing
I only got to hear em' yelling and cussing
I'm throwing temper tantrums
Pops getting up
Walking out the front door and then slam it
I ain't mad about it
Everything at home was straight
Can't miss the taste of something
If it's never been on your plate
Can't catch a sight of something
If it's just a glare in your face
Can't understand something
That you're mind tried to erase
I caught hell in my younger days
Football ages
When the other kids had Pop's to play with
Coming from the fishing hole
With just a fishing pole
I ain't catch no fish
Cause Poppa never taught me how to bait it
Look at me now , I made it
I'm straight
And I don't owe that nigga ""nathing""
And I ain't mad at my people, man
I'm glad I had a chance
To get to know my Momma being Daddy


Cause I done been stuck up (stuck up)
Shot at (shot at)
Hit across the head with a baseball bat (damn)
Stabbed (stabbed)
Right here (right here)
Damn near smothered with a plastic bag
Kidnapped (kidnapped)
Held for ransom
My Cousin had the money
But he ain't handle it
Young as hell
And Street's had me (they had me)
Thanks to my no good Daddy
That dude knew that my Momma couldn't handle it (she couldn't handle it)
All the responsibility she had (she had)
But thanks to the Good Lord, I managed

Show em' how I did it for six years
How I dealt with the bullshit
And how it worked out for the best
How being in there sharpened the skill
Turned the kid into the kid that your hearing right now
And I know you got questions about
Why I'm hanging out
With Suge Knight
And what the hell is this all about
And I'm gonna tell 'ya like this
Real niggas recognize real niggas
That's just how it is
I ain't make it up
That's how it been

Might make folk mad

Cause my house done got a lot bigger
Car's are triple figures
And I ain't gotta fuck with 'ya jealous niggas


Homeboy, Petey got the streets wondering
The label that I'm labeled on
They wonder
Nervous, shaking like the air condition on
And they ain't got no sweater on
And they colder, than a polar bear's cold
Did they think about it before they signed Usher
Every time I turn around
All up under
American Music Awards
They ain't get no ticket for me
But I still was there
Ticket's, paid cash for em'
Or Suge paid for em'

Cause if he paid for em'
We homeboys

And seen so much hate, I'm shamed to even say it
But thangs they done changed through GOD and his grace
My folks and they faith, these hearts that don't break
The dirt roads they laid, have just been paved
By state my claim, and stand my name

Ya heard me

Since the tender age (since the tender age)
I been running wild (I been running wild)
I seen all those things (all those things)
You don't show to a child
It wasn't love I was missing (lord knows)
My folks cared for me
I had a stubborn ass attitude (did what I wanna do)
And y'all couldn't talk to me
Tried often the strait and narrow
But every time I would stumble and fall
Fell so hard one time I fucked around and stayed down
I don't wanna try no more
I was getting a little older
Those mistakes were a part of my life
And my only regret is that I only get one chance to get it right

And I wanna tell the world the truth about me (2x)

I caused more unnecessary stress to my mama than the word allow
Old sister of mine
I had once upon a time
We ain't spoke in a while
Life's been hard on me
But I found a way to keep standing it
And holding on (holding on)
Pressing on (good God almighty)
Standing in jail someday I'll break the monotony
Cause Petey wasn't doing that well
And I can behold a way that the world christened me
... If anybody give a damn to know
What really went on in my life I wrote a song

Remain there until count time is made....count time...

Monroe... (yo)

That always wounded up in the midst of something
Stayed in trouble if I won't fuckin' up

Yoouuu gon' have to change up all yo shit in a little bit
When the radios in the club get to pumpin this
And they start to finding out what what rappin really is

Verse 2, now that you know what the song's about
Yall probably cussin me out
You gonna listen to it anyhow
Lets talk about somebody like Eskimo
Rentin they jewelry from Jacob and don't think we know
You got a platinum piece but your chain is plain white gold
After the video it got to go back to the store
That's Crazy, talkin bout some shit you don't own
Oughta be ashamed of yourself
Yo, don't they call that frontin, holmes?
You ain't Jigga, Nigga
Nor can you spin like Puff
And got a cash money deal
So what's your Big Willy talk for?
I get so excited man, your track got me leapin
Then you start rhyming and *Yawn* I get sleepy



It's a sad situation, record labels buggin out
Cuz they star artist done ran out of shit to talk about (Whoa!)
Yeah that's crazy and you think about it baby
Only thing that changed in yo rhyme was ya date ""2000""
Oh that shit is hot, put that on the album
You heard it with my man kick that shit (??)
Loud and proud, nigga swear he be throwin down
Arthur lose his voice every time he opens his mouth
I oughta hold up a signs and boycott they ass right
No more muthafuckin sound alikes!

I’m A Legend,Anticipated Recordings,UnKnown,"First let me apologize to Jeezy
For jumping on a Jeezy track and I ain't talk to Jeezy
But my intentions were good
I'd a called dude number but ain't have it to do it
Dog, the track was so hood
The first time I heard it, knew I had to do it
And if I won't intend to do what I'm gonna do to it
Swear to God I never wouldn't a did nothing to it
Everybody looking for him, where the hell is Petey at
Petey on the griz-ind, same place I been at
North Carolina is where I live at
When I go out to Cali it's to visit
And even if I did leave, say I did that
It'll never change the color of the blood I bleed
Or for what I bleed for
Or for what I open up my eyes every morning, take a breath and breathe for
Martin Luther Petey, Carolina leader
Got the soul of a lion and the speed of a cheetah
Busy as a beaver, wing span of a eagle
Nigga sitting high like I smoked me some reefer
Peek-a-boo see ya', wouldn't wanna be ya'
Still my turn baby boy, take it easy

I ain't fronting like I'm better
But, till they find something better
I'll forever be the glue that hold it all together
I love em' all, like I wrote em' all a love letter
Carolina, what'd I tell em'
Didn't I tell em'
Hell yeah, through all kind of weather
We gonna weather the storm together
I'm gonna hold em' down, whether they right or they wrong
Whether they short or they long
What they let us put together, let no man put us under
Through the rain, sleet, snow
Through the lightning and thunder
We gonna keep on bumping through, like we in some bumper cars
Nigga's swagger swinging like, children on the monkey bars
Man I'm in a swagger suit, sitting in a swagger car
I got so much swagger wit' this, I swear I need to knock it off
Nigga told me, it costs to be the boss
So I opened up the vault, and paid him what it cost
 2x

If you believe in me, you'll have eternal life
I ain't God, nah
But I'm God like
Come into the light, make all this wrong right
Quit all this back and forth
Man, I don't wanna fight
I'm enjoying life, I could a died twice
I got a second chance, I'm trying to get it right

And have some pretty kids by her, aight

Almost told my boss to piss off and ripped his shit off
Punched my time clock and took my motherfucking wig off

Get out my house and cut my shit off
Leave my key up under the mat before it be lost

Set The Record Straight,Same Eyez on Me,UnKnown," 2x
I'm gonna set the record straight today
Tell y'all everything
From my first to my last name
From my joy to a nigga pain
You'll hear the truth from me
So you don't have to second guess about Petey
I'm gonna set the record straight today
Tell y'all everything
From my first to my last name
From my joy to a nigga pain
You'll hear the truth from me
So you don't have to second guess about me

(Let's start with your name)
My name is Moses Barrett the third
Slash Petey Pablo
At least a hundred years old
Don't ask me how I know
North Carolina born
July twenty second
Went to prison for six years
For doing what I did
Coke and dope sniffing
Yeah, I kicked the habit
(Well have you tried it since you quit)
If I had that's my business
I don't fuck with nobody
Avoid conflict
But me having a record means I'm guilty already
Sold dope, sold coke
Went broke, sold soap
I fell off, and got back on
Robbed niggas at gun point
Broke in they home
Tied em' up, duct taped em'
Left em' on the floor
Whether or not they was dead or alive
I don't know
I don't go back to check on em'
When I leave I'm gone
Before you ask, I ain't doing this for fashion or show
I just thought y'all should know


Fifth and fourteenth street
Balling ????
Impressed by everything I seen
He taught me everything I knew bout giving dope ??
And all the while I'm being taught by a fucked up teacher
Couldn't believe it
A dude that close to me
That knew everything about me
Talked to the police
Had the nerve to tell me when I went to button at the seam
At least he didn't tell on me
Dude, I couldn't breath
I called this boy my brother
I vouched for this motherfucker
Fought folks, and went to war for him
Whether or not we had a car, I ain't care
I would walk for him
That's the type a dog I was for him
I guessed it worked out for the best for him to be locked up
Instead out here in these streets with the rest of us
Cause ya' know how dogs do
When one in the litters weak
He wind up being dog food


Gone out the prison a good year
Fore' I got me a deal
In the bathroom with Black Rob, and Dave walked in
Life changing experience
I'll tell ya' my friend
Ain't really cut out for a few of em'
That had this chance
First of all they too scared
To walk across ?
Ain't nothing but some grass
Let's see what happens
Ain't but a few line pushers
That'll push it and smash
Drive the car all over the road, zigzag
I ain't one for boasting, cause I don't brag
I ain't ask to be who I'm is
I am what I am
I ain't go to Suge and ask dude to save my career
We just went out and had lobster and crab
Took it from there
On the water front, blowing Cuban smoke in the air
Taking pictures of little chicks, out there playing with camera's
I know you thinking, ""nah, that ain't how it happened""
But that's how it happened

Bouncing they ass and shaking titties
Make one for this here
Shorty, I don't ask for much
So when I ask for something, you need to give it up
Come here
Run it like a trick
?????????
""Fifty"" said it best
When he said these industry niggas ain't nobody friend
They know how to pretend

Ain't nothing pussy bout' me
I got credit and credentials in the streets
I got numbers I can call
If I need to make a call
Get ya' knocked off dog, real easy
Ain't nothing pussy bout' me
I got credit and credentials in the streets
I gotta Sprint Phone
And I gotta Verizon Wireless
And I got the Sidekick Three

I wish I had that record so I could use the sample off it
But fuck it, I ain't got it
So I'll just do the shit myself
Nigga I'm a ""Cannon""
Loose screw with attitude
Shy a couple loops from having all my Fruit Loop's
Missing a whole scoop
From having the normal two scoops
Oops, glasses is for you new dudes
I drink my liquor like a old coon
This my personal bottle
I don't share with ??
?? ain't really the word but I don't know what'cha call it
I don't know what ya' talking
Say what ya' wanna say
Mean what ya wanna mean

It's so easy for me to run through the glass of the building

Spit at Game,Young Buck, Banks, or Fifty
Why, when they ain't did shit to me
I don't get caught up in all that shit
Hating niggas cause what side they with

Got stabbed, took the man knife, stabbed him back
What the hell that got to do with rap
I turned my life around and pushed that back
Now I'm supposed to go back to that
Man that got to be a powerful sack
And you got to have something else mixed with that
I seen two of the rap's best
Blow slab off the map
Y'all choose to follow them footsteps
Be my guest
May the best bless yo' chest
May the bullets they send at it, find they self a new direction

If they don't pray, let my prayers forgive em'

To run up on me and try to earn ya' some stripes with your boyfriend

I'm the wrong son of a bitch to be fucking with
I ain't with the bullshit
I could throw my shit up
Turn the white in your eye red
Hit ya' with a uppercut, a jab and some more shit
I'm used to seeing murders
That ain't nothing that's new, kid
Popping pistols ain't nothing but pulling the trigger
I've seen em' get murdered

Damn near shit on myself, thinking that I was hit

You and momma seemed fine when y'all was dating
She was seventeen you was twenty two when you signed papers
Gave her your last name
Last name
Why do I have your last name
If, you wasn't there to take care of the responsibility of the child that you brought here
Heh, talk to me Pop
I ain't being rude or nothing, talk to me Pop
I look just like ya'
I'm a chip off the old block
Ain't that what they say Pop
You know whats funny
Cause now I'm on top
And I don't need Pop
But I still acknowledge
See the problem was a problem
But it's no longer a problem
Cause now I'm grown up Pop
And you don't owe me an explanation
But I want an explanation
Why, because I want one Pop

Papa should have been ready

Cause I'm a bad son of a bitch
And I got everything that I want
And work hard for everything that I get
West Coast three whips
And I don't ask Simon to call Suge for shit
Spend my own chips
Rest of these niggas' be free loading
But I would feel less than a man if I asked a man to do that
And that's why I get the respect I get, BITCH",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-should-have-been-ready-lyrics
Tha Come Up (feat. Sunshine Anderson),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Sunshine Anderson)
(Petey Pablo)
Getcha money, it's tha come up
Nada nada, get the whole thing
Do it big.. yeaaaaaaaaaaaa
(Petey Pablo)
Time is tickin', with a hole in the hourglass
Startin' guns, been five
And I ain't tryin to come in last
Ain't no need for me to be upset
And ain't no need for you to be mad
If a man got his own pad
And whether he want forty-karat
He gonna have to do that there, prove yourself
The greed words, you had that there
What a dream, he would always had
And it ain't right, but that's the way it is
In this life, you don't get to deal
You can climb to the roulette wheel
I want something I can leave my kids
The memories of what they wish their daddy had did
If I could leave them all a couple of mill
And show em how this cruel world can really get the best of a nigga
I'd show em life through the eyes of a demon
The only thing that matters is the root of all evil
(Chorus-Sunshine Anderson (Petey Pablo))
Getcha money made (getcha meoney), it's tha come up (it's tha come up)
Not a little bit (nada nada), get the whole thing (get the whole thing)
Gotta do it big (do it big), to sum it up (yeeaaaaaaa)
We just wanted it, tha come up
(This time through added libs by Sunshine Anderson)
Getcha money made (getcha meoney), it's tha come up (it's tha come up)
Not a little bit (nada nada), get the whole thing (get the whole thing)
Gotta do it big (do it big), to sum it up (yeeaaaaaaa)
We just wanted it, tha come up
(Petey Pablo)
I ain't got time to be bothered with ya'll
I got a hundred problems and there's only one way I'm gonna solve em
I'm gonna have to get my grind on
Hustlin' and using my muscle tryin to bring the prize home
I ain't the only nigga with issues and I know that
But I ain't concerned with nobody's issues by mine Jack
I invented jail, invited(??) em back
Hell, I'm still in that
The only thing left now is six feet of cold black
Flower bringin' and church singin'
In a grave stiffed up and stankin'
And you can tell that I've been thinkin' can't cha(can't cha)
Now maybe you can understand my anger
And while I'm still out there candy slangin'
And while I'm out there, chasin' them banks
And why I gotta smoke a pound of dank
You never know when your day gonna be your last day
Better get this money when it should've been made (maaade)
(Chorus)
(Petey Pablo)
I'm sorry it had to come to this (to this)
I know I'm really disrespecting your family members
That really love to care
It ain't ya'll, cause ya'll know me better than this
I guess it's just the way that I'm is
And maybe I'm a deadbeat kid
Maybe I really don't deserve to live
Maybe they should have gave me life in prison
Only takin' what they give me
Cause out here, I'm stuck in menace
Cause out here, I'm a threat to niggas
I'm like smokin' and pumpin' gas
Light the fire loose to the filter (whew)
You don't feel the vibe we givin'
Cause if you'd did, you'd done been the hell up
You'd done been stickin' ahead of your business
You'd of been, shittin' embarrassed to hit me
You'd of been, sent them boys to get me
Nah ah ah
And I don't repent cause I ain't that nigga
And anything I done, I meant it (you meant it, you meant it)
(Chorus) 2X

Shook up a little, but I was never scared
Motherfucker I don't fear not na'

When you get a chance, touch a live wire
You'll see what I'm talking about
But not just any wire
Climb up on top a the house
Stay grounded and grab that wire
Blow the bottom of your motherfucking boots out
All you gonna hear is a POW!
And your neighbor yelling, MAN DOWN!


Nigga's call me cold, heartless, ruthless, outta control
But you know what, man fuck them hoes
They like motherfucking deers in the road
And if I hit em' I'm gonna tear the whole front of the truck off
And he gonna call the law

My Testimony,Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry,2001,"With no hopes
And my will to live
Barely a care in this world to me
I found a way
Kidnapped and confined
Within a system designed
To destroy the inncocent child that I use to be
It stripped me mentally naked
Embarrassing my mommas first born
Did I deserve that kind of fate?
Was all that was happening to me
Really written in the powerfull and allmighty book of life?
I dont think so
My tears would soak the pages that I write upon
If I couldn't close the windows to my soul
And stand strong in the midst of these storms
Maybe my story is
In some way or another fimilar with yours
Is that why this ain't even a song
But yet you still.. you wanna here this once more
I play this everytime I wanna reflect from
Which I've come from
To help me see were it is I'm trying to go
And even though grandma and our sisters
Left me some time ago
I still go by and sit on the front porch as if I dont even know
But I'm getting better
My mom
My two sisters...ebony and tanya

Man I got mikey and shocker now
My homeboyz
And those that love me regardless

14 Years,Life On Death Row,UnKnown,"Ah yeah
Ah yeah

It wasn't till
That man gave me 14 years
And I sat in that cell by myself
Scared to death
But wouldn't dare, to tell a man how I felt (yeah)
It took that man to give me 14 years
To see life for what it is for real
Y'all can hear me
And you can feel me

It ain't one reason why
I don't live my life all the way right
And behind closed doors
Sometimes at night I'll still get high
The demons I'm fighting inside myself keeps me stressed out
But it ain't my homeboys fault
Lord knows how hard I ride em'
I'm still getting used to letting folks in, to my inner side
There's still a caution wall involved, I try to stay behind it
I ain't got shit to hide
My whole life is in all these rhymes
Sometimes I'll jot it down
When I ain't got a booth around me
I took a walk outside the other day
When I was out in Miami
I ain't have no destination
All the steps I took was in faith
Ended up at a poolside
With a dude that set aside all his fame
And took the time to hear me out and all I had to say
That's why I respect Jay-Z
Cause the dude could've spit in my face
And shunned me off and had me walking off in a ??
I ain't never really been the type to ask for advice
Since I got in the game
But there was something about dude(and I,and I)
And I'm glad I asked him

No momma, no daddy
No friends, no family
Too weak to walk
My faith had to carry me
Back then
Too hard to imagine
Being lost in the madness
But I had to get passed it",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-14-years-lyrics

Love ain't shit
Half the time a street nigga, he gonna think with his dick


I walk so hard when I walk across floors
And I don't even be stepping hard
I'm just trying to get where I'm going
Totally ignoring, screw faces and little comments they making
And ain't one of em' gonna say it to my face
And ain't one of em' could take my place
If they could, I'd a been bumped to the side
To reside, watch the race
To see the rest of the game
Head hung down
With nothing to save me
Yeah that's crazy
Not loose to say it, Crazy
Documented, and written on paper
They ain't use to me
Being a certain way
Now I changed, they can't accept the changes
Cause I made a few changes
The changes I made
Gonna leave me straight for the rest of my days
Biggest fucking Death Row Man, ever been made
Hanging on the end of my chain
Now that's crazy

Might be the night, yo' ass might get D.C. sniped
By a new type of sniper

He used to have this book he used to carry around with him all the time
He used to calle it a diary, he used to take it everywhere he went
One day he took it to church when we went to sunday school
And the pastor asked him whats that you got in your hands
He said this is my diary
And the pastor told him that sinners couldn't have no diarys
My brother said he was lying, and my brother said if he couldn't have a diary
Cause he was a sinner, he would just call it a diary of a sinner
My mamma told him dont worry about what pastor said, my mamma told him dont
Worry about what nobody said
If that was your diary, thats gonna be your diary

Leaving home was the best thing I done
On account of the child I was
I wasn't neglected
Or mistreated or nothing
I was just stubborn
Didn't wanna listen to a Mother$%#$%#
I had a road of my own, I had to travel on
I had to get gone
I was too anxious
Wanted it too bad
Wanted it too fast
So I moved too fast
Never been the type to hold out my hand
So I had to go hand to hand
And hit the street corners
I'm a street runner
Didn't wanna be
But these things I achieved in the streets they look good on me
But at the same time I heard my Momma

I can remember just like it was yesterday
Walking down Fairfax
Crossing Fifth and Fourteenth

A lot of folk talk bad about the Pin
But I'm pretty glad for the Pin
If it hadn't a been for the Pin
Wouldn't a had it in me to win
Probably wouldn't of been right here where I'm is right now
Learned some good shit from the Pin
Went in a confused child
And came out an understanding man
Now I can understand
I got plans
And I can see way across there
Cross there
Walk across foreign land
And just to think, it's the same little bad ass
That folks said gonna grow up to be just like Daddy
But I ain't
I only look like Daddy
Don't get me wrong I ain't mad at Pops
I respect my Pops
I read the Bible a lot
And the Bible says
""You honor your Mother and your Father
And your day's out here will be longer""
Check that


Sitting in my room
When I got the news
That you had gone away
So many bags to carry
I think to myself
How will I ever maintain
My little brother needed me
And so did my child
Gotta stay strong
Beautiful
Gotta stand tall
In the midst of it all
Regardless of the circumstances",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-i-remember-lyrics

Man I'm a country boy to my heart
And I ain't trying to front, for nobody
I got a tat on my arm to show y'all
Any time y'all think I'm soft
You can walk up and get what you're asking me for
Trust that
Same trust that's on the back of a dollar
Man, I sure hate to make this forty five here holler
I hate to do it, but I can and I will though
Lying ain't right
Still, but fuck it, feel better than I did before
I don't take they medication no more
If I'm do a drug, might as well do the one that I want yo
Listen to the finger dog
You can't hear the finger y'all
Let me translate it
When that finger right there
Stuck up like that there
And it's pointed at the air
Mean same thing that it mean any and everywhere
Fuck you and everything you stand for out here
Got a fucking life and ain't did shit with it, bitch


What ya' know about your car being broke down
On the side of the road, Shorty
And I ain't stuck my thumb out yet
My head been in the motor
Man I been out here so long
My damn sock's cold
And I ain't got but two more smokes
You wanna do something than drop me off a pack a Newport
Keep going dog
I'm gonna get this motherfucker crunk before long
I don't know how I do it but I get shit done
I don't even know half the time where I'm going
Could ya' stop me
Hell no, I keep going
Like the little pink bunny with the big ass drum
Throw it to me
I'll catch it however it come
Even if I have to somersault or do a back flip for it
Man there's still two states out here sitting in the waiting office
Jive gotta fucking problem
So I got some drama for em'
Man I'm thirty six songs from being through
And I'm gonna show ya' how a bird do
When ya' turn a bird loose",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-long-distance-lyrics
Hustlin’,Missing Pages,UnKnown,"What ya' know about running up on a nigga spot
Blowing the doors off
What ya' know about laying a motherfucker down
Taking his clothes off
What ya' know about trying to get back
From taking a major loss
When the shit you lost ain't even you're shit, that's Shorty's dope
I'm talking about Feds on your ass like some Hound Dogs
Every thing you do, every move you make, eyes on you dog

Yeah it is
I'm off the chain wit' it
I ain't scared to admit it
Just spell my name right when you submit what ???
I'm a duck-a-motherfucker, got to love me
Done six when I should at least done thirty-three
I did a lot of things, helped a lot of helping hands
One thing I never did though, was help the fucking Man


It's the first of the month and you know how the first flow
Motherfucker banging on the window of your back door
Trying to get served cause you known to have that fire coke
Not today, cause today you fucked up and dead broke
All you got is candle wax and motherfucking Anbesol
Dude, I think I'm giving up too much of the game to em'
Man, I been struggling since Salt and Pepper still Pushing
And Herbert Love had his mind stuck in salt pussy
One of the illest to step two feet into it
It's two-thousand and whatever real rap music
I wish I knew Rick Ross and pay homage to him
I did two version on the ?
I love music
I ain't got shit to do
But what I been doing
That's what I'm known for doing
That's why I love to do it
The good finish last
I don't why, that's how they do it
But I'm gonna get mine one day
If not I'll keep doing it",https://genius.com/Petey-pablo-hustlin-lyrics

Like spinners, sittin on a sixty-seven
At the car show bumpin Funk Master Flex

Pull up to the side and get away from them
