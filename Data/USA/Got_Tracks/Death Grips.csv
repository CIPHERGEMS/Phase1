Beware,Exmilitary ,2011.0,"He come to me with money in his hand! He offered me, I didn't ask him, I wasn't knocking someone's door down, I was running from that! When I got out, I was in that. I was already through that, I had that, I had the studio, I went to the studio! I went to Vox Studios. I had it all, and I looked at it and said: 'This is a bigger jail than I just got out of.'
I don't want to take my time going to work, I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag and ten or fifteen girls! What the hell I wanna go off into -- and go to work for? Work for what, money? I got all the money in the world!
I'm the king, man, I run the underworld, guy! I decide whose does what, and where they do it at! What am I, gonna run around and act like I'm some teenybopper somewhere, for somebody else's money? I make the money, man, I roll the nickels, the game is mine!
I deal the cards
(Beware, God is watching)

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I've taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow
'Cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

Trips to where few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow
Of the ebb and flow, where the roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below the bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire, seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm, time is gone
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm
In blood sworn to glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship

In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse
The spiral storm of flames inside
The torch I raise, the force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by the unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches' blood
Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitch's leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise into apocalyptic skies
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with naught to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns within my gut
As my bones turn into dust

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow
'Cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship

Guillotine,Exmilitary ,2011.0,"It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

Sit in the dark and ponder how
I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor
And they all fall down - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes - yuh!)
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke
Stomp music seriously - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected
To everything you want, ever did want, we got it why not come get it
Stick your head in that hole and watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yuh! yuh!

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat
Causes my jaws to call out, out, out, out - yuh!
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis
 whipping through doors to far more than all that’s ever been said - yuh!
Tie the chord, kick the chair and you're dead - yuh! Yuh!

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

Head of a trick in a bucket, body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it, gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted by the stench of rot is such a drag
 - yuh!
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yuh!
Choke on these nuts till the very last - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Serial number, killing machine, the illest of means
To an end built on the filthy sound you're experiencing - yuh! yuh!

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixing rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel
The passion that blinds me so I feel - yuh!
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yuh! Yuh! Yuh! Yuh!",https://genius.com/Death-grips-guillotine-lyrics
Takyon (Death Yon),Exmilitary ,2011.0,"Tak-kyon, Tak-kyon
Tak-kyon, Tak-
Triple six, five, forked tongue

Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one takin' it back to the days of tryna lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like ""Fuck, what was that?""
Man I don’t know, but it made me feel so heated
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
'Cause even if you did, bet you’d keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it 'til it bleeds to death, each track
Epileptic seize every head we crack
Like EPMD snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map (Takyon)

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale 'til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't 'cause it's way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain’t never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10, 9, 8, 7, triple six, five, forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain’t a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war

Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here’s the deal, if you don’t feel ill
Don’t want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned
Takyon - bitch slapping pussy clots and clones
Takyon - setting off Unabombs inside your dome
Give it up, bitch, you know this is it
Get with this or get left 'cause it's on!

Far I see high time man quit
Won't let you know when I get going

Phone ring too long, I'm probably gone
Ring tone jingle my swan song
I'll show you how to leave well enough alone

I fall back, concoct new worlds
I fall out in throbbing swirls
I fall until I stop this world
I fall the fuck off this world

Noticed me, I've never seen you
Wonder what the fuck I do

Gonna learn how to tie it, hang it in my chamber
Perfect reminder, occult I'm made of
Come try it out whenever you wanna

Can feel him itching to take me with him, hail death
Fuck you waiting for

He turns around, hands me his weapon
He slurs, ""Use at your own discretion, it's been a pleasure, Stefan""
Head on like dead, on like grey

What's going on? Where's it at?
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:

To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So till dawn we're okay, but anyway

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink, and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so you’re knowing
You could get it tonight
But there’s so much around
Best take your time, do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that’s left of you
Is your most primal desires
Ass clappin', dick suckin', lock the door to the bathroom – quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin', cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think 'bout what you're doing

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated

Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Getting looser and looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin', you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a-
Cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me, I'm all about the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song?
You know, the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way, I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy’s hella horny
And their pussies don't smell

Argh...
Where's it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Responsibility's cool, but there’s more things in life
Like getting your dick rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
It's time to find one and take one
Right now
It's time to find one and make one say
""I'm down""
Think I just found one, 'bout to break one off
Meanwhile

Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, 
give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do, let's hope my story isn’t all about haters
Where's it at? Cause I want it like, man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cause I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Where's it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated

No one knows, feels so weird when it blows through my bones
I got a jones for it, I wanna know more
Cause it's 'bout what I got to show for it
I want some more of it, I want too much
I got so bored with it, I shot it up
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up

What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, I need that shit's bound to be the death of me
Fuck buying it I'm taking it and sharing it with nobody

Cause all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job

I own that shit, on some throw back shit, you already know that shit
You even know 'bout how I know the man who grows that, biatch!
You can't buy it with your money, you can't find it overseas

Work that angle 'til it's beveled, curve of the blade doubled
Edge made to bleed the struggle, best believe the game's a hustle
Observer of the strange occurrences, conjurer of the subtle
Unseen but felt disturbances that burst a bitch's bubble
That’s right it’s all mine, never was yours
Like how you wait in line while I walk straight through the door, straight through the-
Hear you say something but ain't nothing, spectators ignored
Pay no mind to that chump's just a player-hatin' whore

I fuck the music, I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Ain’t no fun if the aliens can't have none

How I fuck it dirty, how I make it twitch and scream
How it screams, ""Oh, baby, hurt me. Work me to the bone. Oh, please""
How I bend the rhythm over and hit, hit, hit it on my knees
Give, give, give it up, I need it all the time
Bleed it on the drop of a dime, down to pound it 'til it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine, make no mistake, I makes it mine
Break shit down and make it grind to the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds
Through secrets behind and between every time I scream:
""Shit is mine! It's all mine!
All the time! Shit is mine!""

What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, I need that shit

Thought you knew, thought you thought, thought you did but did not
Come on through; What you got? Is it cool? Is it hot?
Check one two, man don't stop, I'm not through black blood clot

Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
'Cause no one has came even close to the train
Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver
Whippin' the wheel
Flippin' donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base; where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more, and chill while I feel it so much
My gut burns like the tires
Movin' this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done
For the real ones packin' real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war
Marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come

And you think ""hell no!""

And fortune denied as to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
War is never done, think it is you die
Where was I now?
Like I said before, hear someone knockin' at my front door
Who could it be?
Should I ignore the knockin' or see what could be in store for me if I leave the safety of the shore?
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia? (Is it real?)
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel?
When they ask if you can make it
And you don't wanna go

When they tell you, ""you must take it""
And you think ""hell no!""

My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow
My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow

Nathan perculatin proper
Caiman propellers comin' off, she's hella copter
My neck bone sprayin' guava
Shimmy snakin status caved in mental state been shanked and soldered
I got the nasty in my taxi
You need a lift? You can sit between the backseat and my dick
If the law catch me in the act and I happen to die today
Push one my swing out in a glass of purple rain
Candy-painted by the lord of stainless steel liquid your ashy brain

My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow
My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow

I got that feeling somebody killed me
I got that feeling, zero feeling
Can't stop stealing, zeros killing all your millions

Inanimate Sensation,Jenny Death,2014.0,"*Oh yeah*

Inanimate sensation
Vantage perspective from objective it came from
Inanimate situation
No relation, close liaison
No conversation, no social contagion
Bother me, wanna be comrade intrusive
I remain
Inanimate aloof skip
Counterfeit
Like no can do, bitch
My vinyl vibrate higher than you, bitch
I represent, ain't meant to pursue which
One of you, oh you all wanna ride, well, I ain't got room stress
While we continue to make shit tight the loosest

You're in my way
What's wrong
Wrong with who
So what's going on?
Okay
Where you at right now?
I'm not with you
Inanimate persuasion
Strictly still life with all of my occasion
Inanimate surge of inspiration
Glow like thermonuclear invasion
Compared to swapping thoughts; regurgitation
I revel in lack of slightest acquaintance
No rancid level after taste inanimate negate opinion
As it unravel like enigmatic onion
Layers of interdimensional dominion

Blown out

Yeah, bitch
Bitch, bitch
My smoke, my butane
My boots, my headphones, my medicated noose
My deadroom, my schwartzwald hat, my Mac
My macaque skull, my lysergic stash
Empty streets at night, my bike
Apartment sink filled with dry ice
Condemned tenement, brandished rail spike
Disturb in flat noir and stale white
Grey cloud curled around my bearded compound like boa
One of two thunderbolt we ain't broke on tour
Concrète antique trapdoor twenty-four
Spots to get that get right
When I gotta get right some more
Type of get right I can't afford
I covet these things more than any living thing

Which will be the end of me?

This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war
By night shift I don't exist, chump, saddle up
A dust to dust motionless struck belly up
Your skies are lip balm on my balls
Elemental cyclotron on white walls
I met you and your carne asada to cry
Fuck everything, now go ahead and pay us for my shrine, wait
This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war

And I've been like this for my whole fucking life
My whole fucking life's your whole fucking life

Panic, panic, panic, panic
Panic, panic, panic, panic
You know this bitch, this is the bitch you know
I would not fuck a basic bitch, bring a bitch and I want more
Uptight bitch, your blood’s like bitch, right? Zip tight flow
Handle a bitch, handle a bitch, handle a bitch like so
I'm not no bitch like that

Fuckin' with C-notes, like please don't, that bitch might act
Handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch like that

Bitch always been assed out
Kiss your black ass on the mouth

Said, broke bitch, I'm on that dope

Bitches more sick

Section 3

Exist like a drunk man at the wheel
But first sittin' in the front, not at the wheel
No clue I could fuck you 'cause I will
Fuck praise, all it does is pay my bills
I faced the crowd in Vegas there
Ever fake but isn't where
Shit ain't raw, they can't compare
Check AWOL, bitch, I'm always there
Intangible intrusion to the bone, through the bone
Feels human bones, human skill
Blessed on windmill and opium feel
Bumpin' shit, I leave open seal
Ghoulishly austere, paralysis is my souvenir
Exit wounds and rabbit ears
Rabbit holes that last for years
Now can you see I have no fears?
Not havin' cares, post-stratosphere
(Witness post-stratosphere)
Misspoke language of savoir faire
Don't need to come with the stolen hair
Stranger slip by, catch my interest
Look for a minute at a safe distance
Lose my place, look back, see no one
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Middle broad daylight, jump this vanish
I like this type, that's refined manner
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
This is why I'm swimming in a faucet of acid
I bum a dialogue instead of renting it
Call in the place and get an estimate
It's diligent on paper, I'll invest in it
Be weird if I could make it as a mesmerist
Have a tall list of clients to tamper with
Be a practicing confessional
Cultivator of masochists
Crave sanity? I'll make you vegetables
Your family'll thank me like pacifists
Cool long as I don't move my tongue
Cool long as I don't bite my tongue

I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rites of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit

Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
You want to know who I am?

No one's girl, stoic girl
Only fucks fine foreign girls
Makes your muse, play it ruse
Awakens your fantasy, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory

Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

Attention
I am the dragon from the desert

Hate makes me reckless, restraint cease the functions
You get the best of me, but I'm missin' one in my stomach
Killer for the occasion, whip you back to size
Break you like a Franklin, spend you like a five
They like, ""How come? How come, though?""
They come at meals, fuck no
Right on, I'm that killer, you're a fucking sidearm
Think twice, face down
Don't bleed like this Cape Town
Don't sleep like no playground

Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl

Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

Farewell, fuck you hopeless
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless
And act like no one notice
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless

Me and my doppelgänger have a system
My shoulder pain loads ammunition
These counterfeits are mostly sober
I pen the script, he pilots the saucer
It's funny, the bored pose of my dead man
We both scramble until I'm the last man
Stay in first so much I have four left hands
He arose disgusted, I awoke in Bethlehem

Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Section 5

Don't ask me where I came from
Ignore me anyway but
Stick it if you think it
Happens when you can't stop

Came to in a sports cage
Five minutes, coulda swore it was a decade
Had the time of my life, no head case
Zoom with the camp where we jump for fuck's sake
Threw it off over end of the hard way
Lie back, then I shut down my heart rate
Enter threshold of blind man's hallway
Hell'll turn a tightrope to my causeway
Two burned rascals call me hombre
And now you're fuckin' with mojo
Side shift like bold fungus moonglow
I flatline straight through to the loophole

Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

Tone of our voices means our location's a runaway
I'm before all your destinations, I'll be on display
I’m fuckin' on your schedule, explanation’s in delay
Pathway enchanted encounter, feed that hoe a chainsaw
Burned up at myself, back to the floor
Moment I do, my bustle was such a bore
Pull that way, run your vehicles 'cause you know it's cool
Put my fist on a pedestal 'til I stroke the core

Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

No matter what, stay where you are, if you go
Don't matter who you shot, there's no scars where you are
Never felt this, but I been so lost, nothing's broke
Make your life a demand, things don't blow to be all gone

A hybrid night container
Carbonated thrift store
Your peter is the peak
Of hubris marked in vain
Hi
Section 6

Sick like, sick like

Fall out on impact
Never been left, what's worse
You must have that contention
That greenscape, that witch fur
What if I was strapped like toothpaste?
Like filler ass, dig grave
I feel staffed like Rick James

Sick like, sick like

Chinchilla, rich blood
Mindset, core forms
Timeless, but I admire
Improvised explosives
Glowed off, my darlins
Good labor, my harlot
Blood form
With the ice flow garnet

Sick like, sick like

Molten like karma, it's abstractions of bliss to me
Intolerance removes lava, high pressure like quick release
Counterstrike red Bambaataa on those tears
Get by, stampede off billions
Stagnant eyes, spring rupture, drop off here
Said my deadbeat

Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like

Doubtful, you stand in pride
Turnin' me down so quiet
Silence guided by vision
Assailant inside the figure
Can't hide from suspicion
War-waging prescription
Street life breaks you like religion

Sick like, sick like

Hooded figure exploit your demons
Cast profit, go to buy, try, can't knock it
Bet a bitch forward this market
Better get numbered, you're profit
The offer day
The offer day, you're numbered
Try to flee, but you can't leave
You get paid to suffer
Section 7

At the time, didn't recognize myself 'til I was petrified
But half the time I'm not myself
So most of the time I don't question why
We did testify, but best I can do is buy some time
Spend my time folding time
Even met myself one time

You can’t see the kraken
Climbing out the bullshit that exists from the mouth
You can’t get out of debt
Just learn to keep on stabbing
In the heart with a fucking knife
You drop it before you can catch it
Do you see what's taxing?
All life's a moment before the grave
You're only optimally the passenger, a slave
From the middle finger
Open up the sewers before you, drop this ring, reave
The culture hiding behind this life, kill the pain

Section 8

All I see are sycophants
Hunting for that little bit
Never will get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is
Every word is cinema
Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it

Dance, you motherfucker
Get on 'em, motherfucker
Get 'em like a man
Petite like Southern, hit up like clan
Ya'll nations are stuck in gutters fastened by checks
Desert creek kumbaya, feed that snake like mud
I'm too sick now to eat, I inspect my money just 'cause

Question must be scroungin'
Nobody came to flex, it's poundin'
But I bet that's next, the mountain flecks
Off this map's rips, it's grounded
By the thousands, they walked in the valley
Act like you care while I get you out of it
Like I said, get the fuck off my couch
Ain't worth shit if it ain't about me

All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Fucks you admitted for?
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is

Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

I'd rather not get involved
I'm not that much, never been that much
But I saw too much to pay shit off
Too stuck, no way, weigh off that much
What can I say? Fuck what you say
You can ask around if you think I'm frontin'
Never been that much, but I got here first
Get the fuck out, bitch, while I do my work

And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it

Spikes,Bottomless Pit,2016.0,"Headless
I skid like Rita lifted ocean
I drift like my planet don’t spin
I skid all over marks like I’m haunted
Rev it up, twirl my la la like profits
It’s never much, I’m war torn in the cockpit
Don’t interrupt, my turbulence slaps
My path massive demands panoramic
Massive
Shitty, you’re ten thousand leagues subzero, sweat dripping
My hancock do-rag riptides like Tent City
Standoff through low lands eerie silencing

Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes are pulling, are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull-
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

Peel out, press me to magnetic slab
Severe swerving I tow lag
Off uncertainty 'til your zipper locks
My salvia silhouette commence shots
Sixty shots a second on a hexed clock
I strike ‘tween each time your solar plex drops

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

I’m skidding out
I can’t help yourself, I skid in doubt
I’ve dealt with yourself, I tricked hell out
I’m all helter skelter, I’m on that Faust
None of me left but reflex skidding out
Pulse in my chest feel like it’s fixing to bounce
Bounce, bitch, I can’t be the road
I’m crashing into planes, I crash and stroll
Maxed out my oath
Don’t blame me, I’ve no soul

Greed tastes like sin

My skids 'til the brink, I jizz snowmen
Tall knives in my grill feel potent
My jigsaw manipulates you open
My skids writ rubbernecks agent orange
I skid like I’m no use
My headband expand like I choose juice
I binge, all black enhance my tragic
Ends to a means I can’t establish
Noise of nomads on sapphire spice
Cumulus in both hands, can’t kill myself twice
Pawns tremble like dildos wielded by duppies
Traumatized on for size, roadkill hides like yuppies
I’m too passcode, these gates won’t stay closed
Control gets old, I smash out my skin
My vessel thrown like slack at the wind
I’m finally astral now, grab my stems

Watch its kind get thrown like rice

So fucking loud, it's vulgar

I hate your faux touch
I hate every last one of you

When your shit is-

System blower, system over

Yeah, trick, go fetch my whip
Gotta let a mark know
Who he's fuckin' with
Ruthlessly skin a chump
Just for kicks
Can't fuck with this
Sadomaso-kiss my fist
Suck my dick, it's not cool
I'm too sick, what time is it?
System blower, system over
Deep in the klink base
Cut straight to the chase
Like a triple shot of 180 proof
Kill-o-watts riots audio violence
Breaks your windows and
Takes all the loot

Silver coin on your eyes
Forever closed

How long I been tired of that old
Can't nod my head

Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls

Ugh! 
Yes, I like the drugs

I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore, what this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes through your bitch ass decor
Spit it back like a whore and make you shit your fucking drawers
Scared to ride, cowards fall before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons, drug by demons down your halls
Can't imagine what's fit to happen when I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what they're lacking and less than that in no time at all
Can't believe they have the gaul to try and act
Like they’re not trapped between these walls
Bring it (Bring it)
Kill it

Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it

Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there, never get there
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here? Wanna leave here
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
And if I can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don’t give a damn, twist a gram
And keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged, even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of, don’t know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much, there you go
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood

Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it

See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, cause I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it, bring it, kill it
On everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane
Staring at the ceiling, in the dark
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing, and it won't stop

Turned Off,Jenny Death,2015.0,"I'm smoking cigarettes in the shower; when they get wet I just light another, fatal

I'm lighting up like Vegas
All sevens king of pentacles
I'm chaining like it's money, dirty money, surgeons general
As if my flesh keeps me prisoner
As if
I've been spinning chambers since the day I was born
Like, what's it all for?
Like, why the fuck not?
Fuck if I don't get off I don't know how to be caught

I get off at all costs

I'll fuck you off at no cost

Can't look me up, I don't exist
I spin the chamber 'tween my lips
I pull the trigger like a gif
I can't get hit, I've never lost
I'm a rumor, I'm turned off

My footprint precedes me follow me
I'm all the way over my species
My footprint so dropped it's bottomless
Species call my redwings apocalypse
You want this bitch I drop a bitch
Snuff your bloodclot metropolis
Trail of anonymous casualties
Pah pow boom, mastery
I've been over that glass house
All my windows blacked out
Straight jacked up, the fuck up
Guts up man down
My man stand down
I'm not with it
I drop liquid

Can't be finished
You never started
You run for martyr
While I'd push harsher
Lose it more further
Lose it more nerder

Art of indifference trump consequences

How to show 'em they don’t mean shit to me

Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out, abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don’t trip
If you have one let a man know so I could flip a bitch and kill it

Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it

Swing the door open and buck 'em down
Course I'm just fuckin' around
But nevermind the way it sound
Everytime we make it pound
Straight into the pavement now
Whip it, bleed it, cause it pain
Eat it, shit it out and change
Lanes at speeds that seem insane
To them petty pussy brains
Push me and they will be slain
Drag this past the point and claim
That shit as if it was your name
Like it's attached to yours with chains
Own it till shit goes up in flames
And there really ain't no one to blame
No one to blame, it's all the same

Pain of the game
Makes me insane
Makes me fuck up my whole thang
Pain of the game
Makes me insane
Makes me fuck up my whole thang

Where'd you get it?
Give it here, I said don't sweat it
I'm gonna take it around for a bit

Howling on that mountain peak
Feeling like hell's up in my chest
Feel the fire rise, rise so high, so high I rise
Eye to eye with death
Gazing through me like an uzi
Spraying through me, bag of flesh

Until the wheels fall off and I
Run off the road, no telling why
Hear them cry:
""Man, I just don't wanna die
Just don't wanna, why
Is everything always happening
In the blink of eye?
This better be the last time me
Ever see you in my life
Steadily to the death passing
Everything that don't seem tight

Goin' through the motions

Just rollin' like waves at night""",https://genius.com/Death-grips-full-moon-death-classic-lyrics

Trust me trust us we know you will
Tide come crashing in like steel
Makes your passions taste so stale

Cobwebs turn your insides pale

If significant piece of me spill
Little pinot pouring out my gills
Pass a carafe perhaps I’ll swill
My grief may leak but can’t congeal
Word nihil you know the drill
To last rattle on a long swig tail
Till last drop wind through mine like scales
Compromise your position become theirs

Day breaking glyph hissing
Sanity fucking bitch skinning
How do you say come to me
Hanging out with Linda
I heard she’s in fucking custody

Need new escape we’re a trained magician
I’ve just the uranium griffin
Land you there in ribbons
Where your thoughts stay hidden
Fair for a square made soft for digging
Word nihil you know the drill
Amp cooking guilt gives a thunder stealing window licker
Her moods big for real
Head hunting blunt kissing death dumping body gripping

Head hunting blunt kissing
Death dumping body gripping
How does she say come to me
Boosting with Linda’s in custody

Must admit shit’s not luck how we
Manage to elude locked up in county
Every chance a fuck gets I’m counting

The Fear,Year of the Snitch,2018.0,"I don't know dude, I just—I just drink blood dude

The fear (jump, jump, jump)
I'm gonna kill somebody (jump, jump, jump)
Don't jump!

Downs you with dull pain, won't we become strange?
Tied up with your legs, hide helps, on the way
Who will help you fall? It's just all so frail
So long since we fell, still don't know we failed
Go for the most tears, stay cause it gets strange
Went there to shed years, left there in lead chains
Been there since next year, scarred us to death chair
Scared us to rest less, skull full of house guests

The fear
The fear

I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)
I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)

Don't jump! (Jump, jump, jump)
(Jump, jump, jump)
The fear

Pulled close by its pliers, cold, sharp, and expired
Like ribs of vampire, like winds on high wire
Whips you like it cares, push you down more stairs
Kicks you for quick laughs, don't cry, you won't last (The fear)
Missing entire weeks, months gone as I peak
Lost tongue, mystery, everyone's on to me (The fear)
Who's this stole my heels, stumbled into hell
Hates me till it heals, wakes me with the chills (The fear)

I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)
I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)

Frightening and embarrassing
Like one percent and pleasantries
Gather your things bolt till you reach
The crystal fields of ketamine
I'll meet you there, I'll beat you there
Bet I'll be there before you leave
Time you get there I’ll be midair
Like peace of mind's a bore to me

The fear, the fear
Jump, jump
Don't jump!

When the rail holds you, flight like stairs grows you
Off your mind must wish, this is not my ditch
Ah that ditch wears you, host torn and worn through
Hard looks at blank walls, held way too long pause

Butterfly ballistic, seax survival
Butcher kukri to trench homicidal
Can’t say I buy them, just show up lately
Lately seem to stalk me like I’m yeti
Like scream of a haunted jetty
Let me be a haunted jetty
Cross I cry banshee like manic falcon
Shrill like losing time on Shasta Mountain

She’s wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style

Shine like sad hung from starry eyed gallows
Like day old glow of carbon eye shadow
Trembling young wounded mammal
Double edge gut judge choke on his gavel
 (Choke)
Jack slide leave atlantic puddles
Spade slip lives into stranded shuttles
I taxiderm shams with morbid shinto
This three quarter shank, one quarter disco (Choke)
Low res mega evil patina
Pattern maker of myth and trip weaver
Infamous nature in rags like reaper
Like midnight mounted by wayside seekers

Lovely, lovely, they’re so blonde
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
Dusty, dusty, so far gone
I’m fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fucking wrong

Below is above you
Above is below me
I’m dying to try on these knives
You don’t know me

Hope not too much cause I feel insane
Need more than one to numb the pain

Got that covered, tramp, I brought 'em
How it creeps up on me so slowly
I don't notice my eyes rolling
To the back of my head and falling
Shit, somebody's calling
Can't answer the phone
Call 'em back when I'm 'bout to leave
Can't think straight, man, I'm so fucking blown

Face Melter (How to do impossible things),Death Grips,2011.0,"Face melter
Cock the barrel, trigger range
Swerving donuts 'gainst the grain
I blame ghost rider, whips the brain
Kaleidoscopic bullet train
Never gave up, just a clutch
Bitch

Burn a bitch and burn that strip to dust
Dust to ashes, ash to mush
Mashed off the madness man, combust
Black magic flames race out because they forgot they can't get down enough
Low to the ground limbo, don't touch this merchandise, it's way too much
Ride the currents like a snake, wicked rhymes
Whirlpools I'll wade through haters, posers, fools, and flakes
Through this breaks the rules it takes
But I not just bump what you waste your time and money tryin' to chase

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream
(Madness)

Don't trip man, just know we come
And won't even be close to done
Till shit hit the fan and make that flesh melt off your plastic face
Kill it till it dies, don't stop it until you feel that flatline drop
To hell and back, fuck yeah, why not?
(Why not?)
Smash till I break out, can't stop, won't stop, don't stop
Ghosts can't get caught, run it back, get cracked to the beat one time
Get-get-get back, keep in sync rhymes
Endorphins cashed by your own time
I'm coughing, the track freeze and unwind
Weed is of kind vaporize, freak man down from way this rides, how this rides
Feet don't touch the ground inside, I twist the rhythm pounds 'em on
How measurements of sound rewind
Forever and a day forgot
Forget to let it bang and walk the plank that hang from slang concocted to destroy the frame got bent by globe
This takes the pain in shock
(Ahh!)

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

Execution makes it hot, electrocute the wave, the shock
To the brains of heads that came to watch us claim the game haters can't knock us
Real ones bring that bloody bass, we came to melt your fucking face
You can keep it, I don’t want it
Back, my only inside pocket
All up on it, man get off it
Can’t you see me? Best to drop it
Cut it, quit it, quick, next topic
How we fuck it off and rock it
Paradox knot, disco sock it
Can't unplug it with your logic
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it
And unplug it with your -
Take out your eyes and watch it
Make you cry, feel like I lost it
Didn’t lose it, never had it
Just another clueless faggot
Bound and gagged by fear
Too pathetic to be tragic
Get that shit outta here

Don’t know why you waste your time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

I can’t deny I’ve not the slightest idea why
Even attempt to try
See them sigh
And settle with knowing barely enough to get by
Automatic supernova, so what? (Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic)
We’ll storm in the gates, subatomic
Flame drippin' onto this coal, setting hellfire to your face

We bring this for the ones who fiend to see the truth taken back in pain
The weakness of this scene of fucks who lack the nuts to claim
The streets from which that real shit comes to put you up on game
What's your name? Check it, bitch, it's Death Grips
Gutter rappin', anti-sleepin', no half-steppin'
Low life creepin', high-def freakin'

Set it off, no hesitation, audio invasion
But fuck that, can't thrust that to a beam, that shit had to go
Machine that lick and let 'em blow like cream, black
It's the magic host self-ream tactic
What the fuck? I mean that shit

Executors of that next shit
Nest eye to the left shit
That melt your face
Till your bloody neck gets ripped headless
Death Grips!
Bow down and take this what you get bitch
Rest in bits as I pace up and down the low end of the bass
Stomping rounds, automatic fire sounds in your face
Rip them fakes out their flesh
Come test this, get this straight, no escape
Rigor mortis, dead weight
Strung up and hung by hell-tensity drum
Bitch slap negative space
You thought that it makes through a cut
That bit only info can create
To properly uno, dos, trés

Ride through your sk-sk-sk-skull
Took hit to the face
Dead weight off the hook, don't hate
Shook out your footsteps and put back in your place

Triple X heat the rain in which we move
While they choose to get used everyday
Running highs you might break if their own reek of fear
Why you wish we were here
While I say, ""Get the fuck out my way""
Fit to get cut by fist gut if you stay
Thought you was on top, but not no more
That's right, whore, we're fucking you
(All right)
Fucking you
Thought you knew we had shit locked to the beat street don't stop
Licking shots for the old school freaks doing the robot
Hear this devil spit next lower heat blowin' up yo' spot
Fear high drop to your knees, trick, you know what we want
That's right, bitch, best believe this that shit you forgot
Ever was, but it is through my blood, need that fix
(All night)
Gotta catch that but lead off that high head row
Give me the mic and step back, cuz
Need to rip that, watch me bust
Where you going? Not knowing till we get there
Jack 'em off of it
The sword what you're holding till you get well
Have to hit 'em off with all you know and got that gold that make it cracked again
Control this while I hold this enema death they set my casket in
Growing like oceans, epileptic sex, can't get past this shit
Spiraling too much, on like king of the cleaners liquid acid trip
What's up with that next shit?
It's Death Grips
Illegal spit fire bum rushing you're tired as fuck
Give it up, I'm here, look, don't touch why
We're done and whip that, fuck you
I'll cut you, don't try it, can't deny it
Cracks off every time that you bite it
Try to fuck when I don't buy it
What's up with that next shit?
Yeah! It's Death Grips

""What's your name?"" Check it, bitch
Jack the rip in a brain
That's just shrunken head trip

Try to hang but got banged
By that black buku
Flamed to wax voodoo
Simulate dead ass like shrooms
Eat a cap and watch the bass launch the face off the moon
While I'm takin' new cakes and find
A new way to get blown
Your money’s my money, mayne
What’s up with the struggle?
Get down with it or get caged

When you start talking, I don't listen
I just wait for you to finish
And when you're done I'll say, ""That's crazy""
""Really?"" ""oh"" ""yeah"" but lately
I don't reply
You been denied
Sometimes I smile, sometimes I moan, sometimes I look away and nod
Sometimes I give no reply and watch your ice break like a jaw
Don't  waste your breath, the time was over before it started
When you arrived, I had already departed
(Now you know I'm-)
Walk on by
Crashed and burned
Forever rocking that worm
Called the worm
Just got high
Klepto war hand on the ride
Never answer when they hit me; why?
Never matter, pass on the lie
'Bout what happens after we die
Dust to ash, ashes to malt
Ghost all black, control the zone
The troll is threshed, I'm forced to ride
Lock your door
Argent clear
All the dead is souls galore
We just got spit in your eyes
Rabid dogs off the leash
From man to man as we beef
Get the fuck out of that Jeep
All hell leave I lead the sting
(Now you know I'm ready)
So love battle
Took the mantle
From the dogs who want more beef
For the law, code of the streets
With every oomph, we'll sue the pigs

Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane
Leave you for everyday people to teach
About crossing the fucking street
I am the pregnant snake
Stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs
Make your water break in the apple store
Sink or swim, who fucking cares
Cut the birth cords
And they pretend, press send
Fuck earthquakes with you

Still on the way

Back rumbling set my fingers, the Colosseum faints

Got the DNA of Gothic lemons
Shred it thirteen times out of eleven

Shed my skin

Soon your crew will be serving sandwiches named after me

Black Google,UnKnown,2011.0,"A black screen.
UNKNOWN MAN (V.O.): You've been here for some time.
A closing door can be heard.
INT. DARK ROOM
RIDE is pictured in a box on the left side of the screen. He is sitting in a chair in front of a singular light. How much of the light is exposed varies based on the positioning of his head.
RIDE: I'm not an actor.
RIDE sighs. Shuffling and other bodily movements can be heard in the background.
RIDE: How long is it gonna take?
Scattered electronic music begins playing in the background. Simultaneously, a second visual appears to the right of the one depicting RIDE. It shows RIDE from behind walking through a graveyard at night.
RIDE: When... I--I don't know. This is stupid. I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
The left video feed begins to pan in on a closeup of RIDE. His face remains darkened.
RIDE: I don't know exactly when, how many times--
RIDE (V.O.): Black google.
RIDE's own voice, dubbed over the video, cuts him off. At the same time, the left video feed cuts to a zoomed out view of RIDE, the light source behind his head now revealed in full.
RIDE: Uhh...
The left video feed slowly zooms on RIDE's face. Cut to black. RIDE begins to scream out repeatedly. With each scream, an ambiguous image lights and then fades on the right side of the screen.
RIDE (V.O.): Yeah... Yeah.
Between each of RIDE's exclamations, raucous guitar and drums play briefly, then stop.
RIDE (V.O.): Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
The right side of the screen cuts to RIDE in a nondescript room. With both fists bared, he charges at a wall. Just before his fists connect, the screen cuts away to a front view of his face and torso. Between each exclamation, cut to short clips of RIDE screaming and smashing chairs.
RIDE (V.O.): Rah! Yeah! Rah! Yeah! Rah!
An ultra closeup of RIDE's face is pictured left. He remains expressionless. Pictured right, a short clip of RIDE sitting in a chair, moving his hands wildly, and laughing manically plays and then disappears. Pictured left, the camera zooms out slowly to reveal RIDE's full face.
UNKNOWN MAN (V.O.): How long did it take to get to this place? ...To this place.
Pictured right, cut to a darkly lit hallway with plastic hanging from the walls. RIDE stumbles frantically along the hallway. The right side of the screen then cuts to black.
RIDE (V.O.): Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black.
Glitchy electronic music begins to play. Pictured right, a rear view of the room RIDE is sitting in pictured left appears. No one is sitting in the chair. Both sides of the screen fade to black. A full screen closeup of RIDE appears, lit with pink light. His face is raised upwards, his eyes are closed, and he is smiling.

So till dawn we're okay, but anyway

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink, and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so you’re knowing
You could get it tonight
But there’s so much around
Best take your time, do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that’s left of you
Is your most primal desires
Ass clappin', dick suckin', lock the door to the bathroom – quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin', cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think 'bout what you're doing

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Getting looser and looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin', you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a-
Cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me, I'm all about the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song?
You know, the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way, I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy’s hella horny
And their pussies don't smell

Argh...
Where's it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
(Bitch) Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Responsibility's cool, but there’s more things in life
Like getting your dick
Rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
It's time to find one and take one
Right now
It's time to find one and make one say
""I'm down""
Think I just found one, 'bout to break one off
Meanwhile

Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do, let's hope my story isn’t all about haters
Where's it at? Cause I want it like, man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cause I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Where's it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Bitch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?",https://genius.com/Death-grips-wheres-it-at-death-heated-lyrics

Get it
Known for it
Get it
Get it
Known for it

Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, till I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was 'bout to crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had to do it
Hacked into it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it

Let them eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits with a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon to freak this

You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds
Keep 'em guessin' endlessly
Never let 'em know where you're headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How to show 'em they don’t mean shit to me
Put 'em in their place, cause they ought to be
Kept in the dark, not 'posed to see never, but only so much of me
Double O.G. with a skeleton key
Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or it’ll take everything you own, floor it
(Get it, get it)

Known for it

Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How to ride it inside out of the clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don’t doubt it
You might just need it
Already did that
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out, abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don’t trip
If you have one let a man know so I could flip a bitch and kill it
(Get it)
Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it to wind, 'round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cause I will be damned if mine ever decays
Forever on attack gut check the blind
Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life
Cause I am known for it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
