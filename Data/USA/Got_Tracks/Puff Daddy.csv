I’ll Be Missing You,No Way Out,1997.0,"Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again

Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
[Refrain: Faith Evans & 
Puff Daddy
]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you
(
I miss you B.I.G.
)

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits,
 stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face
[Bridge: 112 & 
Puff Daddy
]
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every day that passes
Is a day that I get closer
Every move I make, every single day
To seeing you again
We miss you B.I.G
Every night I pray, every step I take
And we won't stop
'Cause we can't stop
Every move I make, every single day
That's right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
We miss you B.I.G

Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (We miss you)

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (I'll be missin' you)
Thinkin' of the day (Thinkin' of the day) when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (We miss you)",https://genius.com/Diddy-ill-be-missing-you-lyrics
Victory,No Way Out,1998.0,"One, one two
Check me out right here yo

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
You can turn the track up a little bit for me
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
All up in my ears
Better now than never, business before pleasure
The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight (YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin', make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up
Our music keeps you movin', what are you provin'?
Turn that shit all the way up, yeah
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Music's gettin' louder
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
This shit is hot!
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nuthin' but choked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'ma win 'cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uhh) you rakin' up plaques

In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the Feds hate me
The son of (*Satan*), they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit; you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me the underboss
Of this holocaust, truly yours, Frank White

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin' like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, we just macin' them, placin' them
In fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman
Y'all just betray men, we spray men, I position competition
Another day in the life of the commission

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?

Ayo, can you hear me out there?
Ayo turn me up, nobody can hear me out there
That's good, it's all fucked up now
Y'all know it's all fucked up now right?
What the fuck I'ma do now?
What I'ma do now?
Can y'all hear me out there?

We got the real live shit!!
Can y'all hear me out there?
Fuck y'all niggas wanna do
It's all fucked up now.. what I'ma do now, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now",https://genius.com/Diddy-victory-lyrics
I Need A Girl (Pt. 2),We Invented the Remix,2002.0,"Yeah, is that bounce right here
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man
This is what I need

Girl you made me believe again
If you happy then be with him, go 'head mommy breathe again
Go 'head mommy breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head mommy make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a trifilin' mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lye with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life

What I need (Yeah take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

Listen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
'Cause mommy I've done been around the world
Seened a lot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mommy you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes I need affection, let's go Mario

Girl what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leaking in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby!

Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

Ay yo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sun rise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you I believe in
Love you till the day I stop breathing
I love you girl

This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me
To share the dreams that I Believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah oh yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few you would like to bone but
Chicks that romance me don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not where my plans be
Need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to Delancey to trips to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusin' me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin' me
Maybe it's the money or maybe you ain't used to me?
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusin' me
That's why I need me a girl that be true to me
Know 'bout the game and know how it do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world, girl, it's you and me
Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride with me)
I need a girl to make my wife
(I need a girl who makes me feel so good inside)

Nobody else, she’s all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I done met a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm gettin' money and the game gettin' deeper
Yo, on some real shit, I need somebody I could chill with 
(Let's chill)
I need somebody I could build with
I need somebody I could hold tight
Winter time in a full-length Snow White
Anytime we together feel so right

Because of you, girl, now I understand life

I need a girl to be my wife (My wife)
Nobody else, she’s all mine (Yeah)
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn, I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy's style
Shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine (Mine, all mine)

We ain't gon' stop

Now it's Sean on the hot track, melt like it's hot wax
Put it out, all the stores, bet you could shop that (that's right)
Leave a nigga with a hot hat, fronting like
Bad boy ain't got tracks (nigga stop that)
There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)
Did fed time, outta town pie-flipper
Turn Cristal into a crooked-I sipper
Everybody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in bad boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (ehehe)
I'm through with bein a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her
Mase wanna be the one you respect, even when you're vexed
Rock Versace silks over a steel V-neck
Got green never seen so you suck my jewels
Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise
Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)
Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes

Don't push us, 'cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin', not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah

Broken glass everywhere
If it ain't about the money, Puff, I just don't care (that's right)
I'm that goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys
Spend time in H-A-W-A-I-I
Mase, can you please stop smoking la-la?
Puff, why try? I'm a thug, I'mma die high
I be out in Jersey, puffin' Hershey
Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby
Though I'm never drug free when I'm the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna: rock the rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)
I'm like, ""Damn, how these niggas got that trife?
Used to be my man, how he gonna plot on my wife?""
Do you think he snake me 'cause he hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hatin' Degree? (Ahaha!)

Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no
I got to keep on movin'

Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah)
Where your chicks at? (yeah)
Where your whips at? (where dey at?)
Wherever you get stacks, I'mma fix that
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)
Don't knock me 'cause you're boring
I'm record sales soaring, straight touring
Simply a lot of men be wantin' to hear me
'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)
We spend cheese, in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black, and famous, with money hangin' out the anus
And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)
And got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet

Don't push us, 'cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin', not to, lose our heads, a-hah-hah-hah-hah

Why you wanna take us under
Why you wanna take us under?

Young G’s,No Way Out,1997.0,"(Man! I'm back man!)
Uhh, check it out, uhh
I steps in, where the Mo's and the hoes at, baby?
Fuck all that pretty shit
Taking it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggas know the deal
Niggas know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars (yeah)
We built in radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop (haha)
Are we gonna stop? Shit man, if my squad go broke
Your squad oughta choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre (uh-huh)
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt (yeah)
Got nice watches, nice cars, nice bitches and rings (c'mon)
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things (that's right)
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake (uh-uh)
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break (uh-huh)
When your fake ass friends don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it (uh)
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all asking for hits (yeah)
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but separately 'cause now I charter my own (c'mon)
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all 'em playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us (yeah)
They can't touch us,
 
why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release date's bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets (These ghetto streets)
And every day, they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the barrel, with the chrome, with the lead
'Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flown through your head
I been rich, I been poor, I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone's like the falling of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that 'cause he's observant
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, unseen like Allah's body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the R-shottie, that got cats, likening me
To the mob John Gotti, rap dudes biting me 'cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me, y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly, we mourn all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk 'em through it, you know, talk 'em through it
Know these beats is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness, and y'all knew this when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty in a girdle coming out of B-W-I
(In school) I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die
And it's gon' happen, whether rapping or clapping, have it your way
'Cause if that's my dough you're trapping, I'm clapping your way
It's for the ghetto...

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive (stay alive)
It's just reality
 (reality)

Damn, it feel good to see people up on it (uh)
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it (uh-huh)
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GSs with BBs on it, supreme schemes
To get richer than Richie, quickly, 
niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumference, mad bitches with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestses under they Coogi's
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigger niggas represent
Driving dirty in J-30s gettin' bent (uh-huh)
And to my hit hoes, my murder mamis
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punani, like heiny
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds of choke (uh-huh)
Got lawyers watching lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' often in my loft, of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise, open my eyes, no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half-black, half-oriental, eighty-six, she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental
What? From a, from a young G's perspective, uhh...
What? From a, from a young G's perspective, uhh...

Just some ghetto boys

Just some ghetto boys

Last Night,Press Play,2007.0,"Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
Girl, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out, with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see, it all belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
(You said you couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(That should never stop you)
And I'm sitting here (Sitting there) with this blank expression
(I can't read your mind, baby)
And the way I feel (The way I feel), I wanna curl up like a child
(Ooh baby)

I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away

Last night (Oh, last night), I couldn't even get an answer
(Oh baby, what you wanna do to me?)
I tried to call (Alright), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why would you just hurt me, baby? Oh)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
(Don't save me baby, don't, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)

Tell me what words to say to make you come back
Don't break me like that (Ooh)
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home (Baby)
With you, I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone
Whatever you do, just don't leave me

Last night (Yeah), I couldn't even get an answer (Didn't get an answer, baby)
(Oh) I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Oh, couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)

This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me (Belongs to me)
I love you so much (So, so), I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?

Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
And call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you

{Phone dialing and ringing}
""Hello
Hey what's-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you, right?
But for them couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house

That's really how it goes down, right?""",https://genius.com/Diddy-last-night-lyrics
Been Around the World,No Way Out,1997.0,"This Mase, you know what I'm saying
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference
A lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

Now trick what, lace who, that ain't what Mase do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray
No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions
I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz...)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there, girlfriend, I'm ticklish
And I be switching ve's with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies cum
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks
I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes

I Want the Love,No Way Out 2,2014.0,"I hate funerals, I love life. I hate when I see a whole bunch of people just crying in a funeral on some fake shit. They ain’t really love a nigga while they was there. See I’m a different type of nigga, I wanna be honest with y'all. I need the love now, if y’all motherfuckers gonna be crying and playing thirty minute specials when I’m gone (an hour special that I’m gone) fuck that, love me while I’m here.  Love me while I’m here, I had to tell a bitch

(I want the love) ‘Cause all I see is haters
And this money got these niggas catchin’ favors and I tell ya
(I want the love) ‘Cause all I know is getting money
Knockin’ at the door, I’m like who is it? Bitch I tell ya
(I want the love)

I’m a rich nigga, I don’t get mad, I just get paper (I don’t)
I don’t catch feelings, I catch flights, that’s brick paper (for what)
For one rider at Bad Boy, that’s one side
These killers with me don’t fuck around, they jump fast like off sides
I’m ‘bout to creep up on the billi, poppin' these bottles like Willy
I know they gon’ hate when I’m here, but when it’s all over they feel me
If you gon' show love when I’m dead, you better off just tryna kill me
‘Cause I’m gon' ball on niggas, and I ain’t talkin’ about you, I hate all ya’ll niggas, ugh!
Ten Birkins for your main ho, I could buy that
Last week I made a hundred mill, you should try that
I’m a real nigga, they all see it, can’t hide that
I’ll touch down in your city, fuck shit up, nigga then fly back!

(I want the love) ‘Cause all I see is haters
And this money got these niggas catchin’ favors and I tell ya
(I want the love) ‘Cause all I know is getting money
Knockin’ at the door, I’m like who is it? Bitch I tell ya
(I want the love)

I wanted the money and wanted the love
Wanted them bitches that wanted the drugs
They wanted the molly and wanted the weed
I walk in the building, get love in the club
Love in the streets, bitch it’s Meek Milly
Them niggas was haters, I love what they was
‘Cause all of that hating was my motivation
Now I got the paper, it was what it was
It is what it is, look at me now
Living the life and I'm fucking these hoes
Niggas that hate me still come to my shows
Shawty ain’t ready to fuck up my Rose, give a fuck if I go
Straight to the money and back to the hood where they takin’ that money
We package the good and we break up that money
You act like you good, better save you some money (hater)

(I want the love) ‘Cause all I see is haters
And this money got these niggas catchin’ favors and I tell ya
(I want the love) ‘Cause all I know is getting money
Knockin’ at the door, I’m like who is it? Bitch I tell ya
(I want the love)

All the hoes gon' love me, (and all the suckers gon' hate too)
(Been trill like Bun B, can't name nothin' I ain't do)
We race to Vegas on jets from Miami, Vegas went back
And I did Liv in the same night, (woke up, lil' nigga, what's next?)
Since more money, power, respect, (most these niggas probably in debt)
(Back when Michael Jackson was moonwalkin', I was still cutting them checks)
And I still come through my set, shit, (and they ain't showing love yet? Shit)
(It's mo' money, mo' problems, what my nigga Big said best)

(I want the love) ‘Cause all I see is haters
And this money got these niggas catchin’ favors and I tell ya
(I want the love) ‘Cause all I know is getting money
Knockin’ at the door, I’m like who is it? Bitch I tell ya

Satisfy You,Forever,1999.0,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier


Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true


Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you
 until fade

This one right here goes out to all my sisters",https://genius.com/Diddy-satisfy-you-lyrics
Best Friend,Forever,1999.0," (Mario)
I've seen a lot of things in my life
Alot of ups and downs
Made alot of mistakes
No matter what, you've always been by my side
You've always been my best friend
You're the love of my life (Oh)
You're everything to me (Oh)
You never left my side (You're my best friend)
I love you so much (Yes, you are)
You're my best friend

Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you
Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen
Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord
1 - 
Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling
You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that He spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you
Willies with mac millies know how you get down
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town
Just remember when you pray, God is love
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs
Life as we know it, it all begins with Him
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him
Repeat 1

Been two and a half years since my man Big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, God gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour
Looked me in the eyes and ask ""What you doing unhappy?""
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out
Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take
I told him ""I'm too much blessed with faith""
""And living for Christ"" and then he said ""Manifest the great""
All of a sudden, what I'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on
Repeat 1 While:

You mean everything to me
You've been with me from day one
Even when I thought nobody was there
You were there
You're my best friend
I love you like no other
There is no feeling like this in the world
If you can relate to what I'm feeling
Put your hands in the air for me
Let me see you
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me
Clap your hands, come on
Thank you Jesus
You always hear me when I'm calling
Always catch me when I fall, yeah
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole world to see
That you've always been, you'll always be
My best friend
I love you Jesus
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses
As I forgive those who trespass against me
Thank you",https://genius.com/Diddy-best-friend-lyrics
Victory 2004 (Album Version),Bad Boy’s 10th Anniversary: The Hits,2004.0,"Ten years

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
Better now than never, business before pleasure
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
And when you hear something make sure you hear it right
Don't make an ass outta yourself by assuming
My music keeps you moving, what are you proving?
You know that I'm two levels above you, baby
Hug me, baby, I'ma make you love me, baby

It's ten years and we still running this motherfucker
Yeah, as we proceed to give you what you need
It's all fucked up now
What the fuck y'all gonna do now?

Yo, yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and Berretas
Yeah faggot, if I want it I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me or I gotta grab it
Don't make a ass outta yourself tryna stop me
I'm cocky, rap's ""Rocky"", nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm eight levels above you nigga
I'll plug you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga
I'm the wrong one to provoke
And rattin' on niggas is only gon' leave you smoked
So the only thing left now is toast for these cowards
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit 'til we start approachin' these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers

In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit, you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like ""Jurassic""
""Park"" did, quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?

Ayyo, it can't stay dark for long
They say its darkest before the dawn
Calms before the storm
I'm happy Mason Betha's now preachin' the Psalms
And I can see B.I. rockin' the Sean John
Yeah right, this is what ""Life's After's"" like
B.I. Frank White, your ""Bad Boy For Life""
No matter what the public say we gon' prove
It ain't another MC that could fill ya shoes
'Cause Biggie Smalls is the illest
Realest my stones the chillest, got homes and villas
Overseas and what was me, I found out
Other MC's been tryin' to find ya route
It's ill when MC's used to be on other shit
Took home ""
Life after Death
"" and they studied it
Listened to the double disc
Now they all spit, like they all legit
Frank tell how we did it, go

We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, with just macin' them
Placin' them in fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
We spray men, I position, competition
Another day in the life of the commission

I got a industry gangstress that argues and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit gon' get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm slidin' through the Ruckers, with Prada on the Chuckers
So the spring break hoes, home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I'll sick Rottweiler's on you fuckers, cops followin' to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow the soul outta hero
I'ma break 'fore I lay on the floor buried
Besides, every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, I'm smokin' by the big screen
And changin' the channel looks like I'm playin' the game boy
I know the watch botherin' ya vision
But reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like it's part of ya religion

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?

And if your record ain't have it (like that, like that)
Nah, then your song, then your song wasn't (workin')
Ran into this young jawn, tell her come home
She asked for a check I said, ""Bitch is you (workin')

Shout out to my people with a job
I hope you don't fall asleep tomorrow when you (workin')

I turned around like ""Nigga can't you see me, (workin')""

Wanna be ballers? Shot-callers? Brawlers
Who be dippin in the Benz wit the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin to get my hands on some 
Grants like Horace
Yeah livin the raw deal, three course meals
Spaghetti, fettucini, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin to bury
Seven zeros, over in Rio de Janeiro
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 everyday
, that's my word
Swimmin in women wit they own condominiums
Five plus fives, who drive millenniums
It's all about the Benjamins, what?
I get a fifty-pound bag of ooh for the mutts
Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
In something European chromed out with a clutch, what

I wanna hold figures, fuck being a broke nigga
Drinkin malt liquor, drivin a Bro' Vega
I'm wit Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers (uhh)
Rockin Bejor denims, wit gold zippers (c'mon)
Lost your touch we kept ours, poppin Cristals
Freakin the three-quarter reptiles (ahahah)
Enormous cream, forest green, Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'mma scheme (that's right)
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you (uh-uh)
'Cause I leave you, I'm only here
For that green paper with the eagle

I'm strictly tryin to cop those, colossal-sized Picassos
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's (whoo!)
Mienda, with cash flowing like Sosa
And a Latin chick transporting in her chocha
Stampedin over, pop Mo's, never sober
Lex and Range Rovers dealin weight by Minnesota (uhh)
Avoidin NARC's wit camcorders and Chevy Novas (uh-huh)
Stash in the buildin wit this chick named Alona (uh-huh)
From Daytona, when I was young I wants to bone her (uh-huh)
But now I only hit chicks that win beauty pageants (ahahaha)
Trickin, they takin me skiing, at the Aspens (c'mon)
Uhh, gangsta mental, stay poppin Cristal
Pack a black pist-al in the Ac' Coupe that's dark brown (whoo!)
Pinky-ringin, gondolas wit the man singin

Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Asi mismo me engañaste

Honey I keep you hot and wet, just flooded with ice
And you can spend all day and chill, all night
Come sleep with the king, peep what I bring
Every few weeks it's a bigger size ring
Carats ain't nothin' when the cabbage ain't nothin'
I got habits like goin' to Paris I ain't frontin'
You can never need for nothin', only one pipe
Would you like to go to dinner, wit Jordan and his wife?
Am I moving fast? It could happen real soon
Thousand dollar shoes, dance in ballrooms
You know the dress, that got the party impressed
You'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine
I try to address it, but you never get the message
You the water in my life and I'm trapped in the desert
I never seen a honey sweeter, won't stop
Till I get her cause I need her, my señorita

Mami ven aqui
I wanna be your papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor)
Baby I need you conmigo
Your style is my steelo te necesito aqui
(te necesito yo a ti, te amo)
Baby come to me
Baby come to me

Her name is Carmen, she live down in Spanish Harlem
And I think I have the key to her secret garden
When I seen her, I used to want to beg her pardon
But I was scared, I ain't really have the heart
And when she walked by, I would panic
Even though I was cool with her pops Lou, the mechanic
Went to school with her brother, that's right
I never could build up the words to express how I loved her
Long hair, pretty face, slim waist
The kind that you marry and take to another place 
And exchange vows, spend thous
Make love in a hot tub, where there's a hot towel
She'll be loyal without being spoiled
You can shuck all you want but she's still gonna ignore you
Makes no sense to say mira
Cause bet she won't turn him around, she's my señorita

Mami ven aqui
I wanna be your papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor)
Baby I need you conmigo
Your style is my steelo te necesito aqui
(te necesito yo a ti, te amo)
Baby come to me
Baby come to me

I rock regular clothes, as well as Gucci too
And if you don't believe me, ask Groovy Loo
You're beautiful, so I stay true to you
I think you oughta see things like Bermuda boo
No cooperation, got me walkin' around pacin'
Patient, waitin' for my day of penetration
Your relationships is bullshit, your man is a prick
With a little bit of bricks and a whip baby
Please, I got plenty of V's
What you want the pink C-2, or the yellow 3-2-5
That's when I opened my eyes
I was dreamin', damn it was all a surprise
But it felt real, I hopped up in a wet chill
Yet still gotta keep this one concealed
Even though I never got a chance to meet her
I still need her, cause she's my señorita

Mami ven aqui
I wanna be your papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor)
Baby I need you conmigo
Your style is my steelo te necesito aqui

Everyday (Amor),MMM (Money Making Mitch),2015.0,"True badman no cry
Some'll live and some'll die
Real man kill and don't say
Move in silence every day, every day

Money-making ability
Theme music to the Godfather trilogy
Yeah, I just do it for the thrill in me
Come through and facilitate the facility
Walk out on a tab, they try billing me
Caught a plug on a diesel, that's from the Phillipines
Start asking yourself ""damn, how good is he
To make it look so simple?"" but how could it be?
Specially when the work is enormous
Proper preparation, perfect performance
Never let 'em over-exert your endurance
A liability really can hurt your insurance
This is the hustler's thesis
Money accumulates but the product decreases
All types of weed, coke and hashishes
Move it without touching it, telekinesis

True badman no cry
Some'll live and some'll die
Real man kill and don't say
Move in silence every day, every day

The definition of power
Found out that them dudes that's repping with you is cowards
Your right-hand man been effing you on the powder
Cut a body part off and they leave it by city island
We get to the money, the money get to us
Could've left but we stayed, how slick of us
Love us or be sick of us
We millionaires, my niggas up
You think of Puff, come on, you think of Mitch
Either you talking money or you talking gibberish
B.I. died, was New York mine or Jigga shit?
Both did clothing and liquor, got into bigger shit
King gotta fight for the throne, you gotta live with this
Friendly competition in music, you should consider this
Just a little moment, I figured I'd revisit it
Cause y'all niggas is talking it but ain't living it

True badman no cry
Some'll live and some'll die
Real man kill and don't say
Move in silence every day, every day

Pray for the sight and light pot
Death is certain and life's not
If I'm in the booth then you know that the mic hot
If I'm in a cyph, who could tell what I might drop?
My context complex
I'm just playing god in the devil's contest
Are you cursed or blessed when you take your last breath?
With your first one, let me dumb down, get the verse done
Walk with the angels and demons, I'm not the first one
Soul'll be out of my body before the hearse come
Dig me, then you're used to the witty
Old soul, I was here when Medusa was pretty
New York nigga, roof of the city, I'm in the coupe looking pretty
I got work, I still move with the biggie
Playing 10 crack amendments, it's never a lack of hammers
This is called painting the picture without a canvas

Stop
Ayo, that shit was cold, B
(Mitch was a real star
And when the light caught him, he always looked good
And Mitch got love from everybody. I mean everybody)

True badman no cry
Some'll live and some'll die
Real man kill and don't say
Move in silence every day, every day

They say I'm overrated when they weigh in
The fish outgrew the pond that a nigga play in
It's like a blowout but the starter just wanna stay in
When you rap about the shit you simultaneously weigh in
I'm tryna find peace for the love of my brother
Who dodged the white powder, I couldn't, I'm covered
The price of blood diamonds is killing our cousins
While high blood sugar just killing my mother
Two bezels later and another Porsche
It's midnight, the sunrise leather says the Devil Lost
Daytona wing at the dealership
Drug money in the back office, get the peeling shit
Wooo! I ain't never been platinum, nigga
Yuugh! Every car since was platinum, nigga
Wooo! More liquid than you rapper niggas
Only Mister was a blacker nigga
Colour purple on the label
Off-white all over the table like a sable
Sniff, when your curse is your gift
Your nitch get deported like Arizona rich, he'll be back

Security strapped, still stackin' a million
Stunt with a stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it, I'm willin' to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats (Look at me, man)
Hop up clean up outta the Phantom

Fly as befo', cool as the wind
Got hits go back like Juice and Gin, yeah

You can't fall 'til my aura call her

How you flexing when your crew ain't shit

Probably trick on something you ain't hit
Try to do me but the shoe ain't fit, and your jewels ain't lit

Break law pay feds off

You got the kittens fed up with your fake set up

Maybach Music
Big blunts and grass, Maybach on a dash
40 carat gold Cartier on a class
Mink coats with shooters in of the Land Cruiser
My maneuvers sparking these lil' rumors
Duffle bags, Percocets, the Rugers
Still the smoothest at roughing up all the jewelers
Danny Glover, up the pistol, pussies undercover
Propositions and proposals, bring 'em on the double
Raising the K's in the days and
Jaylen that brain is amazing
Top tier, egotistical when he arrogant
Skyscraper, kilo up in the cabinet
For bad bitches who snort lines the fourth time
Cîroc white, blue dot, you should pour mine
East Coast fat boy, he be so braggadocios
Air forces, mansions, and I'm on the ocean
Benefits, free my niggas, I'm talking fish and grits
Immigrants came a long way up out the tenements
Gunshots hereditary, get your daddy buried
With my march, got out of prison February
Cold game, ménage à trois and my gold chain
Bad Boy, Buggatis in all four lanes
The script flip when the spliff lit
Double M cruise ship with a thick bitch

Click, click, uh, uh, uh
Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Crystal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, 
rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker
Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know, I treat my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana drippin'
Big poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogota
With Colombian niggas named Panama
Enrique and shit
Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stocked
Singles on top, Benjamins under the rest of 'em
Advancin' from duplex to mansion
Stashing keys, hidin' G's overseas
VCR's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Into stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sands
Discussing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves my rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent

 Yeah
(I'll never betray you)
 Mmm, mmm, mmm
(I love you baby)
 I love you baby

I met her Uptown on Dyckman, aight then
Talkin that, how she only dealt with businessmen
Niggas baggin joints, money off and on the books
The ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook
About them, I doubt them cats waitin for me
You know them niggas, them big dudes across the street
She say, ""Yeah, they from over on Mayfair""
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out
This bitch over there with them pointin the chief out
They want beef out here, they gon' get it
In the worst way, I'mma show em how Black play
Roll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise
It's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto
Ran out of ammo and started, throwin bottles
Runnin, and I ain't lookin back for shit
Crooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this
(I'll get you back)

I love you baby No you don't
You drive me crazy That's right
I'll never betray thee Uhh
I love you baby C'mon

Yo since the last altercation I been on the street
Seein honey at the club every week and not speak
I'mma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with Babe Bro
Used to call my crib from C-Seventy-Four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
Youse about to get fucked with no gel
I'mma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin
And plan your extermination, word


It took a while to peep your style, Miss I-B-M-workin
Low profile single, house in Staten Island
And Manhattan while, them same cats
You sent to get me boo, is on they to get you
Fuckin' witchu, that small time crack dealin' nigga
He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too
Shit's real, you think you gonna set me up
And get away scot free without some type of injury
Nah kill it, I'mma flip the script on you
Same thing you did to me, I'mma do it to you
Who knew she was the female Rambo
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans and
In the end, she had to be the Last Bitch Standin'
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over
Assumin' I'll go back to my everyday life
Of a rich millionaire just rockin' the mic
Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt
And admire how the chick went out",https://genius.com/Diddy-i-love-you-baby-lyrics

High roller, throw a million dollars in the crowd

With the greedy thing, I turn Citibank to Diddy bank
And I don't care about your piggy bank
You a silly boy, I'm a billy boy
I ain't got to touch it, get one at my young Philly boys
Harlem renaissance, upper echelon

Nigga please, used to spend G's in a restaurant
7 on the entrée, 3 on the dessert
Ask for the job cause you know you need to wizzerk, jizzerk

Way back when heroin became a epidemic

Only hurting your image, your whole life's a gimmick
And we can't click 'cause you all petty
I done told you I'm heavy, like New York Freddy
It's a honor to meet him, a pleasure to speak with him
Trunk full of champagne bottles with leak in 'em
Street value say it's a million in each of 'em
Contracts in the hood ain't no breaching 'em
Yeah, the profit is tremendous (yup)
But the gossip is still endless, no way you can offend us
Peter Shue parties with Madonna in attendance, wow!

Old wild man, can I ask you nice?
Swimming in the dark 'cause the pool got lights
Money in the bank yeah who got dice?
Harlem World
, 
Double Up
 and I can pull that twice, yeah
You got ice and you got ice
Then I must got glaciers, fuck it I got paper
Looking at my house and fuck it I got acres
Drinking the liquor but not using the chaser
If rap's the desert then I'm the oasis
I guess I'm demanding a standing ovation
Look at the map I can land in locations
That's slick talk, two fifth talk
In Cali it's kush but in New York it's piff talk
Why don't you come listen to Mitch talk
Pulling the 6 off
Rich nigga that tricks off
In the telly knocking your bitch off.. Mitch

You must want me to blow your brains out
Gift when you present with niggas that move the 'caine out
Did you really know what the pain 'bout?
When you start eating and niggas come with their fangs out
You like fuck it I got my chain out
Got a couple goons but they don't know what the game 'bout
Are they really ready to bang out?
Call my guns nuts so fuck it I let 'em hang out
She rock Vera, me I'm Alexander Wang'd-out
Not that clear if I'm insane or sane now
'Cause I see the sunshine in the rain now (I see)
I could feel the loss in the game now
Since hey now, had a baby on the way now
I be strapped up like get down and lay down
No school zone, no shell in the playground
I don't fuck around, I don't sniff what I weigh, clown

Is This the End?,No Way Out,1997.0,"Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then (Is this the end?)
Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then

Sometimes I be wakin' up at high noon
Sayin', ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin' I'ma die soon
I just tell 'em keep seekin', but when they sleepin'
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin' to maintain, because the future is untold
'Til the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked 'til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
'Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearin' no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessin' that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin'?
Or is it all in confusion? Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin'
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the TECs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it 'cause I'm a rich man
Or is it tryin' to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand?
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin'
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete 'em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin' to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holdin' the trigger and his finger's steady chokin' it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then (Is this the end?)

Just, can't, let, go (Is this the end?)
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam? Now it's on, let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw his man in a Landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion

I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
(But who are you?) The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
Rain or sunshine, gotta keep one eye, nigga, I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
'Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet fumes when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, 'bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us intertwined with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
'Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, 'cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die 'til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Let's step off up in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his mall get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin' weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
But wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin' close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin', but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then (Is this the end?)
Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then (Is this the end?)

Just, can't, let, go (Is this the end?)
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then",https://genius.com/Diddy-is-this-the-end-lyrics
Happily Ever After,MMM (Money Making Mitch),2015.0,"Once upon a time, a prince asked a beautiful princess ""Will you marry me?"" The princess said no, and the prince lived happily ever after. And he rode motorcycles and fucked skinny, big-titted broads, and hunted and fished whenever the fuck he wanted, and went to naked bars, and dated women half his age, and drank whiskey, beer, Captain Morgan, and snorted cocaine off strippers' asses, and never heard bitching, and never paid child support or alimony. And ate pussies and ass-fucked cheerleaders and kept his house and guns, and never got cheated on while he was at work, and all his friends and family thought he was fucking cool as hell, and he had tons of money in the bank, and he left the toilet seat up

My dome is strapped and she'll die for nothing
You came here for them, came out with nothing
My whole team stunting, neck full of gold, haaan
I'm high and drunk, don't listen to this
No OG or Puff, got Christian women
She came from the block, it was picture women
Hop on this yacht, come fishing with me
All these bad bitches taking pictures with me
All the police taking pictures of me
New Lambo, old pistol with me
Got bando out the window of it

I want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing
Don't give me nothing

I spoke to Ye, he said ""I am a god""
Got no time though
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
You can't take it with you, you might as well ball
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
I take from the rich and I give to the poor
I want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing

I want a bad bitch from overseas
I need my dick sucked, I mean, on your knees
I roll a paper plane, go where I'm supposed to be
I'm probably in the clouds and I ain't looking down
No problems, I got all smiles
The niggas with me, they all wild
Counting money, let it all pile
They've been waiting a long while
For a young nigga with his own style
She hit my phone and I go to her house
Give me that brain, told her open her mouth
Know when I'm 'bout, money, marijuana, pussy
Some things I don't go without
Come to my house, probably get lost
Have you stuffing weed in cones you won't make it out
I be so high that I'm floating
Fucked this bitch and now she open
Talking 'bout she want a real one
All these niggas, I don't feel none
Hundred thousand dollar bills on her
Wrote another thousand dollar meal
I'm the king and all my niggas loyal still
Take your bitch and fuck her, crazy for the thrill
I ain't tripping on you niggas cause I'm making paper
Laugh now, she gon' fuck me later

What You Gonna Do?,No Way Out,1997.0,"It's a Hell Up in Harlem, fuckit, another day
Another dollar, wake up, to the barking from the Rottweilers
Pull the collars, make em sit for the Godfather
Then I holler, to Justin my son, run the water
For the shower, trust fund scholarship sure to give him power
Baby momma call, she pick him up, in about an hour
Now free to go, free to blow, with the calicos
And the navajos, it's just the way this player knows
Anything goes, finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam
Picked me up, in the tan Lex Land
Wanted breakfast down at Pan Pan's, what's your favorite dish?
He ordered cheese eggs and grits, I had the swordfish
What is this? Three niggas dressed in black
Roleys on they wrist, feathers in they hat
One tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack
Put my finger on the trigger
Then I asked him, ""Whatchu want nigga?""

Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go
Whatchu gonna do when you can't take no mo'
You gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go

I pray to God that I'm dreamin, I know my family
Wouldn't take it, when the doctor said, ""He ain't make it""
Mom Dukes cryin, baby mom full of grief
How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?
Now she got beef with them bitches up the street
All because I used to creep, with her girlfriend Sharese
She knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation
On every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uhh
That's why niggas wanna twist my shit, flip my wig
Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gibbs
Before they draw, niggas threw me to the floor
Drill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket
They wanna rip my arms out the socket, fuckin heathens
Love to see a nigga stop breathin
I heard a voice sing out, ""Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?
Here's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads""
G'night Bone


Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision
Watching my life go down, like Christion
Listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac millis
Spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game
And deuce deuces can't stand the pain
Little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard
They just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka
Blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers
Three headed for my chest straight, the other two
Came a little late, and just barely missed my face
I'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars
One of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars
Shit, I'm just tryin to live, so I can raise my kid
And own the world, bone all the girlie girls
That's when I finally figured out
That's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father
And I didn't even bother to ask no further questions
No more confessions only suggestions
I think Sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up
From the rear, and Sam was the only nigga there
Then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum
Sam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin them
Niggas didn't even get to peep
Lil' Kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat
Clips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet
Once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead
They fled, and they waved, hot lead
If I aimed up, I'd be on my deathbed
Sucker move, for that they don't get no props
Lil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots
We in the block, no Land posters just old posters
Of gangsta niggas I see ghosts of gangsta figures
I'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car
Took me in the saloon and said, ""Puffy, there you are""
Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots
Washin dishes, I guess for goin out like bitches
I smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth
Happiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt
That night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin
That's when I heard the bustin, yeah",https://genius.com/Diddy-what-you-gonna-do-lyrics

God is all I fear, money machine is all I hear
Where are you? Tearing up the mall, I buy the mall out there
It’s the bomb, no fall out gear
No shelter, Helta Skelta
Bubble like alka seltzer
Look at me, king, I’ll melt ya
Bars and cars give them the scrunchy face
Violate then find out how your lung taste
Got money to bungee, you don’t want this hate
Yo, I can throw it down and watch it come back up
You food, but you don’t really want this plate
(Nah, slow down, Diddy, you’re killing them
Pictures on billboards, know them bitches is feeling him
You still blowing up like you helium
Cars like spaceships, niggas thought it was aliens)
This is Harlem, niggas that push foreigns
Little homie shoot with the left like James Harden
Excuse me, money, never to beg pardon
Jacuzzi in a Sprinter, models take part in
Tell me where the money is at and I'm departing

Welcome to the auction
We selling flows, riches glow, solid gold
Big chains froze, flashy rings, all you need
What you want nigga, what you see
Nigga, welcome to the auction, we got it all
Soul ball, fortune fame , riches, cars
Vintage frames, drinks to pour, minks to the floor
Nigga, you already know

I’m chosen, something like Beethoven
Comes out golden anytime I compose it
Watch gruesome, chain ferocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
The tub filled with roses
Coming to America money, we Earl Jones it
King Joffery, James Brown, now watch me
Keep going knowing they can’t stop me
Wearing 40 belows, the coats Rocky
Lambo truck same color as broccoli
Acting like Tyson when he was twenty something
Bitch seen the money and came, I call that money cumming
(Ask what’s a couple of mills, I say twenty something)
I'mma a keep on moving, I hear the drummer coming
(Bright like them time square lights the way I bubble something
Nights and ice for the ruckers, I know the summer's coming
Dyckman, double parked, all the niggas  just love the frontin')
I’m like, ""fuck nigga, then show them something""
(Cause I’m shining like I can glow or something
Throwing money in the air, but i don’t owe them nothing)

Hold up, let me show you how to post up
Let me show you how to do it when you leaning on the 'rossa
Let me show you how you talking
Switch up the way that you walking
You can get it at the auction

All that facade rapping and jaw yapping
Nigga, shut the fuck up and watch God happen
Come rain, sleet, or hail, no sales stop
Crib on the island, gotta sail to the mail box
Still send mails to my homie in the jail spot
Roll a big L, bump Big, and let a shell pop
Bodyguards tail wifey to the nail shop
So you can get popped and she won’t drop the Chanel box
Get on my city, nigga, westside ride, eastside bang
Sheeeze, I came so far, GS Lex to G5 planes
At least i’ve trained
You say it’s crazy good, we not sane
That’s the beast I’ve tamed
These shots came b y frame for no reason
Somebody gotta be filming this
When you got this much God somebody gotta be villainess
Somebody gotta be feeling like it’s prophecy filling in
We gotta be boss, somebody gotta be middle men
When you do it this big somebody gotta belittle it
Literally it’s like the lottery picked us
And you ain’t who you depicted in a lot of these pictures

Welcome to the auction
We selling flows, riches glow solid gold
Big chains froze, flashy rings, all you need

But bring that silk suit from Armani with you

Today's without that good
She's so bitchy
Our hearts are not here, her words are unclear
She's thumpin' down there
You about to start love trippin', you sex kitten
Ain't nobody ever had it this juicy since Biggie
I know you wanna see world, girl I'm big Billy
And I've been to cities just to eat Denny's, I'm really different

You could never imagine, what's about to happen right now

Hey yo I'm back by popular demand and shit
Niggas want the crown but can't handle it
This rap game's getting scandalous
I done lost my best friend in Los Angeles
My other nigga turned Evangelist
But I can't quit cause I'm on some Evander shit
Fuck the money and the white sand and shit
When it's said and done you gunna understand this shit
Your man talking about Hummers and little cars
That only fit in his little house little garage
His lifestyle is just a little mirage
He the type of cat that never had a menage
Backrub, you know a little massage
Tight shit you get when you Head Nigga in charge
I'm in the Rolls listening to the bars
Leaned back wit a chick smoking on cigars
From Bogota, Colombia, chicks from Panama
The diamond fellow, mami hello
Pull up in the drop my Ferrari yellow
Pull off your top make it shake like Jello

DROP EVERYTHING!! When you walk in the door
Free your self 'fore get ya ass on the floor!
Ah be a maniac-ah! lose control (just lose control)
GET NAKED!! Strip down to your soul!

Well strip down! (work)
Show me some more! (work)
Is that all you got?! (work)
You got to make me believe it girl! (work)
C'MON NOW!!

I'm sitting on your Louie bag, now you're braining it
Lookin like your little sister came that painted it
Slick, like calamari tentacles
Staring at my chain I kicked off your Jimmy Choos
I weigh 155 pound when I'm soaked ma
That Rolls Royce Phantom, it ain't no joke ma
Weed brownie at 2, but I will not smoke ma
Don't talk about licking if it ain't deepthroat ma
I give you great dick, I make your face flip
Then take ya aboard a nigga Spaceship
Star Trak, my fault I mean Mother Ship
Put on the cameras, try it you'll be loving it
And you can bring your girl and we can get on another tit
Me? I'm a Mount Airy fellow
Or down in Florida wit the Maranello
Driving slow watch the mami mouthing ""hello""
Get wit ya man if you want love you better
Trying to get dirty like Aguilera
Yep, he's a skater the kids that's rhyming
But I'm also young and rich wit a big ass diamond



Hey yo my intro's crazy, I'm in a new Mercedes
Rocks the same colors as daisy's
Y'all niggas is lazy, I'm on my j-o-b
And that's why ya hate on me
But here's the update, Loon ain't got nothing but cake
And power from here to upstate
Y'all sweet as cupcakes
So why niggas stay wit tough faces?
I stay trying to figure what Loon and Puff make

Bitch please! you ain't been in a helicopter
Flying 'round Jesus statue wit a mountain in Brazil
Bitch please! you ain't never been to Guatemala
Eating shrimp by the dollar taking flights to Negril
Bitch please! and you ain't been wit Lenny and Pharrell
Me and Loon in the hills giving mami's the chills
Bitch please! and you ain't never seen a hotter nigga in the game
12 years selling records by the mill, c'mon now

Let's work (huh yeah), let's work
Show me your soul! c'mon now!

Help Me,MMM (Money Making Mitch),2015.0,"Last night was  like my last night
High as fuck behind the wheel, I almost crashed twice
And when you worth half a bill people mad nice
But when that money go that’s when all the hunnies go
Everything was wonderful until we ended under scope
On the corner, Air Force One, Polo to bubble coats
We was selling dope
I had a key looking like I had a ton of coke
Cause I would never let me see me sweat
See me stress, no even bet
We was up 24 for that paper like CVS
Cause they was playing checkers, they really believe in chess
We jump pawns, knock down queens and screamin', ""check""
Cause I was runnin with Big, you was doin it small
I was building a bridge, you was hoping it'd fall
Cop cook and collect, raise a coke and a straw
We been getting this money, these bitches know who we are
I'm from a hood where 14 bricks
Will have your homie try and do you like Po did Mitch
I used to go to my chicks spot like, ""hold this brick""
Young nigga told me I'm old, I said, ""old and rich""
Then I said, ""you better pray you make it old as this""
And when you catch a case, boy, don’t spill them bowl of grits
And niggas they break fast when that toaster lick
And ain't no Instagram when they postin' pics
Just a bulletin board circling him and his boys
Wasn’t ready to lace boots and had Timberlands on
I got paper wasn’t doin what all these niggas was doin'
I hit the road and I was going wherever Benji was goin'
We ate the whole cake crumbs 'til the Entamens gone
Made history at night and reminisce  in the mornin
I'm talkin ten years before Dre put Eminem on
Before Roc and G-Unit we had Kiss and them on
I'm talkin more Styles than P before Biggie was gone
And almost twenty years later still Biggie we mourn
Baby baby, yeah, baby baby
Yeah, these harlem streets raised me
Mama know she made me a million dollar baby
Look at me now, shit's crazy

Water rising fast, I'm sinkin'
Water rising fast, I'm sinkin'
Drift and I'm so far away from shore
So unsure, so unsure
Somebody help, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody help, somebody help me

La Cosa Nostra, move like we're supposed to
Rich like Oprah, bitch, hold the toaster
We in the Benz Sprinter right on the sofa
Inside's cream, the outside's mocha
Coffee color, I buy a bitch a fur coat to match the yorkie color
Of course he rugged, mean dreams that haunt a brother
Still haunt me
Facing times square nigga, you can't taunt me
I'm  a rocket, you can't launch me
Gift of soul, drift cool rides along me
Go ahead and Diddy Pop
Flying through a city block sittin' in a pretty drop
Acting like a idiat, yeah, I mean idiot
Millions on these diamonds, shit, lookin hidious
But I know my mind probably came from the pyramids
And I'm in a zone on my own, be clear of it

Water rising fast, I'm sinkin'
Water rising fast, I'm sinkin'
Drift and I'm so far away from shore
So unsure, so unsure
Somebody help, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody help, somebody help me",https://genius.com/Diddy-help-me-lyrics
Facts (Intro),MMM (Money Making Mitch),2015.0,"Money Makin Mitch is this fairy tale, you know, 
about this fly nigga from Harlem that came up, and he did his thing man
He was shinin’ on em, stylin’ on em, showin' em how to do it, showin’ em how to get it
Maybe he was getting it the wrong way, but you know, the fairy tale of it, is most brothers and sisters end up dead or in jail
But check this out with this fairy tale I created in my brain.  Imagine this Mitch nigga survived
Took those different talents and attributes and business skills and applied it to the world of business
Man the game, the legal game
So this is the fairy tale man, and fairy tales do come true
Cuz we got millions of cats that comin’ up with that hustler spirit and drive
They got that Mitch in them
And they ain’t gon fall to the wayside, they gon’ take their street smarts, and run the world
Cause the black man is god
And 
No Way Out 2
, that's how Imma leave it on you, peace

Ladies and Gentlemen, we are preparing to make our final descent into New York Motherfucking City.  The local time is 11:04 PM, and the temperature is 68 degrees.  If you look to your left, you will see the borough of Brooklyn, home to the Notorious B.I.G.; and on your right is the world-famous Harlem World, home of the legendary Puff Daddy himself.  For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened until the captain turns off the fasten seatbelt sign.  On behalf of the entire crew, I'd like to thank you for flying Combs Air, where all dreams do come true",https://genius.com/Diddy-facts-intro-lyrics
Pain,No Way Out,1997.0,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away
Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin the grief
Baby moms starts sexin, my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin your breathin, long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin
Pain...
I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone
I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..
I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away
I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin
On my knees cryin and prayin, then I said
""God why? Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening 3
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives
I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck WHO it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggas man
Fuck these niggas man
And I'mma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin your name out
Like they screamin all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year...
I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain",https://genius.com/Diddy-pain-lyrics
Journey Through the Life,Forever,1999.0,"Yo, yo (uh huh)
Gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, yo (that's right)
Journey through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas
(You'll never see what I've seen)

When I sleep I dream of, bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost
Feds with toast knockin' my door down, sweat poor down
My body roast from the heat, so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss her and stare into space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If niggas try to rob me, then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks 'cause I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like a walking tightrope and can't look down, fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust

You can never see what I see, motherfucker
Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court
Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was pork
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Stretched up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you guard your soap
I done seen the biggest niggas in the yard get broke
I done took blocks to war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for blocks of raw
What you think .33 in the Glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars
C4, block your doors, niggas can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the Glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason why you switchin' up your jewelry?
Cause you keep gettin' robbed
I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, realest nigga alive

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust

Ayo, ayo, gangsta, gangsta
The Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats
I speak all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome
Throwin' shit at little girls jump ropes
Bustin' BB guns at stray cats, that was way back
Watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in its eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome .45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestyle of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reigning, slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'
Names engraved in the pavement
Brick buildings, grown ladies jump off the roof
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust",https://genius.com/Diddy-journey-through-the-life-lyrics
Don’t Stop What You’re Doing,No Way Out,1997.0,"Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Eh eh
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Eh eh

Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars
Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours
If it's not it's yours, we on the job
Everybody eatin, everybody involved
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap
Bad Boy stop what's the chance of that?
We don't stop
, so check the, mansions and stacks
And we don't have to answer to Jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of New York
And out West, we want y'all to understand
All we wanna do is make you dance
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?


When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough
Fuck Domino's, strictly dice
Bet you niggas won't flow for this ice, notes is the price
Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggas still broke
While my pockets on re-up
Y'all niggas shit on E, what a pi-ty
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my dimples
Drive a Tahoe, wit plenty cash flow
He know, anything I touch I blow
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggas and a Lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you
So who stressin who, 
and even though my nigga gone
Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin it on


Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow
Bang this til you're bein old when you at home
On the six-four, sittin on chrome
Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall
We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch
Every single region, we own blocks
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better
Every single I drop, at least two are better
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Everything we make is hot
Thought I told you that we never stop
Keep risin to the top, yeahhh
Keep risin to the top, yeahhh

Tryin' to get up in your mind in your body your spirit
Take your soul

Come here girl
Let me creep in your world
Let me see the backside of your moon
No vickies only la perl-a
Let me take you to indonesia
Where nobody can reach us
There's no need to take your phone
Cause you far away from home
Baby let me be your tour guide
I'm your burger
You my fries

Run through sets
Come through sets
Chicks hypnotized by my 1, 2 steps
I'm way too fresh
So complex
Niggas try to predict what I'm gonna do next
Let's get the party started
Far from a motherfuckin' starving artist
Got something to prove
Don't talk it, walk it
My niggas outside on them walkie talkies
Pop that trunk
Pass that dutch
Let's get crunk
Baby don't play dumb
Baby don't say none
It's on me
Louie 13 and the cris on me
Dimes wall to wall in the vip
The age don't mean a thing
I ain't chi ali
I bring them out with no id
Them boys they bring them out like I'm T.I.P


Ready for action when I attack on the track
And I flat up a sac on strap on the cadillac and the glove
Could call me when you start shit with the ambassador of new york
And the queen of the chi
And I'm backing her up
Flow be ugly but it's a beautiful thing
Aluminum rings
Get money like I'm moving dem thangs
I got connects in every section
When I'm up in the hood
Chain looking so nasty all the bitches going uhhh
Heard they wanna get me
But I got my guns cocked
I'm dirty ridin 30 somethin' 
Cocked like yung joc
I'm the talk of the town
Lettin' off 50 rounds
Meet me in a circle everybody it's goin down
Give you hpnotiq to get you erotic
And then I take you somewhere exotic
Where we can blow chronic
A full clip for a lil drama
You know I ain't a ho
Snap yo bitch
Come here lil mama you know you wanna go

I'm from the city wit nothing pretty
And everybody know
I spit a flow to get up with diddy
And now we finna blow
Niggas in the hood show me love
I'm the girl
Pimp tight let my mink hang down to the floor
Pardon me if I gotta be a boss bitch
I don't give a fuck what it cost bitch
I floss big whips
I floss big chains
I talk big shit
Cause I'm got big thangs
Now what you wanna do
You betta not step
Now nigga move back
Let me catch my breath
Bring it, bring it back to the floor
So sick with an ass so fat
It's shawnna, twis' & diddy with tim on the track

"Do You Like It, Do You Want It",Forever,1999.0,"Picture me ballin' in the drop top, open skies
In something foreign, soarin', 145
The God is calling for my body, let my spirit fly
I want it all, no lie
Picture me pourin' poppin' something imported
Pedal flooring, clutch poppin', boppin' to Lauryn
Now picture me falling

Never seen, never heard, never happened, never occurred
Now picture me flying 10,000 feet above the sea
Popping bubbly, you'd love to be me
Now picture the servants in the cabin with the sweetest massage
Picture having ice and only wanna speak to God
Picture your dreams being shattered and your cream being lavished
At the same time, tell me what you think matters
Picture all the money that I've gotten off tours
Now picture me plotting for more, picture this nigga

	Tell me do you want it (yeah)
	Wanna know what it's like to be me

Straight flipping, losing my cool
Now picture me gritty, P. Diddy 'bout to run in your house
The gun's with me, put one in your mouth
Now picture me dressed in white linen while your life is ending
Slightly grinning, picture that priceless image
Picture me broke as fuck on your block about to open up
Like Okay nigga, what's up

Picture me driving a course through your home, bustin' a ""U""
Screaming at the top of my lungs ""YOU FUCKING WITH WHO?""
Picture me not being that hustler dude
Picture the Benz, a 5, and the drop not new
Picture the watch ain't platinum, and the rock's not blue
Picture y'all niggas not knowing how I do
Picture me, better yet picture you
Painting a better picture than the one that I drew
Repeat 1

Where do you go from here when you felt you've done it all
When what used to get you high don't get you high no more
When you got a lot of cars, don't even drive no more
When you're expected to win, they ain't surprised no more

Hold up, stop, wait, reverse the tape
How much money can one nigga make in one place
How much dough could you hold in one safe
How many hoes can a nigga really chase

Where do you go after the applause
After all the Soul Train and Grammy awards, after the tours
After asking these whores what they after me for
Is it the money?  The fame?  The house, take it all

The sky's the limit, but I ain't done jumping
Money is fast, but I ain't done running
Picture me driving some wack shit

After Love,Press Play,2006.0,"I miss going out, feeling kinda stuck these days 
(loving you)
And I be on the highway, if only I could leave my place (loving you)
I used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say (loving you)
I been trying to hide but its written all over my face
I really thought you were the one, the only one
I guess that I was wrong
If everything I thought
What do you do after love?
What can you say when its said and done (nothing at all)
Cuz you can't stop a heart break
And you can't stop your tears from falling down
So what do you do? what do you do?
After love

I remember first day that I saw her face
The feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday
Beautiful I must say
She was my earthquake
Cute face, nice shape, you made my earth shake
I'mma try keep the faith, do it like the church say
She the one for me and I don't care what him or her say
Thought I had a home run
But I guess at first base I found out the long run
Just another heart break
So how much can my heart take
You was like air to me
You know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath
See life is but a dream
So its more then I believe
If you ever been in love you will know what I mean
So god help me please I wanna see the light
She keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right
But try and prove wrong cos I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

Tell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound
And tell me who had thought that id be trying to get over you
I'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you
And I can get over it, but I'm ain't sure that I want to
Because you made your bed, now you gotta lie in it
Now all the things you said don't mean a thing
I can't believe I gave you one last shot
I let it ride now baby its your stuff
Oh so leave your not good for me
It took a while to finally come to my senses
What do you do after love?
What can you say when its said and done
When its over
Cos you can't stop a heart break
And you can't stop your tears from falling down
So what do you do? what do you do?
After love

This is what you made me do
Pay attention
She know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening
I think about you all the time, if not every minute
I promise hurting you was never my intention
Something bout your style, the way that you presenting her
Everything I see I ever had you was in it
I apologize for every time that you might have cried
Theres not enough words to describe how I feel inside
Guardian angel sent from the skys
I always knew you would have made a beautiful bride
And that's right
And I wish you could of stayed, so much
But I'm stuck when I betrayed your trust
You know your love is more than wearing
Dolce and gabbana, gucci and prada, trips to nevada
And I admit that you hurt probably true
But I don't mistake the only one I love is you
I love you",https://genius.com/Diddy-after-love-lyrics

Feel there's, no way out
No escape
To be honest, I don't know where my life is goin
Where I'll end up at
I just don't know
Verse One: Puff Daddy
I looked back and saw the cat focus, took notice
Stayed away from the bogus, til his rise began
Phillies stacked his grand played the brokest
Til he seemed hopeless, soon to be the dopest, cat comin
Track stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin
Money starts to pile, honeys start to wild
Top notch drop top make everything he drop hot
He dream, visualize, plot and scheme
Got the cream legally without the beam
Witcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0
Jet black tint still, they might know
Who the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&B
Trapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far
Chorus: repeat 2X
Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to? Do you know?
Verse Two: Puff Daddy
Shorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks
Heard she do backflips, for niggas who stack chips
Suck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo
Real G's makin her back swell
Only givin head to those niggas who rapped well
Owned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints
Rumors spread, half a G she took, six or more
Two bagged up, four went raw
Back of my mind countin up the big score
Violators from the door, she lookin up from the floor
Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore
So far from pure, rotten to the core
Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore
Chorus
Verse Three: Puff Daddy
Hard to cope with, all these niggas and dope whips
With cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold
To bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice
In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on
Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on
Don't understand they playin wit it
Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it
Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun
I'd release slugs black and bust back
See how these players love that, to the point where
I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it
I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself
And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust
Chorus w/ variations
I been on this road for a long time now
At time it seems like the road is never gonna end
On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains
Peaks and valleys
Even a lot of potholes on this road
It's never smooth, on the road of life
I don't know where I'm going
I just know where I wanna end up at
Chorus w/ variations
Lord can you help me get there?
Please let me get there

I Got the Power,No Way Out,1997.0,"My click is in it til it's over, never sober
Bustin over, lay in the lane with the 'caine in the Rover
Pray to Jehovah, for the nigga with the Ruger
The young Don, the Heron mover
You know my hustle, I bring the fo' pound to the tussle
Motherfuck your pit with no muzzle
So chill cuzo, let me blow for my niggas
Runnin round, get down like motherfuckin gorillas
Shorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop
Pot full of acid, I got the game mastered
Move dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money
It could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny
Black I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give
But everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po
Mom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa
Yo, it's the style see it's still the same
And when worse comes to worse, I steal the 'ciane
Papi know my face, so he don't expect it
Runnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it
Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him
He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him
I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept
I take my last breath every time I hit the meth
It's the D to the E, M to the O N
Blowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin
Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap
Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat
Best to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine
From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine

I be, that nigga that yo' niggas can't fuck wit
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit
That nigga that you can't get along wit
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit
That nigga that you see in the videos
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes
That nigga that'll die for his main man
That nigga with the gettin money gameplan

Haven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?
When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get
I'm only sizin you niggas from the waist up
And I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup
Mr. Jacob without the Ladder
It don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup
Nobody badder, since the, baby finksta
I was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter
Shit I even blitz the rich to get chips
Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip
Extra clip in the vacumn if I slip
Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb
Blown to Hong Kong wide been long gone
Plus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?
Worldwide while you simply thug where you live at


You don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car-tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are
You can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us
Jealous dog, cause we spread like relish
Bad Boys, and we all eat together
When it go down, then we draw heat together
Since I made the connection with the big man
I done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land
Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped
And what you call weight? I know cats who sniff that
Enjoy life, what are you sayin?
If the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin
Anything to do with money you can count J in
Next time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin
Cream of the crop, and we ain't never gon' stop

Friends,No Way Out,1997.0,"Aha, yeah, yeah
In a world of, larger moves, new cars to cruise
Sometimes I make the news, falsely accused
I gotta shake the spot when the stakes is high
A brother needs space like a vacant lot
I'm lookin forward to the future, Mase and The Lox
And my little son Justin, touchin a knot
You knew I was comin for the crowns that's uptown
You knew I was comin to put it down so what now?
It's the Bad Boy, pull up and break the clutch down
In the five-speed, smirkin then pull up at high speed
Can you enterprise and rise like cream do?
And leave em talk about the last time they seen you?
Game is magnet, to everything platinum with my
Name attached, can you all do that?
Think one thing when you read my name
That Puff nigga, the game'll never be the same

Can I love you baby? What we about to do
Could make the whole earth move, I tell you my first move
Climb up in it slow, I ain't tryin to hurt you
Can you feel me baby? Should I keep it right there?
Is it still me baby? Take off your night wear
And lay your pretty body in the middle of your bed
As I place myself in the middle of your legs

PE 2000,Forever,1999.0,"Hey yo Puff, check this out pa
I'm tired of niggas hating on a mutha fucka
Let's take it to the next millennium on these bitches
You got to keep bubblin on em
Platinum doublin on em, fuck these niggas
Hey yo, I bumped into these cat an' they was like
""Yeah, what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice""
I said yo, the brother dont swear he nice he knows he nice
You public enemy number one right now
But Fuck that there spit that hydro-ghetto shit

Let's go
That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear
Throw your guns in the air
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see
But you wanna be  you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my real dogs  they'll spit for me
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?
Front from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
More hotter than the sun
I'm living on the run
Because i'm public enemy number one

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?
Is it my house or maybe its all three
I just came up and you're all against me
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun
Cause they got me public enemy number one


All you suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""
You know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
Because i'm public enemy number one


Yeah yeah, that's right Puff
That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad
Cause you got all the ladies
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys
You know? and thats just the way the story goes
And thats just the way the story goes
Fuck you niggas and hoes

You think i'ma come this far and let you niggas stop me now?

Yea, shoutout to my daddy
Yea, man! Ayo, this ones for you, Pops
Check it out:

Cocaine on the table, I wasn't always able
I watch these niggas get rich selling these fucking fables
They like to cook the numbers, we don't cook the numbers
We just want the summer, you can have that woman

These niggas really out here tripping, man
I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face

Cop another Q, cop another Coupe (Yea, let's go)
My niggas from Jamaica, know that shit for true (Blood, fire)

Crazy out my mind, crazy out my mind
Yo bitches on my line, I'm tryna find some time

These niggas really out here trippin', man
I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face

That pack jumpin', those fiends comin'
That line all down the block
That mean that soft comin', that beam comin'
Them diamonds floodin' my watch
That pack jumpin', them fiends comin'
That line all down the block
That mean that soft comin', that beam comin'
Them diamonds floodin' my watch
On, on, on any block
On, on, on any block

It was cocaine on the table, baby
The shit was Cain and Abel, baby
And I been seein' angels lately
And I just make it flip, make the grip
And make my lady crazy
I'm so eighties, baby, '88 Mercedes
Bring your friends, let them live
And if they live, then you can bring your friends again
And they can bring some friends with them
Cause we just talk fly, and we just walk fly
And look you in your eyes 'cause  got eyes
So we dress God-like, and we go star-life
You live yours once, but we live ours twice
What's in these streets? Take your chances
Till my hustle advance
Shit, you niggas got bands? Well, I got bandwidth
And I get sandwiched nightly
By two things that just speak Spanish
One making tacos, one making a sandwich

Everything I Love,Press Play,2006.0,"The world at my sneakers
Gold pieces molded with Jesus features
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable Diddy
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest
My first album due to him, that was my biggest project
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra
It's Harlem USA, I diddy bop and shop with Oprah
(Yeah nigga, what)

Nigga what
From my voice I'm killing 'em
I shed my blood
About everything I love

To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster
Platinum Patrón splasher, fuck Cris', spit atcha
I call it rich ignorant laughter
Black American express card all grey now, its scratched up
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80s, NYC 5 percent of culture
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers
The studded chain around my neck, it makes the night colder
(Yeah nigga, what.)

Nigga what
From my voice I'm killing 'em
I shed my blood
About everything I love

The Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker
Pretty bitch slobber, ex-robber
Heister, my own life biographer
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping
Summer Jam stopper,
 Timb Chuck wearing
Cranapple Vodka, then I spray choppers
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me
Draped in paisley bandanas, suits with Adam Stacey
Cigar like Dick Tracy, its dark I get spacey
Alcohol and laced weed, that was part of my 80s
The Cartier consiglieres be near me
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly
Liz Taylor tried to jux me
'Cause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby
When he gets mean
Think fast 'fore I blast hoes like Grassy Knoll
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion
And realest rappin'
Pablo back on the scene, won't roll back up with green
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas
Two of New York's biggest niggas
Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us
Nas and Diddy, power hustlers

She's in line waitin', my guest list too long
I told her I would love her, love her lasts forever
Forever's just a word, I put words together
Steppin' on the stars, she pause
And I know that one day this show will end - applause
The strobe lights are dancin', we've takin' all the chances
She question what we are, and I'll drink to the answer
Cause my heart is out of service, my eyes turn black
I don't see love anymore I'm blind to the fact
I got my world in my pocket, cause I ain' tryna drop it
The sky is at my neck, so I turn up my collar
My world spin around her cause it's a world without her

When you know, like I know
When the sunlight falls down
There she goes
Strobe lights dance with the stars
And I just can't live without her
And she knows what she knows
And the rain is coming down
My heart is cold, I know she knows
Strobe lights dance with the stars
And I always take my time

And when the lights fade
The lights they turn grey

And I don't know where to go
I'm on a new way, tomorrow's too late

Love create wars
, I got wounds and scars

Dancin' with the stars, but what happened to ours?
What happened because the rain is coming down
Now we trapped in the storm
And I stepped right out of her spotlight
And into the strobe lights
I don't need your light

I know I know I know
That you're no good
I know I know I know
That you make me
Come back for more
Come back for more
Every time I try, I can't get away
I know I know I know
That love is gone
I know I know I know
When the lights they fade away
You keep beggin' me, beggin' me:
Please don't go

And when the lights fade
The lights they turn grey
Bitch, you don't love me no more
I'm at the end, babe, goin' the wrong way
And I don't know where to go
I'm on a new way, tomorrow's too late

I don't give a fuck
If it's me against a million billion of y'all motherfuckers

I bust six out the roof of my Bentley Coupe
Head shots so mother fuckers can't regroup, can't recoup
I'll be damned if you get more points than me
Sell more joints than me
Steal your faith, take a puff, inhale my name
Smoke on it, shit, choke on it

Hot motherfucker down to the skit, nigga

It's official now, they all rock Sean John
Might have to change my name to strong arm
You came to get money man?
That shit been long gone, come on

Promise to do a nigga since Nicolas Barnes
Poppin' and choppin' until the day that I'm gone
Shyne po', playa's dreams come through on vinyl
Prominent premier, premium bravo
Watch him explain ain't nothin' but blood thug crime though
Shots in the spinal for my rivals
Cross the T's and dot the I's and
Pay the judge, drop the top and let's ride
Shit, it's the kid, rappers fearin'
You cowards don't know? I'd rather be racketeerin' somewhere
Bustin' shots in the atmosphere and
Not carin', fuckin' the prosecutor at my hearin'
Money launderin', honies wonderin'
Who me? I reply casually
I'm what God would be if he was a straight G
Tonight, too tight, arrogant, bitch, we ride

Yo yo yo, it's your hide
Grab the rope and yell rawhide
Front line is pussy, call off sides
I'm focus but my hand is cross-eyed
I left my gun home, here borrow mine
Pop the nine like the judge ""All rise""
This gun'll knock plants off tall guys
We value-packs, y'all small fries
(Yo, I'm from the projects)
Yo, but on the floor tied
Don't matter, we'll take up all size
Truly yours Doc, then PPP hide, my name is
Since five, I talk jive
In church dressed in corduroy ties
Now I'm grown up and been married four times
Besides, I'm just a sight for sore eyes
Brick city, known pop the door wide
Stolen Bonneville in New York High

Reversin' the plot
Last come, first one to rot, burstin' the Glock
If I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot
And I be the person to watch
If your girl missin' the rock, purse and a watch
Hot as it gets, from Hell came outta you depths
Buy the cassette, rewind it to death
Alota y'all sweat it, you try to forget
How I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz
I'm why you smell herb in the crib
Man I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful
Indo out-do, intro to outro

I'm the hottest thing spittin' so go warn your clique
Them niggas y'all look up to is on my dick
Sauce motherfuckin' born to hit
I get so far up in your ass, think I was on some shit
Look, you against me is really nothin' to see
Who, when, where, what it's gon' be
I don't give a fuck if it's he or she
I'm the virgin of hip hop, nobody fuckin' with me
I know your type, you a ride dick nigga
Cry sick nigga, lied quick nigga
Out of turn speakin', first one leakin'
Always the Suzuki, side kick nigga
Bitches don't cast stones down, they throw bricks
Why I come through and tell 'em to blow dick
These niggas the nicest? No, go fish
Sauce, you the best motherfucker, no shit

You're treated and competed, walk away from it undefeated
Observe it from over there, okay
Ain't It obvious we overheated
You talkin' that slick shit
But I jus' know that you meant me
But evidently, you don't know
I get your ass gone permanently
It ain't complex
I'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next
Do a drive-by on your project, take the traps
Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up
And nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up
Look in my eyes, I'm not scared
Sucka, you heard what I said
If you don't wanna get dead
No it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla
The mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule

Yo, yo yo, yo yo
Don't hold me back, you bet
How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the FUCKIN' FLOOR!
Only the real motherfuckers belong
I hope niggas don't end the party before we finish the song
(Bitch nigga)
You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past
When I used to pull spine outcho ass
Live niggas go stack money, continue to build shit
Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit
Zap niggas like cellular flips and swell up your lips

You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
It's ten years and we still runnin this motherfucker
Yeah!
One
As we procede to give you what you need!
One...Two!
It's all fucked up now!
Yo!
What the fuck yaw gonna do now?
Yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around wit them pounds and berreta's
Yea faggot, if I want it I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me or I gotta grab it
Don't make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
I'm cocky, raps rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, 8 levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga
I'm the wrong one to provoke
And rattin on niggas is only gon' leave you smoke
So the only thing left now is toast for these cowrads
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers
In The Commision, you ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderers, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? 
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?
You know it can't stay dark for long
They say it's darkest before the dawn
Cars before the storm
I'm happy makes a bethus now preaching the song
I can see B.I. rocking the Sean John yeah right
This is for life afters like B.I. Frank White
Yo Bad Boy for life
No matter what the public say we gon prove
There ain't another MC who could feel ya shoes
Cuz Biggie Smalls is the illest
Realest my stones and killas got homes and villas
Overseas and what was me I find out
Who found out other MCs been tryin to find ya route
This illman MC used to be on other shit
Took home ""Life after Death"" and they studied it
Listened to the double disk
Now they all spit like they all legit
Frank tell how we did!
We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kiss, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggas step up, we just macin them
Placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Businesswise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission
I got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
We slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
Soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckas, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow a soul outta aero
I'ma break before I lay floor burried
Besides, every rapper ain't a star, nigga plad ain't burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, smokin by the big screen
You changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy
I know to watch botherin ya vision
You reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like it's part of yo religion
Why party wit a pigeon?
I'm blowin a 10 cuz Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
I'm in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
And there ain't problem gettin dressed cuz my closet got more aisles than pathmark
Run, when we startin a wave
And leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
I'm the young pimp pardon my age
I don't got long hair but if I did she be partin my braids
Niggas find what club they at
Take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mac
Get advances from grey Acura
See these record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rappa'
I go the college on the tour
I'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
I keep ya ammo clean, text polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor
By now, you probably heard of me
Fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leavin wit cha nike's bergendy, White T, bergendy
You match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I toke, C notes from different years
Besly in the robe, re-motes for liftin chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to crib like I'm a cab dispatcha
You better off wit ya stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive
You ain't gettin nuttin but ya french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio layin my vocals
Nigga

>We got the real live shit from front to back

Hate Me Now (Feat. Nas),UnKnown,UnKnown," Escobar season has returned...
It's been a long time, been a long time comin
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me - this is what I am
 Feel me? Let's go

You can hate me now.. but I won't stop now..
Cause I can't stop now.. you can hate me now..
But I won't stop now.. cause I can't stop now..
You can hate me now.. you can hate me NOWWWW..

Q.B., real niggas, Bravehearts, c'mon

Well you hate me I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin
Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects
But you still wanna hate",https://genius.com/Diddy-hate-me-now-feat-nas-lyrics
Diddy,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, it's Bad Boy, baby
Neptune's and we won't stop
Cause we can't stop
Yeah, let me tell you something
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick, named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers to spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me, dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
And I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stop to this
I can't help it, I'm an optimist
And I'ma make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon' rock to this
Now say my name
It's the D the I the D the D the Y

It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, that's crazy
It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, say what
Ay yo, I came in the door, I said it before
I never the ladiez hypnotize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bouswar
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me
It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, that's crazy
It's the D the I the D the D the Y

C'mon, work it out, girl
I'm trying to see you work it out, girl
(La, la, la)
C'mon, work it out, girl
I wanna see you work it out, girl
Now hold up, stop, now wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning, got Asian women
That'll change my linen after I done blazed and hit 'em
But I just wanna rock wit' you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible, cause I ain't trying to stop you boo
I got an agenda, got on a ninja
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it, girl
I just wanna see you shake it, girl
For the return of the don, the world in my palm
My mom calls me Sean but y'all call me

F*ck u

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone (know)
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy (fantasy)
Only Tiffany and Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be (are) confusin me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin me
Here's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin me (abusin me)
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the wor(l)d, it's just you and me

Now let's ride.....

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride

I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life

I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else cuz she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
Cuz now I'm gettin money and the game gettin deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been lookin for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
It's cuz of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl...

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else cuz she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a Case, , shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But everytime I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All dem days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine

You know we have to do it again, right?
All the girls in the club know what's up
She said she undercover though
And this is what she want

She's got me higher in this mother fucker
She's got me flying in this mother fucker
Ready to die up in this mother fucker
Got damn, she badder than a mother fucker
Let's make a movie!
Two superstars
To big body coupes
Avatars
The marriage niggas stay and they e-condo large
I stay in Louis bed spurs camouflage
Let's go!

She wants the finer things and all that she can get from me
She even wants the lovely cutie on my arm
She get it in all way turned up
She a rider
She says she's in the mood for love

Watch out that girl is trouble!
They ain't got nothing on her
Can't even fight her hunger
She a get it girl, watch her do her thing
What she's got she got from her mother?
She super straight body shaped like no other
She's making her way to my area
And when she gets past security

I say:
Hello! Welcome to my table!
Bring your girlfriends
Everything's paid for..
We gone get it in
Ain't that what you came for
Heard you was looking for me!
She say she looking for love

And this is what she wants!

Straight off the concord, two cheers and encore
Nice sweats, she feens for one boy
The innovator, young Sean combs
Reminiscing me and biggie bringing broads home
Father figure, hating for them other niggas
Dirty money went and brought a money printer
Now my money longer on the Mississippi river
Money making extraordinary!
I am the nigga


Yo Usher
Talk to her!

I... I know just what you liked!
I... I wanna make you feel good inside!

Big Ole Butt,In Tha Beginning... There Was Rap,UnKnown,"Artist: Puff Daddy f/ Lil' Cease
Album:  In The Beginning
Song:   Big Ole Butt *
* cover version of the LL Cool J song from ""Walking With a Panther""

Uh-huh, uh, yeah
What you say?  C'mon, yeah
Uh-huh... uh
Now here's a little story, about a girl, with a Big Ole Butt
A-huh, yeah, I like Big Ole Butts, you dig?
I was at the Tunnel, sippin on champagne
Takin a break, with this honey on my brain
Admirin the girls with the diamond earrings
Benjamins blastin, doin my thing
That's when I seen her, her name was Keisha
Ass-wide figure, just had to meet her
I said, ""How you doin?  My name is Puff
Don't ask me how I'm livin, cause boo I'm livin plush
But then again, I'm livin kind of sneaky
Cause my girl don't know that I'm out actin freaky""
Hit her with the tch-tch-tch, got the digits
Called her on the StarTap, paid her a visit
I was spankin her and thankin her, screwin her and doin her
Laughin not thinkin bout G's, I just blew in her
Playin like a King, on sheets of satin
Me and Shorty smack in, her crib in Manhattan
She had a big ole booty, like you see in the movies
And on top of all that, I think her sister wanted to do me
But Keisha was exotic, and Cease my witness
She said, ""Daddy, when you comin back to hit this?""
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the neck
On my mind was Keisha and how she stayed wet
Sat my girl on the couch, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her, with a devilish grin...
Keisha's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
You know I told you I'd be true (I told you)
But Keisha's got a big ole butt (that's right)
So I'm leavin you (see-ya! he haha)
Keisha's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
I know I told you I'd be true (I lied baby)
But Keisha's got a big ole butt (c'mon)
So I'm leavin you (yeah, that's right)
I went past to Rutgers, about three o'clock
I tried to get a cutie, to ride my jock
Me and Ma$e, Suburban blastin
Cold Dom P, smilin, laughin
Freaks all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her, her name was Kim
She had the kind of booty that I'd like to get in
I said to Ma$e, ""Stop the jeep""
She's only seventeen, but yo she's a freak
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
I scooped this beauty, like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, ""Boo, you look tired
Let's go to my crib, and bone by the fire""
I put her big booty on the zebraskin rug
She gave my balls a kiss, I gave her breasts a hug
I said to this girl, ""I don't love them hoes!
You want to get freaky, let me suck on your toes""
I licked and sucked, she asked me to sing
I grabbed a pack of condoms, I pulled out my thing
When I was through, she wiped the sweat from my chest
When to the kitchen, and fried some chicken breast
Keisha busted in, my house while I was eatin
You know what I said?
Too bad you caught me cheatin, but...
Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
I know I told you I'd be true (I know I told you)
But Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
So I'm leavin you (see-ya! he haha)
Kim's got a big ole butt (yeah, yeah)
I know I told you I'd be true (I know what I said, but I lied)
But Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
So I'm leavin you (that's right)

Yo, I went to Justin's for some shrimp and steak
Around the time that this waitress was on her break
I pulled into the parkin lot and parked my truck
Niggas playa hate but I ain't give a fuck
I paid it no attention, and walked inside
D-Rock had the nine and he was chillin in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was lookin
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin
I sat down to eat, and ordered my food
I said to the waitress, ""I don't mean to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter""
She said, ""You got a girl,"" Ceasar said, ""It don't matter
You look like you're tasty as pipin hot pizza
What's your name?"" She said, ""My tag says Lisa""
I said, ""O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, then goin to snack""
She looked at me and said, ""You need to stop!
Cease where you goin?""  ""The Marriott""
She looked kind of puzzled, I said, ""You'll see""
I pulled out a Benjamin, she looked at me
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
I laid her on the table, and placed my order
And pulled out my dick, and bust all on her
On and on to the break of dawn
All over the restaurant, word is bond
Shorty said she comin, I checked my Roley
She suckin on my nuts, and she don't even know me
I grabbed my pants, just left my main hoe
Who did I see, ohh yo... it was Kim
She work at Justin's but I kept on bustin
Lisa got a big ole butt, uhh
You know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt, uhh
So I'm leavin you, what, uhh
Lisa got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true (I'd be true)
But Lisa got a big ole butt (a big ole butt)
So I'm leavin you
See ya!",https://genius.com/Diddy-big-ole-butt-lyrics
American Dream,Training Day (The Soundtrack),2001.0,"This is not America
Bad Boy baby, David Bowie, let's go

This is not America
This is not America
This is not America
This is not America

Land where my father died, land where my children cried
Come on, America, ain't no barriers
Free the strings, let's see how freedom rings
One nation all gettin' down for the dollars
And the heat is gettin' hotter
But a lot don't understand
Just the way some plan to break you
I done seen the whole thing go straight through
Hungry for it, I'mma make you
Pay back what's due to me
Everybody gonna see, look what they put upon me
Made me a monster, two steps beyond ya
More streets to wonder
For which it stands for cause let's get it
Cause I'mma get mine for damn sure, come on

Screens, greens car candy painted
Chicks in cream is the American dream, ain't it?
I pledge allegiance to Beamers, dark skies
Sleepless nights on the block, two for fives
Deep in the struggles but need the hustle
Weed and blow shit I make the block bubble
I'm to the point where I'm playa hatin'
Fool in the stash and I'm losin' my patience
Medieval times in the chest of the beast
Come around sniffin' I'mma mess up ya fleece
Job lookin' I'd rather be pot cookin'
It's not America, son this is Brooklyn
Home of the sheisty, home of the crook
We signed joints, ain't scared to do a took
My country tis of thee, where there's no liberty
Just misery, ya heard me


Now why can't I breathe with a gun and come free
If six dead people run this country
Now they come cause my crew's too large
Who the fuck put chu' in charge
Runnin' around here like you is God
Then they wonder why the shootin' starts
Gettin' checks with half my stacks
I forgot George Bush wrote half my raps
Murderin' people for blastin' facts
Then blamin' other cats for their tragic acts
I'm tryin' to get paid till my eyes is closin'
Cops is like freeze and I'm already frozen
So they clap and they brawl in hysteria
Tappin' Jackson callin' this area
Green gots cats crawlin' to bury ya
Don't blame Kain for the fall of America


Uh, yo what about these streets here
Before y'all creep here
Look around we there
365 days a year
Lines to cross no fear
And what appears to be roses
See I'm knowin' this
When I chose this
What's right
In broad day or night
More dope deals
I'm tryin' to stay on my heels
Every day's training day
Some things not in explainin' ways
Who said crimes don't pay
Choices to make
Ain't too many chances left to take
Things look so green
The sign of the times corruption politics, youg ones dyin'
What you made of
Either hate or love
Pressure on the nine when push come to shove


A little piece of you (I'm ya worst nightmare)
A little peace in me
A little piece of you (This is not America)
A little peace in me
Will go


Yo, why you cocksuckers pullin' me over
Racial profilin' me cause I ain't pushin' no Nova
I'm up to par lookin'
I know police corruption is up this year and y'all crooked
Took my hard white
Had niggas sellin' the same block, pumpin' the same night
Arrest me, come to court and lie
Yeah that's him, pointin' like I'm the guy
What chu' want those is me of the block
Yo, so you can serve fiends everytime they knock
Just last summer had the mad Hummer
They took that and didn't even give me they badge number
So how am I supposed to feel
Who I'm supposed to call when the shit gets real
Word man I'd rather dial 8-1-1 when it's important
Plus they ain't tryin' to score like Ed Norton, word",https://genius.com/Diddy-american-dream-lyrics
Thought You Said,Press Play,2006.0,"Baby ...baby .. baby

Take a good look at me
I done cried from the lies
It hurts so bad inside
If you need a thing
Ain't never had nothing to me break me down to the floor
Til' I hide the pain
Here to show you a compromise of heart for I'm fallin apart
Til there are no remains
What had me thinking your word was your bond
(Don't you know)
That your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation you knew you weren't ready for
I could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door
You told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for
I can comprehaned the deck of cards you dealt me

How can you turn on me?
(How can you how can you)
How can you purposely?
(How can you how can you)

Lessoned learned house can burn
Were close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said
Thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said
Thought you said that you need me
Thought you said
Thought you said you complete me
Thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said
Thought you said when you held me
Thought you said
Thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said that your never gonna let it go

The times that you weren't there
The times that you left me here
The times that I needed you
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that shall go thru'
I been here before
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until it's right at your door
And then you just can't take it no more
Why does love feel this way?
Why does it hurt so bad

How can you turn on me?
(How can you how can you)
How can you purposely?
(How can you how can you)

Lessoned learned house can burn
Were close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said
Thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said
Thought you said that you need me
Thought you said
Thought you said you complete me
Thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said
Thought you said when you held me
Thought you said
Thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said that your never gonna let it go

The heartache and pain
Sometimes it goes to your brain
Sometimes it makes you insane
Sometimes our joy is our pain
Cuz it tears you apart
These affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes
You know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day
That you come back to me girl
After we both go away
It's just to see if it's real
There's no denying the fact
It's meant to be if you let it go
And then they come back
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault
And of course you lost me with your alibis
And all of your talking
And most important I just question my self

The pain is taking over I just can't believe
(I need your hand)
What happened then compared to now is dreams
(I need your hand)
And I know now that you'll need me

I can't sleep, I can't breathe
I ain't eat in days
Stomach pains from arguing
Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started
And as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson
Well it's all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'
I'm so pressured I'm so physically drained
I ain't thinkin straight
I loved you more than my own self
Although I couldn't bear the pain of seein my old self
Young wild uncontroled self
I love you girl
I don't need no one else

Lessoned learned house can burn
Were close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said
Thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said
Thought you said that you need me
Thought you said
Thought you said you complete me
Thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said
Thought you said when you held me
Thought you said
Thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said that your never gonna let it go


When I look in your eyes
You know it kills me inside

Didn't you. didn't you...ooohhh

Lesson learned
House can burn
We close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me

These affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not

Thought you said thought you said that you love me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me

Come back to me girl

We Gon’ Make It,Press Play,2006.0,"Baby this is your last dance; you know how you do it
There's no nigga like you and there'll never be another nigga like you
Put your foot on these motherfuckers necks
Do it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em

As my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Hard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint
I can't hide in New York City
I'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West
Know a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast
I done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)
Ten years without gettin sweat inside my Yankee fitted
1990-Raw I showed you ice
You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice
When it was +All About the Benjamins+ I had two bezels on my arm
Like a Don's supposed to, Sean
Ride with a chaffeur in Gucci loafers
And switch to All Stars without losin focus
These rap niggas hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks
But I'ma shine for niggas that ain't know Big

Do, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, nowwwww
It feels good to see the sun in the mornin
I'm tired of feelin that the people are talkin
I heard a rumor that things ain't changin
But Lord knows that we gon' make it
Oooooooooooooooooooh

The world famous
As we proceed
To give you what you need
It's been so long
It's been so real
So magnificent, thank you

Tell me who shot Big (who shot Big)
And take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)
If I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef
Put it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)
Sometimes I get drunk, for stress relief
Other times I put ""Life After Death"" on and peep
We ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe
Without my nigga on the passenger side?
And still I try (I try) to get money stay fly
Finish the race, holdin my crown high (take that)
I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize
Been away a long time but now I'm reenergized
(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)
Dedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)
And the day I die, let a G4 fly
And dump my ashes over N.Y


Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name
I told you I was gon' be great ma
I TOLD YOU I WAS GON' BE SOMEBODY!
Ohhh!! Feel so good
Feel so free
Put your fists in the air, AOWWWW!!

I'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules
And do what I do by any means (c'mon)
Call him necessary, the great visionary
Born extrordinary, a life legendary
Who else put flows out, that put clothes out
Flee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out
Nine-six Big showed me what to do
But deep in my heart, this is ""No Way Out II"" (let's rock)
I spend absurd money, private bird money
That Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)
Old habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner
New York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga
I'm seein visions like I did a bag of angel dust
This is life when you black rich and dangerous
I'm with God, I'ma live on forever
Bad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)


Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name
I'm in the best shape of my life!
Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name
YEAH! YOU CREATED THIS MONSTER!
IT'S SO INSPIRATIONAL, IT'S SO REAL
BAD BOY BITCH!

As you can see
I am the crush groovin'
There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight
The record breaking and the record making
Yeah, yeah, turn this up
From the states to over seas
Every city in between I hit the scene
Catch fire like kerosene
Geting paid for more then a decade
We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the PD invasion
Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars
Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar
Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?
No one important, just another nigga flossing
Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real
You just a clone wit' a production deal
I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water
Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya
But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth
Hottest niggas out
Alot better, the shit's too strong
I'm home now, daddy's been gone too long

	What you niggas want
	Wanna talk slick
	Wanna do shit, try shit, new shit
	Who you fucking wit'
	You and your weak clique
	Bitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit
	You coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret
	Trying to be niggas you can't even speak with
	You can't run, you can't hide
	Bad Boy 'till the day we die
Tell they all like Jordan in the fall
On top of the hill like Lauren, Killing 'Em Soft'
What you grillin' me for?
Kept my name good, we from the same hood
Made some change, put the range wit' the stained wood
Now chicks, they keep they eyes on me
Wanna grind on me
Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me
You can't stop 'em when them shells is popping
Look good to the public eye, your streets is watching
At all times, put it all on the line
Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares
No one to talk to, don't know who to trust
Got your gun out and don't know who to bust
It get like that though, when you stack that dough
Can't run from it yo, that's when they get close
So put up you guards, keep faith in God
I promise y'all the world'll be ours
Repeat 1
Your games amaze, but alot of ways, many choices
Can't sleep, when I do I hear voices
Speakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year
So I listen back cause the street is missing that
What a world we live in
So cold I'm shivering, slipping
Gotta work with what I'm given, shit
Bitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'
Niggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'
That's why they hang around you, just to be seen
Type to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine
No blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm
What part of the game is this? And who's side you on?
Can't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work
Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt
In a verse I show the whole earth my work
It got to get better because it can't get no worse

I went from, blocks to greater to fortunes rock related
Now my entire crib is voice activated
Television on, Mr. Combs is home
Solar panel rooftop my, kitchen is chrome
Dim the lights to a purple haze then answer the phone
(Hello?) Peep the moon through my retractable dome
What they thought they assassinated was only a clone
We about to venture off into the unknown (let's go)
Where sunrays hook off layers of ozone
Chips inserted in the brain, the new cell phone
The future, fuck with me now
I'm Grammy certified the committee can pick me now
And they all green with envy like Bill Bixby
Bow down, kiss the tip of my cane, I paid sixty thou'
You know the suit stay crispy now
Hands to the sky and get ready if you wit me now

Yo yo yo
Hey yo shake what ya mama gave you is her motto
Pour out the bottle blow out the candle
Too broke to hold too shallow to handle
Get all today you never promised tomorrow
Yeah her moves remind me of kung fu flicks
Thick lips that contradicts rules of the game
She plays the politics
Red light special red light district
Put on ya make up body all made up
Platinum played up Pearl Jam cut up
Roxanne Roxanne you don't really have to
Put on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue
She got the hots for the disco jocks
Rock ya socks at the pop of the tops
Never get cool like to call it Glock
Twisted minded like Bob Zealot

You dont have to put on the red light (ye ye ye yeah yeah)

Sitting at the bar drinking up Cognac

She wants to party, have a good time
She feels kind of hot me feelin' feelin' fine
Diggin' all her life just to get a gold mine
Bro making the streets she's the pimper's paradise
Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice
She said I heard of ya crew I'm the number one fan
Of the refugees down from the islands
Driving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends
Sippin' colada every day is a weekend
Heard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn
And fifteen million place with your total sound scan
I loved you since I knew you (I like this part, Roxanne Roxanne)
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have you to tell just how I feel (Roxanne Roxanne)

Is This the End? (Part Two),Forever,1999.0,"This is a story about two riders
One's from Chicago
And the other is from New York

Now nigga what? You thinkin' there be no repentance?
But I'm coming back with a vengence
Runnin' like a ant since it was intense
Thought it was the end
Wish every motherfucker's in like sentence
Where they been since?
Let me not go deep in the story
But damn it, I feel the fury when I'm rapping
Got me going off in the zone
Hit eleven niggas and bitches at home
Hear the drama how it happen
Back for one minute
You remember I was grazed in the shoulder
When I plays the beholder
Hit the land like a crusier
But in the Range with the Rov'
Still it feelin' strange to a soldier
Me and Puff trapped in the parking lot
I done found the keys so let's crawl on the floor
Got up beside the ride but we still trapped
But I found my strap, I gotta bust that ho
P., you gotta drive, problem at the angle of the ride
Blast when you crash through the exit
We still alive but the opposition gotta die
When they go then it's on to the next shit
When the car screeched off, I blast my heat off
Thus crackin' our winshield
That stud shoulda been killed
Kept shootin' 'till I seen his bloody body do a windmill
Started catchin' convulsions that we frozen
Ain't nobody here to hold it
Feelin the escape was kinda golden
Now we dozin'
More niggas have rolled in
They started comin' at us with high-tech shit
It's only so much one mac can do
But you know what we got to do
Don't get in the wind
Is it the end or chapter 2
They coming after you
1 - 	
	Living my life on the run
	With these niggas coming after me
	Is this the way that it has to be
	I can't tell these dreams from reality
	Now I'm not afraid to die
	So it really don't matter to me
	It just might be my destiny
	I hope you niggas is ready for me

Yeah, yeah
Saw my whole empire crumble into pieces
As the trouble increases
Escape is the thesis when the car speed releases
I'm on the run like Jesus
The first chapter was sadness but this one is madness
Killers on our asses, plus I'm in 'suit, winney badges
Red and blue light flashing
Now, let's see who's the fastest
Slide through the street like a real C
Hit the curb swervin', but I'm still swift
Damn it, ain't no brakes
I feel like a enemy of the state
We on the run like Will Smith
Pumpin' some real shit
Since the car won't slow down
I had to crash through a window
Level shook but now we on foot with the showdown
Didn't know what we was in for
Somehow, someway we gotta get the ammunition for the gun play
Now I hear some bullets ricochet, motherfucker's got to get away
T., let's go this a-way through the ally
Where these niggas can't score me
And max me a building attack me
Headin' straight for Kennedy, they can't catch me
There 20 minutes exactly
Get tickets at the first airline, first flight out
Get set for the hardcore, could you tell where the sky phone
Me and T. on the plane on our way to Chicago
When we landed in O'Hare
A cop yelled out ""Freeze, we sent here to capture you""
Nigga, you know what we got to do
Tell me, is this the end or chapter 2
They comin' after you
Repeat 1

People better get goin' for the big clone
Leave our shit blown
Coming at us with a C gun, gotta get calm
Then I pick up on the jet phone
So I could see if my bitch home (hello)
Hope the cop that drop them and took a strap then split
Simply, but we acted quick
Damn, there was a Glock
Then we dipped up in the parkin' lot
We saw one Jag' at the Jack-O-V
When we got up on the highway, too smooth
Run away to the hood and we workin' with some new rules
Can't be one who loose
Go to the hideout, make a call for some new tools
And I'm feelin' these fools, we got beef who can die
That want a piece of the pie
But now we got his keys to the shop
And niggas gotta live slow 'till at lesat if they try

Now we can flip my bitch named Angela
She my weed and my wipe and handler
Branding her with a tattoo with my name on it
Make her feel like I'm the man for her
But she lookin' suspicious
And somebody at the front door
Now she looking scared
Soon as I let out the air saying my bitch
Angie up and shot T. in the leg

Should go through the back door
Feelin' torture and pain
I heard shots in the front
Oh we about to die
Straight Kamakozi and ride
There are two things from the start
You wanna go to war, I'll take you to war
I can't make it that easy to ride for me
And when I saw the enemy, I let it ride
Tell me, is this the end or chapter 3?
They comin' after me

You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me
You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers
And say ""That's the bad guy""
So say good night to the bad guy
Go on
Last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again

Ain't another crew like us
That could do like us
See the world from a view like us
Still always come through like us
They ain't true like us
If they only knew like us
It's less than a small few like us
And they ain't pay dues like us
Never on P's and Q's like us
They don't move like us
They don't have the right to choose like us
Or get mad cause they ain't grew like us
They ain't on cue like us
They don't fit the shoe like us
Don't know who's who like us (who dat?)
Strangers, ain't aware of the danger
They head's up wit thoroughbred cats
That knock 'em back, they get the axe
And a hard case to crack
I'm a hard face to track
Fast as they can test us
We flip 'em on they backs, like that
The many men that make us great must stay together
Cause together, we're hard to break


Look out motherfucker
*Gunshot and car peels out*

I tried to warn 'em
You don't wanna double cross us
Haven't you heard how many guy they lost with us
You don't wanna floss with us
Cause shit cost with us
Ain't nobody boss but us
We got force wit us, of course it's us
It's no being better off than us
And ain't a hotter source than us
And these streets ain't divorcing us
We ain't got no remorse in us
Know to hold your horse with us
No cuttin' shorts with us
Here to stay, no abortin us, no extortin' us
Between us we got the mic domain and artillery
Therefore, it's all free reign, who's domain
When shots ring, who remains, they refrain
Who walks away with the gain
Us
Thorough niggas that's hard to top
Together we're too hard to stop


Ain't a bitch like me
That can spit like me
Who could say they rich like me
They don't hold the four fifth like me
Ain't a hit like me
Nobody load the clip like me
Cut coke and flip like me
Make hit after hit like me
Wear the title Queen Bitch like me
Ya'll ain't good in bed like me
And ya'll don't give head like me
Plus your crew don't break bread like me
Think about it, this a one shot deal
Ya'll got one shot still
When my gunshot peel, that's a one shot kill
I'm so far ahead ya'll can't touch my land spread
Cause most of ya'll is misled and underfed
Hey, what can I say, I'm a little vain
Now all aboard if you ridin' my train
Choo chooo, throw it up and represent your gang

Or the west side (West Side)

Album:  Money Talks Soundtrack
Song:   No Way Out
Chorus
(Kelly)
There's no way no way nowhere to go there's no way out
There's no way no way nowhere to turn there's no way out
(Puff talking over chorus)
Yeah yeah uh huh no way out baby
You can't go nowhere ain't got nowhere to turn
Yeah yeah ain't no way out
Ugh check this out
Verse 1 (Puff)
Ready to call it quits from all this shit
Even resign from the niggas I been ballin' with
I'm second guessing all this negative energy
It's making me realize why niggas really envy me
I feel no sympathy it's tight ill
Plus I get slight chills when I write wills
Tired of looking at these ugly niggas with ice grills
No tellin' what I might feel about my glory
2 sides to every story
That's why I pray to God hoping that He reassure me
The more the pain the more the game come with this territory
I might dispose feelin' like my life been chose
All I know in my life lotta ice and hoes
When it's on
My man there gat in his hand
What you do when you got a master plan
But half done ran
Here's ya chance to prove you love 'em
It's on and subbin'
So hot it's feeling muggy. Really though
Chorus
(Puff over chorus)
No matter how bad it gets. It could be worse. Ain't no way out
I gotta live my life you know. You gave me the ends. No matter
How bad it gets there ain't no way out no way out
Verse 2 (Black Rob)
I feel like this approach me with beef ya done
I shoot through pants no chance to pull for ya gun
Man a lot of y'all cats can't stand that 1 on 1
Wind up gettin' embarrassed ain't funny uh huh
Despite the bullshit black still here
Makin' hits down at Chelsea Bea's
Via partaking flicks
No matter what we have to
Come strapped with our gats
We don't want to
But y'all make us act like that
It's a thousand Bad Boy cats ready to blam you
La Familia I steal ya I know how my fam' do
Man handle tracks that be laced by Nas
Rolex watch security straight from the Mosque
Yo I'm all on my own G who should I trust
Niggas bust B.I.G. now it seems they want us
It's like no matter what I do
I can't escape it
Ain't no going around it so
I'ma be a man and just face it
Chorus
Verse 3 (Puff)
It takes heart just to live in these streets
You niggas lift the heat
Take the bitter with the sweet
They can't hurt me
No more than they already did
They killed Big in my heart he forever lives
There's no way out
Like you got Berrettas to my wig
We were slugged then another blood
Shed my ribs uhh
Now the question is Will I survive?
Nigga gotta make it home I gotta still provide
And I get the vibe niggas wanna live to try
Ain't no tellin' what this Bad Boy feel inside
Blood hate the sweat pain be intensified
I'm feelin' stranded as if I can't hitch a ride
Now I tell my seed minimize the genocide
Plus I'm dangerous so numb I feel painless
And you know what you
Tell them niggas who can't touch you
You grab ya nuts and say MUTHAFUCK YOU!
You invited got dones be indicted
And if you kill me

Shmoney Ain’t A Problem,UnKnown,2016.0,"La musica de Harry Fraud

They yellin', ""Bobby put the crack down!""
A nigga makin' money off of rap now
So I had to pass the trap down
In the studio, I feel like Uncle Sam now
Mama always said I was a problem kid
Movin' work, I used to traffic where my mama live
And I even kept them ratchets at my mama crib
I had a 9, a 45 and a banana clip
Pull up on a nigga with a hundred rounds
Ain't no shootin' out the car, we gon' run him down
I told Monte, ""Have him dead before the Sun is down""
Then I tell Fredricks, ""Hit the club and bring a hundred out""
Bitch a hundred out
Bitch a hundred out
Bitch, money ain't a problem
Bring them gunners out, BLAOW
Bring them gunners out
Bitch money ain't a problem

Shawty, bust it open, bend it over, how ya feel?
First they hit me up and then I got up, made a mil'
And my dogs don't swap it if that package ain't sealed
I ain’t talkin' 'bout them Beats, but my dog slangin' pills
The Pepsi and the Cola, crocs and the cobra
Artist and promoter, pull the Phantom and the boat up
Like haan

Mr. Chow's when we chow down
Bumping B.I.G. on the G5, Soundcloud
Lookie here, baby, lookie here

Champagne everything, caviar tears

One time, one, one time

I'm ridin', I'm ridin', I'm ridin', baby
Nigga I was home sleep, that's my alibi
So I don't even know who let the hammer fly

So keep 'em occupied, I slick 'em while your pocket's dry
When you sigh your deal, they wanna know, boy
Tell 'em that I'm GS9, Coke Boy
And tell 'em we brought guns for the smoke, boy
My nigga French still get it by the boat, boy
Say that Shmoney ain't a problem
We drop a bag on 'em, top dollars
And for a Cuban link collar
My lil' nigga Monte go and pop yah
I got shooters where you lack, I got Brooklyn on my back
I got hitters out of town, I'll send 'em where you at
For a Rollie or a stack, they'll fly him off his neck

So we can chill (and have some little ones)
So we can chill (until our living's done)

Can I talk to you for a second?
There's some things I've been meanin to tell you
Some things that have been on my mind
Listen to me baby (let's go)
 Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)
 Boo you know what? (What)
 + (girl)
The day when I first seen you
You know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)
Back then it wasn't oh so fair
You came through like some good clean air
Skin softer than the softest fabrics
You heard about me (I heard about you)
How I ball like the 
Dallas Mavericks
Sayin, anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)
That's 
Harlem World
, I get on my grizzly savage see?
From the first day, we laid eyes on each other
At the office I knew we was gon' be lovers (I remember)
Mark hotel under the covers
You said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers
Who used and abused you and took you for granted
See you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)
Since you got me all sentimental
 w/ Diddy ad libs
 C'mon, don't stop
 Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)

You're so amazin
All I can see is us now in the sun just grazin
Boo your brown complexion, I never seen a
Same color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer
'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?
Goin through tough times and knowin the other side was greener
We had a dream, we pursued it
'Member that conversation, all or nothin before we lose it?
You remember - it's all words like music
Came at a time I needed soothin, soul body and mind
At times I felt violent, you kept me in line
Where-ever I went you wasn't far behind
Girl, we got a bond no one can break
And I'm sayin, I pray to God every night we make it - pray to God
I'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you - c'mon

Now I know I done put you through a lot of shit
I know it's hard fuckin with a nigga like me
Yeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit
Ridin with a nigga
You know.. you might as well

Now sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments
The mansions, the plush apartments and
The big boats and the cases of whole klicko
I don't ever wanna let you go
It's a certain kind of feelin, you know that feelin you get
When your girl right and you know what's what, uhh
You got me on some lay low stuff
You stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff
Brush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em
Without you around, I can't function
We gon' be together 'til the day we die
And when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side
I never had a girl make me feel like you
And every day I wake up, I feel brand new
I live for you and I'll die for you too
I love you girl


Girl, maybe we should think about it
Oh we could be down for life
Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby
You're beautiful lady

Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh
Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin my chronic
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet
Of the almighty, a God to the black child
I told moms I would be somethin
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin
Listen up, I got a story to tell
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone
But nope, I hold my stance in stone
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin
Won't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto
It's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child
Dodgin crisis, three strike system niggas trapped in a vice grip
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush
Thinkin back when my moms gave that first push
Thank God for my life I came through the room
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils

And it's back, better than it ever was
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was
So I deliver the truth uncut
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up
On top of the statue yellin ""Who want what?""
For the past ten years, the future is us
(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer
The preview is over, now enjoy the future

Let’s Get It,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They said that I'm a Rottweiler
And I'm from the Rottweiler house, the Rottweiler New York

Really, get smacked silly, you get smacked silly
Fucking with these niggas from the, what you gonna do
When you ready, shit I was born ready
And I was all ready on fish and spaghetti
Creep with the culture, rap I can coach ya
Attack like a vulture, see what I told ya
Said I'd get cha, wear it if it fit ya
Y'all thirteen inches, I see the big picture
If it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit ya
If not burn it, get hot like a furnace
Shoot the video, motherfuck city permits
We own the city, on the phone with Diddy (*phone sounds*)
Red bone pretty, when she get aroused like to suck her own titty
Put it in the video
Ya wanna holla got to follow nigga here we go
Get you ticket, the train, don't miss it
Won't reach out, and ya bet I won't visit
Till my whole wardrobe is-it, now listen


Make this money
Take this money (Let's get it)
Ain't no way you can take this from me (Let's get it)
Ain't shit funny (uh)
Shake it honey (Let's get it)
Take it money
Now let's get it (Let's get it)

Creep with your people
Though my shit is Sweet and Low it's no Equal, front but you lookin
Once I throw the hook you proceed to get cookin
With the game when the soldiers shit
You came, thought that I owed you one
Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him
With my man's type cargo
Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue
You ain't my crew, who are you? Beat it
'Fore we take off make sure you all seated
Billboard read it believe it


Soul Controller, rap Ayatollah
Kids hate me when they older I put cracks by the stroller
I'm registered voter, motherfuck a quota
Give some bakin soda and a quarter
Bet I flow straight up out the water
I'ma wreck the game til it say out of order
Put the high score up, then tear the floor up
On the world tour with your whore out in Europe, head on the tour bus
Do what them niggas in the drop thinks cooler
All the five quarters, headline supporters
Hitting wives and daughters
Brought a neck spray from Estee Lauders
Call Puffy to order

Aiyyo, call me Diddy, I run this city
Send the cops, the D. A. and feds to come get me
Cats wanna leave me for dead you comin with me
Gettin head in the Bentley red at one fifty
Straight lose it, love two things my money my music
Might co-write and produce it
Drop mine, hot 9 exclusive
Got y'all Hulkin like Bruce did
Cause I can, break backs and stacks it's no problem
Make raps and tracks and go Harlem
I get worldwide coverage
I got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it
Make moves major, hide out in Asia
If your girl keep coming around them I'm a blaze her
I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators
NOT GUILTY, plus I'm filthy, c'mon


I be the east side Soprano, Rob Marciano
Flow in each channel with the Iverson handle
Forty-five sparks turn your day gray flannel
Snatch the yay of the mantle, then proceed to dismantle
Can't slay Rob
How many niggas done tried to play mob, quit they day job
Tired of putting broke niggas under the wing
If I go to jail again I'm going under the bing
Act like you gonna pull that thing thing
You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling
I represent ""A"" block in Sing Sing
Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen
Moves for paper, booze no chaser
Bullets out the blazer four-fifths with laser
Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers say I did it

We just want the summer, you can have that woman
These niggas really out here trippin' man
I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face

I was whippin' on the stove and watchin'  cake
I was whippin' on two pots like I was losin' face
I was diggin' through the crates like Big L, Joe Crack baby
Have a shootout on that corner, right by Larry Davis
Shoutout the G, we roll ourselves, you block, them boys who's dangerous

I want this shit motherfuckin blarin
It ain't loud enough man
Oh these muh'fuckers think I'm gon' play with 'em
Oh I ain't gon' play wit'cha - I ain't gon play wit'cha man!
Ha ha ha.. I need y'all to sing children
Sing, I like it when the children sing
I like it when you sing; I like it when they sing man
That lets you know something's comin
Oh it's comin - aww man something's comin
I like this sound of this - something's comin
You can picture like a photograph, envision the image
Of one-two-fifth street and Lenox
The old folks their souls are cold like tenants
Tryin to keep your weight up better eat that spinach
For four twenty-five niggas lives get diminished
The world serious, I'm tryin to win a pennant
Cops be on patrol through the block every minute
Itchin just to pop somethin, swearin I'm a menace
They disturb me but it's love like tennis
Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage
Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness
Damn it's a scam but I handle my business
Plan to be the man if the Lord be my witness
Do my chin-ups​ with the walk sign for my physical fitness
16's sicker than Alzheimer's, flows is ridiculous
Hold up

Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Hold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up

Easy now I'm seein 'em, mind where you patrol
Fall back young'un, play your lane like a goal
When his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity
Bluetooth nigga but I don't have any cavities
Diddy got it wrapped like cocoons
Pop shit like needles through cow manure balloons
I urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother
About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers
Thugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey
See a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money
Eons beyond bling bling
So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's
Make a name, let it bang so beautiful
The theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals
Or, suitable for, a recuitable whore
To service the whole crew when we out on tour
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up


It's like the music will literally stop time
(Hold up hold up hold up)
We roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up
Get inflicted by my verbal conviction
A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston
You're not focused enough, you're not listenin
You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand
Hop to it, get on your grind music
Across 110th sharp caesar with a lime music
Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning
Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em
Stop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium
We bring New York back like that West side stadium
Fuck the game and if the fame went away
Still be the hardest workin man in entertainment today
Learn a lesson in that, no questionin that
No guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts

Tonight in L.A., rapper Notorious B.I.G
Was gunned down at the media party

No suspects have been taken into custody

As he turned himself in today to local police
For an alleged assault and battery charge
He posted bail and was released on his own recognizance}

Never ending, forever
In my distress, I prayed to the Lord
An' the Lord answered an' rescued me
The Lord is for me, so I will not be afraid
What can mere mortals do to me?
Yes, the Lord is for me, He will help me
I will look in triumph at those who hate me
It's better to trust the Lord
Than to put confidence in people
It's better to trust the Lord
Than to put confidence in Princes
Though hostile nations surrounded me
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
Yes, they surrounded an' attacked me
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
They swarmed around me like bees
They blazed against me like roarin' flames
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord

He has become my victory

Uncle Puffy?
Can you read us a bedtime story, please?
Huh? Please?
(Puff Daddy)
Alright check this out right here
Woke up smoked up, broked up
What I had left and rolled up, lit it
Had a shawty that I brought home, hit it
Sent her on her way, I got no time today
(Yo, I'mma call you next week, aight?)
With all this work I got no time to play (OK)
Cash come and go, and I want mine to stay
Alot of these fake cats won't mind the day
I get an unfair play, then the stairway
That's why I'm like TWA, the airway
Niggas wantin' to believe what they heard through hear-say
Hopin', but forget it
Check the mail, it's a letter from jail, from Hoboken
I open and I read it, it said
(G-Dep)
What da deal son?
It's ya nigga Teals in the field, and it's real son
I'mma have to steal one
Caught up on the run with a gun
Can't walk with it down then you can't conceal one
What to do?
I dont' know if ya knew, that kid, True?
Up in 1-2-2, he plottin' to get you
I hear he's due
You just do what need doin'
Let's not forget these niggas could bleed too , one
(Puffy)
OK, good
Those cats don't keep it real as they should
Heard they don't pay good
Stand around all day wishin' they could
But this green fufills they dreams
They ain't a team
Answering machine on screen
Phone rings, it was Arlene from Queens
Head was mean, had a head for schemes
Told her she get head to see me
But she play her hand proper, nothin' can stop her
(Female)
Hey yo, what up Playboy?
I'm out in Saint Croix
With sun cats that say they real
But they toys
I heard ya doin' it though
And you in the flow
Some niggas wanna ruin ya show?
What up, yo?
Whathchu want a rich shot up on his block?
Or I could leave him in his bed dead, with his dick robbed
(Puffy)
Na Boo, I'mma show you how I do
Just hit me when you get up top
But come on through (Aight)
Now I'm doin' inventory
Guns, clips, vest, bullets
So when I pull it, it's the end of story
Leadin' my men to glory
Then get shorty to hold a pound for me
I know she down for me
Yeah, sneak up on 'em like a car thief
These niggas mad cause it's my party
And my Benz is wide-bodied
Despise me, like the feds despise Ghotti
That I kill for a hobby and lay in your lobby
So try me, go 'head and take a bite
Might as well say good night
Try to put me in the dark, I don't take it light
Now if it's wrong, make it right
Not tommorow, tonight
They barkin', I know the bite
Jumped in the B-N-Z
Niggas gonna see the E-N-D fuckin' with me
See, I knew he was a snake out the ground
Make me wanna call my man rock and break out the hounds
Take it to the pier where you can't make out the sounds
Thoughts in my head goin' 'round, it's goin' down
Pull up to his block, I'mma put it to his knock
But, I don't see him, wouldn't wanna be in town
Ride around for a minute
Thinkin' 'bout the pain that Hell brings
Interrupted by a cell ring
Yeah yeah
(Female) Hey Boo come and get me, I'm here
(Puffy) Where?
(Female) Teterboro
Give me a few
It was like I flew
But it felt kinda strange, it was like I knew
Pulled up around 2, late like I do
With the urge to bug
She gave me a nervous hug
And when I heard the slugs
What I saw in the blur was thugs
Tryin' to soak my fur with blood
Dropped to the curb and ducked
Pulled out the fifth, duck behind a car
Like ""How I'm gon' get out this shit?""
These niggas don't know what they about to get
A one way ticket to Hell in my gun jail
Bust my gun at three and one fell
The other two, waitin' to see what I'mma do
(G-Dep)
Hope you brought your arms
Cuz you're gonna need 'em to hold me
(Puffy)
Peeped around the car slowly
Then I let 'em have the whole wheat
Man there's six million ways to die
And you chose me, but I'm an OG
And in the distance is police
I'm still bustin', tryin' to kill something
And I can't hide the fact that I peeled something
I feel this thing, like in a minute I won't feel a thing
The two cats jumped in the blue Ac'
I fired one shot, they fired two back
They murked off in the night
I get them fools back, man they ain't seen the last of me
But I'm bleeding rapidly
Shot up in the stomach and that wasn't how it had to be
Heartbeat failin', car alarm wailin'
Couldn't walk straight then the firearm failed
Now I'm thinkin' how this bitch played me
Then I faded",https://genius.com/Diddy-pain-forever-lyrics

Lie to industry (Be my baby momma too)
Someone who'll never leave (And always be true)
How I wish my wife could be you

I need a girl that'll ride for me
Situation get real bitch'll die for me
Even step in the courtroom and lie for me
I'm talkin' about right hand in the sky for me
Do twenty-five for me, nigga steal a pound for me
Shorty probably blow a nigga to the sky for me
And go and sit in a chair that'll fry for me
And lord know if I die she gon cry for me
Never say bye to me
I can't deny shorty love is official
Even though love ain't the issue
Shorty still smuggle the pistol
Packin' a gat then hug you and kiss you
Show you love when other niggas that diss you
You on the real
That's the type chick a nigga need
The type smoke all a nigga's weed
And still move at a nigga's speed
Never a victim of a nigga's greed
Especially if she runnin' round with a nigga's seed


I had a girl that woulda died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you woulda had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild
Now these's days that I reminisce
About my little mami I'ma always miss (I miss you)
But long as you happy I'ma tell you this
Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix

Now I done seen chicks come and go
Some in it for the love some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low

'Cause I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be

Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale

	And I see crime, don't die
	And I need changes
	Oh, please, please, please
	Don't go Don't go
Above while:
I'm just trying to get my money, right
Don't fuck wit my money
I won't fuck wit your money
If you fuck with my money
I make you like one of them presidents
Feel me?
Representing my money for the love of my money
I leave a man stiffer than the mummy
Now don't miss it, if I catch them coming for me
When I try to tell a dummy
You took it like I was saying something funny
Took it like my word wasn't shit, like I wasn't legit'
What occurs is gonna be hard to forget
That's something I'll never permit
When I feel my eye twitch things happen
And my voice start speaking a diffrent pitch
Trying to keep things low-low
They don't really know, though
Bad Boy the motherfuckin' logo
Stay on your toes
They shouldn't get it mistaken
Hope they don't think I'm faking
Mess around and get thier life taken and shaken
You know the rule of thumb be
Don't try to take nothing from me
I rule it wit a street stay slummy
Make money's the motto, fuck the niggas that squabble
I know I might be hard for you to swallow
Ya feel me?
Repeat 1 while:
Sometimes I just feel like y'all don't understand
Where I'm coming from, where I'm trying to get to
Shit is really deep, my shit is deep
They don't have a direct understanding of me
Fuck what they planning for me
I just won't accept the bullshit that they handing me
Still standing after the trouble remains, it's me
If you trying to make it clear and explaining to me
And all that negative shit pertaining to me
What ya think I claiming to be
A straight heart staying with me
I can tell it's about to go down
I told them, slow down before I send the low down
And skip out of town
And I don't wanna but I'll do it if I gotta
The situation is serious and getting hotter
You know what they say about those that slow on the trigger
Less then a second too late and you one dead nigga
So I take aim and I squeaze and deliver
Like I told them, just to let him know 'til' he figures out
It's make money's the motto
Something ya'll should follow
And I don't got no time for the squabble
Ya feel me?
Repeat 1 until fade while:
Sometimes you just get tired of shit
Sometimes you just get fed up
Don't hate me, hate yourself, motherfuckers
Don't hate me,  hate yourself
Cause I ain't never gonna stop
I ain't never gonna stop
I'll make you feel me forever
And ever and ever and ever
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it's gonna be",https://genius.com/Diddy-i-hear-voices-lyrics

Let's go
Hey, girl, what your name is? Where you from?
Turn around, who you came with?
Is that your ass or your momma have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging, mama but where your brains at?
(Come on)
I'm still the same cat, when I was young, I was running with Bad Boys
But now I'm older, hope they saw I'm running with Bad Boys
(That's right)
Here come another man unlike no other man
Candy coated, whoa, switching in every lane
Y'all help me, why don't cha please help me?
A thug is we then it's only two G
I like the cocky bow legged ones like white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, shake it for Nelly-san
Manolos, ma, no no's, I can't tell
Everybody and their hoochies, when you do it do it well
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather
Now real girls get down on the floor
(On the floor)
Get that money, honey, act like you know
(Like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants
Enter the floor, take it low, girl, do it again
You know I love that
(I love that)
Now where them girls at?
(Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee and Nelly how you love that?
(Shit)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it, player?
Baby, you impressive, let's get to know each other
You the best of the best
And you got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here, mama, you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low, so when you shake it, I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers 'til the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow

Oh, no, I heard them Bad Boys coming
Can't stop now, got to continue my running
(Yeah)
Because we go party 'til them lights come on
And then my song start thumping because my mike still on
Yo, I'm the big booty type, I like them thick with their mind right
Banging personality conversate when the time right
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, He the man, when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, Popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile because I be about Gs
Keep your women wizzy, man, they say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money
(I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See, I'm Starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my Rats come in Packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you'd think I was valet parking
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low

I want her to lose control
Mary, talk to 'em

I
Yeah

You takin' a part of me
That I cannot set free
See me lettin' go
No this ain't the time
I got too much livin' to do
And I can't lose it over you
So give me the flow
I'll get my swagger goin'
I'll say this is the year for me
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you

I know I make it hard to love me
But trust me
I could take you to places
That you ain't never been
Put you in purple labels
And that ferroin
Get your name engraved
On a weaderin
I'ma love you better
More than I ever did
Cause baby girl listen
Since you been here with me
Can't even lie
See the rider and your ambition
Providin' me with the fire
When you wet and drippin'
Mama if you see if you different
Go 'head and get it
And I ain't sayin' if you leave me
It'd be better
But me and you together
Honey we could do whatever
Let's do it
I made it hard
I admit it it's true
I need to hear somethin'
I'm listenin' boo

Make that sure things that do
I'm prepared to take it there for you
Your lovin' kissin'
It's amazin'
But it ain't enough
So I keep askin'
I stay around
For one, split the cheese
Admire it for what it is

I know I'm hard to love
Let's rock

For me to love you

Lemme talk to you one more time girl
You always sayin' that I don't want you to hurt
You always complainin'
But I was makin' it worse
Besides all the games that I's kickin' at first
It's time to explain
My mind's been in reverse
But now I think back
When nobody cared
And you was there
Just to roll by your man
And came back
Even know what I did
I realize and I'm aware
I know what it is
Put that on everything
Girl you my everything
I don't know where I'd be
Cause you the air I be
If lovin' is wrong
Who could be right
I wouldn't know what to do
Without you in my life
You're more to me than the world I pray
The more nights for your heart to break
Right in the middle of the dawn of day
I think of all the pain I caused
And throw it away and say
I need you in my life
Can you feel it in your soul

You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you

I know it's hard to love me
That don't mean I don't love you
Hey rich
I love the way you got Harlem singin'
Mary take us home

You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you
You makin it so damn hard
For me to love you

Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Let's play a game, let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, trying to see into your mind
See into your soul, no limits to the levels me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you that makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing and the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going, got me going outta my brain
I see us going at it, going in and outta them lanes
I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number, baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up looking like there’s something you wanna
Tell me
What you thinking about when you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you that really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak
Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it
I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
‘Cause baby you're invited, yeah
I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
‘Cause baby you're invited
Your dreams fulfilled, you're rocking with the best
Unforgivable I’ma put your limits to the test
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, you’re trying to catch your breath
(Don't stop)
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the force in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approached you, look how I expose you
Look how I done studied every move, now I know you
I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me
(Don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see, the passion's inside me
It's yours, now come try me, c'mon
Tell me
What you thinking about when your hands is all on me
‘Cause I've been thinking about all the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
‘Cause you swept me off my feet, ooh
Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it
I know you're gonna like it

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
‘Cause baby you're invited

With no kisses, so tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe
I got a selection of positions, affection
With no kisses, so tell me

Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go
Hey, girl, what your name is? Where you from?
Turn around, who you came with?
Is that your ass or your momma have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging, mama but where your brains at?
(Come on)
I'm still the same cat, when I was young, I was running with Bad Boys
But now I'm older, hope they saw I'm running with Bad Boys
(That's right)
Here come another man unlike no other man
Candy coated, whoa, switching in every lane
Y'all help me, why don't cha please help me?
A thug is we then it's only two G
I like the cocky bow legged ones like white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, shake it for Nelly-san
Manolos, ma, no no's, I can't tell
Everybody and their hoochies, when you do it do it well
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather
Now real girls get down on the floor
(On the floor)
Get that money, honey, act like you know
(Like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants
Enter the floor, take it low, girl, do it again
You know I love that
(I love that)
Now where them girls at?
(Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee and Nelly how you love that?
(Shit)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it, player?
Baby, you impressive, let's get to know each other
You the best of the best
And you got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here, mama, you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low, so when you shake it, I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers 'til the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather
Oh, no, I heard them Bad Boys coming
Can't stop now, got to continue my running
(Yeah)
Because we go party 'til them lights come on
And then my song start thumping because my mike still on
Yo, I'm the big booty type, I like them thick with their mind right
Banging personality conversate when the time right
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, â€½He the manâ€, when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, Popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile because I be about Gs
Keep your women wizzy, man, they say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money
(I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See, I'm Starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my Rats come in Packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you'd think I was valet parking
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go

Nah’mean? So, you know, I’m fucking with the chick
So you, nah’mean, I say “Come back to the telly, you nam’sayin’? Let’s pop off somethin’
I got a little Hennessy up there, a little Thug Passion, whatever” (Yeah)
You know, so she was like, “Alright, cool.” Nah’mean?
She went and did what she had to do
Met me at the hotel about 12 midnight
You know, I’m in there, you know, I’m doing me
I’m smoking wild cheeba (Yeah)
I don’t know how it jumped off but it just jumped off
By the time I knew anything, nah’mean, mah’mean...
She was sucking a nigga off
She start pulling my pants down, threw me on the bed
Like, “I like it rough” (Yeah)
You know, started sucking on my nipples—I love that shit
And she started sucking the god toes
And I’m thinking to myself, I’m like, “Yo, hold up…”
This bitch sucking my toes, I’m an old nigga
So I know my toe game ain’t up to par

In a world of, larger moves, new cars to cruise
Sometimes I make the news, falsely accused
I gotta shake the spot when the stakes is high
A brother needs space like a vacant lot
I'm lookin forward to the future, Mase and The Lox
And my little son Justin, touchin a knot
You knew I was comin for the crowns that's uptown
You knew I was comin to put it down so what now?
It's the Bad Boy, pull up and break the clutch down
In the five-speed, smirkin then pull up at high speed
Can you enterprise and rise like cream do?
And leave em talk about the last time they seen you?
Game is magnet, to everything platinum with my
Name attached, can you all do that?
Think one thing when you read my name
That Puff nigga, the game'll never be the same

What do you do when they
Love you? (Let's) ""live your life""

Love turns cold? (Let's) ""live your life""

Can I love you baby? What we about to do
Could make the whole earth move, I tell you my first move
Climb up in it slow, I ain't tryin to hurt you
Can you feel me baby? Should I keep it right there?

And lay your pretty body in the middle of your bed

Nigga tell me right, Loon going southpaw
This is Bad Boy, we don’t give a fuck about y’all
Step in the room, see the bitch come up out y’all
I fuck with niggas, but it’s something about y’all
Acting like Loon can’t do shit without y’all
I call my menses in Benzes to out y’all
See how it feel when your friends be without y’all
I been doing it; coke, I been moving it
Before you niggas thought of the block, I been through with it
Keep confusing this music shit, die for some foolishness
Frontin’ like you hard when you’s a bitch
You hit the block, probably lose your whip
Niggas snatch your watch and the rocks out your crucifix
Watch how we do this shit, Bad Boy 2K’n it
So playboy, what type of pimpin’ is you playing with?

See, they Bad Boy money can’t done

Still the same cat who put the ‘Flava in Ya Ear’
Still the same cat who let B.I.G. rock with Total
Most wanted, successful rap mogul
Still got niggas whylin’ out on the floor
Still got the sky blue drop-top Azure
Still at eat at Justin’s and Sean John velour
Still humble, and still want more
Still hate war, still want peace
And I still can’t stand to see Blacks beefin’
Y’all still sleepin’ and we still eatin’
Still bring the heat, whylin’ out on the weekend
Still happenin’, Black, and don’t need a reason
Still platinum, back in London and Sweden
Still pack the Garden like Adam did Eve’n
And still got rhymes to leave your girlfriend freakin’

Ayo, besides all the money and riches, videos and pictures
Slip and these silly hoes’ll getcha
But not me, I’m too cocky
I love when the women scream “Hey, papi”
I love when a chick leave my crib knock-kneed
And I love when a player hater try to knock me
Or cock block me, but you can’t stop me
You cuff ‘em all you want, but you can’t top me

I’m just a B-A-D, B-O-Y
Son, we multiply—nigga, we don’t die
Niggas frontin’ like we ain’t fly
But nigga can’t name nothin’ that we ain’t buy
Or we ain’t try, or we ain’t drive

But I can't quit cause I'm on some Evander sh*t
F**k the money and the white sand and sh*t
When it's said and done you gunna understand this sh*t

That only fit in his little house little garage
His lifestyle is just a little mirage
He the type of cat that never had a menage
Backrub, you know a little massage
Tight sh*t you get when you Head Nigga in charge

Leaned back wit a chick smoking on cigars
From Bogota, Colombia, chicks from Panama

Pull off your top make it shake like Jello

Taking you in, Angels breaking you in
This is heaven and no longer do you have to sin
And may God bless your mom and your two children
Your wife, your family and all your friends
Everybody stay strong, the good die young
Where we from it's all wrong, we all confused
Never know what we have til what we have we lose
Think Big, we just lost a very big jewel
Hip-hop itself is at a pit-stop itself
Seeing Big die I wish the shit would stop itself
It hurts, you're probably too good for this earth
Genius at his work
Made dirty cats wanna get a clean shirt
Pop Cristal and rock they ice work (word), go Big (go Big)
Everybody wanted to know Big
Made the rap biz, glitter like showbiz
Ask anybody, who could flow Big
All the cats shined, but you would glow Big
Frank White lyrically, moved niggas spiritually
Made you wanna get a cup, fill it up with Hennessee
Front in the club and light a dutch where the women be
If you seen the show then I know you felt the energy
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) 
Just to let y'all know, everything is all real
But it's sad when a good fella catch a raw deal
And pain is a part of life that we all feel
Today this whole rap game is getting more ill
It make me look back, to where he took rap
Dude brought the East back, y'all better believe that
He never had a warning, One More Chance
Was right before him everybody must answer when God's callin
I flew B's wit him, I blew trees wit him
Couldn't wait to go on tour across seas wit him
People seem to get lost and, blow things out of proportion
Life is worth more than the coffin
I need answers, and they better be the truth
Hurts like a bad tooth, we losin mad youth
Lyrically there'll never be no one above you
And no matter how they judge you we always gonna love you
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) 
Right now I know you missin it, smokin in peace
After all this bullshit don't cease, huh Big
Right now, you and Pac in harmony, probably huggin
While everybody from Brooklyn to West coast is buggin
All these gang wars, Big, show me a sign
As for your son I'ma raise Shorty like he was mine (no doubt)
It seems that the devil got his stinkin back whooped
And we should pray for Jesus, and ask for forgiveness
I can remember all the studio time, getting twisted
Bottle after bottle, Bacardi Lime, I miss it
We clicked like heels when we first met the
Junior Ma-f-i-a and Big Po-ppa
Nearly broke down four times writin this verse
Filled with wild madness and sadness it hurts
But ain't no need to cry, cause right now, where you at
Is more laced than any place a millionaire lived at
But it's sad that it takes that for us to unite
The only time you see your family is funeral night
Christopher Wallace, Frank White, holdin it down
I guess you with the real king in New York now
For real
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) 
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa

""And now.. for your.. Bad Bad Boys..
Starting at guard..""

Y'all niggas still talkin?
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowin I'm the boss and
I'm sittin on pyramids, flossin
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back livin off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you actin like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, makin my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
Or pick up your CD, P.D

This is gruesome
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you livin an illusion, livin in a used one
While I'm in the Limited, cruisin
You ain't really got a crew son
You givin them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
Youse a smokehead
I've been doin this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped
I said; I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett
Run and get your CD and cass-ette
Gossip, lotta niggas got lip
But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep

Why niggas lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that
Niggas get fried like that
And you don't wanna die like that
Have your momma cryin like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it fryin like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

Keep frontin, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezin the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
Y'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggas what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggas stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggas that ain't notice
The breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga

We'll never stop..
We'll never stop..
One of the greatest teams that ever lived..
It's like in our blood..
We gotta be born this way..

Hey yo Puff, check this out pa
I'm tired of niggas hating on a mutha fucka
Let's take it to the next millennium on these bitches
You got to keep bubblin on em
Platinum doublin on em, fuck these niggas
Hey yo, I bumped into these cats tha otha day' they was like
""Yeah, what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice""
I said yo, the brother dont swear he nice he knows he nice
You public enemy number one right now
But Fuck that dash shit spit that hydro-ghetto shit
(Puff Daddy)
Let's go
That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear
Throw your guns in the air
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see
What ya wanna be you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my road dogs they'll spit for me
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?
Run from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking no rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
More hotter than the sun
I'm living on the run
Because i'm public enemy number one
Chorus:
One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One
(Puff Daddy)
Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?
Is it my house or maybe its all three
I just came up and you're all against me
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?
Then ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game cause you shittin the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Threw me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun
Cause they got me public enemy number one
Chorus
(Puff Daddy)
All you suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dem sweating
Givin em the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""
Till ya know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
I'm public enemy number one
Chorus
(Hurricane G)
Yeah yeah, that's right Puff
That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad
Cause you got all the ladies
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys
You know? and thats just the way the story goes
And thats just the way the story goes
Fuck you niggas and hoes

My seed gotta grow
I got a reason to flow, a reason to show
What I mean is I go
Off like a champ, when I cling to the flo'
My twinkies shine when I hit the strip, 'llac dippin
Strictly pimpin, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-Y-C I'm representin
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dickin, chokin hoes with anaconda
If my pimpin was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer
I hit the highway smoked out pistol grippin
But I ain't trippin though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

"On Revolt TV, Time-Warner Deal",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Billboard: Congrats on Revolt’s Time-Warner distribution deal
Sean “Diddy” Combs: Thank you very much. I’d have to say it’s definitely the most exciting thing I’ve done in my business career and one of the hardest things. I’ve been blessed with an opportunity to really help be a platform for music -- the art form that has given me my career, my life and to take it to the next level. It’s something I think I was put on this earth to do and I’m ready to turn it all up.
Billboard: How did the Time Warner deal come together?
Sean “Diddy” Combs: Well, it started with Comcast. Comcast had a diversity program because there was a lack of diversity in the cable and media industry as far as ownership. We were inspired by Oprah…and besides her, we have Bob Johnson and you can barely count on one hand people of any color – tan, yellow, or black – who own content-creating networks or brands that have distribution in the tens of millions that can truly have impact. So out of a couple of hundred people, myself and Magic Johnson were awarded the networks on the diversity side.
I immediately started going around to the different affiliates and pitching them my concept. Everybody in this industry is losing millennials at an all-time fast rate to the Internet and digitally due most importantly to the lack of content that relates to their lifestyle. But the one thing I have is the number one form of entertainment for millennials: music. And I have the credibility, the authenticity, the vision, and the insight to be able to create something new and to step in where MTV left off -- without trying to be a newer version of MTV -- by being Revolt.
Billboard: I’m curious about specific programming ideas, obviously, there isn’t a huge music news hub on TV right now but do you have specific ideas of what shows you want Revolt to carry?
Sean “Diddy” Combs: Yes. As far as the DNA of the shows that we will carry, there will be a rawness to them. We will not be doing a bunch of reality shows. We’ll be doing music-driven shows that will be exposing you to the discovery and curation of new talent. We’ll also be doing in-depth interviews, we’ll be doing shows that will go into social issues with different panels and debates. We’ll be doing our version of a Barbara Walters/Oprah interview but with someone from this generation and of this generation. We’ll be going to where the pulse of music is happening and we’ll be covering it in the way ESPN will cover a sports event – with that level of urgency and seriousness.
We’ll also be doing some things that are out of the box with musical artists that have aspirations to be actors, to do short films and we’ll also cover the world of music on a global level. More than ever right now, people are interested in artists from other countries – what’s going on in Australia, what’s going on with artists in Paris, what’s going on with artists in London. We’ve had this thing in America for so long where we play our artists over here and maybe if you get hot enough over there, we’ll let you come over. The world doesn’t work like that. It’s in real-time right now. And that’s the start. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And we feel like, if we can do that good and, most importantly, every half an hour, report the news and report it quicker than it can be put up on a blog, we will build that currency with people and when they think about music, they think about Revolt and to me, that is more important than that one particular show.
But, as far as doing shows, I’ve been with Viacom for six years and I was the number one producer of shows from 18-34 and I plan on continuing down that street but also strategically that I represent music in the right way. And when you tune into Revolt, you’ll see musical content and you won’t see a reality show with fighting that has nothing to do with music.
Billboard: In the months and years ahead of how, how much will Revolt become your primary focus?
Sean “Diddy” Combs: I think it is an evolution for me. Honestly, I think I will personally be putting out less music and I’ll be going into that phase of empowering the next artists. Not saying I won’t make any music anymore, but for me the priority is the future. The priority for me is the next Jay-Z, the next Kanye, the next Beyonce, the next Lady Gaga. And supporting them…",https://genius.com/Diddy-on-revolt-tv-time-warner-deal-annotated

Cruise around the globe, the cops thinkin' it's stolen
Understand, the world's in my hand
G. Dep in this scam, no stunt
Bitch play the front
And I'ma show you how to lay back do a buck while you puff on a sac

Got it different? You ain't on what you talkin' about
Bustin' off in her mouth, catch me
I'm feelin' for whoever test me, pity for whoever second guess me
Know how to ?manhand'? it's real as it get
Feelin' my shit, straight through the cealin' with this
Bet your block love it, find me only with the grimy
Gutters of the street where my mind be
Play the game, get you a 'zil'
Forever, put you until, it fit me to kill
Heat, got it with me still
Flip the game over, see me, we be, untouched
Out like your motherfuckin' guns bust, BLAOW
Sure shot, hit again, spit it grim, anytime, anyplace

Blast off, yo I get it poppin'
When I rock, yo it's non-stoppin'

Bottles gon' pop, cause when I rock, everybody rock
Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off
Straight to the top, cause everybody know this is hot
Aiyyo son, I'm about to blast off, like an astronaut
Niggas don't wanna see a nigga blast the Glock
Niggas don't wanna see a nigga flash the rocks
And pop up in the flashy drop - motherfuckers
Niggas know me, Loon's a gunslinger
Fuck fightin' a nigga, I'm usin' one finger
Catch one of you rap cats in the 'Humdinger'
Some niggas get shot, livin' with 'pump-singers'
Expect to die, I'd rather sit in a chair, electrified
This thing here, testify
But, other than that though, we never get caught
We ?Joy Jefferson? walk, out of federal court
We came ready in ?thought?, ain't better the sport
So whatever you thought, you can use whatever support
But, I think it's best you go 'head and just walk
Or have the cops find traces of lead in your corpse

Look here momma you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see you're thong
My pocket's full of dough shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly man somebody better warn them

Oh no I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (yea)
'Cause we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start fucking 'cause my mic still on
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like them thick with their mind right (Awe)
Banging personality conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard I've got women to handle that
They be like he the man when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a juvenile
'Cause I be about G's
Keep the women wheezy man, they say they have my babies
I'm young like Turk, I like the cash and the money (I'ma eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See I'm starving like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire (is what I'm starting)
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys you'd think I was valet parking

Oh no I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (yea)
'Cause we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start fucking 'cause my mic still on
Let me see you shake ya tail feather

Girl go and take it low
We can even do it slow (we can even do it slow)
Either way you want to go (either way you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something, shake ya tail feather",https://genius.com/Diddy-shake-ya-tailfeather-nelly-p-diddy-murphy-lee-amended-version-lyrics
Last Night (Acapella),Last Night EP,UnKnown,"Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
Girl, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out, with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see, it all belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
(You said you couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial

And I'm sitting here (Sitting there) with this blank expression
(I can't read your mind, baby)
And the way I feel (The way I feel), I wanna curl up like a child

I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will

I tried to call (Alright), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why would you just hurt me, baby? Oh)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
(Don't save me baby, don't, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)

Tell me what words to say to make you come back
Don't break me like that (Ooh)
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home (Baby)
With you, I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone
Whatever you do, just don't leave me

Last night (Yeah), I couldn't even get an answer (Didn't get an answer, baby)
(Oh) I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial

Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
And call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you

{Phone dialing and ringing}
""Hello
Hey what's-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you, right?
But for them couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house
{Laughing}
That's really how it goes down, right?""",https://genius.com/Diddy-last-night-acapella-lyrics
Child of the ghetto,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, yeah, yo
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yo
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yo
Uhh, uhh, G. Dep!

A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin the scripture the picture they painted for me
Rippin it runnin and gunnin and aimin for me
Yo.. (yeah, uhh, yeah)
I guess you niggas told me right and exact
Shak, shak, right in his back
I might just crack while I'm writin this rap
From even, a tire that snap, I'm light in the sack
I tell you how I feel and that's part of the deal
I'm like, Seagal with the steel but ""Harder to Kill""
It's real, big Beans up for lettin me know
Fifteen bet and you blow, better get dough
Won't be a second we won't; they lettin me go
Since pays wisen your ways, allow me to grow
Aiyyo (yo) swing yeah back to the scene
Seven-four-eight-oh, can't recall in between
Whole state pulsate, we can wrinkle the town
Park jams dark shams niggas breakin it down
Niggas rock the heaters, my clique rocked Adidas
Didn't know the blocks were where the spots would lead us
But hey..

A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't the game or the greed
Rippin it runnin and gunnin and aimin for me
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin the scripture the picture they painted for me
Niggas is gamin they ain't who they claimin to be
Niggas that know me they told me the game it could be - CRAZY

I take you back to the scene of the stunt
Scene of that rhyme and you can think what you want
And if you.. and if you tell me you can get it from here
Got boom got boom, put shit in the air (yeah yeah yeah)
Get us some gear to get us in here
Waited years to get a premier and did it from here
Harlem - citizen where the kid is in gear, guard him
Niggas in here, who get it in here, we are them
Take you back to the 80's around
Polo Grounds, Uptown, eight-eighty a pound
Niggas hit the rooftop, y'all was roofin the rocks
Other niggas shoe tops, only youth on the block
You dig me - movin in tops and movin these rocks
You get it - we movin them blocks to move in them drops
Skiddin - I guess the niggas told me right and exact
When they said stop fightin and stack it - get the money nigga


Eighty-one I had fun, eight-two I was new
Eight-three I did me, eight-four I had grew
Eighty-five it got live, eight-six in the mix
Eighty-seven in the kicks, eighty-eight in the whips
Eighty-nine I had the grind, now I know it was flow
Ninety-one we got guns, ninety-two it was dough
Nine-three was the key, nine-four was sure
Nine-five took a dive, nine-six I was poor
Nine-seven did eleven now I'm made out the gate
Nine-nine spit rhymes two-thousand and straight..
Shit, I thought I'd give housing a break
Sit back, countin the cake, and lounge in estates, but yo

Birth to mother f**kers like this destness for grateness the legucy continues show em what you got",https://genius.com/Diddy-intro-lyrics
So complete,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I remember what you said to me, when you said it to me last night
We was talkin', and you reassured me everythings fine
When I woke up this morning to get some loving from you
I turned to one side, to my suprise, I wasn't layin' next to you(mmmm)
Why don't you get closed to me, I thought it was supposed to be
Me and you, you and me, so complete(so complete)
While you handlin' me this way, what was it?
You was talkin yesterday, yesterday, I could say
I seemed to be so complete, so complete

Went away, you said nothing
You didn't, no kiss, no lovin'
You didn't, it's a shame
But it brings about the weak in me
Brings about the weak in me
You didn't, spend a lifetime with me
You didn't, share things I wan'na see
You didn't, when ever your around me it's so complete

So I waited, and I wanted, 'cause I knew you would come
Hours 1, hour 2, hour, 3 hours, not at all
If I'm dreaming, wake me up
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough
I can not see, how would you ever let this happen to me
I still belive, that it was supposed to be
Me and you, you and me, so complete
So complete, so complete
If you saying that you need to leave, then be a man about it
And step to me, step to me, tell me please
And without me it's so complete, so complete
Repeat Chorus

Won't you tell me right now what you want from me(what you want from me)
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby(held it in, oh)
Thought you where the one but, you just played me(you know you played me)
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete, yeah
Repeat Chorus (with different variations)

Please, give me the respone I need
I want you to complete me, oh baby
Please, give me all the lovin' I need
Promise you will complete me, oh baby
Baby, what more can I say
'Cause I want you to tell me
What it is you wanna do
'Cause I want'a be with you
(be with you...)",https://genius.com/Diddy-so-complete-lyrics
