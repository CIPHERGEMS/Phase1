Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat),Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993.0,"We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You, dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with 
waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock
But
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat

We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeter cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them they be crazy down with the five Nat'
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be digging it with a bump verse
Us we be freaking til dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi (wassup)
Who understood, yeah understood the plans
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or they'll be just like juice
If it's the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic
, 
Hip hop gains a classic
Pimp playing shock it don't matter I'm fatter
Ask Butta how I zone (man, Cleopatra Jones)
And

We getcha free cause the clips be fat boss
Them they're the jams and commence to going off
She sweats the beat and ask me cause she puffed it
Me I got crew kids 
seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him, that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll
The lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a Bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids
And
I'm peace like dat

Where I’m From,Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993,"Peace, peace, peace y'all
Strange
Real strange, real strange
An overdose, a nickel bag of funk
Now move on, move on yeah
Hey man are you ready to go

Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, Ahmed play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like run your coat black
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rocking Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some where I'm from
The beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G where I'm from
The fire hoses blow
It's purple when it snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip
When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothing, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from

Weekend Dig Plans got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beats and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids where I'm from
We living off the boom boom crack
It's that hip-hop rockers, jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot right foot 1-2 mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair, here's a bib, have a listen
Of hardhead intervene, damn I know you're fluent
Yeah, cause Doodle ain't having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from

Venus acts a fool at the square right, yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right, yeah
Hip-hop made a point last year right, yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right, yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Rising like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle, Mecc, and Silk, the quad where it's at
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn, kick it till dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-where-im-from-lyrics
La Femme Fetal,Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993,"It was 8:49 on a beautiful 9th day of July
There was not a cloud to speak of, so the orange sun hung
Lonely in the sky
I lay prone in my cavi home
Thinking of fine nappy Jackie and his jazzcat's horn
Sliding in a tape of Bird on Verve, when suddenly rang my phone
""Hey, Butterfly,"" the voice said
""Slip on some duds, comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
The vibe here is very pleasant, and I truly request your presence
A problem of great magnitude has arose
And as we speak it grows""
""Damn, what could it be?"" I thought
A juice I bought and rolled on down to her spot
Seeing bros I know, slapping fives I arrived and pressed G-5
And there was Nikki
Lookin' some kind of sad with tears fallin' from her eyes
She sat me down, and dug my frown and began to run it down
""You remember my boyfriend Sid, that fly kid who I love?
Well, our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
But due to our youth and economic state, we wish to terminate
About this we don't feel great, but baby, that's how it is
But the feds have dissed me
They ignored and dismissed me
The pro-lifers harass me outside the clinic
And call me a murderer, now that's hate
So needless to say, we're in a mental state of debate""
""Hey, beautiful bird"", I said, digging her somber mood
""The fascists are some heavy dudes
They don't really give a damn about life
They just don't want a woman to control her body
Or have the right to choose
But baby that ain't nothin'
They just want a male finger on the button
Because if you say war, they will send them to die by the score
Aborting mission should be your volition
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
You'll be standing in line unable to get Welfare while they'll be out
Hunting and fishing
It has always been around, it will always have a niche
But they'll make it a privilege, not a right
Accessible only to the rich
Hey, pro-lifers need to dig themselves
Because life doesn't stop after birth
And for a child born to the unprepared
It might even just get worse
The situation would surely change, if they were to find themselves in it
Supporters of the H-Bomb, and fire-bombing clinics
What type of shit is that? Orwellian, in fact
If Roe v. Wade was overturned, would not the desire remain intact
Leaving young girls to risk their healths
And doctors to botch, and watch as they kill themselves
Now, I hate to sound macabre
But hey, isn't it my job
To lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
To fight against these fascists
So, whatever you decide, make that move with pride
Sid will be there and so will I
An insect 'til I die
Rhythms and sounds
Spinning around
Confrontations
Across the nation
Your block
My block
Dreadlocks
What a shock
Land of the free
But not me, not me

Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me
Hey, what's happening?
Insects causing fun?
93 million miles away from the Sun
New grooves, show improve
It's the moves (The moves)
Funky songs, but maybe not for long
So, check it out",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-la-femme-fetal-lyrics
9th Wonder (Blackitolism),Blowout Comb,1994.0,"Ah yea
Whole world
MCs
Whose slick?
We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh-ass hair
Style baggy out, clout, slick
Creamy and fresh East Coast to West
Brooklyn, making money
Uptown, making money
To the Universal fam, making money
Old school MCs, making money

I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave, A-train,
 
got the pick in my hair
And what sixteen joints later still lounge
Fresh from Flatbush in my baggy booster Guess
Style is type ease, busted cami fatigues
50,000 leagues of Black, so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the East son, wild Crooklyn, New York
Creamy kids yell Smith and Wesson when I'm blessing
The angular slang blow spots, bang—eleven
Hanging like bats cause the twelve-inch wax
Say ""Scorpio""
And my hair say 'fro
And my blood say 'bro
My clique say, ""a-yo""
Make sparks from the barrel mental pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wildflowers
Scott La Rock had 'em all
I gots to ball, and roll with little Panthers through these project halls
The three-color flag can't hold my baggy sag
7-1-8 to Omega
Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of deep classics
Now glamor boys want to be triple phatted
But I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year

East born
Beats Tannoys on
Lovely, all over the city
In your tape deck blasting
7R's and the phat fly sneakers
And the camouflage

To the hip-hop nation, making money
To the mixtape crew, making money
To the West Coast, making money
To the Boogie Down Bronx, making money

I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And five elements posture, take a B-boy stance
With the gold front shining, baggy pants sagging
This Brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
But I'm climbing, finding new ways of rhyming
Not living like a star, it's strictly bout surviving
Diving, deep into the grooves of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes the notorious, with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect in motion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now I'm rolling with the seven and the crescents
Puffing some expression
Manifesting today's lessons
Stressing the fact that I'm solar guaranteed to go far
Cause the mind is interstellar
Still peace like that, so have no fear
But I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year

To the queens everywhere, making money
To the whole S.I, making money
To the 
lumpen mass
, making money
Don't forget about your peeps when ya, making money

Now you see that I'm 68 inches above sea level
93 million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter
Play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn
Any order
You want em I got em, dripping like water
Catch me at a hot spot with the 
dusk daughters
We bouncing, moving within the true circles
We played you, made you change, straight New Yorked you
We stratify our wealth from my Luchi in the bank
There's love amongst the ranks
Now I'm about to beep my homegirl
Cause we be alike
A-alike, C-alike, yes G-alike
Jazzy Joyce, on the wheels
Jazzy Joyce, no one smoother
Jazzy Joyce
, 
phatter than a '94 Land Cruiser
Where you from
The Bronx representing like whatever, pa
Cool, are you slicker this year
Yeah, watch",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-9th-wonder-blackitolism-lyrics
Pacifics (Sdtrk ”N.Y. is Red Hot”),Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993.0,"Butterfly searching for a relax
Pulling from the jazz stacks cause it's Sunday
On the air is incense, sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems they're equal
Wonder what would Trane say wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me I'm cooling in New York
I'm chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brother's at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtime's extended and highly recommended
But early birds like me's up checking out the scene
The early worms jog, forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people, the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm it's like Hades transformed
On Sunday's early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but don't take em for granted, just chill

New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

(We venture through the streets in search of funky beats)
Doodlebug: Extensive is the travels and it's heavy on the sneaks
L: Yeah it's kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
(My man do Planets do it lovely?)
Doodlebug: Am I my brother's keeper?
(We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk)
Ladybug: And sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
Doodlebug: Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
(Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple)
Ladybug: You be thinking peace when you're vibing with your flock
Doodlebug: But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
(If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else... violence)
Ladybug: But right here is the life, it's the children of the concrete
(Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats)
Doodlebug: Hip-hop's all around, the members is growing
(Please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing, so chill)

New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

Wake up, praying that the game's on
Maybe it's the Runnin' Rebs, maybe it's the Knicks
Maybe it's a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii 5-0
 or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now I'm chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope, dig it
Sunday's to relax
Sunday's to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hot line is in I guess the silvers knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think ain't nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm, some Sartre, Camus
Mingus' Ah Um, damn Roach can drum
The DP's are life, there they go, here they come
It's time to grab some loot, put on the Timber boots
Checking out some dollies like Tasha and Kamali
New York is a museum with its posters and graffiti
If you're in the city on Sunday
Come check me, get with me

New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

Black Ego,Blowout Comb,1994.0,"Alright, boy

Ah, man

Give you your rights

Here we go again

You have the right to remain silent

Hey Ish, what's goin on?

Chill, chill it's cool

Give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you

Whatever man, whatever

Do you understand each of these rights I've explained to you?

Oh, like I ever had rights, kid?

Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent?

Hell yeah

So now lets let into, in my pocket pack
Pummel and I epic, black ethic lack
I walk again, you were shade gray, come display
Mazes in black, fire in the west
Shit is shakin', it's fly
I'm in lookies when I'm pushing vinyl time
Up the Fort, where I'm caught
And my thought to shakin' up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot, KRS One
Cause we fade in and out, are you swinging or coming?
I'm solid on this thought, this ain't living
It's heavy every setback, even when I was a shorty
Now we catch you in your four, thrice
Check me in another place, space, and joy
Nothing you could serve could ever
Ace me boy
Fat laces, I'm out, fat and no babies
""That's right baby""

That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

I got Harlem on my mind, Devil on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and Butter's on the track
I got insect thoughts, catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz, the jive, the poetry
The style, the lingo, the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock, I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot, they can't won't don't stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit, with my bugged out clique
It's Doodlebug, give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice, it's kind of rough
Sevens never bluff, I had enough, eleven

That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevin's braids, we got four in the 'Lac
As we swoop at warp seven, holler don't crowd cats
Cause look, corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber I'm saying oh
Man, we keep it popping on hot days
Shit, I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out, fool
Easing semi-swerve to the curb like the do
I'm fro, blow, got that right
Groove with soul and I'm still spinnin'
Cross 110 and indicate them something else
Blackest space, deepest sea
(Scoff) My shit's, a natural high, the man can't put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out, it's astro black
Time reaching into end, nappy afro blue
We Sw-ing, fightin' out the corners
Do my tha-a-ang like Huey with it, nigga

It’s Good to be Here,Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993.0,"The ticky ticky buzz the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mr. I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Tell my pops I'm out earthbound with the crew
He said, ""Butterfly may the boogie be with you""
Left my mom's a note with these quotes on a trunk
It says ""I split to Earth to resurrect the funk""
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of beats
Travellin' through space with the funky funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruisin' warp 6 with Mr. Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin' peas, star child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York - shazam
We droppin' like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These martians tried to do it, but knew they couldn't cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in sector 6 yes y'all

And it's good to be here
When we landed up on lex
Stirrin' up the ground with the sound of Doug E. Fresh
And the hard rockin' kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep

And it's good to be here
Gettin' fly with the raps
We love it where we from but we kick it where we at
Bumpin' out with somethin' that pops and transcends
Dps baby it's slim but not thin
In amongst the pebbles we rocks on your blocks
Soakin' in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin' on some skin when we slam check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
It's so good to be here

We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet
And there ain't no doubt that you got to check
Doodle, Silk, Butter, Mecc
It's so good to be here

Yeah baby that's the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier, toy soldier could of told you
At the boomin' funk hut it was the Afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
So see 'em kick the lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate today's to boogie down
This is all we know, we feel it when we slams
You could hear the love, it comes out in our jams
The hip-hop diggin' cats just deliverin' the words
From the ghetto-dwellin youth to the bourgies in the burbs
And it's good to be here",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-its-good-to-be-here-lyrics

Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff

I pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, Pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, like what you want you want
Pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk
The noise that we made is blue, in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldn't walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist, with a fist
Proletariat, Cad-i-lac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now, I'm making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make 'em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause y'all we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
K.B. said ""What you give 'em?"" I was like ""Mad rhythm.""
That's my junk

Eric Dolphy always hits me with the live stuff
Bahamadia back the sounds with the love love
T.J. and Lisa real peoples 89 and still
In Fort Green on diamond back is where I'm at
Feelin' da funk da funk that's in the trunk the trunk
I feel the funk da funk, feelin' the funk da funk
I'm feelin' funk da funk I'm in the trunk da trunk
Feelin' da funk da funk, I am the funk
I raise everyday for the mass
Tote my fist right up right against the fascist
Descend to my borough fix my diction
It's way on time
Fossil watch fifth line still shining
I'm left this year I'm not a player
In my vein lives bell hooks Derrick Bell, Reggie Butler
See Marvin knew it, and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals handlin' M.C.s with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jayin
I'm saying a Digable swinger
Word to mouth brought the clout 'specially in the summer
We vanish like vapor
Burn paper
We deal real-real so chill
We linger in the funk

Yes Yes, bus stop what's (Watts) up
On the script side
Low down the whole mix and flips I 63
Jay B and M.C. baby blue great
Do it fluent keep it real and straight

We make it bump de bump, we make it bump se bump
We make it pump se pump, we make it bump

Save your corny missions for the tracks you lying on
We got ammunition for the streets we dying on

Stones, rocks, subways, blocks, chill mode

Loot fold
Rebel wit no pause down to die for cause be-cause
Denia gotta see a fatter day

It's Saturday I'm looking at the streets as my Nikes
Cover asphalt
Day gives way to night

My weight crush trash broken glass
Play the wall with one foot up
""Yo What up Ish?"", ""What's up.""

The flyer we get the higher we get
Good try-ers

Is good die-ers that it so I move
We showed and we prove

It's groove food

What's going on
You want to see knowledge born, see C Knowledge Born
Before we fall victim we lick 'em
I ain't playin'

Meet me at the corner of Myrtle and Adelphi
I bless you with some joints, the mental hollow points
We do it in the park, we do it in the park

That's right, that's right
We do it in the park, we do it in the park

I'm fluent after dark, in any sit-e-ation (situation)

My tools, jewels, the nation

That's how we bump",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-dog-it-lyrics

A nickel bag of funk

The big, the fat, the cool cool cats
The psychedelic soul puts the Planets on the map
The chic, the love, the far out name
The lack of the funk's the main why we came
The boogie gets done, the colors won't run
The funk hits the square, the kids gotta come
The pizza with the pop, 
the west 4th stop
The crew after crew that do the grasshop
The true cool is black
, the new school is fat
The beats by the ounce, the funk by the pack
The groove is the fix, the jitterbugs fix
The hanging off the butts with the fat sole kicks

A nickle bag of funk
A nickle bag of funk

The wide, the hip, dig it it's the trip
The loops, the scene and the funkifying it
The sounds, the pounds, the stacks, the flair
The baggy baggy jeans, the knotty knotty hair
The twinkle in the eye, the kids that livin' fly
The crew from the sky
, the stuff that gets you high
The action, the work from the rhyme
We goes the whole nine
The papers won't rot, the vapors get got
The streets give the buzz the funk up your block
The opium groove, the smacked out soul
The kickin' it live the fat gotta roll

Jimmi Diggin’ Cats,Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993.0,"Yo, everybody's goin retro, right
And I was thinking
If the 60's and 70's were now
Isaac Hayes would have his own 900 number

I know, and 
MC Hammer woulda been a pimp
, right

Word, and 
Jimmi woulda dug us right

Word

Get yours, float up to the stars
Planets hits a spot bout six blocks east of Mars
Air soul kicks and crushed velvet hats
Hanging off the ave with the beautifulest naps
Ride in the crest with the blessed, give a yes
Planets kinda funky, as if you hadn't guessed
Placebos getting blocked, funky joints get rocked
Jive is not found
We fly from the flesh
Whether Jeep or Lac
Peak you as you been there and float to them raps
Butterfly's planets for the jam 8 Tracks
From the 90-tops with the twists and plaits
Look beneath my hat
Find the braids that hit ya, metro quite equipped
Knows of all the funk that was laid in seven zips
Funk is phat, homey homey don't you know me
Cool is back, give some skin, lay it on me
Groovy you could call it
Hip, yeah you could call we
Fikky sticky fingers stuck us, loot junkies
If you digging rhyme, then you digging rap
Jimmi's digging this and we be digging that
Yeah

The song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig
The cats, you can dig the song

Yo 
the black panthers
 
woulda had their own cartoon right

I know and 8-track Walkmans, right

True, The Jackson Five would've had
 
dreads

Word 
my man Tito
 would look fly right

Word and Jimmi would've dug Dig Planets for real, word

Planets busting out of this L-7 square
Check out the wares, check out the hairs
Sweetback chills with Shaft
, on the ave
Jimmi's digging cats and that's just the half
Where'd they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
Slick just like a lizard
Really weird, or is it
It's just the logic, from how we rocks it
Pop shock picks it up and drops its
We, the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses by a DJ and some felts
Long haired hippies, Afro blacks
All get together across the tracks
Because when we shows up, rhythm rolls up
Funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
Life ain't what it seems, life is but a dream
Planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
Yeah

The song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig
The cats, you can dig the song
Yeah, I can really dig how these cats get down with the
Sound as it is today
The way they're bringing it all
Together, they're cool
Brothas are doin it right. And
They're paying good respect to the masters
I can dig it
Exactly the way it should be",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-jimmi-diggin-cats-lyrics

Seven times for pleasure

We don't trip, nah we don't trip
We don't trip, please don't trip
We don't trip, pleasure

Now, sixteen times for the mind thieves
For my thinking Intel, I am Erica
Counterfeits don't stop the wettest of us
We Brooklyn we define the black people equal to who, yeah
What you supply

That was in beetle's but a snake try to spill a score
On my pride I'm in my cammy
We bust at COINTELPRO we creamy like
Fuck that we Creamy Spies tell you scheme-y lies
We let our creamy bullets fly
Should it reflect the sun
We say yes when we think of gettin' dipped
We says guess say yo comrades rest

Because we all bounce
We all bounce, I do bounce
Yes I do bounce. he do bounce
Yes she do bounce He do bounce
Yes we all bounce
I all bounce Come on you know your bounce

From back since the crook caught a rep
For giving birth to horn loopers
I took my first step with Panthers - born troopers
Got caps on both cans for the halls I spray
Slap hands with my mans by the walls we play
Now, waist chains and cami-flauge complete sag
Live pools, my squad rules
From solar to lunar, cheap to death
From no boot to Puma, sewed up like mesh
My cousin's hit the 'pike
I read it in the ??went it?? circle C-low
Now all the niggas hate is COs
As we move on the D-E-low
For our fam in jail, no stars just bars
No cars unless the BMT own 'em
Crook-town bounce streets delph to south ??bar on a??
I drape soul hearts, I make soul darts
Cover mad areas in my crepe soled Clarks
MC's lyin, is dyin' rap off
But here we all y'all
With pleasure, so it's

One time for your mind
Twice times for Mumia's saint crew
Thrice times for the Brooklyn dimes
Seven times for pleasure

We stay on, we stay on
He stay on He is on
We be on cause

Here I go, the seven odd
Manchu squad
Black notes I quote, I dedicate to my young star
Via subway cars I span the metro
C-know sold stee-lo
Is livin' on the D-low
The galactic travler eternal explorer
Like the invincible Master Asia - a true warrior
Neither here nor there, the master of illusion
My sun moon sets catch reps when we cruisin'
The New York boroughs with classic boombastic
Studied all the styles and got nasty at it
Like a Thelonius Monk, I travel in peace
Left on, right on, black man from the east

We don't quit 4X

Yeah like for nothin but beats and cheese
Subzero degrees can't freeze the cool breeze
Ease, easay straight Brooklyn do
Hit you off with some pellets did Brooklyn smooth, ah
It's that certain style, uh huh
Eshu-Elegba
Squeeze off style quarters 'til herbs get stressed
Playin' slick games and avoid all rest

I shows, five seconds after that
I flows left caught your rebel grows

Planets lookin' high when we travellin' on a vibe
Cribs, dorms grasshoppers in swarms
Thinkin' life is big, is that hip is it norm
Psych-e-delic and fat
Flowers and beads and peaces and naps
Ah yes, planets got the blessed
Beats are played on Friday to get Monday off your chest
Kick live dig into the quotes
Lose yourself and groove in the beauty as it floats
Hair, clothes monochrome it ain't
Many different worlds in the sweet and funky joint
Pounds, hands speakers and jams
Even those that fam get fitted in the plans
Light, years sugar for your ears
Hip-hop is the fave we been diggin' it for years

Funk, rhythm psychedelic money
Studied my lessons got vision 20/20
Check out the glow they need it what we brought
Ladybug, don't we boom it from New York?

Yes we do, uh
Time, space what is that like
Just how we livin' when in the hip life
Kids, roll with hot buttered soul
From 125 right down to Ludlow
The juice the cup the token fare is up
The ancestors peace with the daughters of the dust
We just freaks aquafunky beats
Vented to the streets from the boxes and the jeeps

Nuclear is we different time different space
Up on planet Earth we brought the mad bass
Brung is the tongue they all can understand
I'm free so let me pass it to my G

Check me out, Butterflies funk induced highs
I gain a better reason to smack me up a five
Bald caps, pleasurable naps
Time and space is fake and that's the real haps
Youth flights, land on Friday nights
Birds be with the cats DJ's savin' lives
Soul funk jive and rhythm
Jams be ‘til and 'til, but been funkin’ since 11
Sound drips comin' off the lips
Smuggled from the planets that freak the 9 zips
Time space no one's is alike
Be you and just be you or be out

That's right so
Step into the jams
Let the sugars make you sweet
Kept it underhand cause the planets get you free

Do what ya feel, do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, yeah do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, yeah do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, do what ya feel
If it's real

Exit planet Venus for a Brooklyn stroll
Jazzy fly, nappy things, plaits to a roll
Leaves fumble falling down, wind blowing 'round
Dig the layer change, the funkifying sound
Mecca, the Ladybug, changing like seasons
Moves I be seeing, changes life's reasons
On to express the ways that I profess the
Swoon unit glow, as I go; Butter flow
I take a chance, go against the norm
But they used to make advance to my lady form
Ok, shall I smack a ghetto punk with the line?
(but, Mecca) Ok, slap a meadow punk with a fine
I flip this only to the ones who lack respect
The rest, just get your ticket pronto and jet, but please...

Do what ya feel, do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, yeah do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, do what ya feel
If it's real

Check out the funk-brown bass, my man
This be the medium used by Dig Plans
Hit the cosmics like a funkonaut
Leave the ladybugs with forget-Funk-nots
Black sunflowers, broom be your tomb
If sound from the Digs, it'll zoom up your room
Bugs block spots where Hip Hop be your norm
If Capri is the Kid, the floor's getting stormed
With the bass in ya face, space is the place
Bugs take a stand, goddamn it's a jam
C-note be no uncivilized just
Poppin' out the jive in the jazz-causing rush
Can you dig it? My mellow, it's that cool cat sound
(Doodlebug, Japrim told that the G be getting down)
Shit, it's mandatory, so you gots to demand it
And if they cannot handle, take a ticket from the Planets so...

Do what ya feel, do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, yeah do what ya feel
Do what ya feel, do what ya feel
If it's real

Man, I ooze that, in the mad degrees
With my crew and shit, honey dip, cool breeze
Can you dig it? (I'm with it) (Butter, now you know)
I know the wig gets the grade out, it's fat or else we'd be out
Copped the rap bats from these cats out on Bleeker
Rejuvenate the plates for my people and they speakers
Nietzsche, Rap, make Anita crutch
Planets wouldn't allow themselves to grow like such
Expressions, sightings, scripting, taught
Finest status quo is being an artist in New York
Tongues be often fought, clothes be often caught
If they call it a fad, we just ignore it like it's pork
Planets got them thoughts blooming flowers in the dense
They said the grass was greener so we snuck and hopped the fence
Landed in a meadow, glimpsed and saw a shadow
Of brothers with guitars, common sense and puffy afros
Lucks was getting brazed, Paps was getting blazed
Feds was cracking domes, but these cats, they wasn't phased
In tights grips, yet their lips was talkin' fun
Rhythms and the struggle kinda funneled into one
True funk cannot disguise, because the streets have eyes
Who's gonna revive? Well us and delic vibe
Did it like a Dig Planet, goddammit
To get a good kick it, suggest ya get ya ticket and...

Examination of What,Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993,"One day while I was sipping some groove juice I realized
That in the span of time we're just babies
It's all relative, time is unreal
We're just babies, we're just babies, man

Check out, check out
Every man's a planet and the props are there to get it
Insects roll together with the spirit in our orbit
Life, it comes & goes and you do not punch a clock
I don't take shit for granted, I think of Scott La Rock
Also of Tyrel and the battles at the borders
My cousins in the joint and the homeless gripping quarters
The forests are all shrinking, this deepens to my thinking
Don't cover up the nappy, be happy whatcha kinking
Dwelling, yes, you're dwelling as the norm is itty-bitty
Figure eighty-fitty for a smidgen of the city
In the Serengeti, get ready for a box
But beware of the shanks and the pistols and the Glocks
If your peoples don't getcha, you still ain't off clean
The politicians mask is worse than Halloween
I write the funky scripts so you know I got to kick em
Now tell me who's the vics and tell me who's the victim

What is really what is really what is really what
- if the funk don't move your butt
- and if the box don't make you hot
- and if the cats don't dig the raps
- if your life ain't got no spice
- or if the guns just wreck your fun
- or if some shouts ain't in the house
- or if your crew ain't down with you

Peace, this is Mecca the Ladybug and I'm saying though
What is really what if I can't even get comfortable
Because the Supreme Court is like, all in my uterus

Peace, this is Cee-Know the Doodlebug and I wanna say
What is what if you can't walk through your hood with Bert, Ernie and Sesame Street posse
Trying to give the Snuffleupagus

My father taught me jazz, all the peoples and the anthems
Ate peanuts with the 
Dizz
 and 
vibed with Lionel Hampton
Now I'm swimming deep in the hip-hop with eclectics
Now do we gots the power or is it getting hectic
Scribble swings the paddle at the mantel where I placed it
Hip-hop grew from roots but some emcees never traced it
The old-jacks buckwild and some babies bore their fists
But the crew from outer space is here, shit
We grew up digging styles of the 
fabulous fifth Freddy
And scoping out for days crazy legs and rocksteady
Now bleach is in the laundry, the same old beats is handy
The label may okay it but radio won't play it
The censors are about so watch your mouth close your drapes
The legs that's in the boots is on the corner, with your tape
Making papes off the crust, for money and for lust
You're playing out the planets get slammed, trust
You think it, see it, run it and slam it
They peep it, hear it, lynch it and ban it
It just ain't the haps if they know they can't control it
Your grass be in the joint but they licked it and rolled it
So what
I'm saying what

What is really what is really what is really what
If the funk don't rule your cut
Or if the streets don't dig your beats
Or if my man ain't fifty grand
Or if the hoods don't think you're good
Or if your church don't really work
Or if the pigs wanna knock your wigs
Or if the jeeps don't roll with beats

Cause Butterfly is..baby, I'm just a baby, man
I'm a baby, I'm just a baby, man
And Mr. Doodle? (I'm just a baby too)
And Miss Mecca (I'm just a baby, man)
And Mister Silk, he's just a baby, too
And 801s, they just babies, man
And Miss Venus, she's just a baby, man
The ac-facts, they just a babies, man
And dps, they just a babies, too
Oh and, Dash, she's just a baby, man
Danny and Dani, they are my babies, man
Oh and Liz, she's just a baby, man
Oh and Stella, she's just a baby too
Doc Shane, he's just a baby, man
Mike Mann, he's just my main man
And Doctor Timba, he's just a baby, man
And nappy Jackie, she's just a baby, too
Benefi-cent, he's just a baby, man
Oh, and you
You're just a baby, man

We live in Brooklyn

The fly clothes, cash flow, and crazy L's to spark

It's crowded plus they jerkin my space
Shouted cause they chase when I strut out
Sift through my block I'm c-cool
She's my mood to brace
Stole my mind back black
So what you play the boards
Skimmer we got butter so surfaces out
Clever, and I fix it for you, funk time is monk time
Slackers hit the bat, blackest fit my pack
And we for whatever
We get down in this pleasure heavy
And we are measured by the tens degrees of math
In a puzzle hand locked, clocked in struggle
Can't keep the three foot three above mec
In so depth I defect

With my vanguard squad the gods in brooklyn

And we troopin throught the Fulton forkways
The eastern parkways
I'm broader than broadway, nothing more than morays
I sways, why cause I'm a Brooklyn stroller
No ones cooler, pigs on my boulder
So I switch my pitch as I stretch down Atlantic
Strictly slickly with my fork mean tactic
In fact it's really on the daily
Kids with guns and herbs look for herbs
Now I think you feel me
I freaks it, cause yo like my pimp stroll is cool
When I creeps up the sweet and jeeps blast
Tools rule the area, yo these fool don't play
I got the comrades of love, so the g stays
Brooklyn side with the crooklyn slide

We live in Brooklyn

Out on Fulton ave. where the honeys be at

We live in Brooklyn

Type slick, keep it movin when it's after dark

We live in Brooklyn

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

No lies, do or die in the land of show and prove

The place where I dwell is where the warriors dwell
Too many stories to tell
So on the block we don't talk
Stack of loot takin propers
Might get a serious offer from a corrupt ass copper
So um, stop the nonsense
Brooklyn is the illest, the realest
Observe these words as I reveal this
Man my peoples out here they get down for this
Each one's a one man gang with a crown for this
Mad burners to handle any business
And mad sneaky ways so ain't leavin any witness
Got way more drama the theatrical lessons
So my suggestion, you come correct no question
Cause if you comin with that funny hot dog style
You might get looted, executed black mob style
From east New York back to Fort Green
Brooklyns' classic mystical magic scene

We are plush like a million bucks
Down every ave for like a zillion blocks
Blowin out
With my nappy hoods down Fulton
Bless and guess style limpin past the Walt Whitman
Steelo's changed on the corners we hang
The crime stoppers get mad with poppers and tens
And my scrambles ample kid, no part timin, just rhymin
In other words, I play these curbs, with j u ice
When they say you nice, I say son a little somethin
Brooklyn's asphalt rolls like a syl keith rodeo
We bump the big sound, down and gritty
Record and mic checkin, no question, this section of
New York City
Where the crooks lounge out, Black Power is found
Butterfly ground the sky favorite package of pound
It's like th-that, the beats know we be strappin em out
Mad moneys wish they g like us, clout
When I'm in the boogie I'm imported, I study chairman Mao
Ain't nothin but Crooklyn in my plasma now
I got my g's behind the tongue of my gold high classics
I'm all city when I'm dipped, if you want us you can find us (aw shit)

We live in brooklyn

Coney island's buck whiling and we b-boy stylin

We live in Brooklyn

Yeah, on the spot we hustle cause like th-that

Mad game, takin wins, the shit is real son

We live in Brooklyn

With my girls and marissa now you're up in Cambridge

Fly shit
And every spot we hit is gettin blown
That's just how we do it baby
Out here in Brooklyn baby
Slick move
Cause can't nothin stop up but us
So we gettin ours baby
Nothin but Brooklyn baby

Ft. Green, The Sty, Queensburg, Coney I

It's like that, it's fat where we be at, Brooklyn

Red Hook, Crown Heights, it's tight

It's like that, it's fat where we be at, Brooklyn

Bushes, wigs, flat, it's east New York, Brownsville

It's like that, it's fat where we be at, Brooklyn

In the year of '89 I stole back my black mind
Found peace up in the east I shine
One time blind I refined, then over time
I realized the creamy spy gots to climb
Find the spot in this land of uncle sam
Focus my thoughts and be that true black man that I am
I stand in the face of oppression
With my sisters and my brothers no slippin' no half steppin'(Together!)
The five percent nation is my representation
I wear Timberlands study in Timbuktu
Won't rest until they free our brother Mumia-Abu
Now can you feel it (huh) nothing can save ya
For this is the season of our self saviour
Like Che Guevara his young urban guerillas
Sparks the revolution black tactics, whatever

We might start bustin'

In an aerial form we closin'
Select territorial aim let's be out
On an onslaught

And it don't pop son it's p'jects bound together
The beats in concrete when I'm creamin' with my stiletto
Got 16 for the imperial fascists
Long beach brothers and honeys we's bouts to set it
Domino theory cause they stalled our flow
Collectin' pitchforks 'till they free Geronimo
While you blaze up I stay my fist raised up

I peep out the flowers when they bloom, if you dig
Sisters do their dips to our booms cause they dig
Muslims add perfumes and the zoom be a dig
I scoped out as a sprout then Mamma said to dig
The mind then the butt cause the drama ain't to dig
Lovely little honeys in their crews is what I dig
If they fake the fig it's the Blues Child dig
(Want some of my soda?)
Fine they be mega, sexy they be ultra
But don't enroll in pageants to get judged by the chauva's
Crazy fly whips, baggy jeans and sneakers
Silver hoops and Jeeps, hip-hop in the speakers

Automatic, systematic
Automatic
Complex
Just ease it in

The feeling's right
The music's tight
Departing out of Crooklyn, type Saturday night
The gear the god was rocking type way out of sight
Limping past the projects
Seen my man, a'ight
Steelo type fat, solar type facts
Later for milk and honey, get the money out this piece
Relax
I handle streets, all type slick
Just like a seven no ???

She got moist
Cause I gots the platinum voice
Like syrup, for delf roaming, the New York boroughs
As they temp our perms, plus I ride the iron worms
Uptown across down, from the boogie with no faking
Ghetto to my marrow, then
Ease on back to Crooklyn
Hold it, as loot in my timbs and army suits
Parlayin where Malcolm stood, now brothers push they blow out
A slicker nigga pig, dig me picking my fucking 'fro out
Limping up the one tree fives
The p-jects
The eject these herbs
That's word to green herb
Now the curbs
I play that like, primo supreme hustler
Nappy hair, oil slick, loyal to kick and dirty snare
Little panther
Answers to the nom de plum butter
Nice, preciser rubber, slicer and cutter
In a freshly dip state, I contemplate
Whose avenue be making the most bacon?
My honey gets the loot out, what's shaking
We getting live, dreaming being in the central ave. bus stop
Then I call bust out, wassup?
Seems that the dream team's me, Mecca the god, and Sulaiman

If your beats is phatty

And it's on
Then I'm gone
Hey, hey, hey

Easin in as slick as I can

You know my motions, slimmer with no limo
I ride the c local, and tilt my army brimmer
Milt bless the vibes, pro symbolize
Built with the fives, my clique then amplified
Sounds as we ease, beneath the New York moon
Pounds as we dip, increase these New York tunes
It's the universe I have
Nappy and happy, June 12th, I self don't say that exists
Imported on the ships, with irons around the fist
Gradual to afros, black cats, and fist picks
Still creating boogies, and the styles they want
Now they try to move us, for the styles we flaunt
But I, seen it sunny, plus seen rain
Plus seen my moneys getting smoked for change
I face left in the round up
Pound up the god
When the devil
Blow to the essence
Sinks deep down into the blue train cover
The real got surreal cause we feel you ain't a gangster
When I was a youngster ate jazz and black
Freedom had a pistol it was just like that
Old Earth gave me kisses to her Culture Power records
Pumas, Lee flavors, Busy Bee mic checkin's
The crown says I'm down, from the ground up

But what if emcee comes

Come on, emcee go

Easin in as slick as I can

The feelings right
The music's tight
Departing out of Crooklyn, type Saturday night
The gear the god was rocking type way out of sight
Limping past the projects
See my man, a'ight

When the mic check counts
My amounts is cash
I don't shoot out
I get that loot out cause I'm fresh
Hit you with the gold front grin, with diamond look
Muhammad made em, Nikki paid him
I was shook
I tell an emcee in a eye blink
That you wack as crack
Cee-know got my back
And we both can laugh

And for example, we swift this
Lifted up on luck
And for complexing, like brass and brown skin
We of this, built this with south boogie down

Bronx

Outs the clowns, in the suits
With the cash

I tell' em
Pass the ruck, or get stuck by my comrade's badge
Just like my mom and dad had it
And did it

Last of the Spiddyocks,Reachin’ (A New Refutation of Time and Space),1993.0,"I'm blue mood y'all, I slive with jive y'all
I'm actually deep y'all, invented time y'all
In ten fourths y'all, I pay your cap y'all
I player late y'all and draw down too
I bust raps y'all, in love with naps y'all
The sweet beats kid, I speak my thoughts y'all
I wreck the break y'all, don't trust the flag y'all
I dig the birds y'all, I'm layin' out now, yeah

The season's been good like a sweet
I hang out with a gang out Flatbush with cool beats
I found the reverberated shout was goddamn
And questions 'bout the methods how the Planets made jam
Wallowed through a gang a murk in the interim
I couple times we got jerked but still invented them
Wicked little kinky joints that got us ghetto weight
And also kept the jazz alive by pullin' off the plates
Maybe only we was hip to stretchin' out the brain
I felt like Bird Parker when I shot it in my vein
I toss these major losses on the Mingus jazzy strum
Flip off into a nod and dig myself a dyin' young
It's like, cool was the bop and the flair
I kicks to my pools by the nap of the hair
I'm pinnin' Uncle Sam for the death of swingin' quotes
For losin' Bud Powell slidin' over Dizzy's notes
Was it that the rebirth was the birth for new shit, of cool shit
The jazz power showers from the crew was sure legit
But, hey, present since gone Hank Mo's gone
They kill the coolest breeze in this land of the free
And it been like that since they lied about they flag
Like all my main mans gave they beats up for skags
So I pops it at your crew like Bu, I did a lid
But I used Lee's Cooker got my buzz around midnight

I'm sunshine y'all, I'm hip to badge y'all
From sector six, yeah and now and then too
I slows the trims y'all and fades a fake now
I know the nat y'all I'm layin' out y'all, yeah

The season's been smooth like the suede
Pumas that butter got when butter got paid
Or better yet Dolphy's archetypes for cool dudes
Or better still 'Trane usin' space in Afro Blue
It's simple, swing be the freakin' of the time
The spinnin' by the kings good for speakin' of the mind
The forty seven sessions gave the buzzes that I caught
They asked was it cool blues knowledge (What you thought?)
I told 'em it was solid, dig, the licks was way out
My baby loves to kiss when Ornette just lays out
So the quotes be as such bout the kits, uh
(You down with Digable Planets, you's a hipster, shit)
I lay it on the cats about Monk
The logical extensions comin' boomin' out that trunk
Assumin' that the room in which you zooms designed by your mind
Not the stars and stripes but red Cali booms
And the rat-a-tat-tat by Max or Philly Joe on we go

The fly shit y'all, we don't quit y'all
It's slick beats here and it's out there
A smooth groove kid, the jive is high y'all
We ain't marks y'all okay pow me up

Uh, the seasons been fat like some boom
Doodlebug's math jazz fillin' up the room
When Booker jam with Eric at the funky five spot
Jimmy Cob's job was layin' crashes on the top
Butter cop his lid at this little Harlem jam
The tenor bop the middle and his shades and his tam
I'm diggin' how these dudes made my buzz a little hipper
And angles on the moves really couldn't get no blacker
I'm sinkin' deep to the sleekness of the horn
I'm thinkin' take the hipness and just lay it in my form
So when the hoodlums flood waitin' for another anthem
I say it's in the blood cause it ain't nothin' but rhythm
And rhythm goes on and on to the break of moon, baby
The dads is gone but they used to come lovely
The sickness towards the world's cause Sam caused the blues
But hipness takes a swirl and jams by my crew

Infect space y'all, we swing time y'all
It's like milk yeah, it's like be bop
The new scat slips, oh shit, we got fly kicks
It's like jazz, uh, it's like us now",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-last-of-the-spiddyocks-lyrics

Bobbin' over beats that sleeps with ghetto slang
No sirens just felts and wax from ghetto brains

Try to gank my style and I'll hip you to the heater
At the speed of bop grew the hard rock
You can ask my dads 
Chairman Mao comrades
Squattin' at they pads
Diggin' on the jazz that's the half of it
Uncle Sam showed us all his space we refuted it
Told him that ghetto is the aim, let go of my brain
Then we changed your boogie cause your boogie had to change

Caught a fat chat with a cat where I'm from
Flipping mad tracks on a love child Nickel Bag
Ah Mecca much jive and a jazz touch
With a straight no chase
, a Dig Plan erase
Snatch an acid insect changed her dialect

Said we couldn't drip it
Came in and we kicked it with a glass of water on the rocks
Nip it

Jazz, in the last 5 years has progressed in its fits
And starts of sudden discoveries and
Startled reactions. New principles, new sounds
New rhythms and harmonies have been advanced with unusual frequency
Not surprisingly, many of the younger musicians have been quietly digesting
This information almost as quiuckly as it has appeared
As a result, they've acquired a degree of
Musical sophistication which supersedes many of the previous standards of excellence
So it's no longer especially relevant to ask the young saxophone player
For example, to demonstrate his ability by running through all the Charlie Parker licks

Come little hoods peep out the eyelids
Stash a fat gat cause the loops let you dig
With a Bloom Swoon and a Full Moon
Mecca Bug no fake takes we let alone baits
Pitchin' up your cakes might cause a horn rush but then a bass flush
Meta more emphasis as I trip this Butter bug pour it out the mouth

O.K. floater to the order don't we wreck before we split
From the chaos came the fattest little shit
By the soak of it at the point of hammer click
You could either read a little Marx
 or hang with Spiddyocks
When the bass faces fix the deepest cuts they're the sickest
Then we just make you think you boomed with a quickness

Pretenders bent out and ready to do my splendor
Move, move the smooth groover, dudes from the zoo
That play the mic like, wow
Walk with a cane, talk with the slang
Developed on Crooklyn blocks which I walk but
Our radius is the whole universe
Kiss yourself goodbye cause Amu know you no plush
Cheese dime, let me try her, gold smile
Fro in the pile, beep beeped my sun visor
She filled with sun visor, and Staten the third

Blowing out, blowing out

Black on time been still laying like I said
Under the screen, be a eighth wonder
So for Dania, I do it, shit, push a little fist
Fit my one twenties, greet the avenue blue
Corner flying it into a forty, twenty
Brothers lay in a bottle, thirty fly right by, double time and shit
Next, I’m hitting, so I can step sooner
On the nova, so no water goes south
So see my G, yeah, she coming and we not a flesh vendor
Mecca got soul living so, living so
Shot open on my left just in time
No we finger pops it to a liter, when it’s cool

In a sense we smoother than oil's contents
Loyal to the kick drum like... flavor
Bounce, bounce, ease back, when we do it, fluid
Yes, nigga type fresh
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out
We always blow out (Without a doubt, without a doubt)
For the funky side of town, no doubt (Yes, yes, y’all, yes, yes, y’all)
We always blow out (Uh, check it out)
For the funky side of town, no doubt (Word)
We gets live-r than any eighty fiver
And the funk pots thicker out here in Brooklyn
Every crew's badder, we choose to rock fatter
Cause I stimulate...

Life and matter
When I spread my wings, I do's my things
Cause Doodle Bug wants to live like a Zulu king
So I swing with my crew to where the beats be fat
Swoon units by the pound and they natural black
Without a doubt, this is the place to be
I see baseball caps, hear beats by Warren G
I sinks into the mode of the cool out breeze
You know, the cool breeze rocks the beats wit ease
So nigga please, full of the dread poetic
The sun-moon sect in the house made to set it
With the peace signs, fat rhymes, the planet fix
Add Butter to the Mecc, then jet to eighty-six

Blowin' out, blowin' out
Blowin' out, blowin' out
Blowin' out, blowin' out
Blowin' out, blowin' out

You better blow that shit out",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-blowing-down-lyrics

Nothing but the baby cutting jazzy core

Where I’m From (LP version),Beyond The Spectrum: The Creamy Spy Chronicles,UnKnown,"Boogie jive and rap is life where i'm from
Where i'm from i might play with izzy where i'm from
Where i'm from it be like run you coat black
Jupiter keeps the fat beats by the pack where i'm from
Nappy hair is life we be reading marx where i'm from
The kids be rockin clocks where i'm from
You turn around your cap you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds boomin out a jeep
Where i'm from cocoons hide the youth swoon units 100 proof
You want some beef they will cut you some where i'm form
The beats is infinite where i'm from
Voodoo, ? gangster lean where i'm from
I'm interplaetary my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair g where i'm from
The firehoses blow it's purple wind and snow
I do a hit and go
It's hip what's hip when hip is just the norm
Cause planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all it's forms
The kinks the dance the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother tolld mama that it's africa at work
On vibes we free the universal beat
You find it at the spot you here the ends of every week
We twist exist to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbor so we paid it a visit
?
For rock we can't do nothin for this we come equipped
Off disc off tape rap blastin til from 8
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Coco gotta know how planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool get funky is our goal
It's calm relax we only some new jacks
That ask for the funk but don't play the role
Where you from
....
Projects tenements pyramids
Where i'm from we livin off the boom boom crack
It's that hiphop rockers jazz where i'm ats
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghetto's the life
Food for though so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me stop alone into the sunset left foot right foot 1-2
Mic check
Brewin funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair here's a bit have a listen

And ready to be tricky you see we sneak quick
Number one royale under the sun
Freedom gum
Planet with style meanwhile who came beyonder
Through gettin popped - a thunder creamy spy wonders
Cause sweeter than honey lives money yes
Monkey see monkey take
Exploit to live high - fly higher
Travel lush off the blackest
And fresh like Mr. Les

Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky

I can travel the cosmos
It's pure black thought
I travel the world with my chronic pimp walk
I travel through Brooklyn in constant lounge mode
But all I see in doodle big supreme beings
Simply G-in'
Bein' the best that I can bein'
In a world of negativity - I stay true
From Brooklyn to Uptown
See no place the background
Never high post - just coast to the cool sounds
Lost and found in the pounds of home grown
Kinda funny how I'm makin' money by rockin' microphones
I remember those days in [
?
]'s basement
Buggin' off the PC headed beats that he was makin'
I'm makin' styles intelligent yet prevalent
Through your airwave
I self-save the ill behave
Now I crave the spot
Where my sprouts can amplify
And stay high
As we soar the Brooklyn sky

Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky
Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky
Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky
Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky
Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky
Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky
Flyin' high in the Brooklyn sky

It's a conscience style decision
That I slash the competition
With  precision
Catch rhythm
Relentless how I give 'em
Turn to 
Pass that is 'em
Is ummm - trippin' ave
Normandy bad
Shit, ain't no devil high as me
I be so placid behind the mic

Then the beat broke  and blasted nice
Mix clean
Roll with the  team
(chill, hold up, wait a second)
And let me tell you for whom and which I got my sixteen
Those who got the mentality for pimp and we
Pixie-Os upon them I empty
 me no tell how I played it
Then blend into the corner when
I get my 'fro pick now....

Fresh Out,Sounds from the 7th Dimension,UnKnown,"One tilted hat
All black du-rag
My braids work back
My mind is on my racks
Thinking on my angles
Plotting out the sack
When I dance my chain jangles
The wind’s at my back
Raised to the beat
Glazed by the street where it’s crazy
And it’s deep, I sleep easy on my feet though
No doubt, its figures and its clout
And how you turn it out
We know what it’s about
Why this bling era vapor
Unite us under paper
Inciting fly behavior
These niggas ain’t your saviors
Man, they greedy and they shameless
Corny and they game’s bitch
Look how they rock the same shit
Rich and not creative
But we lay away off the playlist
That self-proclaiming gay shit
King’s move the crowd man, it’s all about the bangers
Sagging off the corner’s, dreaming with the burners
Black gangster families
They can kill us at the grammy’s
I’m amazed by the dazzle
Unphased by the tragic
I say love on the magic
Diamonds and oil
All these companies be their profits
The death star confetti
One long red carpet up to a supermarket
Off the self-medication.. a station
Bullshit.. but no relation
So it’s really no stopping
The system’s in the pocket
When real niggas in a cell, got
The devil stands to profit
So..
What we need now is change!
It’s time for us niggas to be about change
Dip deep, nigga
What it do now? I’m due some change
When they catch your style you know it’s time to change",https://genius.com/Digable-planets-fresh-out-lyrics

We cosmic bop (Bop)
Okay, dig me out

The season's been hot like a gat
The wicked little cut?? was like this and like that
Then on 62nd they was fittin' to peel my buss
They ask me what's my set, man I'm banging for my cuts
In Brooklyn, smooth for a spot in your trunk
Baby to the jazz givin' licks that Planet bump
When I flew to earth, I was seven right at birth
From bebop to hip, I drank my milk to Birk's works
My crew boppin' like birds sweeter licks
Plus, buckin' like a G to get our grips
And in Crooklyn gettin' space cause we coolie
Or rollin' with my dogs around Cali
Bow
Dig the coolest breeze take aim at rain storms
Fly boy Butter turns solid when drains form
When we played it was still '96 in the shade
My hair was growin' too long, so I got me some braids
Phat braids

We stacks thick ya'll (Thick ya'll)
We move smooth too (Smooth too)
And imma stab now (Go)

The season's been shit like the time
Talks by the flag 'bout my cool cat vibe, damn
Throwing out they lips on the trash
And couldn't get? a reason why my playas half passed
Diggin on traps but they couldn't love the naps
I was on the corner 65 wit mr. shaft??
Checkin' out that Africa brass was it hip?
Butterfly and I caught the lid and took a lip
Sat back and felt the cool taps of blue 'Trane
Walkin' from inside only we could touch the pain
Like the 801s with their ?? on they deck
They probably catch a wreck who ???
It's all I meant to claim with the bop and the hop
For slippin out the fades is a not 'less we pop
We strechin' out our neck with a cut from the heart
So keep it in the head 'bout this swarm and this art

The season's been cool like the snow
The chronic was bionic so on with the flow
They couldn't puncture space 'cause we spend it on the rhyme
They couldn't fade the time cause the ticks was by the mind
Well, G rides bangin' to they peak
Do they little dirt while we sweeten up the beats
Ain't no honeys phat as Mecha on the mix
Try to make a film and we'll send you to the 6 quick!
Then we caught a fam when we went to wreck our jam
Love and boobie?? know that we should of swung the hands
For the slip slide glide nappy pride watch my kits
They come from other sectors to watch us do this shit
And we do this shit

(space is the place, yea)
To the break of dawn, yea 93 and on
Boogie up your place sector 6 in outer space
Lickin out the jazz while the beats is always bad
Dig the hard rock with the booms from your block
Yeah hardcore rap music what is it if it's not straight from the heart
True!
Hmm, let me tell you
The Digable Planets we're purveyors of true music
Word is born, word is born
Speak on it brother
Yo, we comin' about jazz music
That's our first love
Hip hop is an extension of that love
So what can we be, but nothing but hardcore music lovers
Givin' you what we know best
And givin' it you straight from the heart
Straight from sector 6 to the color full ghettos in outer space

Whole world
M-C's
Whose slick?
We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh ass hair
Style baggy out clouts slick
Creamy and fresh east coast to west
Brooklyn
Uptown
To the universal fair
Old school M-C's
I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave A train got the pic in my hair
And what 16 joints later still lounge
Fresh, from flat bush in my baggy booster gets
Style is tight ee's bust the cami' fatigues
50,000 leagues of black, so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the east and wild Crooklyn, New york
Creamy kid yo Smith and Wesson win a blessing
The angular slang blow spots, bang, 11
Hangin' like bats,'cause the 12 inch wax
Say scorpio and my hair say 'fro
And my blood say bro, my clics say, ""Eh, yo!""
Make sparks from the barrel me tal pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wild flowers
Scott La Rock had 'em all, I gots the ball
And roll a little panthers through these project halls
The 3 color flag can't hold my baggys sag
7 1 8 to omega
Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of the classic
Now glamour boys want to be triple phatted
But I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year, yea
East born Beast candles on
Lovely all over the city
And your tape deck blasting
7 hours and the phat fly sneakers and the camouflage
To the hip hop nation
To the mix tape crew
To the west coast
To the boogie down Bronx
I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And 5 elements posture take a be boy stance
With the gold front shinin', the baggy pants saggin'
This Brooklyn stylin' got the fly girls smilin'
But I'm climbin', findin' new ways of rhymin'
Not livin' like a star is strickly about survivin'
Divin', deep into the groove of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes, the notorious, with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes of conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect emotion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now I'm rolling with the 7 and the crescent
Puffin' some expression, manifestin' today's lesson
Stressin' the fact that I'm solar guaranteed to go far
'Cause the mind is inter stellar
Still pieced like that so have no fear
But I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
To the queens everywhere
To the whole S I
To the lumpen mass
Don't forget about your peeps when ya
Now you see that I am 68 inches above sea level
93 million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn, any order
You want 'em I got 'em drippin' like water
Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing, moving within the truth circles
We played you made you change,strictly ought to
We stratify our wealth from my looty in the bank
There's love amongst the ranks
Now I'm a 'bout to meet my home girl 'cause we be alike
A alike, see alike, let's G alike
