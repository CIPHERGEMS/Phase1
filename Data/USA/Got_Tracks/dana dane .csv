Cinderfella Dana Dane,Dana Dane With Fame,1987.0,"Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the store
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!""
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, ""Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits""
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't"" is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Well I shrugged, I hissed, ""They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish""
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dane? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my Kangol and clout
My fresh Volvo also went too
And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet, the far wall
Hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
Went into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin' ""Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept askin' me as I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock on the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess"", this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' on shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
Sayin' ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, there came a flash of light
And I was tough in the gear from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the Volvo
Said to my family, ""I've got to go""
We drove up the avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me I heard my family cry...

Nightmares,Dana Dane With Fame,1986.0,"Hello, I'd like to see Dr. Slumber, please
Ah - do you have an appointment, sir?
No, I don't
But tell the Doctor it's urgent that I see her
Well - just one moment
Dr. Slumber?
Dr. Slumber, there's a young man out here named -
Excuse me, what is your name?
Oh, tell her it's Dana Dane
Hhhh... D-D-Dana D-D-DANE?!
OH NO!
OH, YOU CAN COME RIGHT IN!
COME RIGHT IN, RIGHT NOW!
COME ON IN...!
Thank you, thank you
Well, I walked into the office, what did I see?
A well-shaped body with the back to me
Sittin in her chair with an all-white gown
Said said (Dana Dane, won't you please lay down?)
She said that she wouldn't reveal her face
Till my hour was up and I was on my way
Now we got to the matter of why I came there
I said, ""Doc, I keep havin these crazy nightmares""
Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
'Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
She said, ""Relax yourself, won't you tell me one
So I can diagnose and see what must be done""
I laid back my head, start to inhale
Caught my breath, and then I said, ""Well -
Bright one morning I was late for class
Had a fresh pair of frames with Gucci on the glass
Girls they was hawking, dudes they was talkin'
Saw the doggy-dogg female, I kept on walkin'
She was on it hard, there was no denyin'
Shoulda seen what this female was tryin'
Grabbin on my shirt, tuggin' on my slacks
Pullin' on my zipper board, I had to hold her back
Word up, Doc, on the ultimate
Now if I never saw a creature, this girl was it
I kept on walkin', had to leave this place
But she was all up on me, breathin' in my face
You may think I'm lyin though it's just a dream
This girl had the baddest breath I'd ever seen
I couldn't think straight, thought I was doomed
Heard a bling-bling-bling, it was time for homeroom
I stepped real quick, she tried to play it sassy
She almost ran me down, this nasty fatnastee
Dipped to the stairs, running blind
Get to my homeroom, ran through my mind
Got to the 4th floor, standin in the door
Girlies watchin' me walk down the corridor
The guys they were jealous and gettin mad
And all the girlies wishin' they had the class I had
Got to my classroom, expect to see the teacher
Who did I see? That ugly black creature
Paused for a minute standin' in the door
Then I broke out when the girlie went raw
Word em up, Doc, couldn't stand the smell
Heard of 3D? Well, she was fat as hell
I ran out the school, I didn't look back
I tell you, Dr. Slumber, this girl was wack
And that's about the time when I awoke
And I smelled that awful breath that almost made me choke
Now tell me, Dr. Slumber, how can it be?
That this dream somehow became reality?
I can't go to sleep, cause I'm so damn scared
'Cause I keep havin these crazy nightmares""
Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
'Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)
She said, ""Listen, Dana Dane, I think I have the cure
But I have to hear one more before I'll be sure""
I laid back my head, tried to concentrate
Then I told her the nightmare 'bout the blind date
Had a blind date with this girl named Anita
The Fever's the place I'm supposed to meet her
Saw the def body with the vicious butt
How did I know she was a marvelous mutt
This lady I met was as ugly as hell
Couldn't go in the jam with this female
I was coughin hard, she started to braggin'
Couldn't let them know I was here with this dragon
Grabbed her hand, dipped to Harlem World
But I left this ugly lady for another girl
Now this other female, her name was Denise
Couldn't get no rapture, there followed the beast
Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look
There was Anita the beast, she could not be shook
I dipped, I dived, I ran, I thrived
But there was no place that I could hide
'Cause she was sniffin me out like a hungry blood hound
Her tail in the air, her nose to the ground
Only thing left for me to do
Was to set her up with this other dude
Now this other dude, he was real upset
'Cause this ugly female he didn't wanna check
He started actin wild, even called me a faggot
What could I do, he had a .22 automatic
I dipped into the crowd, made my way to the door
Bumped into this object and I hit the floor
When I looked up, what did I see?
I saw Anita the Beast lookin down at me
I couldn't try to play it, couldn't try to pretend
Like the ASPCA I had to take the dog in
Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)
Now I pleaded, ""Dr. Slumber, I just can't bare
To have another one of these crazy nightmares""
Then all of a sudden she turned around
And starin at me with that all-white gown
With a Catholic smile, showin all her teeth
Was that ugly female, Anita the Beast...

Dana?
Dana, honey, wake up!
What's wrong?
Wake up, honey
You are just... HAVING A NIGHTMARE!

Chester,Rollin’ Wit Dana Dane,1995,"Alan Morton for Lifestyle News
Out top story for tonight is child abuse
And the effects it has on the family structure
Film at 11

Damn, every time I turn on the news
Somewhere, somehow another child is being abused
I’m confused
What kind of people do we live among?
They must be sick doing the things that’s being done
(See what I’m saying y’all)
Young children being raped and battered
Or they’re falling victim to the ratta-tat-tatter
Who protects them? Who respects them?
When their own family neglect them
It’s time we check them
(yo, check these mothers)
And let them know that we can’t have this
Type of madness
Scaring our kids for life and putting others in their casket
It’s time we made a change today
So there won’t be no more mothers to hear their child say

Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me
Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me

Now, A mother cries, slumped over a dead body
A teenage girl in the corner screams
“I’m sorry mommy”
Her mother wants to know one thing, Why?
Here’s the words of a girl too scared to lie
She said, “It happened to me first when I was nine
He burst in my room and told me I was fine
He sat me on his knee and said that he loved me
And in his dirty strange ways, he touched me
That night you worked late at Macy’s
Mom I prayed that you would come home and save me
Cause he did these things, these nasty things to me, Ma
These things, these nasty things
And I thought I would die from the pain
It was crazy”, the young girl explained
“When he was through with me he looked down and said
You tell anyone, your mom and you, you’re dead”
She feared for their lives so she stayed quiet
Five years of being raped and being silent
1,825 days she suffered
From a man who says I do this because I love ya
Now she’s 14 and can’t take no more
And she knew he kept a gun in his dresser drawer
So she got it, she saw him, she cocked it
She said I hate you Uncle Chester, that’s why I got to stop it

Who protects our children
From the grownups touchy feeling?
Now what kind of world do we live in
When you abuse our children?
Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me
Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me

Now, who protects our children
From the grownups and their touchy feeling?
Do we let our kids kill or someone kill them?
Parents don’t be blind to a developing young mind
Guiding starts at home and I’m going teach mine
Hey young world, I know it’s crazy out there
I know they’re bigger and stronger and they get you really scared
But you have to find someone that you can trust
So they can help you put an end to this madness
You are not alone no matter what people have told ya
Many have been abused from the unknown to Oprah
Now what I’m saying is let’s make a change today
So you won’t be the next to hear your child say
 
God bless our children",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-chester-lyrics
Love At First Sight,Dana Dane With Fame,1987.0,"Love at first sight
Is it forever or fly by night?
Love at first sight
Who's to say it's wrong or right?


Hello?  Yes, this is Dana.  Who's speaking?
Oh, Jackie!  How you doing?
It's been a long time hasn't it?
Nah, there'll be none of that babe
My plan leaves in about an hour
I don't think so
My tour starts when I get back
But, um... thanks for calling anyway
It's been nice knowing you, well it was nice knowing you
You take care of yourself
Oh, and don't give out my number
Thanks

Now I can still remember when we first met
It was one day that I would never forget
Six o'clock the approximate hour
Not really cloudy, expecting sun showers
I was taking a stroll halfway cross town
Then like expected the rain came down
I picked up my pace
For home base I raced
Ran into a soft object in my haste
On the ground we faced
Her in silk and lace
And with my eyes, her body I slowly cased
The pouring rain had drenched her dress
But I loved the way the cloth had clinged and caressed
""Excuse me"", that was my first words spoke
Stood her up on her feet and gave her my trench coat
Somehow it happened while I covered her back
When her eyes and mine first made contact
The looks we gave changed the way we were
Now it was us and not me and her
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight


Now even the rain pour was easy to ignore
Only this young lady is what I saw
She was a sweet female, tender not frail
Other words beautiful, no need for details
I introduced myself, ""Hi, my name is Dane
Can I get you out of this pouring rain?""
""Sure,"" she said.  ""By the way, I'm Jackie.""
Staring at me as I hailed down the taxi
We jumped in. The cab slowly moved off
She was holding my hand and it felt so soft
Now on my ear she gently chewed
And I knew it was more than just gratitude
I took it upon myself to take her to my house
I guess she didn't mind because her clothes were doused
Paid the cab his fee
Took out my house keys
Opened up the door, said ""Enter please""
Took her to the bathroom, said ""Hang your clothes on the line""
And gave her one of my shirts from Calvin Klein
Went to my room took off my wet wardrobe
I freshened up a bit and put on my silk robe
We met in the front near the roaring flames
Where we sat quietly sipping on champagne
Her eyes said ""Thanks"" beyond the use of words
And the crackling flame was all I heard
It felt as though we were on our honeymoon
As we moved from the front into the bedroom
We made passion love the night we met
And by the time we fell asleep there were no regrets
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight


I woke up the next morning.  She was not there
Maybe she's fixing breakfast or doing her hair
I got out of my bed, threw on me house coat
When I noticed on the mirror she'd left a note
Saying, ""Sorry Dane, I could not stay
Please meet me 1 o'clock where we met yesterday.""
Well, I had time.  Two hours and a half
So I laid out my clothes and took a bath
I ate a good breakfast, had time to spare
So then I got dressed and I dally over there
I reached my destination not a cloud in sight
It was cool, kinda windy, but the sun was bright
Now I was on time, but she didn't show
And that was about twenty minutes ago
I stayed a little longer, about a half an hour
Felt a raindrop, maybe it's a sun shower
I was soon to see that my thoughts were wrong
Because the raindrop became an all-out storm
And there I was standing in the rain
And the lady that I looked for never came
Well, I was hurt and it showed in my face
As I tracked in the rain backed to my place
Slowly I walked hoping to bump into her
Me be in love? Nah, I barely knew her
I got home angry and depressed
And my Bally shoes were a total mess
But that was the last thing on my mind
As I sat on the couch staring into time
Well, I had her number and she had mine
But if she really wanted me she would have dropped me a line
But day after day and weeks went by
But she didn't call even to say, ""Hi""
I would have called her first, but I've got my pride
""And I really don't care"", to myself I lied
Now, there was no reason for me to be sad
Just remember that good time that we had
'Cause I learned a little something that you should know
To keep some things you got to let them go
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight


... Well it was nice knowing you
You take care of yourself
Oh, and don't give out my number
Thanks",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-love-at-first-sight-lyrics
Delancey Street,Dana Dane With Fame,1987,"Next stop: Delancey Street
Step lively, and ah - watch the closing doors

I can't express it any plainer
That I'm a entertainer
People call me Dane, but my real name is Dana
I came here just to put you on
Cause I'm taking the rapping world by storm
In the rap I've made a change
A change that no other out there can claim
Now what I've done will make you laugh
So don't you ever be offended by the words I pass
I'll make you tickle, make your butt wiggle
You'll tell your friends, and they'll chuckle and giggle
Now this little story's called Delancey Street
It's the place where clothes are bought and people meet
Each city has a place that's quite the same
Even though it might go by a different name
Delancey Street
Delancey Stree-eet
Delancey Street
This story can't be beat

Well, I (um) went to Delancey Street to buy some wears
Even though I already had on fresh gear
Go into the store to buy a Kangol
I took out my wallet and my fat money roll
When three females walked up to me
There was a white, a black, the other Chinese
The white girl said, ""My name is Dawn
And I love your gear by Louis Vuitton""
The black girl said, ""My name is Jane""
And she couldn't keep her hands off the fresh gold chains
The Chinese girl, her name Suchi
She was foggin up the '86 Guccis
I thought they wanted to conversate
Then they all pulled out a six-shooter trey-eight
Three fresh females, who would have thought
Cause they tried to rob me, I almost got caught
I stood there for a minute, tried to concentrate
I tried to think of a way for me to escape
No one in sight, one thing to do
(You mean you ran, Dana Dane?) Damn right I flew
Up the block and through an alley
Yo, I cold dogged my fresh new Bally's
I ran through some water and some dog -
But I don't give a damn, I wouldn't be their vic'
Oh no, not me, not while I had feet
So then I dipped over to Orchard Street
Around the corner, past the brick house
And right in back of me, droolin from the mouth
Yes, them three females in hot pursuit
Then all of a sudden they began to shoot
I flundered, blundred, all the shots thundered
(Where did you run?) That's what I wondered
So confused, my head still in the wind
A sign up the street that read (dead end)

Now here they came, just as plain as day
Runnin down the street like _Three The Hard Way_
I approached the stop, the temper grew
And then the girl screams out: (Yo, damn it, don't move!)
They continued strong like the quiet storm
""Lover boy, run everything that you've got on""
""Run your Gucci, your Louis and your fresh gold chains
And your Bally shoes, we want it all from you""
Now max this move, what could I do?
Nowhere to run, no one to run to
The girls just didn't know who I am
But I knew a way to get out this jam
I stood in their face, took on the loud racket
Opened up my ??? jacket
Printed on my shirt, yes, there's bold and plain
'I'm not the one, the Rapper Dana Dane'
Well, the girls caught the message, it was plain to see
They might as well have said (Dana Dane, you're free)
Cause Jane came by, she winked her eye
And Dawn came over, grabbed me at my fly
And that's about the time when Suchi came near
She kissed me on my cheek and blew in my ear
Each one of them tryin to grab my hand
Screamin ""Leave him!,"" to the other (Dana Dane's my man)
I knew it: they'd blew it
Punches were thrown, they got into it
They rumbled, battled, wrestled like cattle
""She made me do it!"", they began to tattle
Swollen eyes and busted lips
Cause I think all of them got pistol-whipped
But I don't care, do you hear what I say?
I just wiped off my Bally's, went on my way
And they're still not friends 'til this very day",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-delancey-street-lyrics

It's how you approach it, yo how you convey it
It's now how you rub it

Dana Dane Is Coming To Town,Christmas Rap,UnKnown,"That's right party people, Dana Dane is back!
Hurby behind the board of the twenty-fo' track machine
Making sure the beats come out clean
As I tell you this tale of a Christmas scene
It all began in a far off land
Do you know the Drummer Boy? Well, I'm the Rapper Man
I wandered and wandered with no main course
Drawn to a campsite by some strange force
Now, in this camp lived three wise men
They said, ""Dana Dane, where have you been?""
They said that they had been expecting me
Told me to kick off my sandals and relax my feet
We started to talk, a lot of time was spent
Tale of how emcees wouldn't be content
'Til the Christmas spirit was gone and demolished
And I was the only one who could abolish their plan
So I took a stand!
But they said I must journey across the land
I said, ""Listen my friend, I'll be glad to go
But the sand out there is worse than snow""
The first wise man said, ""Yes, that's true""
To protect my feet, gave me Bally shoes
The second wise man said, ""Yes, you're right""
And gave me a Kangol to shade my eyes
The third wise man, leaning on a cane
Said ""Take this mic, rapper Dana Dane!""
He said that the mic would help my words
Of Christmas cheer be clearly heard

Well I started my journey at the first light
I travelled the desert for a fortnight
I sighed, I tried, the North Star my guide
Pulled my Kangol over my eyes
Took off my Ballys, dumped the sand on the side
Put my Ballys back on and continued my stride
Off I went through the sand and mist
Taking all types of chances and all kinds of risks
It was Christmas Eve, time was growing short
Then I came upon the place that I had sought
Went up to the door, straight in the palace
Faces were filled with contempt and malice
Up on the stage, what did I see?
That's right, party people -- a sucker emcee
Went up on the stage, plugged in my mic
To the sucker emcee I said ""Good night!""
Off he went, he was steaming mad
Talk about relief! The crowd was glad
I said, ""Have no fear, cause I am here
To wish a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year""
I continued on, they began to believe
And the Christmas spirit was soon retrieved
The fingers were popping, the house cold rocking
Talk about staring -- girls were cold clocking
Mission complete, I was on my way
Girls in back of me screaming, ""Dane, please stay!""
But I couldn't cause I had done my thing
And as I walked out the door I heard them all sing

Sucker emcees, you better watch out!
All emcees, you gotta watch out!
Dana Dane is coming to town
Dana Dane is coming
Dana Dane is coming
Yes, Dana Dane is coming
To town",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-dana-dane-is-coming-to-town-lyrics
This Be The Def Beat,Dana Dane With Fame,1987.0,"The sounds you're about the hear coming through your speaker
Will blow you over and fry your tweeter
Get up out your seat
Give your feet a treat
And you'll understand why this be the def beat


Listen up patriarchs of the rapping sphere
The rapper entertainer Dana Dane is here
Now I came here just to have fun
So guys get loose and girls shake those buns
A lot of you girls what I would love to meet
And I'll check you later when my job's complete
Cause as for now I am only around
To make you party people just get on down
Cause the rhymes I write
Are fresh and ripe
And guaranteed to be just your type
Cause you the public knows who we're rhyming for
And for my rhymes I'd like than you all
Cause I've worked hard for days and nights
Just to make sure the rhymes came out right
Now that I did, you must admit
That the rhymes I wrote were the ultimate
But nevertheless I'd like to exclaim
""This Be The Def Beat"" is this jam's name
Now do me a favor for me and my team
When I say ""scream"" would you please scream?
Scream!
(Crowed screams)
Yes, something like that, yes, yes


The beat is bad, getting badder
On the way up the ladder
""The Beat Is Dope"" is the neighborhood chatter
You might think the record would be hard core
But I'm here to tell you it's much much more
A combination of rap, rhythm and blues
And a swinging beat that you can't refuse
Some call it slick, others say it's jammin
Clark heard the beat and said, ""Yo, it's slammin!""
Crashing through your speakers like a wild stampede
With enough base to make your eardrums bleed
And just when you thought it's just a beat
The music line come in for a extra treat
It  on point smooth but also crisp
The producer Hurby just has that gift
Now on the microphone a voice that you can trust
Yes me, Dane, kicking it from dawn to dusk
Simply conveyed
Are the words I say
Don't ask me why, I just rhyme that way
But let's get back to the rhythm at hand
""This Be The Def Beat"" is the name of this jam",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-this-be-the-def-beat-lyrics
We Wanna Party,Dana Dane With Fame,1987.0,"Dane: Hey yo, Hurb what's up?
Hurby: Dana, where you been?
Dane: Yo, the limo came late man.  I just stepped in
Hurby: Well, let's start the show.  The peoples getting upset.  Tell them what this be
Dane: Okay, Hurb, bet

Let this be the reason for all mankind
You're taste buds will just love a well seasoned rhyme
That I recite on the mic
Making you get hyper

Cause I'm Dane.  I'm on the mic again
Rapping up a storm (Oh, come on)
Yo, Hurb! (Huh?)
Tell them what what's going on

Now what we have here's
The best jam of the year
Top security for your assurity
I swear
Me and Dana is maxin hard
(Cold chilling)
If you want to flirt, flygirls
(We're willing)
Who, me?  I'm Hurby Luv Bug, word see
I've been rapping for years
But no one's heard me rhyme
Because I spend most of my time
Producing other groups, but now I'm going for mine

Now you'll dance (You'll glide)
You'll move with pride
And you don't stop moving even though you try
You won't (you can't)
You'll huff (and pant)
And ""we want more"" (Will be your chant)
So you wait, you hope
Wide eyed, you scope
Praying for another rhyme that's just as dope
But you're tired (waxed)
But here is the facts
Just like sex you want your climax
As sure as I'm Dana Dane With Fame
When it comes you'll know it came
Cause a sigh of satisfaction will be exhaled
And all at once you all will yell

Dana: ""We want to party, we want to party!""
Crowd: ""We want to party, we want to party!""
Dana: ""I said, we want to party, we want to party!""
Crowd: ""We want to party, we want to party!""
Aaaaaah, yeah
Haha
That's right.  Get down
So let's party

Yes, we're going to party if you like it or not
I don't care if you're tired or burning hot
Dana Dane and I came here to drop
(Dope, def)  rhymes on the spot
(In effect)
You can bet
Two great poets
And my man, Clark Kent on the D.J. set

Yes, we're going to party until you're out of breath
And the drum seems like it's going to beat you to death
Have you scream and holler throughout the show
(Yo, are we going to party?)
Now Hurb, you know
We'll make them dance until their legs get weak
But they'll still refuse to go grab a seat
""Party Hard"" (G)
And that we will
And there'll be no reason for you to get ill
Cold drinks at the bar
Sounds up to par
And for your entertainment, we are your stars
Now I'd like to send out a call
And I want a little feedback from you all

Dana: ""Say, we want to party, we want to party!""
Crowd: ""We want to party, we want to party!""
Dana: ""I said, we want to party, we want to party!""
Crowd: ""We want to party, we want to party!""

Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, Baby, please
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it to me like that

Let's party
Let's party
Yo, the party's at our hotel girls
That's right and I got the lambskins, so trust me
Cases of em
Ah, yes.  Ah, yes.  We are ready for tonight

Well I am here to show
And to let you know
How to get you party people out there on the go

Soon I will own a estate
And drive a fresh Volvo with my name on the plate
Now with the rhymes I create
I guess it would be my fate
To be considered as the best at the present date
See I am only a man
Giving you what you demand
It's time to make you party people cold clap your hands
'Cause I created this flow
To make go, ""Ho""

As said in my name
To be the rapper entertainer Dana Dane With Fame
I execute my rhyme

Even call them tough
To hear them one time wouldn't be enough
'Cause the words I say
Will make you sway
And for years to come this record will play

Sure to hit the spot
And to make you all groove is the only plot
So won't you bust a move

And it's moving at a speed that we call The Groove


Now be free at heart
Come on and do your part
I'm sure others will follow if you just start
I'm not hear to cause trouble
Or burst your bubble
I just want the party rocking right now on the double
Not trying to sound rude
Fierce or crude
Just trying to get your bodies into mood

To make the house jump
And with he help of the scratch it's sure to pump

Let your body be free
And I'm sure in a moment you will agree

Record Jock,Rollin’ Wit Dana Dane,1995.0,"Dana Dane
Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana Dane
Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana...

Full-circle, 360 degrees Dane
My style will live forever, my fame will be maintained
Now some can't feel this, and some feel can't that
But all can feel a track that's produced by Battlecat
So gather round and listen to my non-fiction
The picture will come clearer than a Sony television
This ain't about dissin, this is all fact
Women on my nuts cause my vocals makin cash

(The Rapper Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's on the record's jock, she doesn't love me
(The Great Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's just stressin my fame and my money

I'm busting this one for Bridget, the ho
I met at the Amoco pumping the petrol into her five-point-O
I wanted her because she looked like Janet Jackson
Caramel complexion, sporting sexy fashion
""Hello, how you're doin?"" I said, ""they call me Dane""
""I could learn to love your flavor, hon, hey, what's your name?""
She had nothing for me, totally ignored me
High-sided, took it like she never saw me - cool
So I tried again: ""What up! How you're feelin?""
Was a hot and humid day, but I felt a cold chill
I figured, let me step before I have to diss her
That's when I overheard her girlfriend try to whisper
(Oh, I know him from somewhere - oh, that's Dana Dane!
I saw him last week, he performed on Soul Train)
Now honey flipped the script like Sybil
""You're not the Rapper Dana Dane With Fame, is you?
Ooh, I like your records, ooh, you're the man
Ooh, you're so fine, I'm your number one fan""
Now she knows that I'm the Dane, all of a sudden I'm accepted
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records


Next I peeped this honey at the bar scopin the Dane hard
Loud, money proud, yo, I knew her ho card
Native New Yorker, Brooklyn fast-talker
Big jewelry-sporter, sippin Johnny Walker
She bought me this drink, she's flashin her cash
She passin me hints like she wanna give me the ass
I avoided her because I knew her man Pedro
She said (Dana, fuck him, let's talk about your stage show!)
You ??? well, there ain't no brother better
Hands on my pants, woulda yoked it if I let her
She was gettin tippsy, dancin like a gypsy
Seen her before, but never knew she was this frisky
Tried to break lips, but she wasn't tryin to have it
Playing me close like ??? metal to a magnet
Then she shouted: ""Dane, I can't wait to get you naked!""
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records


Now last but not least, let me tell you 'bout Tootie
Baaya with the tatas, booya with the booty
A cutie with a juicy fat coochie
Felt it was my duty to make her sing like Suzy
??? 'Choy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy..' - recall the flavor?
From the first album that the Dane ever gave ya
Anyway, no more delay, she was a hard nut to crack
Kicked the rap like a mack, but she wouldn't give me jack
But still she's in my grill every time that she sees me
Askin (When you're comin with that new fat release?)
Well, I seen her 'bout a weak about, I told her 'bout a week or so
""Wouldn't you like to be in Dana Dane's video?""
Now she started clickin, ditcher her inhibitions
Coming to my tip for those private auditions
Again the same game, just a different scenario
Ridin on my nuts to play a part in my video
Must be the music
That's makin her flip
Must be the music
Must be the music",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-record-jock-lyrics
Cinderfella,Dana Dane With Fame,1987,"Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!""
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, ""Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits""
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't"" is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
Well I shrugged, I hissed, ""They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish""
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Hurb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes
My fresh Volvo also went too
And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
Went into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin' ""Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept askin' me as I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock on the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess"", this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' on shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
Sayin' ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, there came a flash of light
And I was tough in the gear from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the Volvo
Said to my family, ""I've got to go""
We drove up the avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me I heard my family cry...

Tales from the Dane Side,Dana Dane 4-Ever,1990.0,"In this starlit world of fame and fortune
Our realities are sometimes dimmed by stature and ego
But when the mic is checked and the spotlight shines
There comes another side
A Dane Side

Now I’mma start this tale from here, is that okay with you
I met a girl, okay the other day or two
She called me up and said, “Dane, I’d like to see you.""
""Be here at 9. Better yet, make it a quarter-to.”
Well at her house I wrung the bell, “Who is it?”
“Me, Dana Dane, here to pay Kim a visit”
A faint voice said, “I’m back here!”
As I bypassed the living room, straight to the rear
Now in the bedroom on the bed she lay
Urging me on as she began to say
“I heard you were great, by word of mouth""
""But right here and now I’m going to wear you out”
I threw my arms in the air, said “It’s out of my hands.”
I took off my shirt and dropped my pants
Then with a grin and before I jumped in
And I swam and I swam like a happy dolphin
I hit at all angles, the bottom, the top
Then she screamed out, “Dane, stop!”
I knew she seemed to (be) singing a new tune
Exhausted, she slowly went to the bathroom
Then a moment later she was back ready?!
“Excuse me lover boy, ready for round two?”
For four or five rounds now this went on
Something was wrong
Cause I was getting worn
So I followed to the bathroom to scope the deal
Yo, it couldn’t be, it can’t be real
Now check this out y’all
Would you believe, Kim was just one of the beautiful three?
But now that I had met the whole gang
Three on one? But it ain’t no thing
You think that tale’s too tall or maybe I lied?
But anything can happen in Tales from the Dane Side?

Late one night walking through a park
Gosh, I must admit it was awfully dark
Now me and this kid, he didn’t pay me no mind
He was stepping kind of fast, I guess he had to make time
A hood on his head, couldn’t see his face
But by the way that he walked, well I assumed he was gay
He dipped out (of) the park and I knew he was gone
But wait, pointed at my head was this .45 long
It was the kid, came back for me
He said, “Take off your coat and all your jewelry”
Other than the fact I was about to be taxed
Something in this guy’s voice made me, um, relax
Playing with my coat, trying to stall for time
He knew I was trying to play with his mind
He started getting confused like a young boy would
He made a frantic mistake and took off his hood
Astonished, amazed, my face turned pale
Would you believe this guy was a sweet female?
She said, “Want everything that you’ve got on
I even want your BVD nylons”
“Now BVDs,” I said, “are well and fine”
“But the Dane here only wears Calvin Klein.”
She changed. My name must have struck a nerve
“Are you the rapper Dana Dane? You can’t be, word”
She said, “You’re the best. You’re number one”
Smiling, blushing, waving the gun
Word to the parent, I gotta get some
As she pulled out a pack of lubricated condoms
Forced me to take of my fly  
We proceeded to christen an old park bench
Some might disbelieve and say I lied
But anything can happen in Tales from the Dane Side

Now I went to a party, go cool and hard
Girlies calling out my name like I’m a superstar
Screaming out of their heads
Going out of their minds
Saying, “Oh, Dana Dane, you’re so divine!”
Now the night was still early, about an hour until twelve
When up jumps this figure from the depths of hell
He introduced himself, “LUCIFER THE GREAT”
He said he’d have my soul and he was so convinced
His eyes on fire
His voice cold
A wave of his hand appeared a mic of gold
Now with the same chill voice from him I was told
“I’ll wager this mic against your soul”
Now the wage was this, who could rock the mic?
Who could make the party pump for the rest of the night?
The mic must have made me outright possessed
Because I didn’t hesitate and took his bet
Now to bet against the devil is a sure enough sin
And everybody knows you just can’t win
The girls knew the deal. They cried out my name
“Please don’t take the rapper Dana Dane!”
Now the devil, he laughed, he thought he’d won
But he didn’t know the battle had just begun
Cause I kicked him this rhyme, yes smooth and on tempo
He tried the same, but a real lame attempt though
He bowed his head and said, “I lose”
Then laid the golden mic by my Bally shoes
So I slapped him across the head and said, “for shame, for shame”
Now right before eyes, yo, the devil changed
Now laughing at me with these rotten teeth
Yeah, you guessed it, Anita The Beast
Now some might disbelieve and say I lied
But anything can happen in Tales from the Dane Side",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-tales-from-the-dane-side-lyrics
A Little Bit Of Dane Tonight,Dana Dane 4-Ever,1990,"Funky
Funky
Funky *scratched*
Funky *scratched*
*record scratch*

No one knows, but I've been here for a while
I was sitting in the back playing a low profile
Then like expected, well my name would be paged
""Would the rapper Dana Dane please come to the stage?""
Well I slid my seat back still cool, relaxed
Stood up on my feet, gave a tilt to my hat
To the front I walked, yes, still unnoticed
Up on the stage all the eyes would be focused
Then from the left the girlies caught their breath
And said, ""There goes the Dane.  He sure looks Fresh""
Now a posse clocked me saying they could rock me?
Mad 'cause the girlies called and they flocked me
But that didn't phase me
They must of been crazy
Forget about the guys, see, I came for the ladies
And to grab the mic, right?
Hold it tight, like
Recite a hyped type rhyme that I write
And if I may or if I might
Give a little bit of myself tonight

(funky)
Just a little bit of Dane tonight (funky)
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
Just a little Dana rocking you tonight
Makes you want to hold on tight (funky)

Now, mic in hand and the people cheered me
""One, two.  One, two. Can everyone hear me?""
""YES"" (audience shouting)
So let the party begin
As Clark cuts the record like a swordsman
To a worldwide rhythm that I'll be sporting
Dropped on point by producer Fresh Gordon
I came here to share my lyrical flair
Dana Dane Forever, rapper extraordinaire
Now girls flocked in numbers
And they cry my name
Saying, ""He's the Duke"" and ""We love Dane!""
I couldn't resist. Yeah, I blew them a kiss
""That was for me!""
""No it wasn't you ...""
Hey, no need to fight, so I blew them another
A fella on the side said, ""F the mother""
But I told him, ""Don't mess with me
You know who the best to be
Listen to the radio, your mother requested me""
I've got a talent, a style, I'm gifted
Those who riff, well, it's time you get lifted
But I didn't come here to fuss or to fight
But to give a little bit of myself tonight

Just a little bit of Dane tonight
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
Just a little Dana rocking you tonight
Makes you want to hold on tight (funky)
Just a little bit of Dane tonight
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
(one, two, three, four, hit it)

Well, well, well, the party's heated now
There's no reason for you all to be seated now
Guys, girls do the latest dance move
Those who can't dance well bob to this smooth move
I drive  straight up 
Is it R&B or cold hard hip-hop?
It doesn't really matter, just have a good time
You better get yours, 'cause I'm sure to get mine
You never thought the Dane would be this large again my brother?
Bring it on up, I'll sign your album cover
But hold your girl 'cause I think she's jocking me
Can't you tell by the way that she's clocking me?
Well, at least she's got the right idea
And we can get busy when I'm finished here
'Cause she knows how to get things done right
Just get a little bit of the Dane tonight

Just a little bit of Dane tonight (funky)
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
Just a little Dana rocking you tonight
Makes you want to hold on tight (funky)
Just a little bit of Dane tonight (funky)

Johnny the Dipper,Dana Dane 4-Ever,1990,"Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast
A baby boy was born, the mother died at birth
His father ran away, that made it even worse
Now he was passed along to his next akin
That was his mother's brother, known as Uncle Len'
He bought him a car of his very own
Got him an education and a decent home
But just when the lad became of age
Uncle Lenny thought he'd teach him his only trade
He said, ""Johnny, my boy"" - that was the laddie's name
""You're about to learn the pickpocket game
Now pay close attention, cause you gotta be quick
But most of all, be smooth and slick""
He studied his uncle for hours on in
And Lenny did the move for him again and again
Then one day Johnny screamed with glee
""I got it, I got it, see, Unc', see?""
""Now hold on,"" he said, ""son, there's one more rule
Use your gift wisely, don't be no fool""
""Yeah, Unc', yeah,"" he said half-hearted
Little did Lenny know what he had just started
Cause now Johnny's dippin right and left
He did a year in the pen, two counts of theft
Yeah, they caught me this time
But wait till I get back out, man
No one will be able to touch me
Not even my uncle Lenny the Lifter
You understand what I'm sayin?
Yo, you know who I am?
I'm Johnny the Dipper!
Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast
Now Johnny the Dipper is the name he earned
Out on probation, and he still hasn't learned
Cause he's hawkin the walls of the high school halls
Schemin and scamin in the shopping mall
He skip, dip, take a wallet from the hip
Victims risky, but he was quick as a whip
Paid for days, his wallet gettin fatter
Johnny was the Dipper, nothin else mattered
Scoopin all them honeys, shit was great
Until he made his fatal mistake
He dipped on a man called Bobby Vino
Mafia king for the gambling casinos
Now Bobby was a hood who demanded respect
His pocket was picked and he was highly upset
He asked all his boys: now who would dare rob the
Undisputed king of the mobsters?
He sent Joe Crazy and  Dan
Out on the mission to find their man
Yo, find Lenny the Lifter
And make him pay, eh?
He-he-he
Wait till my uncle sees my big pay-off
He's gonna be jealous, he-he-he
Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast
Now Johnny overjoyed with escapades
Went home to his uncle with the money he made
When he got home, well, the door wide open
A gun on the floor, the barrel still smokin
He stops, stares, his face full of fear
As he sees the results of his dipping career
Happy days it was to be, but no, instead
Lenny tied to a chair with a bullet in his head
He screams, ""I'm sorry, I return every penny""
But Johnny, you've dipped one time too many
Oh Uncle..
Uncle Lenny!
What I have I done!
Uncle Lenny
Talk to me..
Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-johnny-the-dipper-lyrics
Once Again,Rollin’ Wit Dana Dane,1995.0,"Fuck what you heard, act like you know
For the ninth time Dana Dane serves a funky flow
Oh you didn't know that I was down with the Lifestyles?
Battlecat, we flip this, he makes the track that's buck wild
People wondering where I've been, what I'm going to do now
Well I've been north and south creating a new sound
Thought I couldn't do it, huh?  Make another single?
After ""Dane With Fame"" you thought the Dana Dane was done
Because they say you're only as good as your last
The Diggy coming through with something new on your funky ass
Yeah, see I've been missing in action
Gone, but not forgotten
'95 Diggy Dane's go you rockin'
And you know there'll be no stopping
I got to keep the fellas hyped
And keep the honies panties dropping (oh drop those drawers honey)
With the funky hits that I'm bringing
You know I'm going to win 'cause once again I got y'all singing

I can't sleep because (the nightmares) keep messing with my head
I couldn't top my last smash hit, that's what the critics said
About the capital D-a-n-a capital D-a-n-e
I ain't worried about it though 'Cause I know I got more hits in me (that's real)
So, where do we go from here? That's what I ask myself
Sold five hundred thousand copies from the store shelf (I'm gold)
But a whack contract
Tried to hold be back
And bring me down
But you know there'll be none of that
I got to make it happen
I'm aiming for platinum
Sitting back and rolling up a fat one
Everybody spreading rumors, but I'll get the last laugh
'85 to '95 Dane still signing autographs
So suckers  one in your mouth
You never thought it came from Brooklyn
We cooking up the flavors of the Lifestyles
Old jams linger and persist and keep hanging
Yeah, once again I got you singing

Y'all remember how I kicked it
I ripped it
Gifted lyrics flowed like liquid
(Uh huh, Uh huh)
But now it's time I flipped it
And shifted
To that other level of the game
Yes it's me Dana Dane (Fame)
Once again on the cut
Here to fuck it up
Fort Greene Projects Brooklyn
Off the   
I'd like give shouts to
I had to bust a power move that tapes in LA
Made a plane with my man
Harry O, Little K
Yo, we hooked up and now I'm down with that clique
All the non-believers sick
Your honies riding disnick
Of the Dana (scrath) Dana
The Entertainer
The Gucci Tamer
I can't express it any plainer
For too long I had ya'll waiting and fiending
So I hit you once again fat and hard to keep you screaming",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-once-again-lyrics
Bedie Boo,Dana Dane 4-Ever,1990,"Bedie Boo
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now Bedie was this girl I graduated from high school with
You know, the type of girl that everybody is real cool with
She didn't smoke or drink, in fact she never ever cursed
She wore the rosary beeds and kept a Bible in her purse
Well, one day she was aligned waiting to get in a night club
Some major group was playing, and everybody was real hyped up
Now Bedie wasn't assort to go to parties of that type
And I couldn't help but wonder why she had came here tonight
Now I didn't ask any questions, I went inside and got a drink
Someone tapped me on my shoulder (Hm, who could it be?) Now let me think
I looked around, and there was Bedie, all dressed up in lace and leather
Boy, I must admit, she really had her act together
Bedie Boo
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while
Until it gets around
Oh-oh-oh Bedie Boo
(Hello, remember me?) I said, ""Oh yes, of course I do
You're the girl from science class that I used to sit next to""
She started givin hints like she wanted me to hit it
(Was you with it?) Well, you know.. (Yo, was you with it?) Yeah, I was with it!
I led her to this room, the door said 'V.I.P.'
Only for people with juice, and of course that meant me
I said, ""Gosh, how you changed, Bedie, you sure look, different""
(But you said she was religious) I can see now that she isn't
She got on her knees and started reachin for my zipper
I sang this little song right before, you know, I did her
Bedie Boo
You used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while

Lonely Man,Dana Dane 4-Ever,1990,"I'd like to dedicate this song
To, um, everyone who has someone special in their life
We should learn to cherish and appreciate what we have now
(yes we should)
Because at any point in time it can be snatched away from us

Now I figure with a trigger I can end this all
I could finish my past, before I could fall
Staring in the mirror like so many have done
Trying to solve my problem down the barrel of a gun
Thinking to myself, ""What kind of grief and sorrow
Would have a human being forfeiting tomorrow?""
While in my eyes, a lonely tear escaped
In my mind, well, my past reshaped
I shook, I shivered, I began to quiver
Wondering if I could ever forgive her
For leaving me with a broken heart
My spirit and soul were torn apart
My blue skies gray, my future lost
The present full of pain and remorse
For leaving me the way I am
By myself. Forever, a lonely man

He can't go on no more
You're all he's living for
The precious times you shared
Now all that has disappeared
He can't go on when love is gone
Dana Dane is just a lonely man

Now it was one of those nights, like any other night
Except we planned to have dinner by candlelight
Now, I'm in the shower getting refreshed
And my girl, she's in the kitchen having the table dressed
Then she calls out, ""Dane, I'll be back in a few
I have to run to the store on the avenue.""
I jokingly replied, ""Well, I'll be waiting like this""
""Stop being so fresh"", she said, ""and blow me a kiss""
*kissing*
With this, she was on her way
I said, ""Hurry back honey, hurry back, okay?""
Now hours had passed and she wasn't back
Now I was getting worried. Now where's she at?
That's when the phone rang, *bring* *bring*
""Where the hell are you?"", I concernedly screamed
But it wasn't her, no it was the police
An 88th precinct, a Detective Reese
He said, ""Is this the home of a Linda MacGyver?
There's been an accident involving a drunk driver
Stunned, confused, I listened in awe
Before he could finish, I burst out the door
I dashed to the hospital with no time to spare
Thinking to myself that it just isn't fair
In the Emergency, there I was informed
She had a fifty-fifty chance and her will is strong
In the waiting room back and forth I paced
As pools of tears ran down my face
Thinking to myself the things I loved about her
Telling myself that I can't go an without her
And why I should have to? It just isn't right
For my future to be shattered in just one night
But she'll pull through, she'll understand
Without her here, I'm forever a lonely man

He can't go on no more
You're all he's living for
The precious times you shared
Now all that has disappeared
He can't go on when love is gone
Dana Dane is just a lonely man
Ooooh
Lonely man
Lonely man
Dana Dane is just a lonely man

The Doc came in, his face revealing nothing
I pleaded to him, ""Please, Doc. Now tell me something""
He lowers his head, afraid to face my tears
And what he told me next was that of my worst fears
I couldn't believe it as I fell to my knees
""Oh no, Lord. It can't be! Oh no, Lord. Please!""
Now I stand here contemplating my end
But to take my own life, would that make things right?
Nah, if she was here I know she'd say
""Keep your head up Ba' tomorrow's a new day""
Yeah, I'm gonna try to start all over
It's gonna be hard, I'll try
But I'll still be a lonely man

He can't go on no more
You're all he's living for
The precious times you shared
Now all that has disappeared
He can't go on when love is gone
Dana Dane is just a lonely man
He can't go on no more
You're all he's living for
The precious times you shared
Now all that has disappeared
He can't go on when love is gone
Dana Dane is just a lonely man",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-lonely-man-lyrics
What Dirty Minds U HAve,Dana Dane 4-Ever,1990,"Dane: Yo, Joeski Love
Joeski: What's up, hops?
Dane: I got this story to tell you, see your mind is at
Joeski: All right, so let's hear it, let's hear it
Dane: Yo, what I want you to do, right?
Joeski: uhuh
Dane: Give me the cue and I will drop it
Joeski: You ready?
Dane: Okay, whenever you give me the cue
Joeski: Here you go, one... two... three... drop it

Last week I threw a party, it was extra phat
In my condo in Brooklyn, yeah the bachelor pad
Now I was getting set for the party that night
Hooking up the snacks, punch, and the party lights
Running kind of late but things couldn't be better
When this girl came over by the name of Loretta
She said
Loretta: ""Dane sweetie, can I give you a hand?""
That's when I whipped it out on her like a rubber band
Dane: ""Well here you go honey, do it. For me, please?""
Dane in falsetto: ""I do know how,"" she said, ""I know it's hard to believe.""
Dane: ""Well it's time you learned. Here, assume the position
It's not that different from whistling or kissing
Now get a good grip, message it a bit
Now wet it with your tongue or the tip of your lips
Yeah, you got it. You're a natural, a pro
Now go ahead and do it, hun'.""
Loretta: ""What?""
Dane: ""You know""
Loretta: ""I don't think I can.""
Dane: ""Hey give it a try. I know you're sure to get better as the time goes by.""
Loretta: ""If it wasn't you Dane, I don't think I could do it.""
Dane: ""I'm not trying to rush you hun', but please get to it
You're wasting time. The guests will be here soon
And you still have to blow up all these party balloons.""

(ooh la la la repeating in background)
Tell me, what dirty minds you have
Oh, what dirty minds you have
Ooh, what dirty minds you have

Dane: Oh ho Joe, I saw what you where thinking!
Joeski: Yes, you definitely almost caught me out, there
Dane: Yes, yes, yes
Joeski: You always do
Done: Yo, but I got another one
Joeski: You got one more? A'ight
Joeski: On the count of three -- just drop it

Well I'm tipsy at a jam, Saturday evening
Feeling kind of blitted and I thought about leaving
But I'm not the type that drinks and drives
So I stepped for some air, right outside
Recognized a girl and explained the situation
Gave her my keys and directional information
She agreed to take me home. Now wasn't that great?
""You're name is Dane, huh? I read it on your plate.""
""Oh by the way"", she said, ""my name is Betty""
""You look like a Betty that I might have met already.""
She just smiled and gave no reply
As I thought to myself, ""well, my oh my""
We soon pulled up to my beachfront house
I said, ""I need a little favor,"" as I kissed her on her mouth
""Now would you do me something?"", that's what I insisted
""Sure, okay, I'm with it."" and she anxiously persisted
To take it out my pants and she made it jungle
""Now go ahead an hold it, hun'. It's not gonna wrinkle.""
""Should I put it in?""
I said, ""Of course, please!""
She fondled it a while, then she played and she teased
Fumbling on the porch, trying to put it in
She said, ""It won't fit, Dane"" and she giggled and she grinned
""I've tried and I've tried, but it's far too large.""
Now it was time for The Dane to take charge
So I pushed and I shoved and I pushed 'til she screamed
""Ooh, don't strip it. Here, take the Vaseline!""
So I greased it, slid it, turned to the right
Woooh, I'm in! What a night, what a night
""Never again,"" as I panted and swore
""Tomorrow I'ma change that lock on the door.""

(ooh la la la repeating in background)
(Joeski: Ooh, yeah!)
What dirty minds you have
(Joeski: mm-hmm... yep)
What dirty minds you have

Dane: Yo, Joeski! Am I the dude or what?
Joeski: You're not the dude 'cause you didn't get paid! Did you get paid?
Dane: Yo I, Yo I, I
Joeski: Did you get paid?
Dane: You, you are Joeski Love
Joeski: I know who I am
Dane: And I am the Dane
Joeski: I know who you are, but did you get paid?
Dane: the Overlord
Joeski: You're talking about locks and balloons. I want to know did you get paid?
Dane: What can I say? (what happened to the girl?)
Dane: I am what I am. (come on, man)
Joeski: The party was whack and what happened with the balloons?
Dane: Yo

Joeski: What happened to Betty? Did you... did you get paid?
Dane: Yo, what do you (I think she wrote you a blank check) want me to tell you?
Joeski: The checks bounced, man. You didn't get paid

Where so carefully blended
Together like a piña colada
Or strawberry daiquiri
Or maybe just a shot of
Cognac, V-S-O-P
Top of the line, kind of fine, and divine like me

At the top of the marquee my name will be billed
""Live in Concert"", the board will proclaim

I like to say that it's cool and constructive
The stories I write, my claim to fame
With all due respect, step aside Mark Twain
No fighting or fussin'

Into the mic those rhymes released
Bruce Lee couldn't kick it line Dane
May he rest in peace
Now most can't cope long
'Cause this is a dope song
You got your hopes up to win
But your hoped wrong
Of course you lost 'cause Dane always rocks
I froze to pose spectators wanted snapshots
Lines for rhymes brought me fame and fortune

When I'm with my boys and we're headin'
To a party, a jam, or a movie flick
Going to get a bit to eat - skeezin'
Well, it doеsn't matter where I'm goin'
As long as The Dane is flowin'
Like a hurricane that's blowin'

I'm gonna keep you flowing, steady like a lake
Making sure that everybody is having a ball

I'm kicking to this girl wearing tight overalls
Her man started beef and so I dropped him like a free fall
And off I go (where to?) you know! (woopie)

To Andre Debourg The Recall Lord, Hurby “Luv Bug""
And The Invincibles, and Fresh Gorden
I’d like to dedicate this album to Omega the Heartbreaker
Kool Out Ski, and Lance Brown and the rest of the Kangol Crew
A special dedication to my mother
She said, “Dane, aim high. Be all you can be. You are the future.”
I love you Mom
And oh yeah, could you get rid of that fast beat?
And give me a Dana Dane rhythm?
Thank you",https://genius.com/Dana-dane-dedication-2-lyrics
