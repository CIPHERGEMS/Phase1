Survival Tactics,1999,2012.0,"It's either them or you
It's sort of like survival, you know
Survival of the fittest, you know
You do what you do to stay alive

Niggas don't want war—I'm a martian, with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right; your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite; I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got 'em niggas P-E-Nuts—like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit time to inaugurate
My P.E.-conglomerates 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame-spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be Simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of Theodora,
 
my heart go
""Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom""
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that 'K
Like every day in every way, and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is, ""Pray""
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best—I'm like, ""You're so right""
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E., Public Enemy,
 Assassinate us—bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything, son
Fuck government, fuck—listenin' and shit
You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards,
 
wiping out motherboards
Start spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, I been the flyest with it
Wouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', ""Fuck censorship!""
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
'Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's 'cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond—nigga",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-survival-tactics-lyrics

Before the money there was love
But before the money it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough, yo

Sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in, closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava, with just a penny I could
Multiply my worth and make you work for me for 20 hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
'Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose, foes
Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them, the Pros been on a mission, listen
Enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise stakes to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is

Dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you

LAND OF THE FREE,ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$,2017.0,"Yeah, you know sometimes I think
They don't truly understand me, you know
Cause they don't, yeah, uh

Can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today that's worthwhile
Will for sure inspire actions in your first child
I'll begin my verse now

Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle
They built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let’s face facts 'cause we know what’s the real motives

In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last names of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders

I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action, hold up, yeah, uh

Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
A human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition

In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners

Hardknock,1999,2012.0,"Check it, word word
What's the word word
Yeah, check!

Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wilding, he look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony,
 
only thing playing is the banned violence
No lying niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions
So don't eye 'em they get the wrong message, wrong methods
Put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, 
God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me, ""More dress-up""—I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm putting in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like ""they gon' catch up"" fuck what you must heard!
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressing and shine, it's fine

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and whatnot
The motto never changed it’s still fuck cops
We went from having lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs was hot whenever we'd puff pot
We'd touch blocks and end up having to duck shots
But fuck dot, ain’t trying live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can’t be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your faith is your only escape
Fuck a priest’s opinion, knock the hinges off of Heaven’s gates
Trying to share my cells with my mate, not share a cell with mates
Wrecking shit with my recklessness
The L get lit that’s when I start second guessing shit
Thinking 'bout Ty and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could’ve fuck me over
Never nigga guess again
I’m street so cross me like pedestrians
And that’s gon' be the end of it, straight revoking your membership

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Niggas wanna know what I’m about—I’m 'bout blowin' loud
On the block sporty, 
Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spitting behind the bars like a con position
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, 
I kick it like Nike they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you I keep my attitude on ""screw it a million bucks should do it""
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me, who the bestest MC? They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molesting the beat, 
fuck math
Teachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson’s off of the street
So first class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teaching for some regents, I'm flying over regions
Reaching, all time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Censor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, 
Glock cocked watching out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemesis
Smoking on the Clematis,
 
get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linking terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slinging some regs, popping some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be back stage gripping haze breaking my leg
My folks was making the best when they was naked in bed, muthafucka

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this

Waves,1999,2012.0,"Yeah, you remember back in the days
When niggas used to rock waves and shit?
When like, yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga
Like nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit
And that's real shit

Uhh, since '9-5, momma been working nine-five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful
Will have me in the Daily Postal, flying coastal, eatin tofu
Like I told you, I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin ""What happened?""
But back to the chapter
Momma told me follow dreams, should never have to ask her, to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask em, ""Who's Joey Bad?""
Watch em gasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found in your retinal
Uh, and they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false
 that this kid from the north
Speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss, no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes
Yeah

What the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person
You know what I wanna say: a real N-I-G-G-A
I'm coming at 'em 100% real, I ain't compromising nothin'
Anybody that talk about me got problems, you know what I'm sayin'
It's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world
And I'm being real about it and I'ma grow with my music

Yeah, but it's far from over
Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
'Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like three times, have three kids, I hope
Me & wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge
Cause yeah, they gon need it
Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments, they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, cause my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine
Imagine, I'ma make it all happen",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-waves-lyrics

Blackmailed in braille that means what he felt
And the very reveal could appeal
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth
Uh, roots of all evil
The highest stars; Evel Knievel
I see through people's door,

How my third pupil show,
 
Incognito and cold needles flow
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedoes
The Don, not Cheadle,
 
this don got a Cornelius fro
Afro punk festivities
This for my negus that's lying with queens

Started blazing, and stargazing
See how you can reach your farthest aspirations
It's like holy matrimony in the matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a .47 with a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try and hide divine intentions
Like, let em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life has the lemons it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different highs, different haze
Kama sutra with miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her, she a vibrant thang

You niggas is suspect and I'm just a ruffneck
That wasn't breaking pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet, she getting rough sex, no sunset
I like a chick with a buck tooth, yeah it could get fucked too
We keep one eye open, they sus too
Never tell em my government, make any covenant bitches be loving it
Say not to put a glove on it, some funny shit
You must've thought I was a dummy, miss
I feed lines to felines just to get up in their tummies quick
Yeah you got tricks but I got five more
So any game you try to play, you better know I got the high score
You better settle down cause you not on my level now
The Pros is semi-circle, they can tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns, what's the shit about?
They used to doubt now they see us sprout and I'm out

Said you got what's best of mine but you stay plotting on that dime
Thought cause we was cool before that we gon' take yo ass on tour?
Fuck nah, this my chance to get it
How you entitled to my shine? Nigga you ain't help me get it
Now these niggas see me getting it, check the statements on my debit
My profile get requested but I never hit ""accept""
Hit the sour to the chest, I reflect

Eyes beam, cause we can make it better

When you pissed off at the world like you got a crazy bladder
And, momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters
So I gather my thoughts and make use of all these synonyms
Cause I could never swallow the truth, like it's cinnamon
Excuse me if I'm militant
The sinning men in my hood could leave a nigga quivering
Like goddamn, deliver him
, the venom and his liver is
Corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering
Now take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline
Penicillin could not stop the drive he be giving em 
like mad fours
But fast
 forward, let's get to the part where his records
Could 'ford him a couple Fords like ""Lord, ain't he gifted?""
Christmas just doesn't fit him, I need my own holiday
And by the way, I'mma possibly own Monopoly
And all McDonald's property cause I won't live in poverty like

You sell me something then I flip that amount
I just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out
Yeah, they all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth

Cars with no license
Hard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident
Damn, picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana Purchase

Anything, just let the leaves know, oh
Sucka's fuck around, get clapped where you rest at
Nigga saying you cracking, fabric of your imagination
Ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses
But I got your attention, it's part of my ascension
But if I keep toking this strain
It's gonna leave me stranded in this dimension

Who that mofo that came to showboat just cause he float like no other?
Style smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest
Is making real tracks with feelings people ain't feel yet
Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line-up
The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood
So much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line
So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine

Two birds, one stoned, you get geese’d when trees rolled
They say I'm evil cause I trained my ego to see gold
Cause he know, seagulls couldn't see these goals, please
It's the return of the Beast Coast
No cash flashed, but the cheese still make teeth show
Incognito, is how you move on the strip
What you tryna be Vito? Well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, y'all ain't real spitters, y'all lips chapped
Better watch it, Mr. Nice Watch, don't risk that
I got a six-pack of bare
 skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (that shit crack!)

The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
There's makes sense why you want beef, well this frozen
It's nuts for you screwed in the tool, and can't hold em
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go

My lyrical span is what the fans is demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu stand in

And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
The young cop killer, I'm that ill, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer, nigga

Soul searchin' 'til my flows are perfect
I ain't tryna be a slave to grow old from workin'

Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my jeans so don't worry what my pants is
Get with the script, it's that ignorant shit
And they bound to get sick of us quick but I ain't sealin' my lips
It's a shift, I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses, I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberries, it's a jam

Lost in generations before hatred
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs
But keep it sacred G,
 
fuck a rat race, we take the cheese
Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully
I’m a Brooklyn nigga,
 
basically I grind with the grimiest
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas
And vultures,
 
don’t worry what a verse will cost ya
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya
Imma spark it off unorthodox
Won’t sign to no major if no wager
Less than a 3 million offer off the top
I’ll be in a box with my coughin’ drops
Why settle for a office spot?
Niggas don’t always make it off the block
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin’ - 
let me guess: that’s your mannequin?
Leave ‘em shook while you’re standing and quit the shenanigans
Have you panicking, induce damages ‘til you’re vanishing
Words are told properly, resort top sea examinin'

I dispose for 'em,
 leave fake MC’s in the post mortem

Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

It ain’t easy being this royal
When you got this much going for you
It ain’t hard to be disloyal
Comin’ straight from the soil with lines that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil

I’m the chosen one so you can expect more offerings
I be sonning niggas so expect less orphans
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I’m the best offering
BMX like Hoffman, BMF like Boss-man
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune
They said next up so I stepped up
Fly like I dressed up
Bitches try to hang like left nuts
Like orangutans in the west of
Of the motherland,
 
but I’ve got the swank of no other man
Brother man

I stand juxtaposed to all my Pro's, realest illest niggas I know
See these foes biting the flows, they even jooks the pose
I guess my CD really shaking the coast
Cause this really be the year that I feast, capisce?
Nothing defeats the beast, I speak my piece
Know niggas in the streets that heat seek for me
Release and squeeze
Might put a Halloween between your spleen
Retreat or trickle down to your last pound of green
Know what I mean?
This shit is like taking candy from the babies
Under these rappers is just a bunch of Now and Laters
They too sweet, plus they lease their Mercedes
Can't be second greatest, I'm the best and def your favorite
My flow in-depth nigga, I got my wave up
It's either get your tidal waved, or you could be my neighbor
Cause if I can't eat, then you can't either
I need to know, need the pizza dough, fuck I'm spitting ether for?

Yeah nigga
Reigning rap supreme in this bitch
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too

Welcome back y'all, you're listening to WPRO Brooklyn. That was ""Big Dusty"", the new single from Joey Bada$$ and I am turning on the A/C 'cause that joint is hot. Joey is here in the studio with us right now. Say ""Hi"" Joey and tell the people where you from. Yeah, is this mic on? Oh yeah, like, you know, I'm from, I come from Brooklyn, New York. You know, I was born and raised but ah, my my parents from the Caribbean. You know, my ma's from St. Lucia and my pa's from Jamaica. So, you know I play pretty close to my roots",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-big-dusty-lyrics
Like Me,B4.DA.$$,2015.0,"One time, what's the word
What's the word, what's the word
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo
Turn me up on the headphones
Two times, twist the herb
Twist the herb, twist the herb
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo

If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second, uh
Look at me wrong I turn you to tombstone
Lock you in the crosshairs and you gone then I throw my deuce up
Sip sangritas with your señorita, like me gusta
See what that early morning cock will do up to your rooster
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence
Then  you gon' wonder where your highness went

I bet she get low for a nigga like me
She get low for a nigga like me
Bet she get low for a nigga like me
Low for a nigga like me

So we burn the Mary Jane till the third degree
Some niggas biting flows yo, that's burglary
Same niggas acting like they never heard of me
A fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to me

He get blown for a nigga like me
Get his head exposed for a nigga like me
Put him on the floor for a nigga like me

Yo, my mind boggles when time toggles
In the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twisted up
So we put it in the air, don't let the J's start unravelling
We getting blown like a javelin
She throw it back like she time traveling
Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling
I'm screaming ""Land, ho!"" 'bout to hit for sure
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow
I'm pretty sure, like nice beaches that
Even at my weakest I still leave 'em speechless
How you like those peaches? Find me rotting the apple
'Bout to bump so plump
, 'bout to lock in the grapple
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle
Facts like the tat under the cap of the Snapple
Cats get decapitated for acting a fool
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for making a move

We get high and say ""Fuck the police""
That’s why we get high and say ""Fuck the police""
That’s why we get high and say ""Fuck the police""
Yo

Cause every time I make a move they be sweating me
They want another black man in penitentiary
It's even hard for that man standing next to me
Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me
It's like every step bring me close to destiny
And every breath I get closer to the death of me
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy
But the place I call home ain't letting me

Cause you can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG

Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace

I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me

I'm something like the chairman of the board, ranting
I feel invincible like McMannon
One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damn it
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded
By the lyrical New York City bandit
True Warrior like Rembrandt
Yo some cats claim they fly but really been landed
I really can't stand it, let me take a seat
This where Rosa Parks her bum now make some room for me
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep
My old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I just wanna be, girl, I just wanna be
I just wanna be free

I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
Compton to Bed-Stuy

Feel like Ali in his prime
As-Salaam-Alaikum, alaikum salaam
Peace to my Slimes, and peace to my Crips
Neighborhood police and they always on the shift
Protect my Bloods, look out for my cuz
When it's all said and done, we be the realest there was
Who else if just not us?
If you 'bout this revolution, please stand up
We ain't got no one to trust
Time is running up, feel the burn in my gut
And if you got the guts, scream, ""Fuck Donald Trump""
We don't give a fuck, never had one to give
Never will forget, probably never will forgive
Uh, I guess that’s just how it is
And they still won't let the Black man live

Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow
Mentally, I can never be controlled
No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed
Will they remember me when I'm gone?
I say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye baby
Shotta boy, shotta boy, shotta go crazy
Me nuh play games, so please don't play me

Before I was an artist I would book 'em

Push ya shit back while on them front line, nigga, ya lunch time
I'm by them stop sign, you love that wi-fi
On mamas for them dirty dollars, brains on collars
Park the car around the corner, I'll be there in a second
The murder weapon on me, fuck if this bitch start flamin'
The cops patrollin', get that punk ass American flag ceremony
Aww, damn am I going too far?
Give you some flavor to borrow
Bitch yeah it came with the car
It's off-white, leveled the hard
You ball, might come with a charge
Your kids don't know you no more
Your girl's draws stay on the floor
No phone call accepted in weeks
Your son picked up on your beef, real shit
From gettin' lynched in field into ownin' buildings
Getting millions, influencin' white children
And oddly we still ain't even
Still a small percentage of blacks that's eating
Same routines, the same dope fiends
Them nightmare dreams, forever murder season
Bad intentions to them picket fences
They gave us guns but won't hire us, nigga?
So we killin' senseless
Homies murked on the bus benches
Retaliation 'cause his mama cryin'
Kept it gangsta 'til I modify 'em

It's like (it's like)

Sometimes I feel alienated
Because I'm not up in the stadium playing or on the radio sayin'
""Fuck 'em broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em!""
But always find my self back at the bacchanalian
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop but I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been slacking the skill, although my passion is real
I'm too caught up catching a feel when I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger that affected my hunger
Got older in number, realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin', these motherfuckas racist
These ain't fair races, they just let the fear erase us
Adopted by the slums, son of guns this is how they raised us
Yo son we gotta raise up, don't let them just array us
'Til we raisins in the sun, so we gotta wake up

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

Got a whole bunch of shit up on my plate now
Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I don't know who to believe or who to deceive
Got me thinkin' I sold my soul and ain't received a receipt
But I won't proceed to retreat, Jigga told me watch your throne seat
And now I sees it and in respect to B.I.G., I gotta Cease it
And I hope he see me cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents
They ain't fit for this green, they just caesar salad
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it?
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us
It's the axis of the earth at the birth, I found a new balance
And now I walk on water just like I knew balance
Just like a relative, marijuana sedatives
Got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the Senate is
Cause they corruptin' the youth, we ain't inductin' the truth
Lookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to you

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

I passed the dutch to the left and it started to make sense
It's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bent
You've been warned on the risk, it takes to take to sit on top
Been on clock cause you could see that I been on watch
Shit don't stop, 'til you make the sacrifices
Trade in what's priceless to ices and devices
When the light switch, I shift like I'm typin'
Livin' in the era where Christ is the crisis
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans
But the mic is in my hands so I valor the booth
The blacker the berry is, the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards to the power of truth
Became flowers from roots and now we just move in cahoots
I move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphalt
Every night I ask lord if this what I asked for

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents
Cause they always be behind in the cut

Said, what it's like?
Joey Bad' and Chuck Strangers
Leave niggas endangered
It's the real, yo, what's the word word?
Pass the herbs—check

My man Dirty had the buddha just to put me in my right mind
I rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines
Sight dimes wit' slight closed eyes, I'm slight sober
Ma, you ain't that girl at giving throat so bye
F it, I'm bipolar, took shorty to the backroom
Play charades, she actin like a vacuum
Showed her to the door before the afternoon
She fell hard on the floor, so you know that she'll be back soon
Fake MC's get their reps ruined
Young villain hop up on the track then the track doomed
Click-clack-boom, resurrecting boom-bap from the tombs
Raps dope like crack in cocoons
Back in this mood, back on the move
It's the motherfucking real, nigga chill act cool
Pay respect to the cat Drew
And I'm way too blessed to be throwing shots at you

Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era

I'm tryna find my own lane, in this freeway of life
Just remember home boy there ain't no free way to life
My nigga it's gon cost you, try not to lose your soul
To the rims, hoes, and gold
Cause once the devil grab hold, that nigga ain't letting go
And I'm far from religious, I just know right and wrong
I know how to write these songs, I know how to light these bongs
I know how to rip thongs and I'm pretty good at beer pong
Nigga, I'm so crazy, nigga I'm loco
Gassed up like Sunoco, press the pedal through the floor
Bitch we out the door, vroom vroom, skurrt
Bitch love don't live here no more
Cause her weave look faker than her Louie bag
Weak chick I tried to bag, had the nerve to turn me down
Heard this song and turned around, now she want me to unzip her pants
But I'm gone, bitch missed her chance

Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era

I got sick of class, started making classics
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and bust asses
I'm sure to blow like bust acid
Puff, assist like Maravich, a true Maverick
And I average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit bet you still can’t pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescents be addin' rappin' sessions over addin' lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I’m trying to multiply monopolies
Subtract some homies then divide the cheese
Divide legs just to isosceles so my eyes can see through the E
Shit on you hypotheses
Hypocrisy after essence like apostrophes
You can’t stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part the cheese, head out the spot and leave
A pile of G's for apology

Love Is Only a Feeling,UnKnown,2017.0,"Look, I love her curves but what's more preferred
Is the way she articulates words
Can't help observe and stare when she in the mirror
Masking the massacre while she fixing her hair
I mean she’s so perfect in her own little world
We built the foundation, everything I want in a girl
And it's a matter of time until her last name mine
You got potential baby, just imagine us combined
I wanna see you shine like the gem that you are
Want you be so secure that they can see from afar
That you don't need not a man and you can stand on your own
Let's keep stacking your bread and one day, we gon' get gone
And get away from here
You're the only reason I be staying here
Wanna paint a picture, let's make it clear
The future so bright baby, race you there, girl

Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling

Look, girl you talk too much, need to relax
No stress please, just please roll us a fat
Blunt so we can smoke and fill the room with love
You buzz 'cause I'm feelin' the groove with this one
Come take you a sip, let's dance under the moon
The way that it's lit, got me feelin' the mood
To vibe and be tuned, I'm so into you
Let's lose track of the night and stay up 'til it's noon
Watch the sun rise and watch the moon fall
Asleep if you will, surprise when you spawn
Back from the world of infinite beyond
Roll your eyes back and let's keep on goin'
Come take a ride, I'll be your chauffeur
I wanna make you sing to me as your toes curl
I love it when she doing all the things I showed her
I thank the Lord for her, man, I swear I owe her

LEGENDARY,ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$,2017.0,"Yeah, uh
Yeah
Yeah, uh
Yeah

This is legendary
Always been my mission, never secondary
Gettin' better every January, it's very scary
They gon' recognize eventually, I take it if they don't give it to me
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)
By a higher conscious spiritually (up, up)
Up and away, jump on a plane, get on my wave right now
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feelin' so well
A token of how I felt, never heard if it fell
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt
Quality what I sell, quantity in the sales
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells
This life I'm livin' it out, damn right, my vision is now
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out
My brothers at the brick house, the undercovers stakeout
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think I do it for? My brothers under a spell
It's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon

Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

Look, ready for whatever comes
I hope for the best, I taste the peace and pray it never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings done
Perhaps I was foolish, just like the boy that prays to only see the sun
Maybe, life happens like tides
One minute you're low and feelin' shallow, then all of a sudden you rise
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself
Find a way, the weight of my wealth
It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stackin' knowin' that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got like, ""What's missin'?""
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed
Real blessed, life has always got me wonderin'
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doin' it right?
Am I hurtin' myself?
Am I wrongin' the ones that love me the most?
What a burden to have
That ain't no way to live
Or maybe it is
Well, maybe it is

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

This is legendary, it's never secondary
I'm getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary

Uh, just put it in the air
Light that loud and watch disappear here
Thoughts at the speed of light years, I could see the light
Yeah, this the right year made the flow, yeah
Clear and easy to steer in the space and time erasing fine
Amazing in the maze of clichés
Each day weighs out enlightenment
Niggas blacked out 'cause I got ultra violent
Now my wave lengths to the radio waves
Still keep it under pavements but not a ratio change
My patio the same, but I ain't even got to tell them that
Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat
Get high as heavens, hope he'll never come back
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact
The devil jealous in fact, 'cause I rebel the spells
With a letter to God, I swear you know me so well
This one time, I said, ""Lord, would you help?""
Some short time after, see my music on the shelf
And of course, I gotta thank myself
My wealth is in my happiness and mind
And not my pocket health in its ashes
If you don't even think sometimes
If its passion let relationships synchronize
Drowning inside her, true eyes is to the higher
I don't drink too much, I know the bud wiser
It's the livest one, Bedford-Stuyvesant

Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high
Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high

Uh, one hand on the mac, one hand on my sac
I'm thinking to myself, what if I handed it back?
But I gotta hand it to myself, I’m handling rap
Handsome versing that’s like hand-in-hand combat
Rehearsing, I got eight arms, nigga
Disarm your favorite rapper, he won’t come back
Made flex drop eight times, nigga
On contact, rewind that like eight times
Got to keep it G, this for my masons
Figure it out, eight times, the average amount
I may sign which I don’t like lime light but I’ll shine witcha
Bitch, I gotta eat, I might dine witcha
Yeah, I got bars but I’m like Akon witcha
Convict music for real, this industry give me chills
'Cause in the streets I’m chill but still heating up for a mill
I’m like so real, life is so surreal
Sosa really got sealed for the way he revealed
Taking hold of pitchforks still, but I will never yield
In this pitchfork hold thinking I gotta appeal
'Cause I'm thinking like a deal could get me living swell for real
But if I skyfall, thinking ideal

Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high
Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high

Five finger discount weed leaves,
Exceptionally speaking determination
Breeds success and proceeds,
Feds want the photos and IDs
Into them blood like IVs
Cause every youth
Want the newest Nikes
Straight jeans and white tees
But these things will get pricey

To my destiny by the way, yeah

Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

Yeah, so gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood
Spill my heart again, cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circumference
All that’s left now is the radius
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain’t scared of no man, I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son

So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read here lies a G followed by a poem
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong
Went with both shoulders that my head is always on
I charged through harm's way, carry boulders on my arm
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
Rain on my parade, seen the doves cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gates
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2Pacs and the Big L rolled proper
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him
When my time come, but the story just begun

So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)

Let's just go...
My clouds gray, I hope my pain don’t show
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you need but not needed
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking
They too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty as long as Rawle eatin' wit me
Seen different cities, different titties, all with no money with me
I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man
You gon' miss us when we fly man

So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-on-and-on-lyrics
Pennyroyal,1999,2012.0,"Yeah... another love song gone wrong
Should've known you were a woo, like Based God in Wonton
But I didn't, and I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball but I'm still glad I hit it
Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know
, 
the coulda shoulda type
Like ""Oh, it was slight too tight, come on, I would've piped
But our schedules contradicted we're always tied down""
Ay pipe down, the first night ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown and, pulled out the slinky
She screamed ""Joey spank me!"", and after that she even thanked me
Swanky, 
one time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we be kicking rhymes 'til the end of time
But, back to the topic, oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off and wondering why my shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga do miss her lip gloss
Now she sucks the next nigga dick off and my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm 'posed to do?
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent them postcards so you know it's true
I promised that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you front like you don't miss my whole cockpit down yo esophagus?
Screaming ""Daddy, stop it"", ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polishing in the scratches on my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky rolled?
And I tried to suck your titty hole for milk for my Cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came?
I hit that spot twice and since then, you haven't been the same
But now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name but my first impression, ""What a lame""
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with his shoulder stained
Faggot,
 
six months, and I'm still at it
You'll probably never hear this track but I still wrapped it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you would not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and it’s kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back, sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears

Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player

I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I gotta to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye

Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful

Uh, now all heroes don't wear capes
And all villains don’t get away
But all limits eventually fade
I don't wanna be good, nigga, I'm tryna be great
It’s hard when your back's against the wall
And if you got it all to keep your feet up on the floor
So I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'
'Cause to inform the world the very reason I was born
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform
Word is bond, don't be alarmed
Don't let me have to sound the horn, and drop a bomb
Wanna get my mom a crib, with a lawn
Somethin' that my future kids, can run up on
So I always do my best to carry on
Life is like game of chess, don't be a pawn, my nigga

No, it's the young black god livin’ out his dreams
What you mean? I been up on an ultralight beam
They don't wanna see you fly, they just gonna shoot your wings
Everything ain't what it seem
Wishin' all these dirty cops, would come clean
Still swervin’ on these city blocks, for one thing
My man just copped a 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?
Music is a form of expression
I'ma use mine just to teach you a lesson
Rule one: this microphone's a weapon
I'm shootin' out the actions manifested and my passion
Never restin', I'm surpassin' the expectancy
Of life in my direction
Man the section 8 depressin'
Hard to be progressin' through recession and oppression
Not to mention that they had us cell blocked ever since an adolescent

This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?

Daily Routine,1999,2012.0,"From the block to the top, Buddha baggies in the sock
Only thing that changed now is we ain't runnin' out of stock
Used to beg mom dukes for lunch money
Honeys used to run from me when pockets was dust bunnies
Now what's funny is we done came up and conquered
Even the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers
Though them gangstas grill, I tell 'em keep that drama away
Don't fuck with thieves, I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape
They launchin' out strays, I'm tryin' not to get sprayed
Whether a spitter or a quitter behind the trigger, approaching his prey
His eyes bigger, won't stop to consider
What's right or wrong, because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver

But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam
But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam

Traded in my Nikes for a new mic
I guess it's safe to say he sold soul for his new life
Like they were tryna blind us, but we know the true designer
They didn't wanna see us find the diviners
So now we hit the vines up day and night
On the regular, I know my momma prayin' like
She want me reach my aims in life, but just stay in sight
So I'm shootin' for my dreams, hit the booth and it boost my esteem
The Pro Era crew recruitin' in them fiends by the boat load
Nigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal
They don't feel the name but they say the music dope though
Fuck it, that's how it's supposed to go, these bloggers too emotional
They'll be postin' you until labels start interscopin' you
By then, it's wild late and I'll be chillin' where I lay
Cause I'd rather see the top than to be livin' where I lay
Imbalances in my Kundalini, they tryna put two through my beanie
Wish you well, tryin' to poof a genie

But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam

Righteous Minds,1999,2012.0,"Yeah, make sure my shit sound tight

I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
And I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
She said that orphans morph into abortions without precaution
Problem with our people, there's too many wannabe Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
Too many wannabe actors instead of achieving their masters
At least a bachelors but no, too many wannabe rappers, hah
That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
On Jim Crow laws, you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence

It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis

Person mad nervous, you surrender to sterling
Look them in the eye, if looks made you die, you know you merk ‘em
Right there, plus his hide is like, right here
So you know that if you would fight fair then you'd have him like quite scared
But don't forget the TEC held high by your right ear
So listen loud and clear: you don't wanna lose your life, dear
And don’t you show a slight tear or let 'em sight fear
Just let 'em disappear in the night air, yeah, with yo' Nike Airs
Robbed by the crackheads left alone in the apartments
Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and
Daddy been gone said he, took off like ostrich
Since he gain knowledge, I’m keeping it with the synopsis, and
Shit like that make you wish you were adopted
To escape the pain, you join a gang and get intoxicated
Have no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
The only thing is you do it again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis

It's a war out here, mad niggas is dyin'
You don't want that shit to be you, right? (Nah)
I know you gon' hold it down though, you know what I mean?
Just be careful, man, cause niggas out here ain't really worth it
You a ill nigga though, I like ya style, son

Imagine me fed up, a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
Po' never, blow Berettas ‘cause I, know no better
No Era, no STEEZ, no Kirk, no Lee
No school, no OG, no talent, no me
What if I just ain't act right?
What if I pack crack white with my sack tight, join the gat fight?
The click-clack type, slide in the vipe with the black stripe
And give my friends the back knife cause that's life, nigga

It ain't easy livin' life like this

With the fake, look me in the face, eyes of the storm
You don't want none
No beef could never hurt me
I be on my Istanbul, they cold turkey
Firstly, it's the double entendre monster
Takin' haunted constant trips through your conscious
So be cautious
If it call for it, we leavin' corpses
The causes of the coffin is the broken clauses
Skeletons in my closet, tomorrow's never promised
Never mind it because we immortals regardless
Real G's move in silence like my designer
Intertwined with the timeless, divine higher powered
I was drippin' in the gold since a minor
Sittin' on my throne, overlookin' my empire, uh, uh

Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate

Goin' off the knack, dopeboy in the Cadilac
Havin' flashbacks, wish a nigga would clap back
Hit 'em with the blackjack, goin' through a stack fast
I snap with the raps, I make 'em bring the whole track back
Niggas get smacked with the realer
When I drop, it's all killer, no filler
So you better not make a wrong move, nigga
I'll personally deliver each shot that won't miss ya
And when it hit ya, it's no warnin'
We bombardin', me and my squadron
If you want it, get your army
We droppin' bombs calmly

Caution hazardous, inflictin' damages, I can't recall, uh
Rich in spirit when I broke some laws
I'm breakin' even with my Pros against all the odds
Made my words cut deep, you gon' need some gauze
And that alcohol, we only goin' bar for bar

Remember nights on the dirty mattress in the trap house?
I snapped out and flipped it around to where I'm at now
Livin' legend, finally back up on the map now
Resurrection of real, let's bring it back
It ain't even about the bars, they bumpin' whatever slaps now (Uh)

Sick of the trash out, this is the crackdown

I am not the star? In fact I plan it all
Fuck what the media write, bitch this is a fire bar
Please don't leave your comment if you are not up to par
No names, putting you in a verse that's too far
You're mundane can't obtain, the knowledge in my brain
My set told me light you up so this that propane
It's Nathan all I gotta do is just spit a flame
No escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagne
You set yourself up for that one mane. The king of New York?

Heard they was looking for war but ain't declaring me

you more like Prince of Bel-Air
I'm clearing the air, might fire at will
These rap niggas don't want the static for real
Cuz they lines not adjacent to my spectacular skill
If you don't fuck with cinematic stand still
My life's a movie on the real, 
you can get shot with your hands on the wheel
With your pants at ya heels

Used to be the sweetest 'til life handed me the lemons, nigga

The flower of life devoured into ashes

It's another black man, died at the white hand of justice
To tell the truth, man, I'm fuckin' disgusted
I fear for the lives, for my sisters, my brothers
Less fortunate than I, let's formulate a plan
I'm sick of holdin' grudges, I'm loadin' in all my slugs and
Aimin' it at the judges, fuck the cops

The innermost of my spirit been engulfed with plenty gold
'Cause most of them labels throw pennies so
Who you think investin' in penitentiaries though?
Same owners as them labels, same owners of your cable
Spoon feedin' you fables, tryna keep your mind stable
Your eyes blind, and your skin's hazel

That's word to motherland, sold us on stolen land
Visions from brother man, he seen us all holdin' hands
Fifty years later, still see my brothers choked to death
R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect
Nowaday they hangin' us by a different tree
Branches of the government, I can name all three
Judicial, legislative and executive

I wonder if I'll do it all before they take my life, yo
Crucify my image, the Lord is my witness
If them Heaven's gates closed

Don’t Front,1999,2012.0,"Yo, what's the word word?
Pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Had to learn, had to learn (had to learn)
We just had to burn, check

It all started with this special herb, then after that, it came to sexual words
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played Bonnie and I collide with a vibe when I'm inside her walls
I cut my shorties on the side cause I decide that she all
Mine's, I keep her in my eyes at all times
Not because I don't trust her I just, can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes be cussing her
She played the hustler and I'm like mad customers
Man swear I'm in love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up her line, man I swear I'm addicted
But, it's all cool cause when in love, we all fools
They say men lie and women lay naked, that's all foolin'
Numbers don't matter after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at its first sight
If you ask me, another stupid analogy
Made to cover flaws in the female anatomy
[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & 
CJ Fly
]
But I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Don't front, don't front though (don't, don't, don't front)
I got some weed and some fronto
 
(don't front)
And you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Check (don't, don't, don't front)

It's like a massacre when mass occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on lock so I pass the word
I stash the herb, sit back observe
That she make me feel good is all I ask of her
In the clouds, who would've known we would've crash and burn?
I prayed long and hard, hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her, but I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt, we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick her up longing for our lips to touch
But now I rarely even see her
In everybody, hood not even the law enforcement can keep up
She ain't want no one to know, so I kept it on the low
Any time that we would kick it, I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Bagged her at her friends, but home were I would take her
Didn't know that she was a ho, that only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind would just relax
Could've been the hot topic cause I swore we were a match and
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exert the finest smells
You tryna find her then follow her trail
She left a few old lovers inside of a jail, that's all a part of the tale

Ayo, don't tell me be patient with no doctor prescription
Emotionless positions and provocative visions
Should've known you missed a note like the octave was switching
Remember hate the game but she's spotting some glitches
It's a simulation yeah, stimulation
Take off your shirt, let me feel manipulative
My heart like the Himalayas,
 
but yeah, I gotta slay her
I'm crushing on you sweetheart but yeah I'm a player
Sort of like Isaiah so baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So, this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to 
so my nothing is useable

We all try when you go bye, we all high
Truth is I'm never home and I'm cold if that's where the heart lies
So label me as heartless, it's not that I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less, 
gain sanity and lost stress
It put me in a state that just started taking a toll on me
Kept the secrets you told me, keep emotions I would hold beneath
Always kept the L so I know defeat
Said everything will feel much better soon as you know I leave
Not sure if it's the meds that made you think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on, you know I'm cold, ma
I'm in animal pause, but you got an Ark
When it flooded, used to always feel like Noah

And I know I know her, had these kind of skills I had to show her
So I told her I'm the nigga she see on the posters
Came back through and I put it in the holster
Just had to teach her one time
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though (don't front)
And tell your bitch don't front though (don't front)
Don't front (front, front, front, front)

AMERIKKKAN IDOL,ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$,2017.0,"Yeah, uh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Watch me get gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Amerikkkan Idol, one hand on my bible, one hand on my rifle
I'm aimin' at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival
They say it's all about survival, never lackin' the vitals
So I came to kill the game and still gave it revival
I'm coming for the title, man it's best you throw in the towel
Last nigga who tried to vio, now facin' a trial
I'ma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel
Now she all up in denial 'cause she gettin' the dial
While I'm only gettin' better, so she back on my D now
I wanna be down but she denounced
I got my shot, then made her, bounce
Now you tryna rebound, I'm livin' in the now
While the future figure me out
Told mommy pick a place, yo, and we out
'Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now
That's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around
Never thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holdin' it down
Protect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town
And they judgin' just 'cause my skin color is brown
And for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground
And have the nerve to blame it all on my background
Sorry white Amerikkka, but I'm about to black out
Got a message for the world and I won't back out
So turn the kid raps loud, I'm about to spazz out
Watch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House
But I won't stop 'til this whole shit painted in all black
And we on top, 'cause my people been paining before crack
Media's got this whole thing tainted, that's all fact
Feedin' you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs
Assimilate our history then made it a mystery
Now they all inherit the bittersweet victory
Look at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?
Justice never served, reparations never sent to me
It's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the end of me
Assassinate my character, buryin' my entity
But they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done
They forever gon' remember me
The fuck is you tellin' me?
Fuck is you tellin' me?
Way more than a celebrity
And fuck white supremacy, huh

I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me
Well, dead presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me

It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off

This that Bada$$-assination
Topic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation
Been makin' observations like it's my occupation
Debatin' speculation like it ain't just second nature
Thou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you
'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma, time to pay up
Climb the ladder of success, I'm steady on my way though
Devisin' plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke

You leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice
Yeah yeah yeah
I said leave me no choice, about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice

What the government is doin' amongst our people is downright evil
Disturbin', but not surprisin', that's for certain
With all of the conflict of propaganda, I believe they are simply tryna slander
Start a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those alike
They are simply pushin' us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it
They want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails
Alton Sterlings are happenin' every day in this country and around the world
The scary part, boys and girls
Is most of these stories don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness
It is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement
And accomplishment of what we call human rights
It is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell
I just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it
Because this is all part of the government's plan and what they been plottin'
They're literally beggin' for this to happen, so they can kill us off
Usin' uprisin' and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion
The cancerous foods, the chemical warfare, economic sufferin' is not workin' fast enough
There are many steps ahead of us and manifestin' the future that they want
We have to work together, not only rattlin' them on a physical plane
But to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same
As black men, I think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin' us
The people, our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' them brutally
It's time to even the score
'Cause who do we call when the police break the law?
We are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another
But not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other
The code words to killin' a black man by police is, ""He's got a gun""
Damned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs
Or what about them? Them murderers got it
We need solutions, you better start plottin' now
It's always been clear that they don't value our lives
My people been sufferin' way too long
And I'm tired of singin' the same old song
People actin' like this shit isn't happenin', it's downright wrong
Justice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that
What are we to do? We're scattered around
With no clue of this ugly truth
All we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed
Time to wake the fuck up and do our own research
And not form opinions based on just what we've heard
Ameri-K-K-K-a is force feedin' you lies down your throats with a silver spoon
And eventually, we'll all be doomed
Real, real, real soon",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-amerikkkan-idol-lyrics
Right on Time,Summer Knights,2013.0,"My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm

The only lady I can ever match bonds with
On some atomic bond shit, our love is plutonic
But I just can't put my foot on it
My one and my only, we not only lovers but homies
Whenever I'm lonely, right on time she arrives
She know the business for some minutes
I bury that kitty alive, oh no, I'm kidding but I really be in it
And we don't plan on having kiddies
But I really be skinnin', really be raw
They say sex is the weapon, love is really a war
And sometimes I feel threatened 'cause she really know all
My weaknesses, sometimes we fight, won't speak and shit
But we both know what the sequence is
It's like a never-ending cycle, something like your menstrual
The day you put your menopause, I'll pause the instrumentals
That dussace got me in the mental
Me and you until the end of time 'til we no longer existential

Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions

My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
No, one man's clever, one knows no better
I like to go get her to keep her warm in cold weather
She blow below better then she goes for endeavors
Write our names on the clouds in bold letters
If hoes ever touch me, she load Berettas
But trust me, she's lusty, it must be me rubbin' it off on her skin
I can't budge her, a pen? I swear that her love is just a sin
We back at it again, fussin' and fightin', I start cussin', she cryin'
Break up to make up, I start cuttin' then slide it in
Then mix the vibe with some Hen, you got five, I got ten
Now we some trippy niggas as high as a fin
But what's your game, love? Already know it
We some ordinary people but extraordinary poets
Get lost in the Moet when I po' it
Fuck it if we drownin' in pain, 'cause we don't really show it

Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions

Lord Finnesse, Jayo
It's been my jail since a day old, but they know
Yeah this ones for the ladies
Who be tryna have my baby

Ayo, word to my mother, two things I never do
Is leave the crib without some rubbers or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes
Like whoa don't let them trap you on the tight rope
Spike holes in the condom to form a zygote
Overnight, ask Kwon, he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
On the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases
Pipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases
Like get a load of their faces
Face it, if you fear, hate it, you get put into this clear space

I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
They will never catch me slippin'

'Bout to go nuts, niggas get their achoos to these cashews
Who you know that cool that they drip swagu?
And I’m here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga, that’s the second time I passed you
Eating my gas fume, got me thinking like who gassed you
Your girl got gas too, she let me tackle for a dutch and a Snapple
Unless you decide to put on shackles
I’m that dude, fuck values, pump up the volume
All up in the cut, no alcohol, just mad booze
Tryin to find a pad to bring her back to like a tadpole
I'm that folk, got bad chicks that I feel bad for
Bruising to they back bones, lickin' up my cock tip
Down to do it all no matter what the synopsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
They all unconscious, topless, exposing they crotch and shit

I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
They will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'

Wishing we'll fortune but the price ain't quite right
The slice ain't quite ripe
Still pulling strings how I fly but I don't like kites
How they gon' treat Brooklyn's finest not as fine as diamonds?
And fine nice, surrounded by hard flow like Icelands
Now we getting icing, finances nice
And I don't like surprises, I like superb prices rising
It's the least I could do, these verses priceless
Rehearse in private, reverse her eyelid until she curse in silent (insolent)
Got a problem solve it, 
all my Pros solids
We all gon' dine and until then we mobbing
So don't push me, uh, I'm close to the pussy
Even closer to the knowledge, dropped out of college in advance
Then hit the ground running like it's ants in my pants
Honey, Pop was a bumbaclot and had a queen bee Mommy
Uh, I love her to the tissue, disrespect my blood and it's an issue
She like, ""This you on the cover for real? Ah, you so official""
Now go ahead and buy you some shoes that really fit you
I know she always think of little me, but now I got big literally
Worldwide and physically
I'm saying I used to take walks around Little Italy
Now I roam 'round Sicily
 and I'm plotting on a milli

Hmmm, another loud pack,
 another proud cat
Hey, pound that,
 
hip-hop sounds been profound back
Slow down that metronome, nigga
Let it hit home when the specimen showin' gon' glitter
Gold and ices trigger, your true ideology
I can subtract one with the gun, that's true trigonometry
But that won't coincide with the true nigga that I'mma be
He's royal poverty, I kicks philosophies
Not because I rock soccer tees
I ain't gon' beg but I can please
Rock your socks and sockets out your knees
Fulfil your needs with similes non-similar
Spit that unfamiliar, put that on familia
If you love hip-hop, ladies, rub your papillas
And fellas beat they chest like they silverback gorillas
It's the new age, children of the crystal healers
Thinking I butterfly, I try catapult caterpillars

After years of constructing they start assumptions
So I keep my circumference of deep fried friends like dumplings
But fuck that, my nigga, we munching, 
we hungry

Hands are to the ceiling when I'm in the building
How you make a living, hmm?
Lately never chillin', mind is on a million things I gotta do
Ladies want me, when there no time for chillin' no time for you
I've been on a different type of time
I never liked to rest, a different type of grind
I'm on South Beach like Tony Montan'

And I sit back, let your mind run

'Cause I never outrun no bullet from a gun
Don't ask Malcolm, ask how come?
Ask any real nigga really 'bout some
When you in the field, nigga don't play dumb
Better keep your eyes peeled in the rearview
Know a couple niggas in the ville will kill you
Run up in your hands in the wheel and air you out
Never give a fuck, never hear you out

Lift off, said we 'bout to lift off

Hol' up! These rap niggas be actin' up
Talk mad shit, can't back it up
Don't let me catch you lackin'
I pack you inside the Maxima
Mark them days on the calendar
Don't you dare dodge this challenger
Sonics is hedge-hodgin'
Got heads boppin' way out in Africa
Radios be lackin' though
You can't front on talents so
I'ma kill like every show and any foe and any flow
No flex when I be in the zone
Know to watch when I come on
I check-in in the microphone
Collect this check then I'm headin' home
But it ain't always been like this
'Member when we was broke as shit
Savin' L's 'til next week
My ashtray still got a roach in it
I hit it until my finger tips
Get burnt at the filter tip
'Fore I learn to take a risk, I ain't even had a pot to piss in
Listen, I'm twistin' the system
The mission, the recognition
I see the future clearly: my premonitions is scary
Pray that they bury me
Where my soul has been heavenly sent
For the fathers and martyrs of this art that we formin'
We call it hip hop

Death of YOLO,Summer Knights,2013.0,"This the song I wrote if I died;
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like it ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, ‘cause you only live once
‘Cause you only live once
This the song I wrote if I died;
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5

Beating the pussy like it ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, ‘cause you only live once
‘Cause you only live once

White girl wasted, my wife-girl hate it
‘Cause when I’m faded I just wanna
See her naked
Adjust adjacent, like baby let me see your matrix
Kama Sutra, back to basics
Since I was on the go, back to the block
105 on, started bumpin’ Hard Knock
I looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped
Sedan in front swervin’ as the car stopped
In that split second, my foot steppin’ breakin’
I thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it
All it took was patience, and now I’m on the stations
Luckily I made it right before my life was taken
It was too good to be mistaken for happiness and riches
People callin’ my phone, like they happy that we did it
Little did they know I was ‘bout to meet my maker
Till an angel came down and told me that my time was later

This the song I wrote if I died;
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like it ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, ‘cause you only live once
‘Cause you only live once

Riiiiiight, fuck it
Pass the deuce, 'member creepin’ through the 'jects
Had to, stash the deuce in my 40 ‘Low boots
International, my bread is well earned
L's burn, smash hoes in Melboure
Light skinned jawn, look like Chanel Imon
One night, got her hooked, like I’m heroin
Vintage Vanson's  puffin’ on chron
Posted, lookin’ like a slim or Daron
Give me some to a 112 song
Smoke a nigga like a Newport Long
Pass off to my man, be a baton
‘Cause it ain’t no fun if the homies don’t get none
Right, it's like ballin' on a bitty
Bunch of bad bitches from different cities
Illest niggas in New yitty
Kush God, Joey Bada$$, relax and stack the skrilly, DZA

This the song I wrote if I died;
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like it ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, ‘cause you only live once
‘Cause you only live once

Late night cruisin', fusing the green with the cuban
So swift we moving through clouds intruding
Celestial Nubians, known them since
I was a Brand Nubian and they influenced him
And now it’s new beginnin’s, catch me sinnin’ in Sin City
Sittin’ and spinnin’ and spittin’ in ya city
Swimmin’ in ya bitty, put kin in her kitty and breasts
Got protection in the vest, but still penetrate correct
The vets, I got the remedy for these bitches
Inject, enter sex and eject get some intellect
And jet cuz all we do is flex on the weekends
They upset cause I learned how to flex on the weakest
End of my strength they drenched in they trenches
The fence in my terrace is gold, leave ya defenseless in the cold
And I know all you nigga’s weaknesses
Through my threshold, sight on some instinctive shit

This the song I wrote if I died;
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5

It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds is they limits 'cause we in 'em
Eyes low, squinted, more L's but we winning
Acting like it's hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens
Remember those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends, and it's only the beginning
Big pimpin', fooling dimes, rob 'em for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's,
 flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child but they treat him like a bigger man
'Cause when the pen in his hand, they big 'em up like he Jigga man
Know you see him in the mirror fam
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan like, ""Nigga, damn""
Before he got popular, he been the man
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram
Got a whiff of grands, now everybody say they distant fam
Know the haters still jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam
It's the fuckin' jam

Get lifted like a saint off the kush, man all my niggas push
So I always got the zipstock in the Ziplock
Stay lo, like Ralph lip stock, hit the Mary, won't kiss and tell
My lips locked but my grip's not so I pass it off
Real burners, and we ashing off your furniture
Fuck your couch, bitch, hush your mouth
She said she fell in one of them Ls, but lust don't count
These chickens don't love me, they love the account
But they will never know what's the amount, I keep the hoes in check
'Til they bounce, don't ever let a chick see you withdrawn
These niggas want to know what I draw with
But won't respond to what I've drawn
Tetrahedrons, take a dose of Patron
With knowledge juice and deuce Cubes of Metatron
They wouldn't hear the tone through a megaphone, let alone
Cella phone, but my line stay hella blown
Hella blown, hella blown

Yo Houston, we got a problem, copy
Four, five hotties in the lobby
Said that they can blow the rockets properly, but blow up spots and never stop
Like them aki's, they never get aqui to my property
Known around my city like George Pataki
Young Jason for them dollars in the mix like teriyaki
And round four, I force my large Versace
Over my big head, cause I don't live here, she getting too cocky
Won't spot me in no closet
I ain't like Kels and them
Her closet full of arm limbs and a skeleton

I spray nines on foes, bet if you pick five emcees
Seven, ain't gone flow like me, nigga I'm two-six
I mean too sick, sent to Earth just to shit
Mami, come steer, some new stick, got a man?, I don't give two shits
Better tell that doofus deuces before he catch a whipping
Hit him in his Charles Dickens and strip him for his Scottie Pippens
Cause it's all about the big pimping
Rob him for his Nixon, and then question him about his timing
Right here, it gets reckless, best advice is
To tuck your necklace, and put your arms right back into your Lexus
Cause G-Stone Crips, they ain't nothing
To flex with, and billy gang Pyru, they really on some next shit
So if I were you I would probably ride with two
No fool, not two dudes, two tools
As in deuce-deuce cause niggas jack you for your soul
And your new shoes and your jewels too
There's something about another nigga having shit
That have a nigga spazzing clips all up in your back and dip
Cause it's all about bagging the baddest chick
Stacking them chicks up in Saks Fifth

Yeah I hear you bro, I hear you
You got a minute?
Yeah I got a quick sec
Alright I want you to hear somethin'
I'mma play somethin' for you alright?
Alright, alright
Yo yo you hear it bro?
Yeah

Yeah
Alright listen, listen
Let me tell you what shit is like right now y'all

What's life like now, tryna figure out
They put this mic on trial cause he be killin' now
Forever bitin' my forbidden style
Been laying low for a minute in the game
Since I came all these niggas lookin' timid
My light could never dimith, the Lord is my shepherd
Jesus woke a devil in him since sinnin' with least effort
Thinking back to those lefferts days
And I ain't been the same since I left 6th grade
My mind strayed, used to have the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park, I used to tell her
I'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fella
Play the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell us
Let's just pray it ain't the villain
Till then I be feeling some way
Thinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun play
Instead I let the words play with 90 beats a minute
Bet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finish
But life goes on, basic rules still apply
Bet you can feel that line in any hood you live by
From Flatbush to Figg side, I was a schoolboy too
Hoppin' trains, I just missed my Q

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know
And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know

And what's life like now, I can't figure out
They put my mans on trial, say he a killer now
Conspiracies, we gon' get you out
Just keep ya head up G, shit is wild
It's bugged out cause I know you tryna see your child
But I'mma hold you down still cause you my brother
I just gave Will a lil' somethin' for your baby mother
But don't stress, know you caught up in some b.s
Bet next time you see us, we gonna be our best
Love you my nigga, word is bond, you'll stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
Peace to all my brothers who keep still holdin' on
Been away so long, feel like a tickin' time bomb
The misjudgment of my kind, whom the odds is against
Put our backs on the fence, so we self defence
Followed by a series of unfortunate events
Looking like white America got a brother again

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know
And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know

Take shots to the face with no peace of mind
Give me my piece of mind
Take shots to the face with no peace of mind
Give me my piece of mind
This life is all we know, this life is all we know

Man that's crazy yo, that's amazing B
Thank you bro
Word bro

Good lookin' bro, good lookin' man. That just boosted my adrenaline. It's been ages, I gotta get out this joint b. I love y'all man, real bro, for real man.

Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead

And I guess we them little black beetles
This won’t attract the singles
And that flow is mean, but it lacks tacs and needles
I spend my days sharpening my skill wills while it's still legal
Reading through cathedrals applied to my cerebral
They ain't built they feeble, driven by the ego
The vision of a eagle, see the vision in my people
How many lives will they take today? We ain't equal
Another world war sequel and doomsday prequel
This ain't the world we thought it was when we was in pre-school
Sometimes it's hard to be cool, sometimes I feel like I'm see-thru
Sometimes I really wish, yo I wish that I could be you
Away from all the Hollywood acts and record contracts
I won't say I take it back, because I worked hard for that
But this life ain't turn out to be what it seem
Ever since I woke up I been living in a dream
Got me

Spit art,
 
at heart young Marcus Garvey
Ponders on it, hardly, rap wonders fondly
Smoking  herb with just Marley and me
This one is for my dogs barking up on the tree
Sometimes that wind blows eventually she gon leave
That's mother nature for ya, uh
Patient and sagacious
I ain't gon pay shit watch she ain't gon say shit
Now that's respectable cause most women expect the dough
Accept it though, words of the wise through them rhythm-wrecking professional, exceptional
Half man, half extraterrestrial
They got me

Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
They got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me

I see vividly, hysteria
Cause misery on the interior
As shit get more scarier, I'm never in fear
Just a little inferior in some areas
But I share, wisdom with Sumerians
Somewhere we in the place
Peace means harmony, not war and armory
But fuck that, cock your gun back
This survival of the fittest
Some cats get boxed in where they litter
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in the trap
Get smoked out and I ain't talkin' bout what you toke out
You choked out for really thinkin' that this shit is a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't actin' on the scene, niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well-schemed
I'm tryna' have wealth for my well-being
By eighteen, pockets healthy green
What the fuck is twelve beans?
I need the cake and cream
The stakes is high like feens off a dream jet streaming
Having cuisines with the best seasonings
Its the vets season
Carry a vest, you know the reason
I'm in Chi-raq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
The chicken strip teasers
Thighs, legs and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I ain't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm Sparrow

They ain't tryna' see me in the battle
The lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga,  let alone the cattle
They just wanna ride the saddle; so sad though

Overdose on high fructose, royal toast till I’m overthrown

Low but keep them L's high, legends live long
And we gon' be forever, this for the Era
They tried to tell us we too deep in the flow
The mo' the better, the mo' clever, et cetera, whatever
Why do they sweat us?
Dead us, they just met us, but they won't forget us
They don't know better than the worst case
I be headed for first place
Purchase they position cause they worship our position
But I too had no pot to piss in, and so spot on in this instant
And they still ain't got my decision, I won't stand under no man
Except my high supplier, he got the fire, I got the lighter

Dodging cops, cuz’ 50 be the 666 and I need a fix of that purple rain:
The type of shit that drives membranes insane
Oh yeah, I’m in the fast lane snorting candy yams
That free my body and soul and send me like Shazaam
Never question who I am, God knows, and I know God personally
In fact he lets me call him “me”

When did rap turn into a fashion show?
Too many makeup artists won't let their passion show
The anti-social mogul, havin' 20/20 visions
In needa bifocals, for your eyes dilated ojos
Open wide, never did I owe hoes
Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes
Hit my main bitch in the Poconos
I'm not Pinocchio, I never lied, I poke her nose
With the dopest dope, 
brand new Pablo, brand new God flow
It feel like, Escobar and Apollo
Swank apparel, I put a pic on the site ‘ya megabytes
Y'all niggas ticking me off like headlights
Get your head right, it all falls down

Is what get fake MC's infront of loose triggers
Can't knock the hustle though, I may just bust a jigga

Mo money mo problems as you get notorious, inglorious, until you're a big Victorious,
 no show
Only way you get to see the kid is through a photo
Or  branded up logos,
 and the females come out at night
And when they find the pot a gold they strike, seducing me?
Wait y-y-yeah, you nice on the mic, yeah yeah, you lookin' right
Yeah, you just my type, yo

Her friend split and dipped, damn I should've seen this
I'm in a boobie trap and thats some clever ass cleavage
Well, I think with my dick, I know you want to blow my mind for that reason
She said ""You got clever speaking""
And after I'm done, I still got it leaking
I dipped off ‘cause knowledge a nigga is still seekin'
What you lookin' at son? I might rob you blind
Defined by every line, niggas tryin' to outshine
We’re both number one enemies

I never lack potential, every track is essential
Every project is special, abundant and fundamental

Writing everything I thought
Started openin' my mind, then I send it abroad

Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healin' component
Said you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won’t you come and smell the hot coffee?
Stick your nose in the wrong places, one day you’ll OD
I swear the whole world owe me
I'm nothin’ close to the old me
If you never knew me, then it's too late to be homies
Homie, say fuck what you told me
I'm ridin' out by my lonely
Waitin’ for the day the big homie take these chains off me

I came from
A dream
That the black man dreamed... long ago
I'm actually a present sent to you
By your ancestors",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-good-morning-amerikkka-lyrics
Y U DON’T LOVE ME? (MISS AMERIKKKA),ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$,2017.0,"Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Ayy
Oh, oh

Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, ""Namaste,"" and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins
This what tough love feels like, feel my pain, uh

Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police,
 
praying they don't ever catch it on me

Sweet Dreams,Summer Knights,2013.0,"First I wake up, wake up, thinking of a plan to get my cake up, cake up
Cause I can't pay the rent with school papers
I need two acres and more
I know how it feel walking out the door pockets out of dough
Out it doe, be on the flow
We smoking indo, but we out though, adios
My audio getting me that Audi dough or the range rov
Mahogany colored clothing, my hog in the road
Drive slow, cruising down memory lane before I hit the streets
Have my melody playing
, creators choose flight with my melancholy saying
Head between clouds,
 
I think I'm married to Jane
I remember the days when I'd forever complain
That's way before they started paying, I was in pain
Sick in the brain like I never met a physicist yet
Only lyricist on my metaphysics intellect

Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah

Round two bout, half of this loud through
Don't let them hounds snoop and get soundproofed
High frequency sounds too
Has statik spot over serious statik shots
Scrap vinyls over them statik pops
Im a fanatic fly but a sporadic guy
Never chat a lot, just pass the Lye and guide the youth
Stand with the truth, Nigga nothin' less
When the playbutton pressed
Killswitches feel it hit ya chest
And meet your death,
 if im caught on the fence know hell hit ya
Yes true vets keeps it real whichya
Ill wit ya, show you the real picture
Only keep the ones around that suffer for meals whichya
Cuz when them suckas, see ya supper
And your cake getting richer and your pockets getting thicker
Thats when they want you to remember a nigga
But when I handed you the tape you couldn't remember to listen

Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah

Been on my grind, I keep it 50-50
Thats 100 on the real, no balance scales, still trippy
Where I live it's either you know talents well and sell records
Or no talent, well we still sell for the record
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game
In fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack caine
And if you listening then you a fiend
Our music is the cure like some vaccines
Exotic to the core so stop asking
Got the blueprints to the game, but I read it as king
There's 47 ways to get this green
One is being an enslaved being, the other dreams
Red pill or blue bean, I can't sit still I'm too lean, nigga
Brush my bill on on new beams
Niggas on my tail now that I blew green

Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah

Sweet dreams stuck in the 90's nigga
Stuck in the 90's nigga
We just some stuck in the 90's niggas",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-sweet-dreams-lyrics
Sorry Bonita,Summer Knights,2013.0,"You on that third eye shit, Huh?

It’s all illusions, fixed gear cruising
Fixed reality shrouded from governmental pollution
I ain’t a saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it
It’s the era of indigo and they go with the preaching
I ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish
Cause I notice I’m slowly becoming way more imbalanced
A king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice
Solid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon
Has told many tales, his flows you could sells
Mastering wind elements, I move with the gales

‘Cause I’m a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable
I’m boxing yo dorm, put my Nikes on the coffee table
My tongue’s below her navel, she makes it wet, her skills are naval
Seals my hands on her extremities, we’re chopping up these remedies
Came in between her and I
We leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?
I think not cause all I do is smoke pot
And make beats, and yo ass just want back shots

Smoker’s club, Michael Jordan how I’m killing 4 quarters
You stashing the trash, hoarder
Yo girl starting to bath water, it’s Dirty
And that’s not an introduction, it’s nutching
Dirt on my shoulders, like Hova
My niggas turn boulders soft, that’s the shit that me and jovid saw uh
And now its like Pro Era in stores
All my niggas opening doors
All my bitches is braless, flawless more or less
Balance was the key, more action less speaking
Everybody wants a piece
Peace
Check
(Peace)
Yo

When I release the flows I goes over yo dome far
The nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars
I shine further, you sons get in the bogart
You gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point, God
Better with the regis my mind, they manifesting
Beast coast, yea we the pros, you don’t wanna mess with
We leave you breathless, don’t second guess the best who blessed it
Less than yo adolescence when I speak my progression
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

This is what I asked for, asked for
Chilling at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts
Confuse my intelligence, maybe I’m irrelevant
So eloquent, being riders with a elephant
The higher rank tryna pull a trump card
When I try and do the things, I deserve all respect
Intricit my amount, boy to any amount
To any account, probably I gets em out uh
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I must admit, I must admit

The mental state with a nigga that was penciled for great
Following schedules, never scheduled for break
But still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace
Regular days went to getting paid regular
Respecting the Era where the Era’s been ascending up
Got all types of fans that’s always sending us love
And ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove
And stayed deeper but still heading above
‘Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above
Regular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height
Cause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights
Came with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

Looking for who’s in charge, don’t be shocked, I’m the plug
Get inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant
Energy – I put all in
I’m learning the flaw things
In the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up
I know how to conduct, feelings electric
Well we’re connected, your buttons are pressing
Can test the reception, I sent you a message
Let me know if you get this, the question

Seen it all in the retrospect, took retro steps
Like it’s ’93 still, got ’93 til mic skills
Even got the ecko check
Like for real there no testing, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions
My professions are not no seconds
To no veterans and they minutes of fame
I’m a menace, insane, minus the brain as I diminish the flame
Make it rain, champagne, 'til it falls down the drain
Got my head up in my dreams
Everything ain't what it be seemin'
Don’t blame me girl, blame my semen
You got good jeans so your inseams made seamless
And off top, you’re ingenious
We took a hit of of the greenest
Now she at most fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us
Break her body down to the genus if she leaving
She didn’t get the pic and now I see Sophia
She get the tone, sorry Bonita but
Sophia got a applebum
Sophia got a applebum
I’m thinking I should take it home
What you saying?

Who do you think Bonita Applebum is?
I think Bonita Applebum is...
Hold on before you even talk, you ever been with a Bada$$ nigga?
Don't answer that, don't answer that
Bonita Applebum, has got it going on",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-sorry-bonita-lyrics
Reign,Summer Knights,2013.0,"When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do
When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do

Adapted to these new ways of living, getting money and sinning
Go together like denims diamonds and women
Tryna balance it at once but keep hitting these blunts
Demons of lust, keep hinting they stunts when I'm drunk
What if I jumped off this cloud full of thinking aloud
Into a, pool of my sorrow and start sinking in doubt
Rethinking it out, cause tomorrow ain't ever promising
And ever blink it counts for a prophet who see deposits
But he ain't always see the positives
He used to live in poverty, Thinking probably
One day, he strike the lottery
Cause dreaming big never been odd to me
And since a kid Ive been on a musical odyssey
I knew the day would come where I wouldn't be sorry in a pile of G's
Or probably be rehearsing a verse on the beach
Wait reverse in the speech
Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do

I turn my dreams to reality
So, I burn green same time I burn calories though
I'm eating now in fact, I'm feasting now
No more mistreating, my miss is treated now
No more misleading mister leader now
Mister visa now, I got green and cards with no limits
Bad boy life but shyne with no diddy
But it's no biggie, I spread love the Brooklyn way
But when push come to shove I'm bout that Crooklyn wave
Shook for days, 
Don't ever judge a book by a page
That could be a cover up if you ain't looking that way
But what can I say, everything happens for a reason
Time will tell cause even fall lasts for a season
So keep on believing, you live and learn die and you teach
Another, piece of the pie and it's finally sweet
But reverse on the speech, cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do

Said we done came a long way 365 bong rips later
Last year I ain't make no paper
All I earned was some kicks some snares from some haters
And some favors from some chicks that move there rumps like shakers
But what's that shit, I was tryna be the greatest
Upgrade to the grade A list, but all they do is degrade us
And it ain't to hard to be famous, Whats hard is sustaining
Remaining the same when stuff changing
Cause I remember days at the bus station, waiting
Still had no patience, so niggas try to play him
Imaginary players, Imaginary playlist
I been your favorite before you even started playing it
Who’d of thought the day would come I wouldn’t be sorry
In a pile of g's, and rehearse a verse on the beach
But reverse on the speech
Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now

Like, ""Oh, he's broke! I told you he was broke!""
Word. 
""I told you he ain't got no money!"" or, you know, this and that, or whatever, whatever, then you'll see some other people, you'll put that you're here in this house: ""Oh, Joey done made it! He bought a crib! He this, he that.""
Word, haha. 
So it's all a story, it's a perception that people make for you, along the way. So it's not really what it necessarily is at any point in given—in time, and that's the thing that concerns me. 
Break it down
We break it down like (break it down)
Joey Bad', he break it down like
My nigga Fly, he break it down like

Alright, alright, alright, alright, uhh

First things first is I been rehearsing these verses
In hopes that I hit the surface and keep myself afloat
But I know one day I'm earning me some platinum and some gold
And all them labels could just reimburse this dick in they throat
And tell my mama ""Oh no,"" your purses will never run low
No more cause back when I was four, and we was poor
You would purchase the store
So here I go, your little man has got to grow
I'm walking out the door
My mama just be smiling cause she know
I got my back, ain't gotta worry
Only thing she ask is that I hurry
Home in time for Christmas for some dinner (some dinner)
""Seen you on TV again, boy, you lookin' thinner
But you lookin' like a winner"", aye

You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
Then you give back, then you, then you give back

Worst thing worse, I could've been stealing your purse
Or just been, putting in work and leaving niggas in the dirt
But ever since birth I knew I would be something on this Earth
So now I spit that dope, that shit be hittin' ya nerve
And to my papa, my word is my bond
When you held me in your arms
Did you know along that a star was born?
Then you named me Jo-Vaughn, now that name ring alarms
Nearly 20 years later, we on a plane to The Palms
I gotcha back, ain't gotta worry (worry worry worry)
Only thing I ask is for some curry (curry c-c-curry)
Chicken when we land we eatin' dinner
Mama seen me on TV again, lookin' thinner
But I'm lookin' like a winner, aye

You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
Then you give back, then you, then you give back

I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

What’s the word word word

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

I could never forget them gloomy days
Although I regret where my time was placed
If I could go back, some things would be changed
And I would know that, for a fact, it was fame
That drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain
That withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains
Although I'm gaining ends now, I'm losing friends
They say that time is money, and my time is well spent
Girlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?
And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent
I got to make this album, and hold it down for my camp
Surrounded us all like bonfire
When I lay a verse down that's more fire, I was born fire, uhh

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah

Went outside this morning, morning, uh
Seen the sky was falling, falling, yeah
Old man no longer snoring, snoring, ah
The rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uh
What's heaven's capitol like, like, li-like?
Maybe I can crash tonight, night, night
Cause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, hole
God, please answer your cell, cell, phone
I'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonight
Outside my comfort zone tonight
My brain's blown out my dome tonight
Tonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fight
Don't you trying looking for light
Cause I'm bout to take that flight

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away

Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

Indigo father, meant to go farther
And travel across the water and pocket a million dollars
I am the spirit, I am the guava
You sippin' out of your coconut beverage in the Bahamas
Pardon me mother, pardon me father
I'm glad that you split apart it was part of my firestarter
Along with niggas, bitches, and ballers
And people that look down on me like they so taller
I go harder, I grow smarter
The flow's water, 
like Osama
Oughta gropple every dollar, every single piece of change
Move into the woods so I'll never ever change
Lose a couple friends but I'll never ever change
I probably miss some money but I never ever change
And they can say whatever but I never ever change
I feel I understood why the stars went insane
Ummmm brain battered from scattering every Saturday
Pitter patter with people that really matter
And I'mma fuck up regardless cause I'm a kid right?
That's why you can't spell summer without trouble
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no double
Love without hate, life without pain
This without that, choice without thought
A dog with no day, a Seattle without rain

If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday
With me, one day, one day now
One day now, one day, one day
If it rains in Seattle

Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga

Beware
For like the 147th take

Cause when I hit it, that pussy closed for sure
Like she rock that V card again
She said “Joey no, don’t ever hit me hard again""
It’s funny cause I recall, hitting the score
Play calling, told her hit the floor and she started dribbling balls
My game foreign, way outta line, shit make you forfeit
The score like four-zip flow like faucets
Grip up on that pussy like a forcep
Aight, I done lost it
So make ya decisions, I’m seeing my visions of double women
But I play my position, in the cut like incisions
This is why I’m not hot, I’m sizzling
And it’s drizzling hoes, flows, and dough, so
Foes gonna oppose, roll stupid O’s
You get worn out in these clothes, plus groupie hoes
Love the niño sucio lingo
They be like “You rap? Oh bingo”
I be like “No Inglo”
I only know the language of DeNiro, I never lie
They never seen a Black boy fly as high past the slash in the sky
Got a gash in my eye, bleeding out
Cause, when it was seeing out, was worth more than the amount
Of all of the accounts, in this world I proceed to count
But it’s just mine and
I can’t find no adjustment time sweet pumpkin pie
So just get in sumchin fly
And you gon’ be my sumchin for the night
I’m in town for the day, I say it’s only right, she was a fan so
She left her man right where he stand yo had mad plans for joe
I demanded a blow, whether her name be Wendy or she shy
I just want a little Becky this is not a lie

Wendy N Becky, Wendy N Becky
You so sexy but you can’t apex me
After you done licked my testes, don’t try to peck me
Please respect me, don’t test me
Wendy N Becky, Wendy N Becky
You so sexy but you can’t apex me
After you done licked my testes, don’t try to peck me
Please respect me, don’t test me

We used to smoke nickels inside of Nichols Park
I paid the piper, the pickle she used to pick apart
Peppermint sticks in her middle, brittle, a little hard
Cringe when she grin like the Grinch, that bitch had a little heart
Neck covered in diamonds and hickies
Every time I fly in her city, she buying a titty
Or selling a kidney, or trying to get me
To believe she’s having a kid and that the kid has a mustache and raps pretty
Emoji right back like damn she funny
Thanking God for the shows, that’s that plan B money
Thinking God my moms can’t be grandmummy
Thanking God he ain’t never make a plan B for me
Choke holdin my wine glass, rock bottomin' out
Rock, paper, switchblade, rap got him a house
Pops got him a car, bops got him a couch
Girl got him arrested, girl got him up out

Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself

You feel me, and you gon' be good
Like I can't, cause you my friend and I can't protect niggas""
Like all I can tell niggas is sit n' pray and that's it
But niggas be taking their life for granted like
You know being on some wild cowboy shit, you can't
You got beef with some nigga like, don't be in their vicinity my nigga…
I feel it
Soul music

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Tell me what the fuck an angel does
We're seeing kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high off angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles
There ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Looking where they car be at
And they party at
Cardiac arrest can feel risky
Real pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah
Cats used to yawn on his rap now look at 'em
Shit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking 'em
Pull up with your pen up
, looking sharper than a bulletin
With pin stripes 
and hollow tip bullets in it
He's something that you'd invest in
Catch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'
Pop up 
and poop out something like intestine
No corrections cause the mic been checked in
The only time he be asking is when he sexing
My team like teenage mutants and X-men
Fire spark when I step in
He the human torch
Inhaling fumes of all sorts of course
Steez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts
So when we stop by the D we never get caught
I say it again we face L's but never lost
Either be a warlord for 6 fees short
Each day in this living hell feel remorse
But he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Yo, I'm trying to Oprah win-win with a ""L"" in my hand
Remotely passed off like the generous man
And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
But don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit, damn
Sometimes I just sit and pray
They couldn't walk this way in my J's
It wouldn't feel despair, but disarray
Like their souls disappear
Son got hot flows, got dropped like disarray
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed
Covered with Ray-Bans, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!
Even through shades of black
I see brighter days looking back in fact
So I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find
A gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind
Cause sometimes

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Right on the block where they sit and play
Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
Vicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday
It's nothing but the history
Protecting ya' from being history
And then the next day your face is just a mystery
For niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies
Even the lightest hours requires heavy artillery
Accelerate without the breaks of a break
And still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate
All in a day's work of God and his grace
You wanna eat then tell God and say grace
And avoid the heat getting the boil to surface
A soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface
But the ill-minded child, is ill minded child
Got a round of styles
Killing niggas' mental like a round of shells
Very well rounded, round it 
well 'til the highest number
Praying that 2047 ain't the highest number

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Get off my cheeks let me do my thing
Interrupt the wave length
Live and let live
And people talk smart got the balls to say
They apex and standing for this way
But got nothing to show or give
I ain't judging",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-sit-n-prey-lyrics
47 Goonz,Summer Knights,2013.0,"Yo, Badass don't act or pretend, back at it again
Hit it from the back, she a addict within
I got her on some shit like ""I'm a get tatted for him""
She a ride or die, slim, when she in the denims
Remember it like it was yesterday
Another case of ""I fucked your bitch, nigga"" but a more clever way
Quarter in the room to elevate,
 said if you ever may
Slip then hit her on the hip where the Beretta stay
Catch me somersaulting my eyelids
Awakened from a dream, just perceived how I live
So it's make believe, rather unique
Lavish, sweet all live in a rapper physique
Hit up a show then after retreat back to the telly with freaks
Pack up a bowl and we ain't even eat
But we got a appetite for cookie creases and treats
And they all got tricks up they sleeve

I'm ashing on the bridge, Mary Jane, fuck your cigarettes
I'm laughing out loud, ask me if I'm still stressed, possessed
Hope the boys in blue don't arrest yours truly
Respect but suspect, protect your neck jewelry
47s and Uzis, well-connected and recruiting
I be with my Mexicans, I know they got the toolie
I'm smoking doobies with like 20 of my goons
Hotbox the whip and let smoke fill the room
Even through my lenses, my sense is on the moon
Dirty be the name and I came from the black lagoon
I'm sick with the ink like infected tattoos
Just one love but the two-three's branded on my shoes
You would think I had a eighth the way I'm crushing them grapes
Had her whining for a taste, that's why she's up in my face
Them Apex taking over like we running with Apes
What's the verdict? Nothing but a fucking disgrace, nigga

This ain't quiddtch but you know the snitch get caught
Then get bitched like the bitch she brought, throw your fit then walk
When they clip all of your Christmas thoughts
There's no giving when they take what you got
Placed in the crop circle, doc with a smock, see
Art what we drop, shopping cart with Da Vinci
Whimpering, leave that risk to your Pros
Wrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke
I'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake
Get me mad and I contemplate irrational mode
Don't think about nada, strung you by your collar
The flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper
I'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef
But toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala
There's arrogant cops who stay intruding
Can't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution
Them wack rappers who track-eluding
Critic is a random student who use the Era as a new rap influence
Faster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid
I still kill and you can't lose it",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-47-goonz-lyrics

Man, I've been heatin' up, my self esteem been on the moon
The flow is hotter than volcanic craters near the equator
Any debaters is simply haters, they know that I'm greater
I be countin' my paper, forever fuck all the majors
Did it all on my own, don't owe nobody no favors
It's clear, I'm heir to the throne, I've been the best in my zone
Internationally known, forever Brooklyn's own

I think I might blow a whole pound tonight
So shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alright
Then you know I'm in the house, let a nigga run his mouth
It's going down on sight
I'm always down to fight, ain't duff a nigga in the while
No bluff, ain't no church when you're living in the wild
I was hidden in the crowd, rippin' on some loud
'Til I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style
Wow, must've been the material linen
Whole night kept him in my peripheral vision
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him
Word to my pops, I know niggas known for serial killin'
But back to the women, they tryna catch me slippin'
So I gotta pack a mags to stop venereal venoms
From entering my system
If it ain't my moms or my 'sis then, I cut'em in the system

Super bad chicks and they all up in my kryptonite
'Bout to get down, I'm tryna get up in the tight
So roll the indo right and I can show you what them bitches like
They just wanna come and have fun
Told this little hun she could come but don't touch my funds
I might get crazy, I might bust a gun
So just give me some more and I might bust her son
Might bust and run, they said love will come knockin' at my door
Well I guess lust must've wrung
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on, had her beggin' for the dawn
'Til the crack of dawn then I passed it off to Kwon
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank
Cause some pull hoes like how dreamers pudo
Hold up, let me pull ove', told her to hop in then put it back and drove
And hit it out-park like Al Pujols

So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)

Slangs to get her wet
And I heard you're overflowing, I could test the waters like sea man
And I heard you like semen, see man
Well let me slide through, I know you're feelin' the kid
Cause these nonchalant lines is lettin' me in
Cause on contrast, I could see us lovebirds, it's in plain sight
And am I right cause I heard you like the international lovin'?
On a higher scale, when I mean scale, I do it well
Let me go deeper, feel like I'm doing it well
Word on the street you acting like a bastard, can I be you daddy?
You can hop up in my caddy, and I heard you got the fatty
Yeah cellurite
Just remember it's amazing how I come up on the track
So duck and weave, and please believe my side effect is shakin' knees

It's only one way this can 
work out
Drop down, I'mma give you twenty

You scurred now, 
call me the drill sergeant
Charge in the apartment like a charger compartment
I'm in the walls now, I'm wired up

Smoking on land, lord I light it up
Just gettin fired up, now she coming like a fire truck
She threw the towel in, score for me oh for she
Cause she keep howlin' we
 
showdown like Shaolin
Slow down for an hour then, sink it deep into the shallow end
How you like beef girl? Keep swallowing your food
I'm following your mood and it's blue and me too
But I can't lie like I blew this green on you
I blew it on the purple fume and I know I read your mind, right
You're bright, you want green of all types like limelight
Balance is the kiwi fused in the tunes
Third eye sight
, 
she rodent the car with three blind mice
They chase cheese and don't think twice
And for that, some niggas in the cut get sliced
She looking back
Now, cause she ain't met a nigga as real in the back
Down as shack she throw it back for that, willingly
She hope I catch children
But the mag sheilding, in other words I wrap feelings

Yeah Joey that cat killin', villain
I capture the cat in the trap, a door she sealing
From sicilians to Miss Millins, to miss missin'
That cat killin', villain
I capture the cat in the trap, a door she sealing
From sicilians to Miss Millins, to miss missin'

Reportin' live from a lyrical high
One time

Yo, with not a damn thing on my mind but this rhyme
And a matter of time to make this whole shit align
Like I planned out, nothing in life gets handout
Just stand out, ever since I hit the pot my vision panned out
Pressure boil 'til I'm fanned out, now we the popular band
So they can't keep their hands off of the man now
Invite 'em in, give 'em that S vitamin, baby Cham style
Got some Trini girl to soak it up, ShamWow!
Damn, child, you're killin 'em
Fillin' 'em, drillin' 'em with serums of pure noradrenaline
High blood feelin' like the thermostat cracked, left mercury spillin'
Your favorite rapper tryna earn stacks from nursery children
True emcees write a verse and rehearse it a million times
Just for the rebirth of a feelin' prime and golden
Shawty ask what I'm holdin', teasin' 'em
Know when the magnum blast eye squeeze magnesium
Used to be mad premature, now I'm mad premium
From lookin' up to niggas, to lookin' up niggas
Meetin' 'em, meetings with 'em
Give 'em a high pitch like curveballs and helium
Young scorcher trying to evolve like Charmeleon
Million, yeah, nigga, we tryna get a million

Got the bomb nigga, Baghdad
I'm blown away from a bad pass
Walk on grass, below skunk, I smell sole funk in the stash
My SB's, antimony I never had
I was more arsenic, vaporize when I got heated
Never jealous, solid as a rock n' roll fo' planes
No propellers, just some Pro fellas, who you know better?
Never lost my groove, I don't know no Stella
It's a cold world without Coachella
A shady bunch, like under Interscope umbrella
But that don't phase me once, people say I'm crazy
But call me young Evel 'cause I crazy stunt
Amaze these punks, drop swank like it's knowledge to ya
Mr. Bada$$ is ya scholar's tutors
Swank the lord and hallelujah
Still praying to the Allahs, Gods and Judahs

Left LAX with a bag of the THC, straight reekin'
Nowadays I bounce back and forth each weekend
Shorter days, longer nights from my lack of sleepin'
Thinkin' when this bi-coastal life is just dreams and
Now a nigga headed West, the cold seasons
Wrist below freezin', chicks is strip teasin'
They only suck a nigga when a nigga succeedin'
If she a go-getter then she never will achieve 'em
Best believe, cause all I do is fuckin' lead 'em
Off in the right direction, teach her many lessons
Reduce the stress and balance out the imperfections
Honeys falling in my lap like many blessings
Every night 'fore I take the chance, I ask questions
Somethin' like, ""Can you meet me at the Westin?
And after I fuck you, girl can I fuck your best friend?""
Fuck it, I'm just shootin' all my shots now
Hard to be humble, when you ridin' with your top down
Picture me rollin' up in my SL500 Benz
Mami sip on the potion while her hair blowin' in the wind

Chick in my passenger seat, lookin' like she came out the pageant
And she down for anything that I ask or imagine
So I hit the corner store and copped a pack of the Magnums, shit
Cause I ain't playin' no games
Lil R&B chick and I ain't sayin' no names
Let her rock the mic and give a nigga soul brain
By the time this shit drops, she'll prolly be my old thang

Enjoy the ride I'll be your pilot
You gotta glide it
Close your eyes, come fly

Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance
I'mma teach you how to dance, how to dance, how to dance
Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance

Run up on Ya (Bonus),B4.DA.$$,2015.0,"Yeah, run up on ya bitch like
Probably run up on ya bitch like

Lord, can I get a bad bitch?
High class whip, be above the average
Headed north west, that two seater Kardashian
Type to give me brain up in the red light traffic
And keep ya head up, that 2Pac blasting
Face two sacks and then we back into this action
No time to relax, I need someone to count this cash with
That match with, give me what I'm askin'
The lady in the streets, a pure beast on that mattress
That's it, you're the only one I'm trying to mack with
But you could be a liability or fat ass-et
How real is that ass miss? Bend that shit backwards
Hit one backwood, crack the pussy like a password
Bet that pussy's last word is master
Ask her, rode my rocket til I made that astronaut
That's NASA'S thought, be that young fly, nasty one
Swallow the seeds, please, but you can't catch me slipping, hon

So let's just ride away
We could die today
Got no time to waste
So just roll with me, baby
Ride or die
Always by your side
Until the end of time
Driving me crazy

First thing's first, I, Joey
Freaks all the honeys, mommies, the playboy bunnies
The hoes love me, get down before the money
Just know shit could get ugly, but whether it rain or sunny
Just never worry, chinchillas in February
Vanilla, that's when you ready
Check the itinerary whenever it's necessary
Keep my baby straight, peep my lady lace
The Margiela to Doneva
Fool less it's planned and everything is in control
So hit the gas and let's go
It's  no sleep til Brooklyn, another beastie boy
And she just can't stop looking, she like it raw
Real spitter and all and that's the word of mouth
And let her sit in the jaw
I'm so nasty, please just walk past me
So tempted to grab it, I gotta have it
We could be living lavish so tell me, girl, right away
We could hit the bank then escape to the hideaway
Is you riding, riding with me?
Is you riding?
Is you riding, riding with me?
Is you riding?

So let's just ride away
We could die today
Got no time to waste
So just roll with me, baby
Ride or die
Always by your side
Until the end of time
Driving me crazy

Getting head in the whip and not crashing it
FILA Velour shorts set, half Arabic
I sit in dark room with candle lit
Tell little mama handle it
Or you could leave the sandals on and pull your skirt up
I really remember reading Word Up
Tiger Beat, see me on the cover soon, fold out posters
Hanging on your shorties wall
I still be fucking women half my age when I'm 44
Young skin, a winning personality
Hard dick, million dollar salary
These cheating refs calling fouls on me
Break the fucking whistle off in his ass, now hit the road, Jack
Hop off the bozack, the .44 clap
You'll need LoJack to find your ho back
Euros'll get down, you know that
Swimming trunks and throwback
Yeah, you know that ah

So let's just ride away
We could die today
Got no time to waste
So just roll with me, baby

In traffic, in traffic

Switchin lanes, I'm swervin
Getting brain I'm learning
Nigga getting burn, how he gettin his earning
Turn me to ashes, I put it on they asses
Back from the dead with the dead button
Dash is the fastest, swervin' thru traffic
Don't worry I'll catch him I'm barely distracted
Attractive bad bitch tryna get wax like my hash is
And if you crashin know pussy cats get caskets
Don't get gassed, and if you clutch just know these blunts won't get passed
I put your guts in a open bag,
 why you toten that?
Where ya tokens at? This just ain't potent packs shit is choking gas
Sim simmer who got the keys in the bimmer?
Who see police in the mirror
? 
Who do Mach 3 speeds on the highway?

Shawty going on about her main how his team flop
She mesmerized as I hit her mind
How I hit her spot back at my spot right on my mothers couch ouch
We on that Brooklyn shit
, speeding soulfully thru the game
Living up fuck your fame I'm above uh
Growin' up they say you never really change
But since my younger days I been switchin' lanes paving the way
School we never showing up, home with homies rollin' up
Sittin' in the back of the bus pourin' a 40 up
Niggas never quacking at us, homies'll fold em up
World about to end so whaddup, lets roll the whole thing up
Yeah the whole OG, keep it in motion
Beast Coast yeah we chosen
, 
nigga sick got the potion
I'm hoping the knowledge me and my niggas spoken
Will find  a nigga in the villa smoking on something potent
You niggas is fucking hopeless, and me and my niggas focused

I'm sitting in the whip dreaming about tactics
On this rap shit and how to make my cash flip
You need practice,
 
I already get my ass kissed
Flows nasty I could probably sell a blank disk
Kate Moss tee on
 
28 grams bitch I get my OZ on
Laney 14's bitch I get my OG on
Got on Christian Dior but we living like we demons
Talking shit and rolling up thats the wave that we on
MCM jacket, gold teeth like I'm Jerome
Tea shroomed up, 
acid drops in my cup
Don't just sit there girl what's up
Pop that pussy crack a dutch, and roll it up take one puff
Rubber cover me up, you know some women are crazy
Lil nigga ain't mine—that Trojan got yo' baby
She said, ""Meech—don't even try to play me.""
I switched gears; Jeep went ""Ehr!"" like Jamie

Ready,UnKnown,2016.0,"Badmon representing
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
They ain't really ready they ain't never ready
I was born ready now I'm coming heavy
Now I'm coming heavy

I hope you ready, cause its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out
And if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house

Niggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping
They forgot we from the bottom
They forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar
Before the money and the power
You could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours
Plotting domination now the whole world is ours
Tell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making
And if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking
They got me mistaken
Critics try to box me
I feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi
Somebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze
I'm on my 47 shit, like how could you not see
Cause we dropping jewels I said we dropping jewels
Temper rising cools prolly see me on the news
Joey got the juice, finally got this nigga loose
Now while I'm free to speak free my nigga Shmurda too
I'm feeling like Victor Cruz a giant from New York
I'm lacing up the boots then I'm going fucking long
So if you trying to score just pass it to me more
Never dropping the ball, always raising the bar

Man it's gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
All these others niggas thinking they from the south

Bitch I'm the bomb even HOV said it
Though I never signed to ROC and no I don't regret it
You know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger
How can you sign if you know you're tryna beat a nigga
When I made it to his office I was seventeen
Like forty floors up I grew a pair of wings
In that moment man I knew I could do anything
Feeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king
And I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry
If we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me
Man I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly
But fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me
60k first week for the Bada$$
200k to this day I know you niggas mad
With the 80/20 split my nigga do the math
My nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave
Now they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next
Got these niggas bread hurt, Limp Bizkit
Its crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck
Got the ninjas on deck and bitches in check
And that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you
Steezy told me to go hard and niggas ain't hear you
I see the whole future clearer and I'm near it too
And if you really break a leg, I hope they still will cheer you

Man its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
Tell these other niggas I'm coming for the crown

Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
Nah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide

Day In The Life,Underground Airplay 2: The New York Renaissance ,2013.0,"La Musica de Harry Fraud

On some third eye shit
What a young nigga to do?
 
Little yute trying to figure the bigger truth
Fed up with little proof,
 
hopped off this stoop and cocked this duece
Adopted by the street life, Moms was juice and riches
Pops was tools he lifted, 
son of a gun,
 he put fools in ditches
Raised well, time went on and he aged well
At age 12 dropped a twelve gauge and two A-12’s
When I blaze this L, 
see niggas who ain't obey the style
So they spray shells and tool-grade's the cells
You remain swell, but you can tell that life that was once difficult
Got flipped like reciprocals
He retired the days in which he booted slaves and caught up in
Fusillades, and now he gets induced whenever music plays

But that's just a day in the life
You saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night
Get this made in a night
You can say it ain't right
But that's just a day in the life
You saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night
Get this made in a night
You can say it ain't right

At the back of my mind I'm held hostage
Incarcerated flow, they got me locked up and blocked up my chakras
Only thing on my conscience is contracts and contests
Can't burn no bridges, 
surready no calling back to the
Nigga I used to be when, shit was new to me
Move indubitably,
 honeys always talking about they nudity
But stay including me to the exclusivities
I love titties, but amor kitties
You know I got those vato, you know the motto for models
Trust you gon' swallow, but mine not those bottles
Men lie, women lie, but not no lotto
It's the primeval underground but nah, not no fossil

But that's just a day in the life
You saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night
Get this made in a night
You can say it ain't right
But that's just a day in the life
You saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night
Get this made in a night
You can say it ain't right
But that's just a day in the life
You saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night
Get this made in a night
You can say it ain't right",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-day-in-the-life-lyrics
Satellite,Summer Knights,2013.0,"And I guess it's my turn to shine
The bright light I was starin' at turn lime
And the green stuff turned to slime, and grime
Everybody want to be your blood cousin
When you're buzzing
Fine, I give 'em my other line, another rhyme
Word to mother, I'm goosed up
My two fucks in two cups
Another double entendre
She fell in that Bombay
Now she tumble dry lingerie
Chardonnay nothing but the bottle of emotion
But the love potion when it sprays
They just caught up in the days
Let me show you how I feel these Jays
The cheese stays high like Dr. J
My flow is like land the boats, dock the planes
Hand the dope but cop the chains
For more fiends some antidote to stop the pain
Now my stream, floods these streets
They can't stop the reign
All right I need them back
To blast, to blast me out of sight
Like a satellite
Vibe all night
A satellite

I take a day off
Let the trees take some weight off
My mental's just a fact, 
Bannon's got the instrumental
I keep niggas on their toes
So you got creases in your Forces
My verses they're important, yo your verses they are boring
I am not of this Earth bro
I'm a satellite that's bound to fight
But we're down to light, 'n light the fuck up
Vibe all night

As I roll the dice
Like my first drink was just the brink of a crooked eye
But don't blame the ice for the I U KEL
Oh God couldn't see past 'em
If his puff pass, notarized
Two dubs I got 40 on my hit list
Just smoking drinks both the broken in-glass like old English
Are you good bro?
Is your eyes dilated from the kush 'n Nuvo?
This new for the life
Like a Nubian
 
with the doobie cold eyes
Better smell the coffee I'mma coughing
That means I'm sick widdit, spit it out
Kill it like airborne diseases
Is this why the rap game is this easy?
Like please eat your vegetables
So I took a dose of the edible
Ain't an overdose
Already a rap monster fucking overload
Hopping up on stepping stones
So we making stepping stones
Turn up that tichrome
We rap game dose
This is Messiah and the eyes are hopeless
Hopin' my divide eyes through the world flex
This shit
Don't this shit make my people wanna jump?
No disrespect, ask my man for the pumps
Don't this shit
To blast, to blast me out of sight like a satellite
Don't this shit make my people wanna jump?
No disrespect, ask my man for the pumps
Don't this shit make my people wanna jump?

Surround Sounder
Come and hear the blunt-smoking philosopher
Smoking with a joint to get you open like a chakra
No time for the roster this rap game goes either way
Let him lead the way
And niggas will know who they need to play
Freeing the ways to amplify the idiolect
Saw nothing but shots since the project days
Like I was eyin' the Tec
Kept the eye in the text
Make 'em see my eye in the Lex
Giving my blood sweat and iron injecting selecting the soul
Cause mind body and soul can't be reinstalled
Special with the flow to make Niagara fall
It's over for the systematic rapping robotics
Crashing my logic
These niggas hooked on hooks and Hooked on Phonics
With hooked on phonics the pot could get em hooked on chronic
Cause pain conditions from the page conditions
Racing like Sonic inhaling the tonic
They couldn't grade my brain in a college
Themes behind it rob you for ya mind like thieves is behind it
So we had to squeeze in knowledge
To pile it when the green sees wallet
Anything to let the green seize wallet
Taking forever and a century with sentence speeds
Like a penitentiary to build cell blocks to block your memory
Catch me on the enemy's territory
Telling terrorist story with a terror
The Era ends with a good night story
Don't this shit make my people wanna jump?
No disrespect, ask my man for the pumps

Don't front, we brought Brooklyn back
You know where my lines is, where the hookers at
One punchline outshine 'em 'fore I show 'em where the hook is at
Where you at?
Pro Era info, you could book us at
We snot-noses don't forget
Where the boogers at
Brown skin, curly hair, tell 'em J Boog is back
I be too brick
Insane in the membrane from the empire
But I keep my mind in the pen state
Niggas wanna know how I keep my pen straight?
Damn straight
How they trying to bite off of my template
Based off they sentences
That ain't got good Penmanship
That get you clapped like an assembly
And that's all that I was sent to say
Let's get a offer 'fore SOPA try to censor me
They provoked an immenser, intenser me
Niggas thought they could relax but look tense to me

I walk around Harlem blocks, pockets full of knots
Niggas try to jock cause I smoke the best pot
Road trips, I let my young chick rock
Hold the work for a nigga slide at the rest stop
Hungry like a nigga fresh out
Sippin' medicated punch, somewhere decked out
Scribble my name, ""X"" your name out
Fuck off me, turpentine to get the stain out
Nigga my name ring bells from Wellington to Belgium
You get your passport stamped seldom
Fuck around, kids you're welcome
Washed 'em up before the bell rung
Fuck your premonitions, my proposition to the opposition
Is get down and lay down or pop up missin'
George Kush, when it's war, I'm firin'
Money on your head, nigga, change your mind

Hey, let me ride, woah
Let me rap a taste
We cut them corners like stoners 'til they evaporate
I had to break, no longer dancing by the rhythm of
Plunder searching of suckers smoke fuck it, I had to kill them, you know
Niggas ain't fuckin' with Cinematic
Half of these niggas ain't even average
How is it the word classic gets tossed around
But fuck them critics, I do this shit here for the underground
Bubble hotter than molten lava that burn their summer down
Itty bitty tittie sucker, where them hoes you claim you fucking
All up on my jock again, I get around like Pac and 'em
Slamming sushi roll ties with teriyaki paint
I chop stick her dim sum enter the dragon
Sho 'nough, locusts, the grasshoppers is plenty
They peep my technique, but can never ever beat the sensei
Shogun, try me nigga, I know some, word to Sant
I crush their vertebraes, my verbal plate can weigh a ton
Elephant been in the room
They can't decipher for the life of many biters that challenge us, how we still consume
Cyphers of so many writers unlike us are surely doomed

And you know it, cause real G's don't have to show it
Got your head in the clouds, big homie gotta get you focused
But know, it's all a part of the business, don't take it personal
It must be hurting you to know I could be merkin' you
At will, whenever I feel,
 this shit get realer
Foe squealers give the beats out to the nigga Dilla
I shine like crystals, Never held a pistol
Never packed a tool, but that don't mean that I won't fix you

How you trying to be Prince in a Queen B mix?
Little faggot pants dance you make no sense
Don't quit your day job
Cause after this, your campaign wrecked
I could do this all day y'all
It ain't no sweat, ain't no threat
Is this little bitch sick? Cause there ain't no vets for the love
And ain't nothing less I come next, ain't a nun
I'm the one, I think I spit lozenge
The Bada$$ enforcing
This niggas off I put him in a (cough, cough) coffin
Make yourself a pitch and get tossed in
I could do this often on your porch in
Foreign, this a warrant, we warning, if you want we still be
Sparring with the martians with an army of spartans
Sparking up I fuck yo bitch when I park your truck
Rockin' a 49ers' park - what?

Ever since a toddler, I had them call me father
Since ye' high, I got booty like prostate doctor
Mom want me be doctor, I be rhymin' like pasta
Eat them like they pasta, headed straight up, posture
Niggas can never knock the, hustling
Bitches on my balls, never fumbling
Nigga in fact they be doubling
But the hunnies get the smothering, never loving them
I never sleep, Got the heavy bags, struggling
They run from him when he approach, they call him the hero
All he need is thee cloak, cause murder what he wrote
And fuck guns, don't need those
Everything is done to the Max, no Keeble
Circle tighter than Speedo, I'm the Don like Cheadle
I'm flyer than eagle, I get the cheeks like pillows
Uh, I swear niggas they bout it, they bout shit
You'd be in good shape if ran like your mouth did
Ya'll lower than mouse shit, I'm higher than mountains
Keep false announcing, have you running like fountain
They ain't amounting to the money I'm counting
In a few year my accountants need accountants
Uh, everything y'all do is counters to me
Stupid nigga kinda seem you were counting on me
But I, bet you ain't trying to encounter with me
Nuh uh, I'm piranha, you some flounder to me
And the word on the grapevine, I'm going up great heights
Joey got enough line to capture a great white
I get more shine than late night, I'm beast who ain't ate right
Back up on my mojo, I'll show you what apes like
Nigga it's JoJo, They on my pogo, no homo
I ride the beat like the man on my polo
Ya'll some bozos, I'm underage, but pour more though
That Roso got me moving slow-mo

Tell me if you dig it, so we can get a dick in
Life, she be bitching, so get it while you live it
And stop fronting, you need to quit it
I swear I'mma hit it, I just need you to pitch it
So hollar if you're with it
She tried to play me, She said that I'm only a baby
She said she gets crazy, it'll probably amaze me
She said that she too much, she don't think that I'm enough
I got a smooth style, but she like to do it rough
She caught me slippin', I wasn't trippin'
Cause it ain't a joke how I be ripping up the kitten
I told her listen, Lord knows that I'm a good Christian
But we can do it in the tub or we can do it in the kitchen
She started gigglin', She thinks I'm kiddin'
I was on a mission, blowing double o's, always get the women
I know she peep the fits, I told her read my lips
Said we can do it like that or like this
Cut the light switch
Close your eyes, let the music intervene
We can play some Marvin Gaye or a little Al Green
We can listen to some Prince while I kiss up on your lips
Or get right with Betty Wright, turn it up, that's my shit

This when her pantie dropping, this shit is a pantie dropper

So how the fuck can I go shine, when my constellation dim
I conversate with momma just to know where I begin
Then condensate yo' armor so it's weaker by your limbs
Blast the speakers when you speak up cause you bleak in measurement
Stay relentless if you get it
Second place is ours we're clocking in any minute (Alright)
Cause first is not imagined
They got me cursed with this new apparent future
That I will never reinsert my fuckin' balance
I'm a frog, you a cricket - once was just a tadpole
And I'm still a tad poor, trying to fix it
They ballin' with no limits, reckless in the Rari's
So how the fuck you expect me to be civil in Civics

If I ain't know no better
I could have been sucked right up into the setup
But I kept my head up
And every time I fell I would get up
See I don't need no nines and Berettas
I kill with the lines and the letters with the verbs and the nouns
Just a kid trying get his sound heard around
Jump into cyphers and keep the old timers astounded
They said he was the best in the surroundance
Cause everyone around him was drownin'
In the fair one, no one son could pound him
With the lyrics, you pray you hear it
They say his bad hood couldn’t match his good spirit
And one day his mom and dad will be cheerin' to his grammy nomination
And proclamation to his world domination
Inauguration into greatness
From making rations to cakin'
2 AM and he be up like attic
He's an addict, alarm clock pop, he back at it
Barely got any sleep
But, he gotta eat
Cause ain't shit cheap and his soul/sole torned out of feet
He got dreams, but don't plan on sleeping until he reach 'em
Until you out feastin', paying houses where you sleep in
Until his album ready and his fans get it leaking just for sneak peaks and
Until then, his home is the booth
He spittin' to the plaque it's poof off his tooth
Like Hocus Pocus
Or word he's too focused
You should quote it
His goal is the denial that he wrote it
Flowin' like oceans and menstruals
Ink from the pen, lies within my credentials
They told me that I could be mental
But mommma always said that I was special
Haters tell me I should stop
My enemies tryin' see me in the box
So the streets tell me to cop a Glock and pop it
But something down deep tells me I'm the next prophet
Like the new Muhammad or the new Marcus Garvey
Or probably, it makes sense why I'm so heavily guarded
Wait, no, please restart it
I'm heavenly guarded, it's the golden child and for a while
God been looking down with a smile
Watchin' me prosper
Attackin' with the raps and then conquer
The junior Frank Sinatra, rapping out the Opera
You should spectate in the booth with a suit and binoculars

I guess you caught me digging fools’ gold
The very reason why I write poems
To right my wrongs, if you knew better you would do so
I was wrong, now you gotta kiss me through the phone, now I’m gone
Your day’s blue and your mood’s blown
It’s too soon before it seem like time took too long
The table’s turned, we gotta move on

I know that I can’t be what you want me to be
But I know you know that we gon' come to times like this
But truth is, sometimes it don’t rain on two lips
That sunshine don’t mean a thing where you live
Colors in my wallet lookin' gray and gloomy
Give it up one time for the pain in this music
Oh oh yea yea
Oh oh yea yea
It’s a brighter day
Open your eyes up and pray
Oh oh yea yea
Oh oh yea yea
It’s a brighter day
Open your eyes up and pray

A concrete rose from the land of the hazardous
I only ground down like it’s Nazareth
Catch me in the Crooklyn palaces, up in genesis
With my fabulous queen, I woke up from my miraculous dream
Uhm, they say life ain’t what it seems
It’s what you make it, so I tailored the inseams
And now I’m comfortable in my genes
I wrote one leg up & extended my lean
Tell me I'm definitely look clean
First I catch your fresh, then I cash this check
Isn’t it?
Now I’m lookin' fresh, my pockets back in effect
So what's the cause for the sneakers with the check?
I feel like a fresh air force's first step
Like some fresh flesh, first pack, first sex
And then I doze off for a sec
And see the hand of god pick me up like forceps
You told me never to forget and never to force it
To embrace the time and glorious moments
Cus you could die in a second
So open up within, fore I get to dissecting
I woke up again but this time forgettin'
Scratching my chin like that was rather interesting
I turn to the small coffee table on the right
Pick up my pen and turn on my thinking light


Catch me somersaulting my eyelids

Push the grandaddy proper, uh
Whatever you do just please don't drop the stuff
Is it awkward love or is it proper lust?
I'm not whats just poppin' though I'm what's popular
I love it when you scream big poppa bear please stop
You know my animal style
Apex on top that latex gon' pop safe sex ain't a option
They be sitting on your chin like it's up for adoption
Give a fuck who watching
Guess who knocking the boots
A foul doctrine
Exactly what got me so into you
Don't tell your boo
You let that rap nigga in your gut
If he knew you like I knew you
Then he know you give it up
You know that vanilla thin lust with the chocolate chunk
Something like a strawberry and bury it up


Yo open up what's for lunch?
She said 47 flavors of that shit come rushing up
Got your blood flowing a pump lets quarrel for the nut
I got the woodstock
How much wood can a wood thot suck
What if the thot could guarantee she would
And that's a tad bit explicit
If its implicit lift the clitoris lip and kiss it
Listen to me, bust it for me magnificently
So devilish you magnify the Christian in me
Unexpected positions when we switching between
When its over you see the inner magician in me
Abra ka dagger and gag her
Ain't tricking if you got it, but she was tricking when I had her though

Weapon of steel right to my brain and just bang it
32 in the clip but one is in the chamber
Click clack, hope it freeze me from my anger
If you don't plan on staying, I'm saying
I'm better off just laying
Six feet deep underneath the fucking pavement
At least you work the grave-shift for treating me like ape shit
I even wrote you love songs but money was your language
Just look at all the damage that you did
Chuckin' up the deuces to the suicidal vital motherfucking nuisance
I knew it, and now I'm about to lose it

Went from elated to a swayze, ghostin'
Taking my life the only escape from you potion


Cause homicide is painful, bitch you should be thankful
I turned that fucking anal licking nigga into an angel
Fuck you mad at me for? Because I put the C4 in the car
And blew that motherfucker up, swerving off the Detour
Well hee haw, boo hoo; Now it's just we two
What you propose that we do?
(You hate me bitch?) Well me too
You turned me to a reject, dejected
But that presidental keeps me free stressing, 
I should be elected
I bet I'll win but I'm lost without you

With four tenderonis off one orgy
At the crack of dawn, get the crack at the Don Corleone

My bitch never could be too thick
I told Satan, ""Won’t be too big""

I know my angels got my back, but it's demons all in front of me
A halo for a hat, I wear the crown always underneath
A king to a God, tryna guard all this energy
That's why I stay strapped - in my dungarees
Looking at the past, thinking everything is done to me
Moving so fast, I can't let the future run from me
One foot upon the gas, other foot up in my enemy's ass
I'm just tryna make my legacy last
It's everlasting, you never passing a nigga passion
They on their last stretch like they're elastic
I'm Mr. Fantastic, everything I drop another classic
They only mad cause I got it mastered
Anything that I imagined, I made it happen
Turned the pen into a wand and I made magic
I'm good with the words but I'm better at the actions
I'm putting in the work, man I'm never relaxing, my nigga
On God!

Never could be too lit
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick
Never could be too, ooh
Never could be too lit, aye
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick
I told Satan, ""Won’t be too big""

And you don't understand my angle
Getting tangled in, all kind of stars that's spangled
Feeling like I'm dangling over a edge
Playing tango with the Devil trying not to break a leg
I'm just tryna break bread with my brother man
Rather see us niggas dead, you don't understand
Middle fingers to the Feds and the government
I'm taking shots to the head like Osama Bin, I’m wilin' man
They rather see me talking 'bout my wallet and
How I got the girls going crazy at the colleges
She give me good brain then I might just pay her scholarship
Pussy intuition, baby get up on this knowledge and just swallow it
I penetrate deep like a hollow tip
You can ride the mic baby girl, we can politic
The money, man I'm piling it, I'm profound at this
Never high profile with it, my whole style legit

Never could be too lit
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick (yeah)
Never could be too, ooh
Never could be too lit, aye (yeah)
Never could be too rich (aye)
My bitch never could be too thick (yeah)
I told Satan, ""Won’t be too big"", ooh

Ooh, that's right (yeah)
Ooh, that's right, that's right, yeah
Never could be too lit
Tell America to suck my dick
Never could be too big
Never could be too

Uh, who want spar with the demagogue demi-god?
Feeling like I'm Thor for the denims on, special cloth
Talk and got attached to the emerald
A vessel of a force, to be with you in the epilogue
It's another episode, written from the upper echelon
Just hidden in another rapper lungs, shalom
Should I carry on tradition, as a Barry Bond division?
Through the windows of my soul, ain't no medical prescription
I'm on a mission, keep an eye out for opposition
Niggas tryna sneak him, that's for his rap position
But they better off just quitting
Got bars like the guards sitting in San Quentin
And I'm sicker than the judges with the sentencing, I sense tension
Viewers discretion, will be advised anytime that he arrive
They caught the vibe, way before I step inside
I walk with the light, see the spark in my eyes
On God!

Sentindo o frio em minha alma
Te convidei...

Never could be too lit
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick
Never could be too, ooh
Never could be too lit, aye
Never could be too rich
My bitch never gonna be too thick
I told Satan, ""Won’t be too big"", ooh",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-too-lit-lyrics

Come here girl, let me lick up on your ear girl
You say you got a man, well I don't care girl
Cause I'm right here, he way over there girl
You ain't even got to do shit
Two minutes, and already spot your juices
And that's just how I do this
Sex game stupid, she thought that I was cupid
And don't you fight it, I know you know you like it
Cause when the light flick, I creep inside your private
Talk, Victoria's Secret
She see the polo draws, she start to debriefing
She say she want the treatment right
I kiss up on her neck and hold the cleavage tight
Till it's evening time, we been at it all day
If your ex's ain't do it as good, they all gay
You can hit me always, I be free and all day
Treat that cookie like a rookie, I just want more play
Who taught you ? I know it ain't Yeezy
Ain't trying to say you sleazy but this was too easy
He a mogul and I'm a local, but in the bed I really go loco

Little to the right, yea around there
Perfect, I'm glad we past flirting
Before you wasn't certain when I was lifting up your skirt and
But now you squirting, at the same time I'm bursting
You look good on twitter but even better in person
I wanna take the time out to say that it was worth it
Your trip from NYC to out here in Burston, I mean Boston
I'm a MAC like your lip gloss is
Girl you so fine I wonder what the cost is
A Dime ? I'd give that ass a Milli
Coochie got the power,
 
neutrons on my jimmy
Know you thought I was a kiddy and know that I wouldn't last
You'd thought it be a quickie, you probably even laughed, well
I bet you regret that you said it
I can tell I'm the bestest by how wet your bed is
She told me ""Shut Up"" and just let it ride
I'm like girl that shit fat how much you let it slide?
She sighed and replied ""It was only like 5""

Bury me in gold 47 karat casket

What if I told you there was nothing to be scared of
Nothing but yourself and all the lies they shared ya
Look at all the lives that we lost 'cause we fear love
To the unknown and Biggie's dream getting teared up
Lack of reverence for this sacred land we stand on
Its incoherent to the very things we planned on
Can't understand it if you never expand your
Indoctrinated minds, playing possum to the times
Thanking God I'm still alive
Every time I open my eyes in fact I lie
But lord knows I try
Tell me how we gon' survive in America
It's a mass terror in everything I'm telling ya
Yo, it;s a genocide going on outside
Homicide, suicide, choose a side
You decide who stays alive, who gets crucified
Who deserve to die, hope it's never mine

Kiss my Nanamen, how it feel
Ready to kill when you still got your hands on the wheel

I keep one eye open, I can always see all
This one for my niggas hustling tryna seek more
For my brothers in the pen, tryna see again
Squeezing triggers on my niggas with the clippers like C. Paul
That was sorrow to the children of tomorrow
Another pill swallowed and a bottle of Moscato
Shots follow like a train, this shit never end
Same city, different boroughs, so we can't be friends
I can't pretend this shit don't bother me
Money for lottery but can't solve poverty
The streets is starving me, of all my good wills and my sovereignty
I hope my people don't dishonor me, but I'm just tryna get paid

Weathers on that wise dome so I always come to know

Cash will come when you see your people open up your soul to them

I move sweet 'til I'm in my holy feel

And she knows I got hoes, but still want me to body (the kitty)

Quit all that cryin' shit, and stop denyin' it

I said, ""Your foolish, I heard you did it to like half of the students""
I checked her quick, I threw her down, she intercepted it
And I ejected it, she swallowed and digested it. I jetted quick
No time for a marriage, baby in a carriage

The more cheddar, the more better, ya'll won't be friends forever
And I know it's probably killing you softly, pardon me
Thinking you can handle all of your problems costly
No matter what the cost be, you're quick to try and buy it off
Everything is win-win, you know you can't afford a loss
But blowing up was always the main dream
So I can't get mad if you're flowing in the mainstream
But you knew from now that it'll be this hard
Shit, you learned to trick broads when your dick got hard

Check it out, 20 is a blessing

What a nigga to do, nothing to lose
The whole world to gain, coming of age
Mama cut loose my chain, now I'm walking these streets like a gladiator
Mama shoulda kept me cuffed me up to the radiator
Fuck is that bullshit on the radio?
Tell that nigga Ebro, ""Please play that flavor""
And I don't really ask for favors, and toot my own horn
And I just really got to say the state of hip-hop ain't been the same since
They brainwashed youths to think we came from a slave ship
Hopped out of the spaceship, decoded the languages and realized
They tryna keep us trapped in the anguish
Flooding the airwaves with all of the same shit
Forgetting what's ancient, they tell us we ain't shit
The only means of getting by is killing our own, left in the tomb
Or even worse, putting it in a song to sing along
And I'm a Hot Nigga, cause where was OG Bobby Johnson
To tell young Shmurda that he has some better options
Don't wanna blame the streets that adopted him, or the doctrine
That got his mind, so boxed up in and I don't judge
But there's no one to blame but us, and that's the truth, but
It's always swept under the rug, and deep down we all wanna be loved
But they got us so blind, we don't wanna be us
And growing up in the slums, the shit is tough, I ain't bulletproof
But full of truth, so shoot 'em up till he deceased
And lined right back on the streets
I hope left enough gold for you to get back on your feet, peace

I woke up early on my born day
Im 20, it's a blessing, yo
I woke up early on my born day, uh yea
I woke up early on my born day, yea, check

The riches under my soul is full of shit
Kinda like the gist of everything from most of ya lips
You see the cash on the otherside's greener
But nowadays I feel like I walk with a nina
Cause the streets got meaner
Preachers got mad nice and my cousin just passed like
You just swerve in any matter, seconds, minutes, and hours
No time to question the power
Cause any blink could demolish a current
Is it your saga? So I'm honored to be here today
The world is ours, we should celebrate in every way
Spread the knowledge to the youth and tell them when we lay
Six feet, I'm six feet
Standing on my own two, and my own shoulders
It's that deep, shifting to max p's, will I put my ego right
Into the back seat, flowing out my veins
Running tracks like an athlete it's insane
Apex rap-thletics, leave 'em gassed off the aesthetics, yeah

Have no fear, fear, fear, fear
Yeah, it's Jay Oh

Even if I got high, I still feel grounded
I'm lower than the pavement
But the shit I been sayin'
Got me feelin' Super Saiyan
So I rise into the beat
Y'all tryin' to touch sky
I'm tryin' to catch God's feet
Little nigga spittin' flame, 500 degrees
Little nigga spit it sick, 500 disease
On some legendary shit, thinkin' I should be deceased
Like Pac, like Dilla, like Nujabes
Maybe then they can recognize, I'm better than the other guys
I'm the shit, see I attract hella flies
And I get hella fly shit up out of Bedstuy
All these new kids in rap, I'm a pedophile
Rapin' 'em, fakin' 'em, makin' 'em feel low
Rippin' 'em, flippin' em, grippin' 'em ?
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'm stepped on like pillow
But now I'm going in motherfucker, dildo
On pink, Jada, super head
No sleep, I get famous, see my eyes is super red
I be writin' rhymes 'til my motherfreakin' eyes bleed
Never backin' down, even if you rip my spleen
Flow sharp like I was spittin' up a syringe
I can see my future clear, no help to Visine
I advise them, stay away 'fore I get violent
When I spit, it's like a grip to your neck, violins
Silence, silence, silence, silence
I'm risin', risin', risin'

I never run unless I hear sirens
I'm the gorilla nigga, y'all niggas be lyin'
If I'm lyin', then you dyin'
If you're drivin', then I'm flyin'
Futuristic flow, it's still real to dough
I do eenie minie mo just to pick a flow
I see you see the other real lyricist
You niggas get smacked if you ain't feeling this
I'm killing it, sixteen, but super intelligent
You're feeling it, oh you ball, I'm stealin' it
It's my time, I'm in my prime
I would never let another person write my rhyme
It's all me, no strings, Wi Fi
I'm spaced out dawg, I belong in sci-fi
When I see my dealer I give him a high five
Then I rise, touch the sky
Like Kanye, rappers are my entree
Hey my momma, Imma big boy like Andre
Let me do it one time for my mom-ay hey, hey, hey
Since a kid, you always clean the monsters up
On Christmas, I always got my monster trucks
Now I'm going in on these kids monstrous
Well before I do, ay mom gracias
Now in I go, back to the flow
I'm just trying to find a pad, I'm a tadpole
And yeah I'm that pole so what you mad for
Got a bunch a bad girls that I feel bad for
Lord have mercy on they back bone
Blew a nigga off like you're playing saxophone
Never gave a ho the number to my phone
Don't call me ho, call Tyrone
Nigga, I'm on, I'mma drive on
Just trying to get cheese, that provalone
Middle finger to them niggas too mad at it
I flow crack, I check mad addicts
And I could never go soft it's a bad habit
JayOhVee and I'm back at it!

Yeah, damn
So out of breath
Feel like my lungs bout to collapse
Yo I felt that in my whole diaphram
Feel like I just ran 20 miles around the whole globe

Acting like it's hard to find women when I'm in these hard to find linens
Remeber those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends and its only the beginning
Big pimpin', foolin' dimes rob em' for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child but they treat him like the bigger man
Cuz when the pen in his hand they big him up like he Jigga Man
Know you see em' in the mirror fam
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan, like nigga damn
Before he got popular he been da' man
With yo' chick, in the can, rollin' thru an instant gram

These niggas enter my trap now
It’s too late to back out

Bet I could do this in my sleep
My young niggas stay with the heat
Fuck yo bitch, then hit the yeet now
These niggas lie through their teeth now

Through their teeth, niggas lyin’ all through their seat
Niggas lying all through their teeth
And that's the word on all these streets
Niggas lying all through their teeth
Niggas lying all through their teeth
And that’s the word on all these streets

Tell me, which man are you?
Do we gotta sell dope, or bang them hammers too?
Do you got to prove it all for the cameras too?
Black men, more like caged animal
I’m from the Brooklyn Zoo
Where my dogs at?
For the pigs in the blue
For the project rat, in the trap with the snake, but they’re both going to bite you
Probably won’t strike, but they goin’ try to
But they both gonna spite you
Get a text from the , come fight you
Follow me, follow me, follow me
To a fuckin’ death trap of my forced reality
Don’t forget to paint my picture when I’m gone
Read ‘em scriptures, read the motherfuckin’ Palms
Might want to take this literature, with ya
To the after-life, where it's probably gonna hit ya


Is this the American dream? Or is this what the American seem to be?
Looking at the messages that my heaven has sent really make life feel so evanescent
'Til every single cent is spent every  better breath all this reefer in
Maybe then they can understand it, we'll damn near damage every single aspect in plain
Everybody coming all out in vein, when they screaming shit out they call out his name
It seems everybody want someone to blame, remembering 9-11, who forgot Hussein
It's a shame, cause I don't feel like calling no more
I should go to Italy so I could roam some more
Across city simile, microphone control
Feel it in yo' body probably go chromosome
Shawty head  give me dome or something
Stick it in till you feel it in yo' ribs or something
Same spoiled brat in a bigger crib or something
After all that I could say I lived through something
Fuck all that noise something big to come
Say you loved the people what you ever did for them?
Heater on my lap probably took the pig
Rep B-K like the second coming of BIG or something


You done entered my trap now, it's too late to fucking back out
You done entered my trap now

My brothers banged, I was a scholar
I knew them Crips but couldn't die for them blue colors
Them niggas murking, they murking, young nigga put a little bit of church in
Put God above my purchase, been the martyr before I was birthed
They say that I'm too young to be out thugging
But I know it's in my blood, cause all these niggas my cousin
Might pop the gat if you budging, hating you gotta love them
Staging up out in public, making loud noise with the bullet
But fuck it, fuck it, niggas still hugging the block
Contraband stay tucked it my sock, coppa mans they loving the watch
Maybe cause it's  let us go, knowing that I'm out for my gold
Sold out shows across the globe until my story is told, nigga",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-my-young-niggaz-lyrics

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, is this New York?
Is this NYC?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

Skinny nigga with a fat wallet
First class seats right behind the pilot
O.N.I.F.C, fucking living lavish
I've been getting stylish
I'm just being modest
Fucking up the commas
Fuck reading comments
You would know whats real if you was really conscious
Substantial content in anything I'm dropping
And the flows i'm kicking, k-k-karate chop 'em
Back to the topic
Going so hard with no plans of stopping
Yeah, looking so strong, got a whole lot of options
Hair growing so long, covering up my optics
And this is coming from the top, though I came from the bottom
With enough fire in my heart to move a whole mountain
And I sip the youth from the fucking fountain
Won't stop 'till my name what they shoutin'
Overseas and the money I'm countin'
So just chill, I breeze
Just trynna fight the good fight
The Devil is alive, walk with him on good nights
Channeling my higher self at this time
I'm leveling with the top spot cause it's mine
Ever been high before it must be
Just me, nobody but the world above me
And I could give a fuck how the world could judge me
Cause if I die today I bet they all would love me
God forbid
Knock on wood
Twist fingers in the air, nigga rep your hood
Tell my nigga's still bang, you up to no good
Cause ain't shit changed, we misunderstood
Taking shots to the brain, leave you dead where you stood
Probably hidden the remains, dead bodies in the woods
And that's just how the world revolve
Is it love or evil of the evil of love, tell me lord

I said first class seaters
Chilling with my feet up
These bitches just keep ID's up
These niggas just wanna be us
You see us, it's obvious
We moving like mafias
Heard they wanted a verse with a hearse, where my fee is
Told mama that I'll feed us
I ode as your fetus
Birth of the true leader, they can never defeat us
No time for non-believers, they ain't worth our ether
Remember my school teachers never had faith neither
Now i'm at the Ivy Leagues as a big time speaker
I just got my new advance, I'm 'bout to park my jeep up
So keep up if you can
I'm the man, understand
Got the motherfucking world in the palm of my hand
Drop a bomb on a man, but never harming my man
And if it's tucked in my pants, it's all according to plan
Never missed me with the patience, my timing will win
They in a sticky situation now, call in the jam

Hold on, hold up, hold up, hold up
I think i got another one

I come off the top, yes it's the golden child
The Brooklyn son, I'm moving, this is so wild
And I got the style, yes, this is freestyle
Funk Flex you might as well drop that bomb now, cause I'm
Going in, it's no signs of stopping
Anytime we going in, trust me we 'gon win
We never taking a loss
And thats of course
Because we just gotta floss and we keep it lit, I said

Hold up, hold up, let me catch the beat right
Hold up, hold up, let me catch the beat right
Yeah, yeah, said let me catch the beat right
Okay, yeah, okay

Now we 'gon see who get the last laugh
Funny, cause these niggas always tripping off the gas
Think this shit a joke 'till somebody gets choked
Smoked, for the very words that they spoke
Listen here though
It's getting near close
'Bout to blow your brains through your fucking earlobes
With this one
The kid been gone for a while, they missed him
Patient with the shot when I blast off, won't miss him
My last victim went missing
Fuck sneak dissing
I hit 'em off from a distance
Another check off of my hitlist, fuck a witness
Then all of you'd eventually get this
You dismissed
Done now, finito
Talking like you lethal but we simply don't belive you
Nobody wants to be you
If your life was a movie, wouldn't even watch the preview
I guarantee it won't be no sequel
When we see you, we'll probably leave you see through
You talk guns cause you need those
Everything is done to the Max no Keeble

Hit your chest like cigarettes, check the predicament

Throw dirt on my palms hardly ever

I was raised in them neighborhoods so impoverished

Perception Vs. Reality,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Perception or reality, now what's realer?
And can I really trust that man in the mirror?
The death-span of the human mind gets nearer
Can't withstand time when you're raised out here
Raised out here
When you're raised out here
When you're raised out here
Raised out here
When you're raised out here
Only place guaranteed is the grave out here

Raised out here, you're never really here, but out here
Welcome to the jungle, yo, you're living in fear
Lions, tigers and bears, hunters gather your spears
How the hell we gonna survive for the next hundred years?
And it's hard to stay alive when one side don't share
Be the food or eat the shit, either way say your prayer
And if we are what we eat then we're already deceased
That's why my squad rolls deep in the bellies of beasts
Posted at the deli, heli's over the streets
The block cold heat, now I'm soaking my feet
No, my hands ain't dirty, but as you can see
I'm another misconception of reality
So when the 'po drop by he ain't gotta ask me
About the body that somebody caught last week
I ain't finna go downtown in no backseat
Cause perception is reality when black like me
Perception or reality, it's more than meets the eye, I know


Perception or reality, now what's realer?
And do you really base judgement 'bout what I'm hearing
Young rich nigga, chinchilla, other 
Objects in this mirror seem closer than they appear
Everything ain't gold
But these days I might pay up just to say it ain't so
Gotta get it, I gotta get that dough
Gotta get my mama in a new Range Rove
And what you saying though?
And yes I meant 


So, what's your perception when you see a big bald-headed inmate standing on stage wearing prison boots? Are you thinking ""I wonder what that guy did?"" or ""look at those tattoos, he must be one of those white supremacists or a gang member."" (Black like me) Are you curious to what the reality may be?

I'm a beast with these flows
Two birds, one stone, you get geese’d when trees rolled
They say I'm evil cause I trained my ego to see gold
Cause he know, seagulls couldn't see these goals, please
It's the return of the beast coast
No cash flashed, but the cheese still make teeth show
Incognito, is how you move on the strip
What you trynna be Vito? Well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, ya'll ain't real spitters, ya'll lips chapped
Better watch it, Mr. Nicewatch, don't risk that
I got a 6 pack of bare skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (That shit crack!)
Ya'll niggas softspoken, down below choking
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
There's makes sense why you want beef, well this frozen
It's nuts for you screwed in the tool, and can't hold em
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico
My lyrical span is what the fans is demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu stand in
Ain't no half steppin' around me
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
The young cop killer, I'm dat ill, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer....nigga",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-og-killuminati-lyrics
Flow-ers,UnKnown,2012.0,"Now, If I ain't know no better, I coulda been sucked right up into the setup
But I kept my head up, and everytime I failed I would get up
See I ain't need no nines and berettas
I kill with the lines and the letters, with the verbs and the nouns
Just a kid trynna get his sound heard around
Jump into cyphers, and keep the old timers, astounded
They said he was the best in his surroundings cause everyone around him would drown him
In the fair one, no one son could pound him
With the lyrics, you pray you hear it, they said his bad hood couldn't match his good spirit
And one day his mom and dad, will be cheering
To his grammy nomination and proclamation
To his world domination, inauguration into greatness
From making rations to caking
2 A.M he be up like addict he's an addict alarm clock pop he back at it
Barely got any sleep, but, he gotta eat
Cause ain't shit cheap and his soul is torned out of feet
He got dreams, but don't plan on sleeping until he reach 'em
Until you all feast him, paying houses where you sleep in
Until his album ready and his fans get it leaking just for sneak peaks and
Until then, his home is the booth
He spittin' to the plaque it's poofed off his tooth
Like Hocus Pocus
Or word he's too focused
You should quote it
His goal is the denial that he wrote it
Flowin' like oceans and menstruals
Ink from the pen, lies within my credentials
They told me that I could be mental
But mommma always said that I was special
Haters tell me I should stop
My enemies tryin' see me in the box
So the streets tell me to cop a Glock and pop it
But something down deep tells me I'm the next prophet
Like the new Muhammad or the new Marcus Garvey
Or probably, it makes sense why I'm so heavily guarded
Wait, no, please restart it
I'm heavenly guarded, it's the golden child and for a while
God been looking down with a smile
Watchin' me prosper
Attackin' with the raps and then conquer
The junior Frank Sinatra, rapping out the Opera
You should spectate in the booth with a suit and binoculars

Gruesome hearing my track, but none the less

Dangerous in the temples, cause they ain't getting my tempo

-Word up. That's why I put his name on everything I'm involved

Well, then get ready to give him a proper shout-out right now...
Cause what we need to do is set this thing off - We got Joey BADA$$ in the building, B4-da-Money is out Tuesday - It's real up in Hot 97 (...)

Yeah, mic check uh
(Whoo!) Before the money, 
before the money hungry, yeah
1-20, check it out check it out yo

The ridges under my soul is full of shit, kinda like the gist of everything from most of y'all lips
You see, the cash on the other side's greener, but nowadays I feel like I gotta walk with a nina
Cause the streets got meaner, preachers got mad nice and my cousin just passed like it just swerve in any matter
Seconds minutes and hours, no to time to question the power, cause any blink'll demolish your current - is this the saga?
So I'm honored to be here today - the world is ours, we should celebrate in every way
Spread the knowledge to the youth, they tell it when we lay
Six feet, I'm six feet, standin' on my own two, and my own shoulders, it's that deep
Shift it to max beats, when I put my ego right into the back seat flowin' down my veins, runnin' tracks like a athlete
It's insane, apex rap-thletics leave 'em gassed with the aesthetics

New York lineage with the new ports hittin'
Breakin' new support, better hide yo childrens too, another ape loose from the Brooklyn Zoo
So watch the pigs in the blue, the jays got word from the same fake snakes that bit you too
So get loose when they peep the pump they gettin' goosebumps, it's duck season leave your roosters slump
Early in the mornin' put the wormy in the mouth
, I'm from the north, but I'll make your pidgeons visit south
Back to this cheese, no time for cat-and-mouse
, I trapped a spouse I'm headin' out and I'm spazzin' out...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, uh, they can take nothing from me y'all
Yeah, before the money, aight, this is really time to go in-


Aight... yo, yo, check it out, uh

Yeah we finna go ape shit, 
banana clip through your drape shit
Dressed in Bathing Ape that a fly nigga's basic, take it sellin', face it
What's my favourite line? -Give you that sour face 
my odour base is lemon-lime
And I'm the spotlights, the camera's, the action
Blow off top if it ain't already packed in
My flow is steady tight, heavy like Iron Fist, Dead Or Alive
Been ready like Biggie back in 9-6, 
and I already died, steady rise
Touch the sky, kiss God, learn to fly, and then I came back alive
Fucked around, then did it twice, this is truly my third life
About to turn 20, but I'm goin' on a 105
My soul is wise, filled with wisdom of a older guy, so when these little niggas talk why would I reply?
I hold the light(n)ing, truly you're the one to fight, I break necks and smash faces, just off the flow and them cadences
All my shoes in the hallway but don't know what patience is
You know I spit it hot like where Satan is, and you already know what the fuck the station is
So keep it locked cause my niggas feel gon' make you big
From the top, but we're comin' for your nation, still on that world domination tip
Yeah, comin' for that crown and your queens, she just comin' for the sake of it, yeah she love a nigga with jeans enough to take a flick
Uh, exposin' that clip with a face in it
And truly, I can end your life today with one click, nobody fuckin' with my squad, nigga name one clique
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout I'm lackin' the bars, nigga got so high they started shootin' at stars
Comin' for the rap game, practicing my aim, who got an issue with this view? -I can blow your brains out
Uh, I'm tryna eat right now, a stand out nigga beneath a seat right now
And I can't bear to find no peace right now, my nigga STEEZ said it's time to release the beast right now
Uh, so that's what I'm about to do, you say you're comin' for my plate? -Cool, you know you fool
Don't step into my lane, dawg you gon' get chewed, and I don't fuck with this rap game, I don't go by the rules, boy
Uh, I'm from the school of the hard knocks, where niggas get dropped if they violate yo' block
All the OG's gon' be passed away, that's why the rap game run up on the cats today
I'm a rap god and this is blasphemy, 
I just might be the next one just to pass away

Know you feel the vibe when I'm all channellin', the innermost of my soul has been agrow for plenty gold
But most of them labels don't pay me, so...
Who you think investin' in them penitentiaries tho? -Same owners of the labels, same owners of your cable
Spoon-feedin' you fables, tryin' to keep yo' mind stable, yo' eyes blindin' yo' skin's hazel
The truth's under ya nazel, but even the air's all fucked up - how we supposed to see stars with chemical trails above us?
Plus some other shit that's undiscovered, detached from the roots since we set sail, my brothers
That's word to motherland, sowed us on stolen land, visions from brother man, we seen us all holdin' hands
Fifty years later still see my brothers choke to death, R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect
Nowaday they hangin' us by the same tree, the branches of the government, I can name all three:
Judicial, Legislative and Executive, lock your pops away, trap your moms and next the kids, it's all consecutive
I'm just tryna break the cycle, I wonder if I do it all before they take my life, yo

Keep the pistol to me close

Natural disaster, cycle in the loop and we caught up in the rapture
Not to mention all the other factors
Government agendas against rappers
They wanna see us either dead or captured

So we hold our head high, 'til they put us below
No restin' 'til the day we die, we gon' keep the seat closed
This is for my niggas who took a day to relax
Huggin' the blocks but, the blocks ain't hug us back
So I keep my head high, 'til they put me below
No restin' 'til the day we die, I'ma gon' keep the seat closed
This is for my niggas who took a day to relax
Huggin' the blocks but, the blocks ain't hug us back",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-the-blocks-lyrics
Fire in the booth Freestyle,UnKnown,2014.0,"Instrumental 1: Redman -- ""Tonight's Da Night""

Mic check yo yo
Its the Jozif Badman
PE, Brooklyn look Check me out huh

These niggas they ain't  ready for the war
Know all about them niggas, close you drawers
Please put your bread up
We ain't gon' settle for no iceberg lettuce
Let us eat when it's raw
Or end up like venison meat in the street
They're not ready for beef
Let the fish burn in the pot, niggas all in the spot
When it turns 12 'o clock then, we'll be servin' the block
Yo cut this shit
Cause I'm the best in the sector
Get your ear buds to grip, then I dissect ya
Inject ya with my lethal weapon
Plant a mine in the deeper sections guess who's least expect it
Motherfucker please respect it
The last one to pull my card was easily dealt with
You felt it this shit wreckers can't be reckoned with
On tracks wreckin' shit, ask me why I'm reckless
Break a wrist, approach my demo with a risk
Brought my demo listens, I'm a demolition specialist
I got the blueprints to the shit Jay to the O-
If blue was a prince I'm still Joseph Ko-
Know they can't ever little bro me
No matter how big they blow, they still a little below
It's the P-R-O E-R-A, indigo with the killer flow
Guaranteed the realest that you ever saw

We ain't done, no way to London
Your lung done
One next question son is where you from
From dust turn to dust and dust turn to O
Never was a rusty type so I'm just pure gold, stainless
Clean sheets good arrangements
Already made my bed and laid in it
Now I'm against the say in it
I said it best I pawn in this game of chess
I'm a King Luther my mind is my weapon
And I'ma respect the shooter kamikaze yo
Kam kamasutra please my nigga use your mendulla
I stay perfectiona-uh no dementia not to mention
I keep that shit sapiosexual still rough around my edges
Service that ask tweety bird is this your favorite cartoon to blast?
I lost my style cast away brace myself lime now
Who's wide shook but now I'm free at last
Now whats the problem now, no tape, no album out
These bad muthaphuckas they talked about
Instrumental 2: Mic Righteous -- ""In A Gang""

I stand juxtaposed to all my Pro's, realest illest niggas I know
See these fool's bitin' the flows, they even jooks the pose
I guess my CD really shakin' the coast
Could this really be the year that I feast, capisce?
Nothin to feast, the beast, I speak my piece
No niggas in the streets that heat seek for me, release and squeeze
Might put a Halloween between your spleen
Retreat or trickle down to your last pound of green, know what I mean?
Shit it's like taking candy from the babies
All of these now rappers are a bunch of Now and Laters
They too sweet, plus they lease their Mercedes
Can't be second greatest, I'm the best and def your favorite
My flow in-depth nigga, I got my wave up
It's either get your tidal waved, or you could be my neighbor
Cause if I can't eat, you can't either
I need to know, need the pizza dough fuck I'm spittin' ether for?

Smoke a blunt as my palm to the face a quick change
I'm banking my shot spray the maces never read reverchi
Don't sell me dreams actin' like a fuckin' banshee
Understand me rock in my ears so you hear
What I'm dealin' with simplicity is key upon my simple shit
One sock on the foot, other on the mic pap filtered me from these
Please ride the dark knight
Try to smoke me and try to  in a room full of roaches
Watch how you approach me
Getting antsy lies out the pennies
Seem seventeen old enough for  Huh!
Instrumental 3: Biggie Smalls -- ""Dead Wrong""

Imma do it for my city on this one
You ain't running with the apes yet
Apex at the empire state neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts, suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999
Who'd've thought that 19 I might be in my prime
Thought of the right scheme, everything else align
Here's a penny for your thoughts, another one, another one
Eventually the dream was bought
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough
I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows till it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see nobody no, no
I don't see nobody no, no
[Verse 6: Kirk Knight & 
Joey Bada$$
]
I look at the world like Donnie Darko
The flow cuckoo and I don't really care
I don't chuckle I don't smile
No fuckin family no friends and no attire
I be up in the black timbo up that's entire
Your attire my mic is never tired
It never retire your time's expired and you's a liar
I punch liars through my punchlines with the choirs
Bitches sitting quiet cause I had her on desire
Yo, I guess it's time to watch this citizen
Just come off straight up off the block
And become that star that everybody watching
Catch me on the red carpet
To be a citizen, are you gonna really sit or stand?
See it in the end on CNN and Channel Five again
Try to come all the way for first place
But I can't relate your time slate comin' back huh
You plates gone I comin' through
Never mistake Don with Jig want
With the beat with the flow he enticing

Joey Bada$$

I blow more O's than your circus
No wild with the churches
You see us lurkin' and I never make a purchase
Put my god over that see me I'm a maverick
Chillin' with the maverick the sabertooth we at it
Back at it we rapping niggas on the radio spazzin'
To my radio waves can't get my wave lengths gotta get it back huh
Right here man oh bring it back
Throw it like a baseball bat
It don't really matter where you at
Baby girl come fuck in the back
If you fuck in the back then

And I guess it's mac and I guess that
I got two stacks in my Cadillac
In the black and I got the drop-top too
Double entendre

In my pocket in my wallet

Never thought soul demons were under my nose schemin'
My success will mean the best to all
Gotta connect, I could've stepped and left the rest to fall
Into another cold season, and we were all dreamin'

I blessed my niggas with an opt to hit me on the weekend
And what I get in return, our friend weakened
Every weekend I'm weepin'
Every time my heart makes a beat, no reason just more treason
And in the beef, but I'm no deacon
Third eye wide, so I know who's seeking and sneaking
Its like the deeper you get the more the relationship sinking
Thinking this can't be true, its hard to believe
This can't be you, you belong in the garden with Eve
We had this goal where we go, by any means necessary
But damn, I guess enemies are necessary
And its clearly imperative
I bring to the light to me, you were nothing short of a relative
I guess this is the outcome when friends get competitive
Friendships form crevasses, arguments become consecutive
Messages from label  moving from positive to negative
Bring me back to my competitors

Success will mean the best to all
Gotta connect, I could've stepped and left the rest to fall
To another cold season, and we were all dreamin'
We were all dreamin'
Never thought my success would mean the best to all, when I

Want a suicide note, man somebody get the rope
Hold up, man I'm on a slippery slope
So a man, feeling that gas
Whole gas, straight dash

You probably can't stomach, you probably can't ingest
At times you so hungry, got mad dreams wishing that it all get sunny
But for now it's money this, money that

I told her ""Save the Children"", 
You said for sure that's thight, but what's the dollar signs in that

The phantom in the Maybach, that black Mac that go (pew-pew)

Paper Trail$ (Tradução),UnKnown,2015.0,"O dinheiro não é uma coisa se eu entendi (2x)

Antes do dinheiro,havia amor
Mas antes dele,foi difícil
Depois veio o dinheiro fácil como um plug
É uma pena que ainda não é o suficiente

Estou sentado planejando detalhadamente,anotando informações sobre meus pais
Realmente comecei na base,moleque,plantando
Mas eles ainda tem os plantios deles,e nós ainda compramos deles
São homens de mente fechada,o orgulho é maior do que os preços nos seus vestidos
Balenciagas,equilibro meu futebol com a aguardente
Eu e meus manos estamos tentando rangar algo,e vocês são uns covardes de bucetas
O flow é como larva quente em abundância
Com apenas um centavo eu poderia multiplicar minha fortuna
Fazê-lo lucrar mais para mim durante vinte horas
Eu juro que esses negos amam copiar,obrigado por me ouvir
O garoto aqui não é mais o mesmo desde que Biggie me deu um tapa no meu batismo
Fique atento a sua tradição e por favor,tente se salvar
Porque a sua posição no topo está a mudar mesmo á sua frente
Estou mandando essas rimas pesadas,eu atiro para o lado de fora
Ele caí como um mergulho,ocorreu alguns problemas agora,e correu de volta para casa
Então abaixe as pistolas,pois tem um ''pontinho vermelho'' no seu nariz
Quem sabotou as fechaduras?A boca de um artista de blues é sábia
Froze,fica de boca fechada ou vai sentir a energia solar
Eu sinto conexões que garantem,ver as portas fechadas
Você ouve o som do sub-mundo através de um ''sonar''
A forma do meu flow tem sabedoria
Os ''prós'' tem sido uma missão
Ouça a câmara,para obter hiperbólica
Eles se levantam ao máximo,e eu me levanto até o perigo,para me manter um durão
Minhas putas são modernas,passe a crônica
A sonoridade dominada é anos-luz acima do seu consciente
Você é novato,mas eu tenho letras que atingem os nervos
Eu prometo quê suas mentes não são afiadas como minhas espadas
Então corte o BS e não se preocupe ,onde é meu jeans
E PS: Sua cadela é especial,aprendi com meu pênis
Eu tenho sonhos enchendo arenas e suportes quebrando
Empunho esta raquete,enquanto traço uma Serena
Caramba,Deus abençoe o céu que enviou
Mas agora eu estou brisando olhando para outro lado,bebê,meu aluguel está aprazado
:
Merda,é realmente verdadeiro aqui
Eu disse,merda,é verdadeiro aqui
Só estou a tentar chegar a um acordo aqui
(O dinheiro não é uma coisa se eu entendi )
Eu estou gritando creme
Joey Bad,o Big Preem veio para recolher o verde
Eu tenho um dólar e um sonho,sabe o que quero dizer?
E eu tenho minha mãe fora da cena (2x)
 :
Eles dizem que o dinheiro é a raiz de todos os males (3x)
(Não vai assinar a nenhum grande sem nenhuma aposta) (O dinheiro não é uma coisa)
Eles dizem que o dinheiro é a raiz de todos os males
Vejo o dinheiro como a rota de todas as pessoas
Porque todos nós seguimos trilhas de papel,trilhas de papel
E todo mundo tem que pagar suas contas,pagar suas contas
É a conta de dólar dólar,todos vocês
É a conta de dólar dólar,que é a nota de dólar que mata,todos vocês (4x)

Antes do dinheiro,havia amor
Mas antes dele,foi difícil
Depois veio o dinheiro fácil como um plug
É uma pena que ainda não é o suficiente

I would've wifed her up, but she just a fan
And I don't eat pork, so how can I go ham(I'am allergic)
Its time to go beef, cause I be the meat that be stuck in your teeth
My lyrics in your head, stuck on repeat
I own this game, y'all just got a lease
 believe, my team with the wave
Get knocked over, if you misbehave
Super fly niggas, yes we well paid
You  the green, cause thats my maximum amount of wage
And I'm a slick and fresh nigga, thats word to La Di Da Di
Jay Oh Vee is the best, ask anybody
Roll with me or you might just get bodied
Ride the wave, or get Tsu-Tsunami'd
Have you cry, have you crying to your mommy
Choke it up, face time blue like a 
Have you sitting  like Bugatti
I cry with this beat, who give a fuck about 

Jay Oh
Jay Oh you already though

Periscope Freestyle,UnKnown,2016.0,"That's my shit
You got it going on, what what
You got it going on, what what
You got it going on baby, what what
You got it going on, what what
Wassup, yeah

A nigga been trying to fuck with you
Since the first time we kissed it felt comfortable
Didn't wanna let go upon my trust in you
Now everyday I'm thinking 'bout what's up with you
Every time my phone ringing I'm praying it's you
Nothing else I'd rather do than be hanging with boo
Smoking blunts on the roof, lay under the moon
Taking shots of the Henny and run in your room
Now we kissing and touching and setting the mood
Baby tell me where you want it and I'm making a move
Chemistry mixed smooth like we in a bruise
Started out as just friends, now we in a duo
When our energies collide, impeccable vibe
Inevitable, we aligned, a matter of time
'Til I can feel your warm skin pressed against mine
Until then I just can't get you out my mind
I sing this all the time

Whoo
Yo this shit gon be hard
Every day I'm, aye aye ayee",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-periscope-freestyle-lyrics
GQ Freestyle,UnKnown,2017.0,"Now, what's freedom to you?
Let's talk about it, take a minute, think it through
I'm all about it, but the concept seems new
The coppers still shoot us down on Channel 5 news
Lock us up for anythin' we do to pay dues
Some of us woke while some stay snoozed
Zombies walkin' around trippin' over issues
The knowledge is official but it's often misused
America my masseuse, massagin' my back
Tryna act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map
Holy cross on my back got a bullseye on it
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healin' component
Said you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won't you come and smell the hot coffee?
Stick your nose in the wrong places, one day you'll OD
I swear the whole world owe me
I'm nothin' close to the old me
If you never knew me, then it's too late to be homies
Homie, say fuck what you told me
I'm ridin' out by my lonely
Waitin' for the day the big homie take these chains off me",https://genius.com/Joey-bada-gq-freestyle-lyrics
