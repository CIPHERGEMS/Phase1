Hip Hop,Let’s Get Free,1998.0,"Fake (fake) Records (records)
Uh, uh, uh, 1-2, 1-2
Uh, uh, 1-2, 1-2, uh, uh
All my dogs

It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

One thing bout music when it hit you feel no pain
White folks say it controls your brain
I know better than that, that's game
And we ready for that
Two soldiers head of the pack
Matter fact, who got the gat?
And where my army at?
Rather attack than not react
Back to beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
Whether your project's put on hold
In the real world; these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world; it's bigger than all these fake-ass records
When poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1-2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do; if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame-ignitor, crowd-exciter
Or you wanna just get high then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent with a wire
I'm gon' know it when I play it

It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

Who shot Biggie Smalls, if we don't get them, they gon' get us all
I'm down for running up on them crackers in their city hall
We ride for y'all, all my dogs, stay real
Nigga don't think these record deals gon' feed your seeds and pay your bills
Because they not
MC's get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talking bout how much money they got;
Nigga, all y'all records sound the same
I'm sick of that fake-thug-R&B-rap-scenario, all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video
Monotonous material
Y'all don't hear me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice?
A dream or some substance?
A Bimmer
, a necklace or freedom?
Still a nigga like me don't playa-hate, I just stay awake
This real hip-hop
And it don't stop 'til we get the po-po off the block
They call it...

Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

DPZ got that crazy shit
We keep it crunked-up, John Blazed and shit
Uh, DPZ got that crazy shit we keep it crunk up
John Blaze'd and shit what
Uh, DPZ got that crazy shit we keep it crunk up
John Blaze'd and shit what
Uh, DPZ got that crazy shit we keep it crunk up

Mind Sex,Let’s Get Free,2000.0,"It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

Pardon me, love, but you seem like my type
What you doing tonight? You should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed, play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown: Brooklyn, New York
Now I know you think I wanna fuck, and no doubt
But tonight we'll try a different route
How bout we start, with a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon
See, I ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me wanna show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just taking our time
Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't trying to say I don't wanna fuck, cause I do
But for me, boo, making love is just as much mental
I like to know what I'm getting into

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

African princess, tell me your interests
Wait, let me guess, boo: you probably like poetry
Here's a little something I jotted down in case I spotted you around
So let me take this opportunity
Would you share a moment with me, over herbal tea?
Take a walk verbally, make a bond certainly?
Cause in my hand I bet your hand fit perfectly
And it's like we floating out in space when you flirting with me
C'mon, a little foreplay don't hurt
Imagine my chest under this shirt, your ass under your skirt
It's like walking the hot sands and finding an oasis
Opposites attract: that's the basis
Our sex is the wind that separates the Yin from the Yang
The balance that means complete change, our aim
Is to touch you in a delicate spot
And once we get it started, I ain't trying to stop
But first, we havin mind sex

We ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
It's time for some mind sex
We ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
Mind sex

She smiles; I smile
She walks - no - she glides softly by me, changing night into day
She opens her mouth to speak
And so sounds ring in my head
She speaks, and I want to dance to her rhythm
She moves ever so gently, increasing my desires
As I place my arms around her waist
Hold and squeeze unto me
I want to melt into her body, and discover the base of her warmth
Her beautiful black body that no human mind could ever conceive
She's love, she's truth
She's real, as real as the stars that shine in the heavens
As real as the sun that bathes her body
As real as the moon that glows and the birds that sing and the rose
That blossoms in Spring - for she is that rose
And not just any rose, but a black rose
Black rose stands tall and stronger than any other plant
A black rose, that stands as Creator
Of nations of black roses
That never loses her petals, and blossoms all year round
Black rose, sweet rose, thornless rose, eternal rose
Please look my way
Please look my way
Please look my way
Black rose",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-mind-sex-lyrics
Be Healthy,Let’s Get Free,2000.0,"It's all love

I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
Only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
Curry falafel, barbecued tofu
No fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
Only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
Exercising daily to stay healthy
And I rarely drink water out the tap, cause it's filthy

Lentil soup is mental fruit
And ginger root is good for the yout'
Fresh vegetable with dem ital stew
Sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods
Cause you don't wanna lose vitamins and minerals
And that's the jewel
Life brings life, it's valuable
So I eat what comes from the ground, it's natural
Let your food be your medicine (uh huh)
No Excederin (uh uh)
Strictly herb, generate in the sun, cause I got melanin
And drink water, eight glasses a day
'Cause that's what they say

They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
Cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
We got to start taking better care of ourselves
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
Cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
We got to start taking better care of ourselves, be
Healthy y'all

Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold the fuck up, yo
We'll take this little intermission, listen what the
Fuck we gotta say, y'know?

Police State,Let’s Get Free,2000.0,"You have the emergence in human society of this thing that's called the State. What is the State? The State is this organized bureaucracy: it is the police department. It is the Army, the Navy. It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you. This is the State; it is a repressive organization. But the state and gee well, you know, you've got to have the police because if there were no police, look at what you'd be doing to yourselves -- you'd be killing each other if there were no police! But the reality is the police become necessary in human society only at that juncture in human society where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct
You know how we think:
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, Black, and Green instead of gang bandanas
FBI spying on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watching society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P
While all you fake niggas try to copy Master P
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street where the people live
We sick of working for crumbs and filling up the prisons
Dying over money and relying on religion
For help. We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades is ready, we're just spreading the seed

The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate?
We living in a police state

No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back, pretty niggas be running with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back
We tired of that, corporations hiring Blacks
Denying the facts exploiting us all over the map
That's why I write the shit I write in my raps
It's documented, I'm in it, every day of the week I live in it
Breathing it, it's more than just fucking believing it
I'm holding M1's, rolling up my sleeves n' shit
It's Cee-lo for push-ups now
Many headed for one conclusion
Niggas ain't ready for revolution

The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate?
We living in a police state

I am a revolutionary
And you’re gonna have to keep on sayin' that
You’re gonna have to say that ‘I am the proletariat’
‘I am the people’
‘I am not the pig’

And anybody that’s down with you!
You could man-make things better for us
And you cuttin the welfare

They Schools,Let’s Get Free,2000.0,"[Intro: 
Sample
 & stic.man]
Why haven't you learned anything?
Man that school shit is a joke
The same people who control the school system control
The prison system, and the whole social system
Ever since slavery, naw I'm saying?

I went to school with some redneck crackers
Right around the time 3rd Bass dropped the Cactus Album
But I was reading Malcolm
I changed my name in '89 cleaning parts of my brain
Like a baby nine
I took a history class serious
Front row, every day of the week, 3rd period
Fucking with the teachers head, calling em racist
I tried to show them crackers some light, they couldn't face it
I got my diploma from a school called Rickards
Full of, teenage mothers, and drug dealing niggas
In the hallways, the popo was always present
Searching through niggas possessions
Looking for, dope and weapons,
 
get your lessons
That's why my moms kept stressin'
I tried to pay attention but they classes wasn't interestin'
They seemed to only glorify the Europeans
Claiming Africans were only three-fifths a human being
[Chorus: stic.man & 
Keanna Henson
]
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we trying to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Telling me white man lies straight bullshit (bullshit)
They schools ain't teaching us, what we need to know to 
survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies

You see dog, you see how quick these motherfuckers be to like
Be telling niggas get a diploma so you can get a job
Know what I'm saying but they don't never tell you how the job
Gonna exploit you every time
 know what I'm saying that's why I be like
Fuck they schools!

School is like a 12 step brainwash camp
They make you think if you drop out you ain't got a chance
To advance in life, they try to make you pull your pants up
Students fight the teachers and get took away in handcuffs
And if that wasn't enough, then they expel y'all
Your peoples understand it but to them, you a failure
Observation and participation, my favorite teachers
When they beat us in the head with them books, it don't reach us
Whether you breakdance or rock suede Adidas
Or be in the bathroom with your clique, smoking reefer
Then you know they math class ain't important 'less you adding up cash
In multiples, 
unemployment ain't rewardin'
They may as well teach us extortion
You either get paid or locked up, 
the principal is like a warden
In a four year sentence
, 
mad niggas never finish
But that doesn't mean I couldn't be a doctor or a dentist
[Chorus: stic.man & 
Keanna Henson
]
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we trying to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Telling me white man lies straight bullshit (bullshit)
They schools ain't teaching us, what we need to know to 
survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies

Cuz for real, a mind is a terrible thing to waste
And all y'all high class niggas with y'all nose up
Cuz we droppin this shit on this joint, fuck y'all
We gon speak for ourselves
Knowhatimsayin? Cuz see the schools ain't teachin us nothin
They ain't teachin us nothin but how to be slaves and hardworkers
For white people to build up they shit
Make they businesses successful while it's exploitin us
Knowhatimsayin? And they ain't teachin us nothin related to
Solvin our own problems, knowhatimsayin?
Ain't teachin us how to get crack out the ghetto
They ain't teachin us how to stop the police from murdering us
And brutalizing us, they ain't teachin us how to get our rent paid
Knowhatimsayin? They ain't teachin our families how to interact
Better with each other, knowhatimsayin? They just teachin us
How to build they shit up, knowhatimsayin? That's why my niggas
Got a problem with this shit, that's why niggas be droppin out that
Shit cuz it don't relate, you go to school the fuckin police
Searchin you you walkin in your shit like this a military compound
Knowhatimsayin? So school don't even relate to us
Until we have some shit where we control the fuckin school system
Where we reflect how we gon solve our own problems
Them niggas ain't gon relate to school, shit that just how it is
Knowhatimsayin? And I love education, knowhatimsayin?
But if education ain't elevatin me, then you knowhatimsayin it ain't
Takin me where I need to go on some bullshit, then fuck education
Knowhatimsayin? At least they shit, matter of fact my nigga

You can't fool all the people all of the time
But if you fool the right ones, then the rest will fall behind
Tell me who's got control of your mind? Your world view?
Is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to?
Know what I'm saying 'cause Uncle Sam got a plan
If you examine what they tellin' us then you will understand
What they plantin' in the seeds of the next generation
Feedin' our children miseducation
No one knows if there's UFOs or any life on Mars
Or what they doin' when they up in the stars
Because I don't believe a word of what the president said
He fillin' our head with lies, got us hypnotized
When he be speakin' in code words about crime and poverty
Drugs, welfare, prisons, guns and robbery
It really means us, there's no excuse for the slander
But what's good for the goose, is still good for the gander

I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago I would've been a Panther

Telling lies, to our babies
Only truth, can take us away

I don't want no computer chip in my arm
I don't wanna die by a nuclear bomb
I say we all rush the pentagon
Pull out guns and grab the intercom
My first words'll be, ""I believe
Man made God, outta ignorance and fear""
If God made man, then why the hell would he put us here?
I thought he's s'posed to be the all-loving?
The same God who let Hitler put the Jews in the ovens
We don't fall for the regular shit, they try to feed us
All this half-ass leadership, flippin' position
They turn politician and shut the hell up and follow tradition
Boy, your TV screen is telling lies to your vision
Every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
Running up in niggas' cribs claiming that they heard shots
It's a plot, but busta, can you tell me who's greedier?
Big corporations, the pigs or the media?
Sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
Commercial airplanes, fallin' out the skies like flies
Make me wonder what secrets went down with Ron Brown
Who burnt the churches to the ground with no evidence found?
It's not coincidence, it's been too many steady incidents
It could've been the Klan who put that bomb at the Olympics
But it prob'ly was the FBI, deep at the core
Cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law

""Uh, we view each other with a great love and a great understanding. And that we try to expand this to the general Black population, and also, people-- oppressed people all over the world. And, I think that we differ from some other groups simply because we understand the system better than most groups understand the system.

Umi

I was born, in a dump
My mama died and my daddy got drunk
He left me, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shack
All I owned was hangin on my back
And Lord knows, how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, you're dirty and you're filthy
Tobacco Road, gonna get me some dynamite and a crane
I'm gonna blow it up, Lord knows gonna start all over again
My mind is the place where I make my plans
The world is the place where I take my stand
The beauty of life is mine today
They cannot take my mind away

Fuck what you heard, I'm from Africa
This ain't no act it's mathematical
Past the black radical
I choose the M-1 because it's practical
Nothin was changed, we ain't protected
No names, it's all factual
They push the wrong buttons, count down to detonate
Brooklyn blown away and the world will have to speculate
This is what we learn in the streets, fuck a degree
Believe in none of what you hear and half of what you see

It's like watching your own father smoke crack
I have nightmares on shit like that
No way in hell I'll ever get like that
I seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
It's like a 
tour of duty
My life is booby-trapped
, 
it's hard to see the beauty
When your heart is turning ice cold
Cold like your hands exposed to blistering winds
My mother keep her eyes closed, she say she prayin
I listen close to what she sayin
When she speak of Jesus I ignore it
But when it's practical I'm all for it
You got to think like a soldier
I'm training myself to snatch pistols out of holsters
Discipline keep the mind focused
This whole world is a corn field son
Look out for flying locusts

Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wanna do?
Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wanna do?

You can't walk the streets with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
And if you know the time, give me a sign
Tell me where we draw the line, I got your back if you got mine
My enemy's enemy is my man
, 
one dreadlock is stronger than one strand
While the crackers got the upper hand
 
my comrades stands
On lands stolen
Every tooth a golden opportunity, who holding my community
Hostage? 10% ransom
Costing us time we lost and some
This is how the plan runs, thinking with a fugitive brain
What we do to live is insane
Hold in the weed, healing my membranes
, just like crack
You know it all boils down to the dollars-and-cents of it
Niggas commence to get rents to sentenced to serve terms
Jumping the fence, the black germ is loose
When will they learn?
Psychology

We piss on walls and smoke reefa in the halls
No respect for their laws
I cut your face with a kitchen knife
In gladiator times, man against machinery
The tree bark fatigues help me blend in with the scenery boy
Life is a series of serious choices
Theories is formed from experience, never mysterious forces
Various courses of life can lead to failure
Too much of anything is a trap
My mind snap
Guerilla warfare for two grand
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man...
They say karate means 'empty hands'

Dean Street, click clack
President, uh huh
Nostrand Ave, DPz
Orange Ave, RBGs
Tee Town, who wanna ride
Brooklyn, come on, come on

Sitting in the living room on the floor
Hunger pang got me on some migraine shit
But I'm gonna maintain
Nigga got two or three dollars to my name
And my homies in the same boat going through the same thing
Ready for a caper, better plot for the paper
We been living in the dark since April
On the candle, gotta get a handle
My homie got a twenty-five automatic added to the camper
Nigga get the phone book look up in the yellow page
Lemme tell you how we gonna get paid
We gonna order take-out and when they send the driver
We gonna stick the twenty-five up in his face
Let's ride, stepping outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hiding in the corridor until we see the beams from the car headlights
White boy in the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes
You know what this is
It's a stick up
Gimme the do' from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggas
We running down the block hot with these stacks of boxes
So we split up and met back at the apartment

Hell yeah! - Yo ain't you hungry my nigga?
Hell yeah! - You wanna get paid my nigga?
Hell yeah! - Ain't you tired of starving my nigga?
Hell yeah! - Well lets ride then!
Hell yeah!
Hell yeah!

I know a way we can get paid
You can get down but you can't be afraid
Let's go to the DMV and get an ID
The name says you but the face is me
Now it's your turn take my paper work
Like 1, 2, 3 lets make it work
Then, fill out the credit card application
And its gonna be bout 3 weeks a waiting
For American Express
Discover Card
Platinum Visa, Mastercard
Cause when we was boosting shit we was targets
Now we just walk right up and say charge it
To the game we rocking brand names
Well known at the department store chains
We even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po Po never know who to true blame
Sto' after Sto' you know we kept rolling
Wait two weeks report the card stolen
Repeat the cycle like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch
Coming out the mall with the shopping bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yea, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right that's how we paid the rent


I know a caper
We can get some government paper
You know food stamps can we really do that
Hell yea, right there for the taking
Fuck welfare we say reparations
And, you know the grind
Get up early get in the line and just wait
Everybody on break that's part of the game
And when they call your name
Ms. Case Worker let my state my claim
I'm homeless, jobless, times is hard
I'm bout hopeless
But I gotta eat regardless
No family to run to I'm twenty two
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
My sad story made her feel close to me
I made her feel like it was an emergency
When I came to the crib niggas couldn't believe
I came back with a big bag of groceries, hell yeah
Every job I ever had I had to get on the first day
I find out how to pimp on the system
Two steps ahead of the manager
Getting over on the regular tax free money out of the register
And when I'm working late nights stocking boxes
I'm creeping their merchandise
And don't put me on dishes I'm dropping them bitches
And taking all day long to mop the kitchen shit
We ain't getting paid commission, minimum wage, modern day slave conditions
Got me flippin' burgers with no power
Can't even buy one off what I make in an hour
I'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
I take mine off the top like a politician
Where I'm from doing dirt is a part of living
I got mouths to feed I gots to get it

If you claiming gangsta, then bang on the system
And show that you ready to ride
Till we get our freedom
We got to get over
We steady on the grind",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-hell-yeah-pimp-the-system-lyrics

That's it—five more minutes and that's it
Back to work fellas, back to work!

Yo, lil' Kadeija pops is locked, she wanna pop the lock
But prison ain't nothin’ but a private stock
And she be dreamin’ ‘bout his date of release, she hate the police
But loved by her grandma who hugs and kisses her
Her father's a political prisoner, Free Fred
Son of a Panther that the government shot dead
Back in 12/4, 1969
Four o'clock in the mornin, it's terrible but it's fine ‘cause
Fred Hampton Jr. looks just like him
Walks just like him, talks just like him
And it might be frightenin’ the Feds and the snitches
To see him organize the gang brothers and sisters
So he had to be framed, yo, you know how the game go
Eighteen years because the five-o said so
They said he set a fire to a arab store
But he ignited the minds of the young black and poor

Behind enemy lines, my niggas is cellmates
Most of the youths never escape the jail fates
Super maximum camps will advance they game plan
To keep us in the hands of the man, locked up

Lil' Kenny been smoking loosies since he was twelve
Now he's 25 locked up with a L
They call him triple K cause he killed three niggas
Another ghetto child got turned into a killer
His pops was a Vietnam veteran on heroin
Used like a pawn by these white North Americans
Momma couldn't handle the stress and went crazy
Grandmamma had to raise the baby
Just a young boy born to a life of poverty
Hustlin’, robbery, whatever brung the paper home
Carried the chrome like a blind man hold a cane
Tattoes all over his chest, so you can know his name
But y'all know how the game go
D's kicked in the front door and guess who they came fo'?
A young nigga headed for the pen, coulda been, shoulda been
Never see the hood again

Wolves,Let’s Get Free,2000.0,"I'm not a hunter but I am told
That, in places like in the Arctic
Where indigenous people sometimes might hunt a wolf
They'll take a double edged blade;
And they'll put blood on the blade
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice
So that only the blade is protruding
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat
And it'll come and lick the blade, trying to eat
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade
Of course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds
And he thinks he's really having a good meal
And he drinks, and he licks, and he licks
And of course, he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself
That’s what the Imperialists did to us with crack cocaine
You got these young brothers out there thinking that they’re getting something
That they’re gonna make a living with
They is getting something so they can buy a car;
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something so they can get a piece of gold;
White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They’re getting something to get a house;
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there’s something that’s bringing resources to them
But they're killing themselves just like the wolf was licking the blade
And they're slowly dying without knowing it
That’s what’s happening to the community, you with me on that?
That’s exactly and precisely what happens to the community
And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn
Handle and the blade in the ice for the wolf
What happens is the wolf gets blamed for trying to live
That’s what happens in our community
You don't blame the person, the victim
You blame the oppressor!
Imperialism, white power is the enemy
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa
Snatched up the first African;
Brought us here against our will
Is the enemy today

Animal in Man,Let’s Get Free,2000.0,"Help me!
You want me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction

Once upon a time
There was a very serious situation growing
There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals
And this is the story of their times

Old man Sammy had a farm
Walked the land with the rifle
Most of the time shit was calm
His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor
From the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable
This is how we kept food on this table (maxing)
You would have thought he was disabled by the way he be relaxing
Acting like Mr. Magnificent
But the animals were thinking something different
The sentiment was tension in the barnyard
Throughout the years they had been through mad drama
With the farmer, word is bond ( God)
And they all came to one conclusion
They argued there was no way they'd ever be free
If it was up to humans
Therefore the only course left was revolution which was understandable
And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals
They planned a full attack
Under the leadership of Hannibal
The fattest pig in the pack
The next morning on the farm
Everything was calm
Just before dawn
But before long
The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric
Now check it
This is when that shit got hectic
Directed by Hannibal, the animals attacked
Old Sam was in a state of shock
And fell up on his back
And dropped his rifle
Reaching in vain
Each and every creature from the field at his throat
Screaming ""Kill, feel the pain.""

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true
This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

After they ran the farmer off the farm
The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn
Hannibal spoke for several hours
But when talks about his plans for power
That's when the conversation turned sour
He issued an offical ordinance to set
If you not a pig from this day forth then you subordinate
That's when the horses went buckwild
One of them shouted out
""You fraudulent pigs, we know your fucking style!""
Hannibal's face was flushed and pale
All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal
He felt the same way Sam felt
They took his tongue out of his mouth
And cut his body up for sale, for real
You better listen while you can
Its a very thin line between animal and man
When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand
What would you have done?
Shook his hand?
This is the animal in man

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true
This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true


This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true
This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man

I love to wake up and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure (my leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia
So many pretty things to please ya
The greenery, beautiful birds, natural scenery
Or even just a infinite sky.  We be forever puffin' lah
On the block, or tellin' jokes in the ride (ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside (whut)
Havin' fun (aight?), eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (sup, boo)
It's instinct—that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this—full of happiness

I feel great even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind, let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin', feelin' fine, leavin' my bad times behind
Feels great.  And no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind, let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive, feelin' fine, livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great

Yeah, know'm sayin'?  I just wanna give a shout out to everybody who got a birthday today.  Happiness (Happiness)

Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometimes, I feel the same way.  Roll up a J and get away
Put some food on the grill or just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
‘Cause it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the kings
The flowers that bloom and the sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune ‘cause it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh).  A day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car.  Now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out all night to sunrise
Celebration of life ‘cause every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs, and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind and have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (what)
You can leave your troubles behind and have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind

I feel great even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind, let's unwind, and find a reason to smile

Because some cracker that knows I'm black
Better than you, nigga, is probably gonna' put
A bullet in the back of my head!
Yeah our lives fucked up, no doubt
All this shit we go through every day
Sometimes a nigga don't know what the fuck to do
But see I got my niggas
And we gon organize a people army
And we gon get control over our own lives
And I mean that shit right there from the bottom of my shit
I Ching

Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war?
Could you take the life of somebody you know
Or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died when they registered

Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me wanna break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free, we need more than MC's
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today, it's kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us
But I'mma stand up on my own, like a man do
Dominate the land and make wealth, like Fu-Manchu
Yes the peoples army stick together like glue
We represent the I-Ching, and to this we stand true
Military formation, anyone participation is welcome
Each one teach one
, son help son
Just one gun is all it take to get it started
Livin in the wilderness of the West, we cold hearted

If you don't think it could happen think again my son
Be prepared for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclysm, niggas be like fuck the system
If you don't think it could happen think again my son
Be prepared for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclysm, niggas be like fuck the system

I don't wanna be no movie star
I don't wanna drive no fancy car
I just wanna be free, to live my life, to live my own life

Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is, crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
Cuz a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lot of niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, trying to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear in the coming years
Ahead of me, I'm ready for whatever they bring, though
I'd go against a tank with a shank for my dreams
And that's my fucking word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hanging on the curb

If you don't think it could happen think again my son

No Way As The Way,Information Age,2012,"My way might not be your way
But it’s okay
It’s alright, your way might not be my way
But it’s okay
It’s alright

Yea, I used to go to church
But the church didn’t quench my thirst
Mama taught me to put god first
But she never tried to block my search
I was curious, young but serious
Why's religion so mysterious
Why is black life so hard?
They say you’re not supposed to question God
Well is it okay to question the pastor?
Was it passed down from the slave-master?
It was only the truth I was after
But I never could get a straight answer
So I couldn’t relate to the sermon
Put down the bible, then I start learning
About life, didn’t know where the path would lead
But I had to get off my knees


I build with the 5 percenters
On the God within us, there's no limits
Study the Metu Neter from Kemet
Also I remembered
Smoke herb with the Rastafarians
Grew my locks became a vegetarian
Following the tao, filling what the bible lacks
Jewels being handed to a innocent child
My mind is a Buddhist temple, the truth is simple
I try to be principle
Walking with a warrior spirit
It ain’t nothing like learning from first hand life experience
I’m a realist, that’s all I deal with
Respect & truth, that’s all I build with
A child of the universe
My religion is life and it’s just as valid
I strive for balance


I gotta admit, I don’t know
In the end which way it’s gonna go
Why we sit by the project window?
Instead of living off the land with my kin folk
Is there even a master plan?
An unseen hand? Is God a man?
Some say that’s sacrilegious
Same folks selling us lies about Christmas
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny
Just so the capitalists can make money
They say God will take care of it
But you a terrorist if you say the same thing in Arabic
It’s so hypocritical
It’s a miracle, listen to the message and the spirituals

She like to ride that glass pipe
Fast life, popping pills
Cheap thrills get you killed
Big syringe, pick your skin
Make you thin, she not your friend
Frying pan, brain on drugs
Back hand, ain’t no love

Malcolm Garvey Huey, their life is like a movie
I live, I die, I organize
Everything I do's revolutionize
I build what's good for the whole damn hood
Study G's like these, really think you should
I study Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey
Monster kody with a UZI, listening to Fela Kuti
I'm a goon with the machete, especially if it's deadly
Got the Santos for the Xe to protect me, so respect me
This is heavy legendary, revolutionary
My wifey she resurrect me when they thought they had me burried
Took me out the cemetery, now it's family over every
Cause it's always necessary to avoid the commissary
I'mma live for you five, so I stopped getting high
If you know, then you recognize, it's that Black and Brown pride
This the power of the mind, RBG, God Divine
You can see it through the lies if you can read between the lines
I live, I die, I organize
Everything I do - revolutionize
I build what's good for the whole damn hood
Study G's like these, really think you should
I study Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey
Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey
Malcolm, Garvey, Huey, Bunchy, Bobby, Pac 'n Tookie
Sitting by the door, so you can say I'm acting spooky
Just like in the movie, son, you better pack it tooley
Niggas squish be acting fruity or be cracking like they tookie
Rather smoke a doobie than be burning and alluding
Bang bang, pig shooting, we should blame Rudy Julie
Banging for the cameras, China White & nose candy
Unless you're banging on the system, you're a gangsta wearing panties
RBG my family from the Bronx to Miami
Police cannot stand me packing y'all like a manny
Call me Little Bobby Hutton, cause I'm first to push the button
Rappers don't be saying nothing to the system, we say fuck 'em
This is for Nahonda, mama see, Mama Akuwa
All the real OGs, I'm a soldier cause you told me study
Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey
Malcolm Garvey Huey I'm reportin' in for duty
Stic.-ie-ickie, yours truely, here for duty
Down davino, M A uno , you know how we dropped the jury
This is real not a movie, not Mickey Donald Goofy
I'm a soldier, I avoid a bitch nigga like the cooties
Screwface in a hoodie, fresh pair of khakis
We can do this like we fam or go to war like the Apaches
For whatever I stay ready, I learned that in Tallahassee
Babatunde used to school me as a juvie skipping classes
Never let the system use me, my duty is my passage
Watch the homies in your army, they don't always show their badges
Keep your family living healthy, teach your children 'bout their blackness
Teach your wifey how to use the ratchet, this shit is classic
Get your food, clothes n shelter, fuck the system pimp it backwards

Brooklyn
All my soldiers gather up all your arms
Let's go to war niggas
Onyx, Dead Prez

This is America's nightmare
Red, black, green and don't give a fuck
Just wanna get free and live it up
Fuck a 9 to 5, and labels trying to slave us
Busting 12 gauges, breaking your minds out the cages
Crips and bloods banging in New York, that's outrageous
Protesting is hopeless
We putting lasers and scopes on the toasters
Shooting at the police in the streets is the focus
Roll with the rush, it's that official nas
Got soldiers with pistols that blast
We living in the last
My theory is fuck it until the system ain't corrupted
To the public I'm conducted through ghetto clips and armor metal
Busting at the feds or Berettas, we never settle
Til the Rockefeller laws get better
We all trapped in the hood fucking all together
It's war forever
So guns up, if the cops run up on ya
Hold down your corner, and cock a four pound on em

Multiple shots, heard on the block
And my niggas is popping the cops
All up in the hood, it's hot
Living life with my back against the wall, it's over
Open and sober, holding pistolas and repping my culture
Get it or die trying, us against them, freedom or death
This how we on it when it ain't nothing left
Ain't getting locked up no more, ain't buying your raw
Rocking it up, coming for mine, cocking it up
This is the last day, hour, minute and second
So I'm screaming ""fuck they law,"" and carry my weapon
Warrior code, shoot and reload, and we taking back what we are owed
We dividing it with my soldiers
You dare to struggle, you dare to win
To the OGs and the veterans, spreading that ghetto medicine
This is my last day, on my word and my balls
When the people army rise, then the system will fall

These the last dayz (get yours!) (repeat x4)

Just talking bout takin my own life
Into my own hands
RBG, refine, be a grown man
See that's what I'm doing, cause I know it's inside of me
All I gotta do is just bring it to reality, it's
Fuck the government, but still I gotta pay the rent
So yeah, I'm for the caper most definite
Keeping it militant, focused, intelligent
Pimping the system is basic common sense
It's still fuck the pig, black power ain't dead
All that red, white, and blue shit be going to y'all head, see
We break bread, it's like a game or a sport
Gotta train everyday to keep your team on point
Cause still to this day our reparations ain't paid
And you can see it in the poverty around the way
It ain't even our own people on BET
So they gotta get it from somebody, it might as well be me
Besides, a nigga gotta eat when he hungry
You see how they sent troops to war for they country
Niggas worldwide need an army of one
This revolution to the fullest, put the bullets in the gun nigga

These the last dayz (get yours!) (repeat x8)

Ayo these niggas in the streets ain't ready for no revolution
But neither am I, I'm at the club getting stupid
I ain't got no time to think about who's really oppressing me
I'm too ready to smash the first nigga stressing me
Far as I'm concerned they got us trained so well
Look like we doing a good job of killing ourselves
It don't take heart to pull a trigger, so I'm glad that I'm heartless
Killing easy, living with it was the hard shit
I done broke every rule in the Good Book
Trust me, I memorized The Anarchist's Cookbook
This nigga here ain't as dumb as you think
I could make a bomb with the shit that's under your sink
My name is a number, they trying violate my probation
Fuck it!
Throw me in jail, I need a vacation
Our future is fucked, it don't do no use to pray

I was trained to defend myself for my brain and my mental health
The white man got the wealth we held back
We're living in hell black and niggas can sell crack
But that ain't gonna change this thang
If you gonna bang, then bang for change, don't bang for crazy thangs
If not don't bang
If ya gonna ball play the game how it should be played
Can you dribble a grenade?
To save your life you payed the price, mama raised you right
Now how you ain't gonna fight?
For the white man's laws hell nah
For the cause, because we got to get what's ours
Gotta struggle for the motherfucking power
Cause we're livin' in the last few hours
It's 11:59, I think it's bout time
We get on the grind, and get out the carbine
With freedom of mind we can see what we can find
If you can spot 'em, pop pop pop the po-9
This is only a rhyme so now don't get scared
Listen to the message in the word
Don't let your sight get blurred, you heard this righteous words
You might prefer it from a cotton mouth
Timeout, I didn't say bug out, ball out, bling out
All y'all sell-outs get the hell out
This shit it's RBG so bang on out
Uh, we people army nigga, bang on out


Yo, Yo, what you know bout hard?
Can't be the weak link in the squad
Gotta look way deep in your heart
Anything in the way gotta go straight through
Take charge
Can't hide from your flaws when you ride for the cause
Cause a nigga will pull your card
Keep your guard up 24/7 on the street like you're doin hard time on the yard
What you know about hard?
Can you assemble your heat in the dark
Take it apart, and clean all the parts?
Life is a journey, a course, like learning a martial art
You can't have partial heart
Gotta get your own, if you drop the bone, dog, we all fall
It ain't over til the problem solved
Get your back up off the wall

My niggas is riders, we fighters, we tight as a fist
RBG's up in this bitch, so bang on out
If your khakis is sagging, you repping your rag and you holding the magnum
Use it for freedom nigga, bang on out
All my dirtiest dirties, revolutionaries and visionaries
Don't be no scaredy nigga, bang on out
It's a war going on in the streets, we hollering fuck the police
Ain't bout no peace, nigga, bang on out

Let’s say you see fifty niggas in all black fatigues
My regime running down your street
At the end of the block, we got the god damn cops
And they hope we sink, tell me what you see
I see blood, buildings burning, motherfuckers trippin for a goddamn purpose
The police is nervous, cause we done observed 'em
Now niggas is thinking about murder
We ain't talking, no more, and we ain't squashing shit with po-po
And we ain't marching in the middle of the goddamn road
'Cause Martin got smoked
Niggas ready for war, so get the fuck up, we fixing to set the city to fire
This time when we ride we burning it down, turn this shit 'round
Keep your justice, your peace
And keep busting your heat, aim it at the crooked officer
We won't stop blazing til they coughing blood
Wanna slang my baseball cap to the back and get busy, nigga
You say you a soldier, well get over here nigga we under attack
As soon as they done, they dead gone
Murder mo come, come, they done, me redrum, me redrum, they done
And when we put 'em in they grave
We toss in a doughnut, and tell 'em we don't surrender, surrender, naw

Overstand,Information Age,2012,"Are we addicted to the struggle or committed to success?
Are we focused on the positive or holdin' onto stress?
Not sayin' thing's perfect but in many ways I'm blessed
Learnin' how to take the negative and flip for the best
Everyday bring challenge, every challenge is a chance to advance
The power is right in our own hands
From a youth full of rage, to a wise grown man
Here I am, life is beautiful now, I overstand

I'm lookin' forward through my rear view mirror in hindsight
Gotta be more than just a G if you keepin' your mind right
Better be ready for the battle or focused on my fight
I ain't sittin' on no sidelines watchin' them highlights
I'ma be in the game playin' to win but learnin' from setbacks
Strengthen my weaknesses and masterin' what I'm best at
Power of refinement until you get right and exact
It's all in your mind, but that depends on where your head's at
Life is a chess match and lessons come from your mistakes
Try not to end up in checkmate no matter whatever it takes
Long as you're breathin' then you can be problem solvin'
Stayin' involved, evolved, world keeps revolvin'
For the cause be all you can from the mornin' to the sunset
You never have no regrets
Took the journey to the edge of your fate and then lept
Not just understandin' but overstandin' is the objective
{keep it open, in perspective}

Just let me be what I am
Take my destiny in my hands
By my actions you can judge where I stand
And I hope one day you'll overstand

Change come from the inside out
No fear, live free, let the truth ride out
I'm steady, shakin' off the shackles of the old me
Wakin' up daily, meditation, feelin' so free
They hate to see you change {yeah}
But they don't understand {no}
Unless you see for yourself, then you won't comprehend
The caterpillar don't care what you think about him
He was born to be fly, his nature gonna bring it outta him
By the struggle I was never broken, I was broken open
I tapped into a source that was omnipotent
Had to shift my focus to my higher purpose
Ain't nothing weak about broke, it takes a fighter's courage
People say they want a revolution
But steady holdin' on the slave ideas, afraid of evolution
In life we live and learn, it's practice, theory, practice
Wisdom is organically grown, its not pre-packaged
{it's forward baby, never backwards}


We think we found the absolute truth
But only to discover it's a labyrinth, we go from one maze into another
So many chambers and angles, peelin' the onion layers
Within it all I see the same gang, just different players
So I rebel from the prison cell of the pigeon hole
And dare to be myself, original
A man lives on principles --I don't posture to be popular
Born to be a leader not just a blind follower

It's family before the dollar, your priorities in order
And like Bruce Lee say: ""Be the water, be the earth, be the wind and the fire.""
Elevate, take it higher
It's instinct, fulfill your needs and your desires
But we go to be compassionate, considerate, the people's advocate
Eradicatin' ignorance through experience
The more you live, the more you learn and you grow
It has a positive effect on all the people you know
{it's motivation}

I hope that you will overstand 
{
look at things without any opinion
Otherwise you'll never look at reality
Look at things without any philosophy, without any prejudice, without any dogma, creed or scripture
Just look, without arrogance
And see the cause of ignorance, and overstand}
{Change is necessary to evolution
The universe contains incredible diversity
And you cannot experience it all within the confines of one comfortable lifestyle
Look ahead to what you will think of your life at it's end
You will probably not want to look back and say it was cozy and dull
Thus, react positively to what seems to be disaster
Remember that what seems now to be disaster may be an important step toward evolution
And may even be identifiable as such at some point in the future
Every great loss takes you out of a rut and starts life anew
Be grateful for the time you had and your former happy state
And look forward eagerly to the new phase

This is that incredible
It ain't who, it's what you know
Intelligence from head to toe
Third eye open, ready to grow
Look inside her beautiful mind
Fly design, watch her shine
Fine wine, better with time
Do the math, what's the science?
Analog girl in a digital world
Drop jewels, diamonds and pearls
Body language, numbers and verbs
Vocab, revenge of the nerds
Got no time for dumbin' out
Her brilliance keeps coming out
My batteries ain't running out
I'm street smart, her ass is round
So sweetheart, you better ask 'round
This is brain food and a closed mouth
Stay hungry, that's ugly
But let me tell you one thing

Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
I love her healthy lifestyle and her sexy ways
A girl like that, comrade, I swear we can have mind sex for days
Frantz Fanon, Khalil Gibran she says, ""it turns me on""
A lot of these beautiful girls be freaks, but weak in the mind, hers is strong
Good head on her shoulders, she got class, she got culture
Still, she down to earth, she down to ride, La Vida Loca
She act local, but she think global, multicultural girl
And only an A-alike way of life soldier can hope to approach the girl
Keep it real or you're talking corny, tell the truth is what get her horny
I think she wants me, school me, jewel me, feed me, wisdom, drop it on me
No time for no bullshi-, all she got is that realness
Good books to read, tea to sip, good vibes and friendship
Wise words, pretty lips, smarty pants and them curvy hips
Back side like, ""bong bong"", self-aware like Don Juan
She ain't ashamed of her nerd side, her body and her mind fine
And I can't be no wise guy, but her head game is Einstein

Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy
She so wise, thick in the thighs, politicized, beautiful eyes
Ambitious and so delicious, motivated and oh, baby
Analytical, raise the temperature, critical thinker, hot for teacher
Fire burnin', higher learnin'
Pimp the wisdom, wheels turnin'
G spot is not between the legs
The G spot is between the ears
You got the edge when you know the ledge, you can touch her soul with the right ideas
I can send a text, I can get you wet
With my intellect, and ain't hit it yet
On the internet, so into it
You went across the globe, we still intimate


Drop it on me, turn me on
Turn me on, baby
Dr-, dro-, drop it on meh
Drop it on me, turn me on
Turn me on, baby
When you drop it on me
I don't want nobody who can't get up on my level
Who can't overstand my rebel soul

Root of All Evil,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What is the root of all evil?
Many people of color believe that if you have money, you can do any and everything.  You cannot.  Other people believe that if you don't have money, you cannot do anything.  They're also wrong.  
Money is only the visible effect that shows what is going on in your mind.  The richer, stronger, and clearer your thoughts, the greater your supply of currency
.  
Money doesn't only show up as dollar bills and coins; people you can call on, resources you can draw upon, thoughts and attitudes—these are also money
.  
What you yield in your physical life is a result of how you think
.  You are your own money.  Money is my own natural energy field.  Your thoughts, words, feelings, and actions determine your own wealth.  
The quickest way to make money appear is to love yourself, respect yourself, and put yourself to work.  I am money.  Money is me

I read a book that said that money is power, which is corruption
Destruction is its one and only function
But where we live, it seem you got to die to be king
So we supply to the fiends 'cause, see, the ends justify the means
Politics is war without guns.  War is politics with guns
You know what I mean?
  You better get one
The cash make us equal.  Babylon can't fool the people
It's hidden in the symbol of the evil

We're at the end of the world, boy, with no sight and no direction
They passin' gun laws so we can't have no protection
It don't even matter who win the '96 election
'Cause it's already planned and every man'll be affected
I'm a real nigga, but not the type to spend my life in prison
I don't believe in no gods and no form of religion
My way of livin' is based on pure reality
Far much more than just a crack-sellin' mentality
I sharpen my brain.  Karate keep my body trained
I think of my brother and how the crack tighened the veins
In his arms.  Wish I could take the stress off my moms
'Cause she harmless, y'all.  She don't deserve no part of this

What is the root of all evil?
Money is the root of all evil
From the pyramid to the eagle
Check your dollar bill, boy—there it is
Money is the root of all evil—period
What is the root of all evil?
Money is the root of all evil
From the pyramid to the eagle
Check your dollar bill, boy—there it is
Money is the root of all evil

Picture this illegal rock crackin'
Make sure it's dry before you try and bag it
This is when the iron start jumpin' out of jackets
And you plot like the dead cop—the plot thickens
Chicken heads in the parking lot sparkin' chocolate
You take your place in the mix—domino tricks
You crazy 'bout them New York Knicks.  It's like a Newport fix
You caught six fiends jonesing right off the bat
One grabbed his dome when he smoked the crack, stood back
And began to scream, swingin' his fists up at the wind
Gave a devilish grin and fell dead with his eyes open
Involuntary homocide.  He died hoping for a blessin'
Murdered by his obsessions

Yo.  
You could use your forty as a weapon
A little bit of gas ignite fire underneath the heavens
That could reach around the universe, purify the Earth
Dollar bill on this reverse side—see, what is it worth?
It seem the number thirteen is a curse if you accept it
It's thirteen letters in 
Annuit Coeptis
Thirteen rows of granite blocks on the pyramid of Giza
Thirteen stars above the eagle
Holdin' thirteen fig leaves and thirteen arrows
Thirteen berries on the branch and one pharaoh
Watchin' you with the all-eye-seein'
Announcing the beginning of the end
Of all human beings...

(What it is) What is the root of all evil?
Money is the root of all evil
From the pyramid to the eagle
Check your dollar bill, boy—there it is
Money is the root of all evil—period
What is the root of all evil?
Money is the root of all evil
From the pyramid to the eagle
Check your dollar bill, boy—there it is
Money is the root of all evil—period",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-root-of-all-evil-lyrics

Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there ain't another place to run
Eat your own gun, scared because my people never known fun

Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough la to take my sins away
This E&J be freein us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way dunn
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
I choose that wildly Mr. Charlie keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin niggas is dead
We learn the chokeholds with fisherman's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins
I hope that something is done to them, far worse than killing them
It reminded me of something like what happened to Lincoln

You ain't even safe wit a full clip
I swear on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit
You ain't even safe wit a full clip
I swear on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit

Globalization (Scene of the Crime),A3C Volume 1,UnKnown,"Intro: Mumia Abu Jamal
The new name in the twenty-first century of Imperialism
Is really globalization
And when you think about that
When you read about that
When you study about that
Globalization really means the Globalization of Capital
You don't hear people talking about the Globalization of Labor
But you know working people all around the world
Have more in common with each other
Than they have with their own so-called leaders or the rulers
The ruling class that is of the Society
So people should uh Globalize resistance
Globalize and that means...

Globalization..
Some kids get bombs for breakfast
And blowed away on their birthday
Ask the lil' orphan boy on Iraqi soil
What he think about the U.S.A
Today was the worst day of his life
Uncle Sam killed both his parents
His village was burned to the ground
And they left him and his lil' brother to perish
Cus they want the oil in the soil
Like vampires they come for blood
In the name of freedom and justice
Nowhere to hide nowhere to run
First they send the soldiers
Then come McDonald's and Coca Cola
Toxic western culture
And once they take over its over...

Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Halliburton, 7-up, Walmart, Exxon
Who cares if you get stepped on, Get stepped on
In the name of progress they business has no conscience
All they want is profits It's obvious in Africa
It's obvious in Mexico, It's obvious in Cuba
It's obvious in Palestine, American invasion
Foreign occupation, Covert operations
Oppressive domination, Resiiiiiiist...
-

Yo, 2012 is approaching
No food on the shelves and the system is broken
It's out of order, we out of water, and out of time
Out of my mind, out of prime time with the propaganda
Make you wanna snap make ya pop the hammer
Call it what it is use proper grammar
Land grab call that gentrification
Micro-chip Identification
Thats just fear and intimidation
Nine O'clock news interpretation
(?Break of a Nation?) that's
Got nothing to lose but our chains
Got nothing to use but our brains
Stop following the rules
And lets change the game, Resiiiiist...

Blackwater, Ford Trucks, APAC, Starbucks, IMF, Chevron
Who cares if you get stepped on, get stepped on
In the name of progress
They business has no conscious
All they want is profits it's obvious in Africa
It's obvious in Mexico, It's obvious in Cuba
It's obvious in Palestine, American invasion
Foreign occupation, Covert operations
Oppressive domination, Resiiiiiiist...

Learning Growing Changing,Information Age,2012,"We could grow
We could develop

As we know that heaven is not a place
And happiness lives in the heart
Long as the world keep turning
Our duty is to keep on learning
Ya heard?

Keep on learning, and soaking up game
We gon' make mistakes, we gon' go through some things
Keep on growing, keep on soaking up game
If something ain’t working, don’t be afraid to change

Nobody know it all
As soon as you think you do, that’s when you fall
We gotta do more than survive—we must evolve
Things change just when you think you seen it all
We trip, we stumble, but we get back in stride
Each day, all the way, one step at a time
Don’t wanna let my ego and pride make me blind
The elders say, “When you stop growing, that’s when you die”
”
The one who gets the knowledge is the one who asked “why?”
Through the course of life, you gon' taste some humble pie
But I love it—it makes me appreciate the things that I take for granted
Gaining insight and understanding
Each one teach one—we got to pass it on
Keep doing the knowledge, building and adding on
With faith in the assumption
That nobody knows everything but everybody knows something


The more you know, the more you know you don’t know
And if you don’t know there’s more you can know, then you won’t grow
What you don’t know can hurt you.  Discipline is a virtue
Gotta ask the right questions
 or else you go into cycles
And cyphers and spirals
Information is viral—this infects you
It’s contagious, it had you going through stages
Like denial, don’t believe that.  No, we didn’t do that
Then reality set in, there’s no disputing the facts
Yo, I’m sorry if I woke you up, but when I open up
It’s like I’m smoking but I’m high off the people, watch me soak it up
Huey said the best education is observation and participation
Study how the people be relating
Different points of views turn bad news to good news
See, it’s kinda like some shoes ‘cause they gotta make you move
Treat it like organic food, make it something you can chew
Information you can use, make it something you can do


Aye man, it’s okay to say you don’t know.  It’s when you let go your ego, you’re free from all illusion, dig?  Can’t make moves in confusion.  Don’t look for conflict, man—always look for the solution.  And my pop said, “Humility is a sign of wisdom.”  But to really soak it in, now that’s a different kind of listening.  See, man sharpen man, and every day is another lesson.  And it’s not fair you only learn man—it’s a blessing.  And as the Buddha says, “Nothing lasts forever.”  We gotta manage our expectations—
The less we crave, the less we suffer
; and this way, we awaken.  
Right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right focus

Before the outrage burns out misdirected
What can we do so our community's protected?
I believe that should be our main objective
While we full of rage and we wanna make a difference
Let's do more than protest
Let's make a commitment, to be pro-active
Not just emotional reactin'. Move like G's never passive
Organize safe teams, martial art classes
Get to the gun range and make your aim accurate
Self defense is a must by any tactic
Security protocol, make it a daily practice

They say I look suspicious, I get it all the time
Pro-black face tatted when they drop dime
Follow me get on yo' jack, tell 'em to come get me
Or better yet, yo dun, you be the judge jury
We gotta make better war moves
Police the pigs, polish our own tools
Fight back, become a force to be reckoned
Let 'em feel the consequence pullin' that weapon
They do what they wanna to who they think they can
Understand, there's no respect for the black man
What's the solution, the ballot or the bullet, G?
Gimme that pistol, that vote never give us free
I tell the young people ""go 'head, protest.""
Petitions, picket signs, citizens arrest
Just know we at war so get your game face on
Hoodie on I bomb first for Trayvon

I'm tired of the marchin', the rallyin', the protestin'
We hoopin' and hollerin', still we gettin' no justice

It's the free mix on your radio station
Turn it up so you can drown out all the media hype
We plottin', plannin' and strategizin' ready to fight

Off our criminalization our people gon' be a target

 who gon' be next?

When I die don't put me on a shirt my nigga
Be a revolutionary make 'em hurt my nigga

Hate views, fake moves, and wild hostile
Young black world in a struggle for survival
Great stress in effect, disrespect, disconnect
Judged on why these skittles and iced tea
Gun shots and blood that break the nights raids
A self-appointed judge, it might be Nazi
Insecurity identity doubt
You think that they see a neighbor, they see a villain is out
Standard answer it was random police movement
Inconclusive confusion, the present news clips, callous bullshit
Every talking head is clueless, man they stuck on channel stupid
Sick of the town, we know it’s win that
It’s time to fix that for every place we live at
Put in work where ought to change the wack facts

The forms, the stances
The flow, the rhythm, the internal answers
The herbs, the healing, the quiet meditation

The cause of your ignorance, flaws in your discipline
Broken laws of nutrition, and poor conditionin'
The vitamins and supplements

The dues, the pads, the wraps, the gloves
The mouthpiece you left home, the taste of your own blood
The hunger, the blocks
The punches, the squats
The crunches, the example you set for the youngsters
The will, the skills, the kill or to heal
The separation between what's fake and what's real
The laws of physics
The class-comradery
The vows of humility, the bow, the courtesy

Sellin’ D.O.P.E. (Album Version),Turn Off the Radio: The Mixtape Volume 1,UnKnown,"Dead prez - “Sellin’ D.O.P.E.”


Drugs Oppress the People Everyday

Selling dope, serving weed.  We had
To hustle to hustle just to eat

Ain’t no hope in the streets—you broke, you sell dope
All my young niggas outside hustling coke
Know the drama.  If you ain’t selling crack, then it’s ganja
I’ve been through it, dun, hitting niggas two for one
Pulling guns out and busting my shits too.  What?
I ain’t give a fuck.  I used to get a rush when I bust mine
Bagging up my nickels and dime, going through
Difficult time,
 writing my life’s story in rhyme
But when I look at all the niggas they hit with mad time
In proportion to the big kingpins, it don’t fit
You could get caught with barely a half a slab
And the judge sentence you like you ran the ave
I ain’t planned to get rich from selling that shit—it was survival
My game plan was not to get knocked by 5-0
But who am I?  Just a young nigga caught in the mix
And if this weed don’t sell, I'ma cop me a brick

Selling dope, serving weed.  We had
To hustle to hustle just to eat
Selling dope, serving weed (Selling weed).  We had
To hustle just to eat

It’s been a minute since I’ve been in the game.  Some years
Back, I held crack—I couldn't say the same thing
Ask my nigga Bang Double in Raleigh.  We was trouble
Got the fiends’ spot bubbling hot.  We wouldn't never make
A lot—I mean, not like Scarface or Nino Brown
Or George Bush.  No matter what you pushed
It was politics and camera tricks, very deceptive
Criminalize us and fooling the collective
For the most part, we don't own no boats and planes
We just cop it from papi, bag it in the cellophane
It’s a family thing.  You got to hustle all night
Yo, I seen fiends losing their brains for hard white
Ask my aunt and my brother and my stressed-out mother
How realistic it gets.  It’s sadistic
Statistics show it’s sick how we living
The one thing bigger than dope games is prisons
One million niggas inside.  Over three
Million is tied, but the president lied
 
because
The white house is the Rock House, Uncle Sam the Pusherman
This is for my people on the island

Selling dope, serving weed.  We had
To hustle to hustle just to eat
Selling dope, serving weed (Selling weed).  We had
To hustle just to eat

But what we gonna do when we’re caught up
And have to face responsibility?  (This that ghetto shit.  This that ghetto shit)
What we gonna do when we’re caught up
And have to face responsibility?  (This that ghetto shit.  This that ghetto shit)

"Food, Clothes & Shelter",The Set-Up,UnKnown,"Yeah.  For all my peoples that's hungry

A nigga need food: you got to have food for your health
And clothes: gear to keep esteem for yourself, son
Shelter: a place to lay for rest when you're stressed
Over life cause it's trife and ain't no God gonna help ya

I feel the winter heart creeping
Vicious as the wind, which is life
When it's deep without a meaning.  A trife scene it screams
Niggas fiending—the pipe dream and some be seeming
Like the only way to keep breathing in the slums, but nothing comes
And keeping funds is like dreaming
My situation: no solution—even the young become demons
Where I'm from, shit is unyielding.  Something like three-hundred
Million
Gun-wielding black rats trapped in one building
With low ceilings and no feelings
Cutthroat villains, dope dealings, and glossy-eyed pavilions
Sunken faces and powder traces
My people slave for the basics
The powerless devoured in the matrix
Of politics, pimps, and glass pipe
From gun blast and flicking off blunt ash, the cash heist
The fast life, where the have-nots rule
Stick and grab plots, toting tools, victim last by some jewels
'Round the world, we stay stuck in capsules, shackled
And crackas got homes like castles
I figure the only way this nigga got to go is wild
Plotting licks for liberation, stocking cap style
 (x2)

He's just hungry for knowledge, that's all.  Yeah, that brother's starving!  So am l.  Let's get something to eat

Yo, I was born in the storm, hearing gun clap for thunder
See my childhood peers catching years in the numbers
I wake up from hunger, try to lift my stress that I'm under
How I made it this far makes me wonder
You in a fight for ya life, for basic human rights
Can't afford the booming prices—it's economic crisis
Life is a sacrifice.  I'm down to my last bag of rice
They forcing us to live like laboratory mice
Like fucking laboratory mice—that's right
You wear the camouflage, but do you choose to live the soldier's life?
I said before, ""This is a war, not a play fight""
Taught to be a slave from the womb to the gravesite
Some of us even share the views of the Canaanites
Tryna be white, but they gon' lose in this game of life
So dead that.  I tie my dread back and scheme
Put a star on my red, black, and green
 (x2)
 (x2)
Pay the bills, put food on the table, and put clothes on your back.  You understand?

What do power mean?  Our team
Seem to think it means sour cream
Cause our dreams got us fiending for the power, son
And Huey P. said political power come from the barrel of the gun
What do power mean?  I believe in thieving
And smoking weed—everything happen for a reason
I hope my seed grow up and get even.  It's open season
And if you poor and black, you know the reason
Yeah

Nah'mean?  We out here fighting for the basics.  (Tryna get all we can get).  Tryna get food on the table, clothes on our back, pay these bills.  Dead Presidents.  That's the come-up for us.  Food, clothes, and shelter.  Ain't no need to even say nothing else.  (Word up)

Sacrifice my life in combat for ya
So you know I gotta love ya, I'm down for my brothas
And sistas.  Fuck the system, bust ya pistols.  Nigga, I'm with ya
Just put a rag on ya face when you ride—you don't want them satellites to take ya picture
We gotta have a lot of discipline to win and it comes from within—it's not somethin’ you pretend, homie
A lot of niggas be talkin’ that shit.  When it really goes down, they be gone with the wind, homie
Can't be no coward.  Gotta get this power by any means
Gotta know yaself and ya enemy when you puttin’ it down for ya family
Can't tell by no tattoo, can't tell by no handshake
It start with the heart, bein’ down is an attitude—doin’ what you gotta do for the crusade
My definition of a soldier: revolutionary, military-minded, and ready for whatever
Nigga, hope for the best and prepare for the worst.  Stay aware, be alert, bomb first, don't tear

Tell me: are you down?  When it's goin’ down
You got to hold it down—don't talk it, put it down
Homie, tell me: are you down?  When it's goin’ down
You got to hold it down—don't talk it, put it down
Homie, tell me: are you down?",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-down-lyrics
Window to My Soul,"Turn off the Radio: The Mixtape, Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin’",2003,"My big brother. Revolutionary love
You know your lil brother love you, dawg
You know your sister love you, dawg
You know your mama love you, dawg
We riding right here with you dawg
Be strong man. Keep pushing forward. Look here
You're my brother and I love you and I wrote this for ya
If I could change anything, it's what that dope did to ya
Coming up, I looked up to being just like you
Same crease in my khakis tried to dress like you
You getting swole lifting weights, stocking caps with waves
I'm trying to see the world how you see it, wearing you shades
You and pops never really got along, who was right or wrong
15 years old kicked out all alone in this cold world
And I can only imagine what you was going through
Cause I was so young when it happened
Mama cried like a baby that day
She never blamed you, it was painful
Cause she knew the streets was waiting to claim you
Over time, we could see the hardness in your face
Wanted to help, but couldn't find the words to say
I guess I went into denial hoping for the very best
Stopped believing in they God cause what God would allow this?
Not in my wildest nightmares, nothing compares
To see my brother be a crack fiend for all these years
Tried to send you inspiration when you was locked in the pen
But soon as you came home you right back on that shit again
And mama say she don't feel safe with you home
She got to hide money and lock her room door when she gone
We still love you but until you find strength in yourself
And the will power to open up and accept our help
What can we do? I can't let you terrorize mom dukes
We feeling like we just gone have to turn you loose
They say in war there's no victory without causalities
But when it hits your family that's when you really see
Like a window to my soul, you can see the pain in my life
Got to make a change in my life (it's a struggle every day)
And it's not impossible to make a change in my life (gotta keep pushing forward)
I can make a change in my life, I know (ain't no other way)
I know it's hard coming home to the same old shit
Ain't nothing changed cause the game don't quit
The pain inside is still throbbing
The same conditions that first created the drug problems still exist
And it's a bitch, got to go to the job or starve
Without a gun every day employees get robbed
And on days off, we blow off them crumbs like nothing
Getting high cause a nigga gotta get into something
But we get trapped in a cycle of pain and addiction
And lose the motivation to change the condition
I blame it on the system but the problem is ours
It's not a question of religion; it's a question of power
How did black life, my life, end up so hard?
Why do so much injustice go unresolved?
Why the ones we call governments be the main causes
Behind why all the dope is coming through the borders
Television reporters got the facts distorted
Making scapegoats of every black youth on the corner
It's a war even though they don't call it a war
It's chemical war unleashed on the black and the poor
And who benefit? the police, lawyers, and judges
The private owned prison industry with federal budgets
All them products in the commissary
Tell me who profits, it's obvious and it's going too good for them to stop it
In my mind, my body, and my soul, I need a change in my life
We need a change in our lives, you know
And it's not impossible to make a change in our lives
We can take the pain from our lives, fa sho
We don't own no boats
We don't own no planes to bring no dope
We don't make no cellophane (bags to bag it up)
We just caught up in the game
Don't you know
Don't you know it's bigger than this shit
I know you know. I know what's in your heart dawg
I love you til the end of time. And again and again
I'mma be your brother, your comrade, and your friend
Til we win and even then",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-window-to-my-soul-lyrics

Till We Get There,NBA Live 07 Soundtrack,UnKnown,"Til we get there
Til we get there
Til we get there

Here we go, from the poorest and blackest of people
To survive in the streets of Mogadishu
The most dangerous armed and lethal yet peaceful
We no evil, I come from the slums that's run down
Spit native intelligent tongue sound
Would rather get gunned down than dumbed down
So come down

Much success to you comrade
To who I wrong, if it's never been said before, my bad
I took a page from the book of Martin Luther
And decided that it's better to hug you than to shoot you
I'm sorry homie if it's not what you used to
But the way that we livin' these Black lives is beautiful
All the things we've been through and the tree we done bloomed
We probably family but we never knew

Til we get there, I'm on your side
Til we get there, I'm on your side
And it can take some time, til we win this fight
Til we get there, I'm on your side, yeah

That's what's called solidarity
When we struggle it's therapy, after chaos we get clarity
My enemy's enemy is my man remember
I ain't tryin' to be endin' up in this man's dilemma
We only here for a minute, it's what you make it so live it
See, I'm a rider and I'm gon' be remembered
For those of you not born, to those of you not here
I wish you the best and that's real

This ain't ya average, when they portray us they say, all savage
Cause we have it, blast it, won't stash it
Cause we fight to the death and manage
To makes songs of struggle and to habits
And dammit, if I don't get even
It's chant down Babylon season
Die for New Orleans to Cleveland
Til we even, we not believin'


I love when we makin' plays
I love all our brilliant ways
I love when we get paid and never move away from the hood
We keep gettin' while the gettin' is good
You right at home in our neck of the woods
Cause we people, momma said treat others like you want 'em to treat you
We just wanna live and be peaceful
Long as it makes sense, I'm a have patience
Especially with my brothas I go back in the day with
We speak the same language, suffer the same dangers
Cause our children are victims of lead paint chips
Out in L.A. they put the Black against the Mexicans
Old rivalry is throwin' up they sets again
They put the short against the tall and the old verses the new
Pretty soon it's gon' be me against you
All the things we been through and the tree that we bloomed
I wish you much success and stay true",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-till-we-get-there-lyrics

Life is like a game of basketball
They just want niggas to run jump and shoot
Chorus:
The game, of life, is a struggle to survive
We live, to win, cause if we lose, than we die
Verse 1:
Whats the word for the day homeboy
It ain't nothin but this killin shit
Tryin to get this money right quick
You know how it is
Nigga tryin to eat food and live, smoke weed
Payin rent on my crib so I can breathe
Life is not about the quickest speed
What you achieve
Come degree by degree
And what you get is what you see
In your mind visually
And manifest physically
If you stick to it shitll work out terrificly
Take me, everyday my life be hectic and stressful
Never really know if ima ever be successful
But the best things you get out of life require struggle
If it dont you gettin hustled homeboy
You gettin hustled
How I see it
Anything you wanna be you can be it
If your mind can preceive it
And your heart really believe it
Than you half way there and all you got to do is do it
And if you give it all you got there ain't really
Nothin to it

Verse 2:
As a, black boy
Started out a bundle of joy
But quickly I grew playin with toys
Than you started makin noise as a youth
Tryin to figure out the truth
Behind the shit that the schools ain't tellin
First come rebellin, then come drug sellin
Juvenile court, cause you too young to be a felon
Knew that everything around you was yours
But you gotta maintain the game of wealth that the
World has in store
A wise man told you before
You got the power to bring things to life black boy
You can test it
Everything you see is just a thought manifested
But before you had a chance to know that
You got arrested
And it all seems clear to you know, you can breathe
It was different
When you couldn't see the forest from the trees
If you follow your dreams you can accomplish anything
If you always do your best then your destiny is king
Of the world

Dont let life mislead you
You have the power
People dont let life
Dont let life deceive you

There's nothing to discuss. Just make adjustments, time is up

Consuming, not producing. We got a problem, Houston
Its worse than genocide, they get inside your mind
Tricked 'ya. You thought the finish line was 1999, didn't 'ya?
Try to save the trees but you can't go green without that black and red
If we gon' get free we got to change that lightbulb in our head

The end of the world don't mean too much to us
It's a new beginning
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust to us
It's a new beginning

They dollar's losing value, but the hood knew that already
The price of gas been rising, at times we can't afford it
The oil supply is leaking, facing a global shortage
According to news reporters, every year its getting warmer
These violent weather patterns, some say it's just nature's karma
They planting they seeds of fearing, genetic engineering
Interfering with the crops and now the bees are disappearing
Don't know what is upon us, just know one thing for certain

Everywhere the white man go, he bring misery
All throughout history—look it up

Every government he set up, it be corrupt

Revolution

Dead prez, People Army, Steve Marley, Ghetto Youth Crew

What you know is who you are—who are you?
Do you know who you are in the world?  What is your world view?
What do you go through?  What has your life shown you?
What are you learnin’ in this so called life?
Do you have principle or do you blow with the wind?
Do you wanna be free but don't know where to begin?
Do you know your enemy from your friend?
Even your kin is deeper than skin—it’s the system they keepin’ us in
Will we survive?  Do you believe?  Are we afraid?
Would you rather have control of your life or be a slave?
Show me a sign.  A pig ain't no homey of mine
They own me what's mine—I'll show you if you loan me your nine
I'm only concerned for tables to turn
When the people learn the truth about the system, the cities will burn
And I stand firm, like Shaka Zulu
These crackers can't stop uhuru

Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Chase those crazy bald heads right out of town

This is what we be waitin’ for?  21st century, still poor
World war, they want me to kill for
What happened to the future they always predicted?
With new science fictional things and space visits
I've seen two sides—us against them
Police troops ride with four to five men
Prison businesses boomin’, senators grin
People searchin’ for answers.  Where to begin?
Capitalism born from the backs of blacks
White folks relax, live off the kick backs
Gettin’ worked to the bone, yo, build this country
Further exploited by class to make money
Filthy rich capitalist with blood loot
Use main frames systems to bank and compute
With the next technology, credit through the wires
Internet growth demand more suppliers
Welfare, elderly checks, and wage workers
All us, elephants trapped in they circus
Ain't fightin’ over manmade chips no more
When the lights go out, it's gon’ belong to the poor

Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Chase those crazy bald heads right out of town

Everything you got is what you took from me
Conditions on my block, just like we in slavery
Everything you got is what you took from me
Conditions on my block, just like we in slavery

I'm feelin’, oh, what I feel

Everywhere the white man go, he bring misery

Where the warriors at?
Where the riders at?
Where them fighters at?

Fixed up, touch the sky, feels great, 
natural high
Sweat dripping down the block, healthy life, I’m out the box
When I run I'm in bliss baby, feel so good I don't wanna stop
Free my lungs of that marijuana, get my burn like a marathoner
Sunday 
hotter than Arizona,
 time travel anywhere I wanna
(I’m a long distance runner)


All seeing, all knowing, so free and mind blowing
Omnipotent, magnificent, liberated, feel mad different
We all talented, all gifted, tap into this raw spirit, it's unlimited
So call it a vivid suspension, expansion another dimension
Free from the box that we're trapped in
We bout to blast off, are you strapped in?
T minus and counting, imagine the ocean, the deserts
The glaciers, the clouds and the mountains
(See what I wanna see, feel what I wanna feel
Be what I wanna be, to know what’s right and what’s real)
Invincible, unshakable, earth quaking but unbreakable
Unstoppable, don't stop until there’s no rock a few, now I got the joke
I come from the jungle, I drink from the fountain
I looked and I found this, as innocent Roberts
Who died and backed out to the big bang
15’s of guap, we doing big things
(Until the fat lady sang)


I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I tell ‘em what’s right and what’s real
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I tell ‘em what, I tell ‘em what’s right and what’s real
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I just wanna time travel, to know what I don't know
I'm Zen'd up and I'm zoned out
I just wanna time travel, to know what I don't know

Still evolving, adapting, changing
Time is moving, let’s embrace it
Past conditions, forward motion
Pour libation, the way it’s open
Ancient wisdom, the tribe has spoken
Let the circle be unbroken
Eye of Horus
, wake the Buddha
Mayan calendar – see the future
Higher consciousness, revolution
Evolution, to better humans
God particles, spirit molecules
Science terms for what our G's already knew
Hieroglyphics, ancient temples
Know our self, infinite potential
Boundless options beyond the doctrines
We are the universe, break your boxes
(Let’s go)

Chorus:

Know your enemy, know yourself
That's the politic
George bush is way worse than bin laden is
Know your enemy, know yourself
That's the politic
F.b.i., c.i.a., the real terrorists
Know your enemy, know yourself
That's the politic
George bush is way worse than bin laden is
Know your enemy, know yourself
That's the politic
C.i.a., f.b.i. the real terrorists

You got to watch what you say in these days and times
It's a touchy situation, lotta fear and emotion
September 11th
Televised world-wide
Suicide planes fallin like bombs from out the sky
They wasn't aimin at us
Not at my house
They hit the world trade, the pentagon, and almost got the white house
Now everybody walkin round patriotic
How we gon' fight to keep freedom when we ain't got it?
You wanna stop terrorists?
Start with the u.s. imperalists
Ain't no track record like america's, see
Bin laden was trained by the c.i.a
But I guess if you a terrorist for the u.s
Then it's okay
Uh huh

They try to make us think we crazy
But I know what they doin, they tryna put us back in slavery
Check it, to get on welfare you gotta get your fingerprints
Soon ya gotta do eyescans to get your benefits
Now they got them cards to swipe, ain't no more foodstamps
Shoulda seen it comin, now it's too late to get amped
And everything got a barcode
So they know what you got, when you got it, and what you still owe
You seen them projects, lately you better watch it
Why they got us surrounded if money is the object?
Why they use satellites to keep track of the criminals?
Why they puttin jails in schools, is it subliminal?
Cameras everywhere to protect us from one another
Or is it the undercover, disguised as big brother
And even freedom of speech is limited
Mad leaders done spoke up, and look at what these crackas did
(chorus)

And you ain't got to believe me
Go 'head and listen to bush
The dope pusher on the t.v
What you think the war is for?
Cause the greedy wantin more and more
We be hustlin the corridor
I would never join the military
One soldier to another, nigga holla if ya hear me
Goin out to the best sons and daughters
Don't be a lamb gettin led to the slaughter
I'mma keep ridin when my momma released
Cause ain't no stoppin us now, dawg
Freedom before peace
Ugh
They got a plan for us?
We got a plan for them
And this time we gon' win
Who in? you out? you in?
No doubt, we men
Ain't no ridin the fence
It's called self-defense
It makes sense
When they tell us we gotta shackles on our brains (say what?)
I'll be damned if I sit here and let them put us back in chains

Well did you know the pen, is stronger than the knife
And They can kill you once, but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh is not the ending to life, fear not of the Anti-Christ
Did you know that I, exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go a Zion and a wear jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
Your bodies just a vehicle
Transporting the soul
It's what's inside people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Every day dem' flesh it grow old
Changes of the time take toll

Somethings got to give
The system is the problem but it ain't' just gonna' change
The people got to fight as one to break free from the chains
We livin' in a time
Where whitey got us cornered
Shackles on the brain, police on every corner
Lookin' for some soldiers but they so hard to find, my elders say be patient cos' things come in time
Not fast enough because, yo

And make the motherland a mystery
Cuz we too strong for them dis we
Because it was, and now it is and it will definetly be
Because they days is up
Blaze it up

Raise it up
Push it up
Fill up your cup
We had enough
We gonna buck
Now is the time
Open your mind
And you will find
It's a design
No matter what you do
No one can stop the time
Me want no

Look how they dealt the deck
We inherited stress
Had to bury our best
Martin, Malcolm X
Bullet holes in they chest
We adapt to the struggle
Only way we survive
Eating scraps from the table
But it kept us alive
Making something from nothing
Still we hope for the best
Making miracles happen, daily coping with less

Raised in the ghetto
Singing songs – called survival
But eating soul food to
Have you dead on arrival
Hand on the rifle
Other hand on the bible
Strong as an ox
But look at what you put inside you
We resillient beings
Do the silliest things
Know better than you better
Cause that’s what experience brings
Break out of jail
But can you break out a sickle cell?
We say we livin well
But we living in hell
We already been to the other side
We ain’t turning back, now we choose a lie
To many goodbyes, and that ain’t right
We feel it inside, it’s time to fight
We already been to the other side
We ain’t turning back, now we choose a lie
To many goodbyes, and that ain’t right
We feel it inside, it’s time to fight

Crack Donalds, Murda King
What happened to eat your greens?
Eatin some or anything, abusing Mary Jane
Chinese chicken wings, everyday hood thing
5 hour energy, red bull and Hennessey
Head bobbin but the organs full of toxicity
Pack a cool menthol, nicotine pit fall
They have the nerve to
Put cool on the pack so they can trick y’all
Slave to the Dutch master
Colon cancer victim
Tell you on the package
But we still blame the system
No squares in my circle
Screw all that sippin purple
I’m tryina live to my potential
Age is just a number
A G preserve his temple
A G control his temper
No discipline, you slippin
No toxins in my kitchen
Slavery is over cousin
But then at lunch it wasn’t
If food is the last plantation
Then I’m Harriet Tubman
Advocating colonics

These Are the Times,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The televisions have eyes
The modern religion is lies
Plotting a collision world wide
Watch the hour glass, the power clash
Over currency for world supremacy
Burroughs is burned down deliberately, son
We ain't about whats devil level
Smell the gun metal
King to mo' man
I read Mao Tse-Tung
Feel the foul taste that run on my tongue
Burn a L for everyone of my sons
There so much more than just herb in my lungs
Similar to spilt Mercury
With enough force
They could've killed Hercules
This whole nation was built
Virtually, from capital to captivity
The earth could be the modest tomor'(tomorrow)
You not listening
It's cold outside
They got the whole South side
Using bar codes
Military blocks on all the state roads
And worse, somebody's child got hung
They took his pants off
Covered his whole body with ants, and cut his hands off
The type of shit that have your brain bleedin'
They about to start scanning the back of niggas hands
To get your vein readin'
They call it New World Order
But, son, this game is in the fourth quarter
World War 3, don't drink the water
Because...

These are the times that try a nigga soul
Population control, we wasting time chasing gold
They after more than your mind
They want your nation as a whole
It's time to take off the blindfold (I know)

These are the times that try my thug sole
White collar crime
Deaf tolls, gold, and drug sold

I call it black Holocaust
Some say all is lost
But in the end
Your life is all it costs
Pronounce counter insurgency

In case of emergency
They building mad prisons with urgency
Son, I solemnly swear
They keep them slugs in the air
Until they murder me
Shut down the government
Revolutionaries be lovin' it
Clinton flee the country in a bubblejet
Trouble is yet to come
For each crime, they tryin' niggas three times
Then probably prosecute me for this rhyme
International nickel and dime hustlers
Move weight and muscle us around
But my army bustin' rounds
Shells covered the ground for miles
Street like from here to Capitol Hill
And you can read it on a dollar bill


I know (I know)
The time (the time)
They trying to take this world (world)

They breakin' windows out with canisters of tear gas
Put out the cannabis
We fighting canibals with silver badges
I feel the madness in the wind
Like a premonition
Dee got the ammunition
Puffin' reefer while we cleaning pieces
None of my niggas don't believe in Jesus
We fight a war against the beasts Chevrolet Caprices
Whatever way we find feasible
Sometime shit be unbelievable
I'm seeing skeletons in parked vehicles
Put all the terrible types behind sandbags
My philosophy is much more than snatch your handbag
I'm talkin' shit like hand-to-hand
Man-to-man, clan-for-clan

Some of us will pass away

If we take it light, end of conversation

Dropped herself in your arena

My spirit is ready, for the awakening
The awakening
Empty your mind of all thoughts
Let your heart be at peace
Returning to the source of serenity

A courageous walk down the Mississippi road
We live in the blues of the delta
A good morning to your neighbor
A good night to your dreams
We are the song of survival
A living song without lyrics or words
A kind gesture, a wink of the eye
A loving touch upon a child’s head
A strong warm hug to keep away the doubt
Grandma's, grandma’s hands upon your face
The wiping of the wavered tears
Holding back the fizz
In between in-between the shoe shines and the dish washing
In between in-between the GED’s and PhD’s
In between in-between the out-houses and crack-houses
We, we create waves to live and love
We live on the move
Moving, moving forward through the bling bling
The prison camps, the clothes castors and the hoes and bitches
And the 
alcohol
 and 
Jesus all on the same corner
We are the one and true living God
All around us is life
Our humanity, our humanity is the essence of life
Our blood, our blood nurtures the soul
Our humiliation and pain gives an expression
Our ignorance gives vision
To what’s like living contradictions, living paradoxes
Living phenomenons, living just for the city
For a smile, for a touch
For hip-hop, for the glory of our ancestors
And the blessings of our gods

Refuse to lose

As a man thinkin it becomes his reality
I used to let stress build up until I learned
That stress'll eat your insides up like worms
See worry is the cousin of death
Thinkin negative you might as well go ahead and bury yourself

Like ian, you hafta have the heart of a lion
I been through my share of this hell, but still I rise
Many days didn't know what to do
But we survived
Every struggle is a test, a lesson
You just gotta figure out how to overcome and catch the blessin
They want us to turn to dope and lose all hope
Spirit broke and confused
But I refuse to lose
Through fear, through pain, through loss
I can't stop
Won't stop
Till we make it to the tip top
This is hip hop
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I refuse to lose
(I, I will not lose)
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I refuse to lose
(I, I will not lose)
Ay yo, failure ain't an option it's a death sentence
You can't survive without no food that ain't no sustenance
Plus when it's crunch time
Back on the wall
Life on the line
Before you lose your balance and fall
You will find that it's an instinct
Act first and then think
Second law of nature, self preservation
Move without reservation
No hesitation when it comes to me and mine
Do you come from that design or do your compass need alignment?
I'm mercernary
My assignment?
Kill or be killed, a sin or a skill?
However you define it
A sa siembra victoria
Revolutionary propaghanda intended to raise warriors
Ain't nothin like this world crisis
The price of life is measured by the lifeless
It's brutal but I fight this
Supply, demand, inflation rises
We can't afford the rice
There's nothing to eat
I know it's hard to digest
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I refuse to lose
(I, I will not lose)
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I refuse to lose
(I, I will not lose)
They say the best revenge: success and living well
No more throwin them coins down in that wishing well
Go out and get your own
We all reap what we sow
The end is all on you
What you gonna do?
I got bass strong enough to cut through a coal mine
Hold a goal in my mind till I reach the gold mine
Overtime grind
With no days off
But ain't nothin like the feelin when it all pays off
All it take is the thought of my son for motivation
Long as I'm alive you can't break my dedication
Family first
Everything real in the field
It's a cold game
Life don giva fuck how you feel
We live in a material world or so it seems
But I ain't got nothin to lose but bad dreams
When I woke up I was already 17
But I was determined to break the cycles I'd seen
When I learned that the blood in my veins came from kings
It curdled, when I looked at the present day scene
But the same pressure that turned my brother to a fiend
I face it, embrace it and convert it into steam
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I refuse to lose
(I, I will not lose)
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I refuse to lose
(I, I will)
(I, I will not)",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-refuse-to-lose-lyrics
They school,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Why haven't you learned anything?
Man that school shit is a joke
The same people who control the school system control
The prison system, and the whole social system
Ever since slavery, nawsayin'?
I went to school with some redneck crackers
Right around the time 3rd bass dropped the cactus album
But I was readin' Malcolm
I changed my name in '89 cleaning parts of my brain
Like a baby nine
I took a history class serious
Front row, every day of the week, 3rd period
Fuckin' with the teachers had, callin' 'em racist
I tried to show them crackers some light, they couldn't face it
I got my diploma from a school called Rickers
Full of, teenage mothers, and drug dealin' niggas
In the hallways, the popo was always present
Searchin' through niggas possessions
Lookin' for, dope and weapons, get your lessons
That's why my moms kept stressin'
I tried to pay attention but they classes wasn't interestin'
They seemed to only glorify the Europeans
Claimin' Africans were only three fifth's a human being
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we tryin' to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Tellin' me white man lies straight bullshit
They schools ain't teachin' us, what we need to know to survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies
You see dog, you see how quick these motherfuckers be to like
Be tellin' niggas get a diploma so you can get a job
Know what I'm sayin' but they don't never tell you how the job
Gonna exploit you every time know what I'm sayin' that's why I be like
Fuck they schools
School is like a 12 step brainwash camp
They make you think if you drop out you ain't got a chance
To advance in life, they try to make you pull your pants up
Students fight the teachers and get took away in handcuffs
And if that wasn't enough, then they expel y'all
Your peoples understand it but to them, you a failure
Observation and participation, my favorite teachers
When they beat us in the head with them books, it don't reach us
Whether you breakdance or rock suede addidas
Or be in the bathroom with your clique, smokin' reefer
Then you know they math class ain't important 'less you addin' up cash
In multiples, unemployment ain't rewardin'
They may as well teach us extortion
You either get paid or locked up, the principal is like a warden
In a four year sentence, mad niggas never finish
But that doesn't mean I couldn't be a doctor or a dentist
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we tryin' to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Tellin' me white man lies straight bullshit
They schools ain't teachin' us, what we need to know to survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we tryin' to get all we can get

Tellin' me white man lies straight bullshit
They schools ain't teachin' us, what we need to know to survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies
'Cuz for real, a mind is a terrible thing to waste
And all y'all high class niggas with y'all nose up
'Cuz we droppin' this shit on this joint, fuck y'all
We gon' speak for ourselves
Know what I'm sayin'? 'Cuz see the schools ain't teachin' us nothin'
They ain't teachin' us nothin' but how to be slaves and hardworkers
For white people to build up they shit
Make they businesses successful while it's exploitin' us
Know what I'm sayin'? And they ain't teachin' us nothin' related to
Solvin' our own problems, know what I'm sayin'?
Ain't teachin' us how to get crack out the ghetto
They ain't teachin' us how to stop the police from murdering us
And brutalizing us, they ain't teachin' us how to get our rent paid
Know what I'm sayin'? They ain't teachin' our families how to interact
Better with each other, know what I'm sayin'? They just teachin' us
How to build they shit up, know what I'm sayin'? That's why my niggas
Got a problem with this shit, that's why niggas be droppin' out that
Shit 'cuz it don't relate, you go to school the fuckin' police
Searchin' you you walkin' in your shit like this a military compound
Know what I'm sayin'? So school don't even relate to us
Until we have some shit where we control the fuckin' school system
Where we reflect how we gon solve our own problems
Them niggas ain't gon' relate to school, shit that just how it is
Know what I'm sayin'? And I love education, know what I'm sayin'?
But if education ain't elevatin' me, then you know what I'm sayin' it ain't
Takin' me where I need to go on some bullshit, then fuck education

Together (together)
The motherfucking ants (the ants)
Can conquer (can conquer)
The motherfucking elephant (the elephant)

This is for Mumia and Sundiata.  Herman Bell, we got ya
Mutulu Shakur, we want you free with Assata
And Giuliani
, yo, you can swim with the lobsters
I hope you mobsters lose your livers to the vodka
Somebody needs to get took hostage
This is preposterous
Got a whole nation up in bondage
It might sound rash, but nigga we about to crash
We're in a race for life, you thinking it's for cash flow
I'mma be the asshole coming in the party to harass you
Or should I say, ""Fuck it!"" and just dance too?
But we don't dance no more, unless it's capoeira
We the new rap era of natural born guerillas
‘Cause anything can happen if you make it so
I'm like George Jackson—.45 in my afro
I'm like Marcus Garvey coming with money to blow
Saying I want an army of boats full of niggas that led revolts
So on that note, I'm sick of these scared millionaires
Better get your nuts back ‘cause crackers thinking it's theirs
Drop a jewel not a bracelet
Face it: 90% of us still fighting for the basics

Yo, I'm true to the struggle, not new to the struggle
Been through many trials, many forms of hustles
Spent nights in the county for bullshit charges
Fist fights with police, cussing at the sergeants
Beef over females—you know how that goes
Niggas' egos turn best friends to foes
I've been robbed, beat up, scared to fight
Niggas busting shots off, had to run for my life
But I ain't no gangster-wannabe thug
Never glorify selling dope ‘cause I seen my brother on drugs
And it's painful, this game's so dirty and foul
Even the hospital just might murder your child
If you ain't careful
But I'm a rebel to this whole era
African root, imported like capoeira
Ready for whatever—that's where I want to be
Able to destroy any enemy in front of me
Or inside of me, see.  That's a jewel
If I overlook the enemy within, then I'm a fool
Can't judge a book by its cover
Can't trust every sister or brother
‘Cause they could be undercover
DT’s, BP’s got jewels for days
From making mistakes, I learned to correct my ways
And it pays to stay humble, study your lessons
Don't wanna see your own blood on your weapon

DP—not to be confused with niggas who just do music
It's that true shit (ghetto prose)
Not to be confused with niggas who just do music
It's that true shit (ghetto prose)


Yo, don't be yelling, ""People's Army!"" if you ain't training
Just wanna rap like it's all about some entertainment
How we too busy to train but got time to smoke?
Ain't got no money for class, but got an ounce of 'dro?
We could be learning how to sew, get skills that's useful
Instead of this fake thug shit we used to
We could bling, but a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
That's why the whole People's Army got to keep in sync

EME, UNO, you know
PA.  Niggas is opposite of the po-po
We say, ""Together, the ant can conquer the elephant""
They say… fuck what they say ‘cause shit is irrelevant
Soldiers, where's your heart?  Show me the love, what you made of
This is the shit that could make thugs
Turn revolutionary, 360°.  He with me, she with me
Anything for you—give up my kidney
Yo, it's in my blood like shots of Remy
What's gotten in me?  I see the goddamn enemy
Stic, give me the gat so I can smoke this cracker
This is Uhuru, nigga.  Blak-a, blak-a, blak-a
I study Chairman Mao, Malcolm, and Mau Mau—who with it?
It's self-defense.  You want the blao?  Come get it
BEO, BLE, soldiers living better lives
For self and for family, do or die

The Hood,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Goin’ out to the block, come on
All the homies in front of the liquor store
Little girls jumpin’ rope
Grandmas hanging out the windows
All the hustlas tryin’ to get that dough
The whole hood
Walk with me

It’s the congressman, and the policeman
And the businessman, working hand in hand
And the way they play, we don’t have a chance
Gotta give my life in my own black hands
Because I can’t take it anymore

I seen the pigs harassing this little kid on my block
So I stopped my car and jumped out like why not
What y’all doin’ to that man I’m sayin’
Them handcuffs too tight for his hands, at least pull up his pants
Undercover van jumped out on ‘im, he shoulda ran
They talkin’ about they had something in his hand
Then them crackers tried to intimidate me
They even threatened to arrest me
But I’m thinking to myself these motherfuckers can’t touch me
Plus I know my rights, and I’m lookin’ out for his
I got a right to stand on this block, this is where I live
I’m stayin’ right here, folks start crowdin’ around
Niggas at the liquor store seen it all go down
They say police been on the creep , all this week
Doin’ sweeps grabbin’ anybody standing on the street
And we outnumber these motherfuckers a hundred to one
They think they can’t get it cuz they got a badge and a gun
But then, little man’s mom came downstairs
She was screamin’ on them crazy when she seen her son in tears
We’ve been goin’ through this same bullshit for years
Livin’ in fear, you have no fuckin’ idea
What it’s like to be the prey, all day, every day
Don’t want minds to grow up and catch the same way
So I stayed until the lil’ homie got released on the spot
It felt good to see the hood push police off the block
Cuz the…

It’s the congressman, and the policeman
And the businessman, working hand in hand
And the way they play, we don’t have a chance
Gotta give my life in my own black hands
Because I can’t take it anymore

It was a hot day, record hot, hundred degrees
Niggas irritated and broke, perfect for summer beef
Franklin Avenue crews, wore wifebeaters and brews
Then my homie’s sister came through with the bad news
Niggas threw on they shoes with straps ready to move
My nigga Ryder got cut because of his shoes
On Washington Avenue, where niggas don’t like blue
And if niggas don’t know you then niggas don’t like you
But I know them niggas too, yeah they know the rules
Why I gotta come to the tools before we catch dues
And since I be comin’ through, I'mma see what it’s bout’
Check it out, if I see a spark, imam put it out
By the time I arrived, it was live, the war was on
I’ve seen blazed hands into shirts, I knew where it was goin’
So I threw my hands up, tried to reason with them soldiers
Blood was in they eyes and they was shoulder to shoulder
(?) that’s a nigga in jail, not to mention another nigga up in the white man’s hell
They said, move out the way before somethin’ happen to you
Call me crazy or brave, I said do what you gots to do
Yeah, we quick to retaliate when the enemy us
But when it’s pigs on the block I don’t see nobody bust
Yeah, we quick to retaliate when the enemy us
But when it’s pigs on the block I don’t see nobody bust
Word up

These are the hard facts, time for the hood to uprise
We gotta organize ourselves, we gotta mobilize
But there can’t be no confusion, ‘bout our collective solutions
If not for ourselves than for our kids, cuz we know who our enemy is

It’s the congressman, and the policeman
And the businessman, working hand in hand
And the way they play, we don’t have a chance
Gotta give my life in my own black hands

Don’t Hate My Grind,Pulse Of The People - Turn Off The Radio Vol. 3,UnKnown,"I'm close to the edge
Don't push me

Yo, this recession got a nigga losing calories
Can't get no food in your stomach without that salary
Gotta come up by any means, my mentality
Don't wanna dream about it, gotta bring it to reality
On my side of town, this ain't new, this is life
If you ain't lived it then you have no idea what it's like
To go to bed with excruciating pain in your abdomen
So hungry you can't sleep, you just lay awake imagining
Big dreams, big schemes, big risk takin'
Penitentiary waiting for me if I'm mistaken
Paying dues, can't lose, failure's not an option
The only way is up when your coming from the bottom
Tired of watching all these companies get bailed out
And the only thing that poor people get is another jail house
That's why ain't nothing patriotic in me
For they system my heart is empty

Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate my grind
We gotta find a way
Though things is getting rougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

Another day up in this servant concrete village
Trying to live in a world where they just rob and pillage
I'm waking up in the clothes that I west to sleep in
I pick up my pistol and I get back out on the creep
And I see the same bullshit I just saw the day befo'
Drugs and the murders and my people trying to play me yo
I ain't about that bullshit and they already know it
I don't want to have to kill but still I can't show it
So I mean mug them, screw face them, and I twist up
Hand on my strap while I'm balling my other fist up
Pass me the piff and roll me another spliff up
Cause one way or another my nigga I'm finsta lift up
Above the troubles and the stress and the mess
I'm just hoping that the good Lord is choosing me to bless
I'm tired of this world trying to fuck me like a pussy
My nigga I'm close to the edge don't push me

Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

Ain't no retirement from this profession
Plan B is the Smith & Wesson
It's reliable
No 401k for this runaway slave
Fuck tomorrow when we hungry today
But you don't here me though
We be surviving off of Cheerios and videos
We get a dose of the high-fructose and there we go
A recipe for the grind, AKA the struggle
AKA the muscle, AKA the hustle
It's hard enough for us to trust one another
When I see you as a threat, not my sister or my brother
I hope one day we put this all behind us
And resurrect the grind museum for memories to remind us


I feel like Melle Mel on ""The Message""
I'm close to the edge don't push me
I'm trying to hold my head but its hard out here for a pimp man
The cemetery's waiting for you if you slip man
Another day of oppression
They call it possession, it's media misdirection
But you know what get's greeted by repression?
A long overdue, much needed insurrection
It's a cold world, but I'm a grown man
And a grown man needs power in his own hands
Ain't no sitting around, waitin' complainin'
Unless your in love with the plantation",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-dont-hate-my-grind-lyrics

 What I wanna sayyy

Everytime I look around, I see
So much drama goin down
Everytime I look around, I see
So much fakeness goin down

Why I'ma- be stingy when I could share?
Why I'ma- be hateful if I could care?
Why would I hate my own?
Or forsake my own?
Why would I- fuck around and get a jake on my chrome?
I wouldn't- have to stick you if we all could eat
It wouldn't be no need for beef
Dyin over streets we don't even own anyway
You could get bucked off anyday
We behind enemy lines
Y'all still writing Hennessy rhymes
While I'm tryna find a good price for a nine
Feel like my life on the line
That's why a nigga be hype all the time
Ready for the revolution at the drop a'a dime

I got a duty to have security for my niggas
My duty to serve the beautiful black sistas
A duty to stand wit' anybody that's wit' us
And fully criticize all bullshittas
There should be awards presented to niggas who fight back
Like Panther jackets, or sistas who light gats
I'm a full-blooded warrior, ready for change
Recognize any soldier that's doin the same
Because I love who I am, and that means everything to me
My life ain't worth a damn unless I'm dealin with reality
When I look myself in the eyes, it's just me
And I ain't gotta tell nobody no lies, I feel free
And I would rather deal with the truth and falsehood
Than bein fake with my people and claimin' 'it's all good'
You can't run away from ya self, so that's useless
If your word is bond, then you don't have to make excuses

Everytime I look around, I see
So much drama goin down
--Hold up! 
 Wait a minute!
Let's take it back to the old school
 Yo, 'memba back in the day?
When sh- everything was all smooth 'n calm
And shit was like - snap? on, nigga

Its not a word to be claiming jus cause it sound cool
The game's so twisted today for lack of ground rules
Is a man of his word a man of action
Never begging, complaining he make it happen
It's not the image they selling us on the TV screen
Is a suvivor, a rider provide by any means
Moving stragey outsmarting his enemies
Ready to give his life, you still wanna be a g?
It's not something you claim just because you from the hood
Everything twisted the game is so misunderstood
Used to be a protector, man of the people
Now they most followers man, where are the leaders?
A ghetto superstar is cool but I know something harder
You dont know gangsta till you know about Bunchy Cater, Aunty Assata, Sundiata Acoli
Not to disrespect their legacy but thats the real OG's
The one who has the biggest mouth to be the biggest coward
No time for petty beef a gee is about getting power
Thats why you can only be down after initiation

He was a mean one nah he was born one
He dont ever say a thing when the law comes
He dont need a posse of brothers that act wild
He works a Hard Job and tries to raise a black child
He breaks bread with his people like Jesus did
He tried to explain to the children what the evils is
Knows the spots where the crack, coke and diesel is
Did some time in the pen now he diesel kid
He know the penile system is part slavery
Knows that the judge on the stand is where the pagan be
Knows freedom is priceless it takes bravery
He knows I ain't an animal but they caging me
He plays DP thinking about his DP's
Wish he had a hundred guns headed up to DC
He wants change like Obama did
Probably lived where your mama lives

Is is the bandana, the hat, the loafs or the gatt
I tell you off the bat hell nah it ain't none of that
It ain't the smell of the chronic the broken ebonics
They be the main ones poppin that shit but they dont want it
Willing to live or to die for what he believe in
He know the code of the streets you can't decieve him
A gangsta's word is his bond you must respect that
He keep his flag and his rep well protected
Is it the bankroll? The bulletproff tank? no
Look at his tattoos the women about to faint so
He could of went to jail but been the biggest snitch Or
He could when you trust your loyality you switch

When Mama Cries (Real),"Turn off the Radio: The Mixtape, Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin’",2003,"Dead prez ft. Jamila and Umi - “When Mama Cries”



Why do babies cry?
‘Cause they knew they were born in the eye of the storm
And my mama cried
On the day I was born ‘cause she knew I would die

Aww shit.  Another young brother hit
They got me doing my dips and loading my clips
Bloomberg name taste like shit on our lips
Projects flipping, niggas is shitting on pigs
It ain’t a war where we live no more.  It’s a massacre
Brothers ain’t trying to ride.  We’re in the passenger seat
And everybody just trying to eat
But I’m trying to eat, then live, get high, and get free
Don’t tell me I’m deceiving myself.  If that’s the case
I’d rather meet reality now, a gun to my face
Than play-fight with police and get shot in the back
So they could dirty my name and sprinkle some crack
Tell me that’s not how we’re getting down.  We had some principles
I guess some things is different now.  Broken promises
We made to my homie’s mom.  They killed her only son
And now she crying in my arms.  Be strong

Don’t cry, don’t cry, don’t cry no more
‘Cause it won’t be long.  We will survive
Don’t cry, don’t cry, don’t cry no more
‘Cause it won’t be long.  We’re gonna ride

I cried when 2Pac died.  It was a Friday
We sat up that whole night, bumping “Shawtay”
I felt the same way when I lost my cousin Padre
Why so many niggas had to go out the hard way?
Nobody knows the reason we’re here.  We’re just surviving
From day to day, caught up in a game you got to pay to play
Life is just a series of days that fade away
Every day, the sun rises, but nothing changes

I feel the sadness.  I’m trying to console his family
And tell his mama that her son is still standing
I know he left you and life is full of pressure
But, in me, you’ll find a piece of his spirit
And, as children, the block was our prison
We couldn’t escape the bid that we was given
Learning lessons, searching for directions
Clinging to the truth, poverty kept us desperate
Was steady grinding with our minds on survival
Had plans to build a fam without dope or violence
But, in a second, niggas is left breathless
We was caught in a storm, being born as black men
And life is tragic.  My nigga’s in his casket
It got me loading clips, ready to bust a cracker
I can’t replace him, but I’m here to help you face it
Consider me your son ‘til it’s my time to face death

Don’t cry, don’t cry (Don’t, mama), don’t cry no more (Don’t you cry)
‘Cause it won’t be long.  (You know that) We will survive (We will survive)
Don’t cry, don’t cry (Don’t, mama), don’t cry no more (Don’t you cry)
‘Cause it won’t be long.  (You know that) We’re gonna ride (We’re gonna ride)

Mama, hold your head up high (Hold your head up high)
‘Cause it won’t be long (You’ve got to be strong).  We’re gonna ride
Mama, hold your head up high (Hold your head up high)
‘Cause it won’t be long (It won’t be long).  We’re gonna ride

Bang for change, make the change.  That’s on everything.  It’s on for life",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-when-mama-cries-real-lyrics
Footsteps,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lies is like poisonous snakes—slick and colorful
And that's how most niggas get bit—for being colorful
See, I believe a liar is a fucking coward
And by the same batch of lies you tell, you get devoured
Tryna copy the next man plan.  Make your own
But I know how it is—when you young, you think you grown
And you wanna be the most popular, follow the latest trend
(What?) Mack a lady friend, (What?) push a Mercedes Benz
But most niggas don't live how they tell you
Rather lie on theyself than be considered a failure
But for me, I'd rather be myself and be nothing
Than to rise and shine, and I know I'm just fronting

Sometimes, life's been so funny
You never know who's in your corner
You never know who's by your side
So don’t be sad
Just be aware that's the way it goes
Take control, take control
And let yourself go
Follow the footsteps

Your conscience tries to be your guide
But you refuse to listen (Why refuse?)
Now tell me how much you will roll
When you get to where you've got to go
Follow the footsteps


I love who I am and that means everything to me
‘Cause my life ain't worth a damn unless I'm dealing with reality
When I look myself in the eyes, it's just me
And I ain't gotta tell nobody no lies, I feel free
And I would rather deal with the truth then falter
Than being fake with my people and claiming it's all good
You can't run away from yourself, so that's useless
If your word is bond, then you don't have to make excuses
Excuses, excuses…

Put your best foot forward
And ride the wind
Look a man in his pupil
See if he truthful
Footsteps
We all on a journey
Don't nobody know why we’re here
We're just forced to have to deal with the realness
Every day
Every day of our lives

Footprints in the sand

We're talking about a bailout for some of the wealthiest banks in the world, and yet we can't seem to help our own citizens who are having foreclosure crises--

--the bailout on the house floor, warning it could destroy the dollar, and the global economy--

--working families are suffering, unemployment is over 10% in my own district, we have over 2,300 people who have lost their homes to foreclosure, retirement and pension funds are losing value, local government can't make decisions--

For a five dollar bill
Certain parts of the real
You can get your blood spilled
On the concrete
Little 17 year old nigga doing foul in the hood
On the prowl, out in these streets
I've been in the same situation
Heartbeat racing
You come up or you don't eat
I done had to sleep in a train station
Going stop to stop, but no place to be
Paperchasing
Filling out applications for weeks
Just trying to get up on my feet
But they ain't hiring
So a nigga's forced to resort to the streets
Just to make ends meet
It's called survival
The struggle continues
If it offends you
Let me remind you
We all have instincts
To do what we have to do
To make it through
And this drive is primal
Whether you at MickeyD's taking an order
Or coming from Florida transporting a quarter
Or on a corner
We all got needs
I gotta feed my son
He gotta feed his daughter
Naw, I ain't no capitalist-exploiter
But I know the rules of supply and demand
Whoever controls the product
Controls the supply
And, well, hey that's the law of the land
Make your own stimulus plan


People lie
People cheat
People steal
People will
Do anything

Dollar bills don't make you royal
It can kill you
It can cure you
Love for money
Root of evil
I say lack of it
That's more accurate
Army, navy, special forces
Rob the land of its resources
Gold, oil, guns, ice
Gas, corn, beans, rice
It's your life
You better think twice
How bad you want that?
Name your price


Don't ever think slavery was just about race
Slavery was about money
They say the USA was founded on freedom
But slavery built this country
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln
Hamilton, Jackson, Grant
Were all slave-owners
And even today
From Clinton to Bush
They running the same game on us
They so-called war on terror
Is just a ploy to get more cheddar
Dinero, the root of all evil
They come in bombing, shooting, exploit the people
And call it freedom
It's a cold game
And it's the same from the top of the food chain
All the way down to the little homie in the street gangs
Slanging cocaine, it's how they do thangs
It's the American way
Imperialism, have it your way
Whatever it takes
Whoever gets fucked in the process, that's okay
That's how they play
So you can't blame us
Them dead white men on that paper ain't us
We still gotta hustle for the benefits, man
My grind is my stimulus plan...


And my constituents are concerned about
Where the 700 billion dollars is going
They want to know
Because they get up every morning
They work hard
They give up their tax dollars
And they're trying to figure out

I ain't scared to die, I ain't got shit to lose
Plus I ain't happy here, no, I ain't happy of your family
I ain't scared to die, even though I wanna live
Deep down inside I'm a cross between homicidal, suicidal
'Coz I was born to give my life like the Messiah
Smokin' weed till I can?t get no high, tryin' to ease the tension
Heavenly Father, did I mentioned in my confession
The world got me stressin', maybe death will be a blessin'?
 grew up learnin' lessons in the street
From seminary to 72nd in Lacey in the east
Side of Oakland, California I was on my own at a early age
That's why I'm filled with rage
I know the system is responsible
For the conditions of my black folks in the ghetto
All across America, their funk is deeper
I put the message in the music to wake you up out your sleep but
How could I keep my head above the water
When the force of the current is pullin' me harder than I can swim?
Sometimes I feel like I oughta die the death of a martyr
Before they kill me, I'ma slaughter 
I ain't scared to die, I ain't got shit to lose
Plus I ain't happy here livin' on a planet full of fools
I ain't scared to die, I ain't got shit to lose

Plus I ain't happy here livin' on a planet full of fools
I ain't scared to die, I ain't scared to kill
I'm a righteous black gorilla from the hill of 72nd in Lacey St
To all my comrades in the pen, wait for me
I swear to God, I'ma set you free
Even if I gotta lay it down in the dirt and if I'm lyin' I'm dyin'
If I'm dyin' atleast I died puttin' in work
And if there's Hell below, we all gon' go
Death can't hurt unless we die slow
Sometimes I look up in the mirror starin' deep into my own eye
Searchin' for the strength to carry on
Wonderin' if I died a physical death
Will my people remember me when I'm gone?
The ghetto is a warzone, 7200 is my head code
'Coz when the funk is on I pop the clip up in my chrome millimeter
The Grim Reaper, keep my heater in my shoulder
 soldiers at the hideout
Righteous black gorillaz 'bout to ride out, to put the smash down
Run up in the bank, yellin', ?We want the cash now?
To finance a revolutionary struggles all around
Lay it down on the ground
And if I hear the sound of a siren
I won't hesitate to get the firin' on everybody in the buildin'
Killin?, I'm a villain because I'm black
Put your hands up to the ceilin', keep on fillin' up the sack

Fuck The Police,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro)
Fuck the Police...
(Verse 1)
You couldn't ever understand how my mind ticks
I'm on some old school crime shit
Where niggas hold tools and keep the dimes lit
Ain't no rules when these iron shots is thrown
Dun, this heat burn through ya flesh straight to the bones
I reach for the buddha-sess & zone
I'll probably have a future of stress
State-impressed and be alone
But as far as the present time, it's on
I represent mine til I return to the essence
And I'm dead & gone
Nobody wanna be broke & you neither
But put me on the corner
An' watch me catch a quick case of CREAM fever
If you be popping shit, my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face
And take ya wallet when we see ya
But son it gets deeper
I'm running wit a click that speed a hundred by the grim reaper
To all my niggas in the man keeper:
Let your situation be a teacher
Ain't nothing like an education
When I was locked down
I learned about patience and dedication
And not say shit
Unless you need a motherfuckin' face lift
And as a youth I was an outcast
Running 'round with pellet guns, playing war
But now it's all about cash
And say no more. I keep it raw, keep a gun
I'll go to hell wit a slug in my jaw 'fore I obey they law
And love, it ain't no secret
My previous lifestyle, juvenile delinquent
Devious night prowl was frequent, creeping
Reach for your shit? Don't even think it
Nigga get slick and try to cock it
Unless you want your face shot, drop it
Crime rule the world and ain't a Jake that could stop it

I'm caught up, caught up in the mix and shit
And I ain't tryin' to hear shit
Yo my crew got cash ta get
Blast you wit the pistol if I have to
In my mind, its all about cash in the fistful (x2)
Yeah, Fuck the police (x6)
I'm a no-meat-eatin', vegetarian, revolutionary people army...yeah, yeah
(Verse 2)
I hold the weed too long when I be thinking bout my mom
And all this things gone wrong in the past
And what we do for this cold hard cash
Nowadays it seems like we age fast in dog years
Like 7 to 1
Though I was born back in '72, I'm still young
When I speak dun, I speak it for millions of children
And tax paying black kids who never said they prayers
Blame it on the governors and mayors
'cause they pimps and players
With the tracks on they arms as old as I am
Watch what you be doing 'cause they see you through the skycam
Power means the man who controls the land
He hold the key to selling drug paraphernalia and contraband
Its something like pushing narcotics
Cigarettes and tar products
Some people say you can't trust an addict
But I believe that life is a habit
And that's why we teaching our seeds how to load an automatic
I'm one with my gun, I love it like my first son
It protects me and makes sure the Jakes respect me...
I'm one with my gun, I love it like my first son
It protects me and makes sure the Jakes respect me...

Shuffering and Shmiling,Red Hot + Riot: The Music and Spirit of Fela Kuti,UnKnown," (scat singing)

(to the ancestors)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot (to the warriors)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot (to those who came before us)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot (long lived the revolution)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot

Religion is like prison
Keep the people locked up in different divisions
Some of them promise you heaven
But I see a whole lot of bullshit ism-scism
Imperialism in the form of spirituality
Slave mentality, escape reality
What we supposed to just suffer and smile and be content?
Sendin our prayers to the clouds? (stic.man - uhn uh)
I want my heaven now, freedom on earth
And if the preacher ain't with us, then we takin his church
What is it worth to have the biggest religion
When the people got miserable living conditions?
No water, no lights, no rights
All over africa we fight, but we have to unite
Cause ain't no power in the gospel
When the priest puttin powder in his nostril
And the elder's council fails to lead
And the children suffer from daily need
And the people can barely eat
Is it a sin to stand up
To fight against the ones that put is in handcuffs?
Goddamn, what happened to the daily bread, spread love
And not what the bible said, but in the name of the bible
How much love is spread compared to how much blood is shed
Chorus:

Everyday my people get inside the bus
(women - shuffering and shmiling)
Everyday its the circle
(women - shuffering and shmiling)
Everyday my people get inside the bus
(women - shuffering and shmiling)
Everyday its the circle
 (scat singing)
(women - shuffering and shmiling) x4
Everyday its the same thing

Yo
Every day I wake up is a miracle, thank you
Seperate religious and the spiritual, thank you
See, I dont be askin in the air, every action is a prayer
The bear won't attack me, I be, attackin the bear, see
Back in the day I used to work in a bookstore
My job was to find whatever book you look for
I remember one day this lady came for a bible
We was out, so I started showin here other titles
Tryna share information about a religion
Everything that I showed her was written by christians, still
She got the hell up outta the place
Wonderin something about me shakin her faith
Now, knowledge is power, we spread information
How strong is your faith? what it take to be shaken?
Yo, I think she missed what jesus was sayin
Can't keep your eyes closed to a revelation
You could be speakin in tongues
Could be speakin of sons and daughters
My reflection of course, within the water is
Beautiful, attractive, my musical contraption
Classified as unusual practice but
Thats what it take to be a man
Free the land, crash down on babylon like the sea to the sand
Peace to the fam, we want you all to stay strong and live long
Like a de la song, c'mon

Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot

This way of life, ain't right
Pray all day and night and don't fight
Poped up, doped up
Work three jobs to fill the gold cup
No water, no food, no lights, no rights
No power til the people unite
It's gone - divison and they work us in prison
Look round, how my niggas is livin
Everything we make, they takin it to the bank
While we sittin up in the church to give thanks
Don't you know the preacher got bank? (m1 - uhn uh, uhn uh)
Don't you know the deacon smoke dank? (m1 - uhn uh, uhn uh)
Did you ever think the bible was a prank? (m1 - uhn uh, uhn uh)
Somebody bout to faint
Before they came
They had the bible, we had the land
Now, we got the bible, they got the land
And what do you believe in, heaven or hell?
Life is what you make it, so thats why I rebel
Uncle sam, got blood on his hands
Good god, how the devil can dance
Nobody wanna help a nigga
Put your hands together, do it yourself my nigga
Don't sit there
You won't have nobody rushin to die
So do something don't just suffer and smile

Life goes on, (hey one how ya feel?) the world keeps (yeah) turning & life goes on (let's go)
Life goes on
You stuck back in the day, but homie it's 2009
Every thought you think is a seed you plant that grows within your mind
Better focus on your grind
It's real out here
The game don't wait
We fall down
We suck it up
We get back up and make a way
'Cause the past is yesterday
And the future never comes
The present is a gift
This moment is the only one
You can't rewind the clock
Time is all we got
And once it's gone
It don't come back
Whether you like it or not
Gotta play to win
If you ain't happy - make a change then
If what you doin' ain't workin' it might be time to change plans
You lookin' at a changed man
From where I used to be
It's no fear
I ain't going' nowhere
So get used to me
I shook off the dead weight
Freed up my head space
Now my priorities in order
And my bread straight
With even greater faith
So let the haters hate
For one thing we got in common that we can't escape is:
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
Life goes on
Some people blame they parents
For what they shoulda done
Or what they didn't do
Or what they wish they woulda done
Caught up in the past
Trapped, 'cause they can't forgive
But you can make a choice now how you wanna live
You can be negative;
You can be positive
But either one is up to you
It's your prerogative
It's not what happens to us
It's how we handle what happens
The ups and downs in life give us understanding and balance
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
(Yo, yo) Life goes on
Gotta take it day by day
The pain just seems to fade away
Look at pictures in my mind
Everything just turns to shades of gray
The cornerstone; without you the family fell apart
Can't put the pieces together
We don't know where to start
Had a show in South side Chicago, it was a cold day
Cold playing, repeat playing
No way, I keep saying
Think about my momma locked up in that dungeon, Godforsaken;
And when she find out her momma dead, how she going to take it?
Got an older brother and we argue every time we speak
Every relationship is different
Ours is unique
Shoulda said I'm sorry 'fore I went to school in T-town
I got your memories
I got you on the rebound
Walk with the ancestors - Grand mommy
And if I start to get weary, please stand by me
I just want the world to know your grandson was thinkin' of you
I guess it's never too late to say that I love you
So this one is for you
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on
Life goes on, the world keeps turning & life goes on

One slip out here, these crackas will hang you
Only the strong survive
No choice, you gotta ride
Young in age but your mind is wise
Walking strong with a King Tut strut in your stride
Black pride and I'm young, hungry, born to survive
Don't collide with him

Ya, I hear all that righteous shit you talkin' man, fuck that. I gotta get out here and get this money, man. My daughter feet grow everyday. I'm broke out here. Ain't nobody giving me no jobs. I gotta get it one way or another

Little child, little child
Runnin' wild, runnin' wild
Little child, runnin' wild
Whoah, ya
Hey, little child, little child
Runnin' wild
Little child, runnin' wild
Whoah, hey

Growing up in this world today is not easy to do
Either your choosing your path or your path will choose you
Lil' Khazi got big shoes to fill for his fam'
He's so young it's hard for him to understand
That he's the man of the house
He know the time, his momma work overtime
And his attitude (a milli, a milli, is '09)
Go to school just to battle MC's in the cafeteria
Fell asleep in third period to the theory
That the president is black so he should try to be that
Better yet, put a gat on your back and go to Iraq
But he already done chose a side
A bonafide People Army soldier rollin' for life
Mind sharp as that switch blade knife in his back pocket
Ain't no crack in his sock
He got bigger dreams
And even more than money countin'
He ready to move mountains
The future Kwame Nkrumah
And he know it's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it

Shoot, you gotta feel me man. Not a day goes by it ain't a shootout. My gun is all I got in these streets. I'm 'bout myself, and when I need help, the only thing I can rely on is my gun game


I love to see the homies cliqued up, fists up
Khakis on, STAG bandana rag twist up
Hood pride, unified
G'd up, ride or die
Street tribe
Real soldiers don't die, we multiply


You got people all around the world nodding their heads to what people are saying. So when you're conscious of that, then ya know, you can do more than just say, ""this is a hustle"", ""I'm trying to make my bread"" or ""that broad got a big ass"". Come on. There's more important things in the world. I know you and stic do it everyday",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-runnin-wild-lyrics

Beating they charts and graphs, yo I'm beating they God
And I'm not the only one, see the drama is common
Asked my homie what he been through and he started bombing
He said, don't, push, me
I done pushed crack cocaine, and I done pushed dope in my vein
I done sold it to my main man moms too, it's horrible
The things we do, in pursuit of the loot
Ghetto currency, we was trading food stamps
Seven for ten, so I could chip in on the sack with my man
Ghetto clinics give dirty abortions
And then, evil scientists pass out pills and cut foreskins
Cut off like orphans in group homes
Lost in the system, foster care victims
Wards of the state, the more they take the more they make
We tiptoeing through a pit of snakes, but wait

Everything I been through
Has made me what I am
The struggle must continue on
Cause that's what made me a man

Nigga, I'm from the dirt roads
Tallahassee
Used to keep the .38 under the front seat
Selling dime bags, on the south side
Throw on that Bone Thugs shit and just ride out
Stayed at my mama house til I was seventeen
Hit the streets, getting into some of everything
Caught a gun case, but that was bullshit
I didn't even stop and think before I pulled it
Seen the county jail, way too many times
Growing up, revolutionary state of mind
Kicked out of high school, for my world view
That's when I figured out what they really there to do
My brother cracked out, sleeping in the streets
He come popping up, we ain't seen him in weeks
I been in hospitals, stitches put in my grill
With no health insurance money when they sent me the bill
Been in McDonald's, slaving, late in rent payments
Homeless in New York City walking the pavement
Been on, emergency stamps, verbally amped
At the social worker for trying to tell me she can't help me
I been in, fights with wifey, physical conflict
Scratches on my arms and wrists, hitting with fists
But I been through with them days, focus my rage
And niggas still keep it moving on the worst of my days, nigga


I been, cuffed and stuffed, enough is enough
I'm supposed to been gone, so I'm calling they bluff
Been at, gunpoint, heart boom-boom-boom-boom
Been running for my life, yo I knew I was doomed
Since I been alive, I been hearing these lies
Been gone, been back while my homeboys died
I been in, crack house raids, packing the gauge
I been from, braids to dreads and dreads to fades
I been a, music junkie since back in the days
Been waking up to Prince, went to bed with Maze
I been, through the court, looked the judge in his eye
Been through the worst days when I wanted to die
I been, high off that gray, slinging that yae
Mix it with hey, wake til the break of day
Been to, Botswana, felt the sun on my skin
Been to Germany and don't wanna do it again
I been, through a lot, don't be surprised
Got a lot to get, I been getting organized
It's been, 29 Roman calendar years
Since I been here, still overcoming my fears, nigga
Been won, tell me where you done been
Bet I been through the same shit as most my friends
I been, motivated since my moms got pop
Won't stop til I been to the mountaintop
And back

I done been through the worst you can do to me
Lived with dope in my family
And even in the penitentiary, still survived
Stronger than chains and hunger pains
Stronger than slavery or AIDS
Stronger than every drug you make
Still alive",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-unbroken-lyrics

With that 38 under the seat
What you know?
Yo
Whoever said life is beautiful lied
This shit is hell
I've seen too many funerals
Too many of my niggas locked in cells
Nobody ever put me on life was like this
I'm 20 years old and my whole life's a crisis
No way out
And I mean that
When I say that
Runnin' round from place to place
Like a stray cat
I don't own nothing, don't hold nothing
I'm growin up with nothing to show for all my hustlin'
Still strugglin'
And a job is a joke
They ain't hirin'
The only free ride I get is one with a siren
So what other choice do I have?
I got niggas on the ave
Pushin slabs that a break me off a Porche and a half
So I can stand on my own two
Be able to have what I need
So I can do what I want to
I wish I woulda had a career
Cause through the years my momma stressed
Takin care of self
But I ain't here
I was caught up
Sipin on Coors
Smokin Newports
Short
In and out of court
Without a single thought
These days I'm out bout to Loc
Whether I make a record or serve dope
I refuse to keep bein broke
Cause times are getting rougher by the second
As long as I come up
Who give a fuck about the method
It's a kill or be killed kind of a theory that's in me
So when I die, at least I'm taking somebody with me
If I'm wrong, than I rather be wrong than right
45 calibre chrome and its on tonight
Nigga
That's how I'm livin
Low life, runin licks
Taking big risks
Tryin to get my motherfuckin flow right
Cause without loot it's useless
My life as a youth was fruitless
That's why nowadays I'm ruthless
Plus I got a lady in my life
That one day just may be my wife
If I can deal with this crazy strife
I put love in the air
Show that I care for her
Let her know I always be there for her
But right now the type of life I live
Can't afford no wife and kid
I gotta fight for my right to live
So I cock my hat low
Snatchin up pocket books and float
Cause I'm a thug and that's all I know
Whatever it take to make the steps
I'm ready to take the steps

Fear Not The Revolution,Turn Off the Radio Vol. 4: Revolutionary but Gangsta Grillz,2010.0,"No reason to get scared
Change is necessary
Somebody gotta' do somethin'
Who better than us?

Nothing to fear but fear itself
Use your experience like wealth and get rich b*tch
I know n*ggas that fear success
So they sabotage they self
I question their mental health
Help me understand it
I'm battling with my demons like the next man
But I expect to stand victorious, vainglorious
Head up and encourage us, like Afeni did to Pac
It can send you into shock
It can bring you to a stop
Shook stop in your tracks
Fear of our responsibility by Ho Chi Minh
If you're looking for a weakness hope you don't see me
We're so gangsta but scared of our own shadow you see
It's your reflection
And we're searching for direction but our compass is broke
Put it in your GPS and still don't know where to go
It's the heart
It's the spirit
It's the soul
Trust yourself, if it's green then go
If it's not then don't

This is the revolution
This is our only solution
This is officially a takeover not a makeover
We on our way soldiers

Crime scene forensics, syringes
Dope fiend binges
The pain seem endless
My soul cringes
Old women asleep on park benches
It's heart wrenching
Below poverty level existence
No public assistance
They system is against us
We runaway slaves, political prisoners
They manufacture disease, create sickness
Then they rent you the cure for the symptoms
To them it's just business
We the fuel for they corporate engines
A swastika and dollar sign should be they emblem
We the have nots without a pot to piss in
Living in third word conditions
I don't wana be a victim no more
So much stress living under pressure in the trenches
The struggle is a lifelong sentence if you listen
You can hear the wretched of the earth in the distance
Coming for our day of vengeance

This is the revolution
This is our only solution
This is revolutionary but gangsta grillz
This is what's really real",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-fear-not-the-revolution-lyrics

Lady liberty dressed in drag
Silver badge
No country for old men
Renegade policeman
True evil
Oppressor of the people
Blue lethal
Psychopathic
Arm of the state
Licensed to kill
In the inner city he hunts and lurks
Blood thirst
Vampire sworn to protect the evil empire
It’s business
Mercenary, no code of honor
A blue wall of silence
His actions cause riots
Murderer, terrorist, racist, supremacist
Terrorize the residents
Intimidate the innocent
Power unlimited
Targeting the prey with the hoodie and the jewelry
He the judge, the jury and the executioner
Redneck Lucifer
The streets is on fire for all the years he been abusing us
I fiend to throw his ass off of Lakeview terrace
So I ran up in the precinct and I shot the sheriff

It’s been a longtime coming
And I can’t hold out much longer
It’s been a longtime coming
And all the waiting made it stronger
It’s been a longtime coming
And it’s way too late for you now
It’s been a longtime coming
And there’s nothing you can do
I’m on the warpath

And I’m gonna hit you like a freight train coming
On the warpath want to hit the ground running
I’m on the warpath
I’m on the warpath
I’m on the warpath
[Verse 2: M1)
Ayo my brain fried and I’m off duty
I’m about to pull out my gun and go and shoot me a movie
You think you hardcore?
But you ain’t ready for war
When you see me coming pray for the lord
You probably just a snitch anyway
And a ditch is your grave
And the president don’t got shit to say
50 shots is nothing, it’s been 500 years
I enjoy seeing all y’all mommas in tears
As I haul your ass off to jail
Stop going to church, praying to god
You’re living in hell
And I’m the gatekeeper
My boss is the Grim Reaper
Better known as the sergeant of the pig department
And guess what’s next for the next generation
I’m about to turn the whole damn ‘hood into a slave ship
You thought that was some shit in New Orleans?
You better watch out for the global warming

When you close your eyes at night
And you think you’re safe at home
You’ll never see me coming
And you wake up all alone
You made your bed baby
And I hope you’ll never sleep
I’ll be waiting for you in your dreams
If you ever get that deep
I’m on the warpath

To wipe the vitamins and natural medicines essential
To preventative healthcare off the shelves
This raises eyebrows as new information emerges from progressive and holistic communities
About the critical importance of vitamin D... discipline
The OGs and elders like Matula Shakur say it is a question of population control
And the people must wager struggle for truth and reconciliation
Next up, if you haven’t seen the fires, well you’ve probably smelled the smoke
Resistance in form in forms of riots and police clashes in cities around the world
90 Cs way informer is reporting live from Philadelphia

Well, Ime Helu, the situation is tense to say the least in front of City Hall right now
Many organizations have valued membership and are out in numbers chanting and raising banners plackets which read a laundry list of grievances
For instance, one read “foreclosure equals war on poor people”
Another read “schools are jails, stop locking up the youth”
And lastly “Mayor McNutter is a buster”

White folks says it controls your brain - I know better than that, that's game
And we're ready for that two soldiers head of the pack, matter of fact who got the gat?
And where my army at? Rather attack and not react
Back the beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock and roll, whether your project's put on hold
In the real world, these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world (world), it's bigger than all these fake ass records
When poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1,2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do, if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame ignitor, crowd exciter
Or you wanna just get high, then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-cry

Because they not, MC's get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talkin' bout how much money they got, all y'all records sound the same
I sick of that fake thug, R&B, rap scenario all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video, monotonous material, y'all don't here me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed, and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice? A dream or some substance?
A Beamer, a necklace or freedom?
Still a nigga like me don't playa' hate, I just stay awake this real hip hop
And it don't stop until we get the po-po off the block

I ain't gotta cover it up, that's what I meant
Sick of payin bills and I'm sick of payin rent
Seem like I work all the time but don't know where the money went
And the funny shit is we supposed to like this shit

It's a war goin on, the ghetto is a cage

Truth fluid, Boots put the funk to it, ain't nothin to it
This is for the G's all the way to the bay

Pay aquit, It's more of us than lies your mayor spit
I'm on some ""Ma hate the game but love the player"" shit
Is you a ""have"" or you a ""have not""?
When you run out of bullets grab rocks
'cause the prison don't slam locks
It don't open when your fam knocks, 'less you rich and have stocks
Fight the power like a motherfuckin Zulu
It's The Coup plus Kanume and Mutulu
So raise your hands in the air like your born again
But make a fist for the struggle we was born to win

When I hear the woop-woop, I be duckin them hoes
I can smell a pig comin, so I stay on my toes
On the low from po-po, so fuck the Ho-lice
'cause peace to me is loaded under my seat
And I know power respect that, so 'serve and protect' that
I'm young, black, and just don't give a fuck - try me
Grillin you right back, you better drive by me
We the People Army is known to get rowdy
And even if you a friend of the blue
You can get it too, snitchin is never forgettable
This Hell we livin is never forgivable

A giving heart

It's the time that we spend
It's the hand that we lend
To a friend when we can

It's the fact that you gave;

And my homies in the same boat going through the same thing
Ready for a cake
Better plot for the paper
We been living in the dark since April
On the candle
Gotta get a handle
My homie got a 25 automatic added to the caper
Nigga get the phone book look up in the yellow page
Lemme tell you how we fend to get paid
We gonna order pizza and when we see the driver
We gonna stick the 25 up in his face
Lets ride, stepping outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hiding in the corridor until we see the dominos car headlights
White boy in the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes
You know what this is
It's a stick up
Gimme the do' from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggas
We running down the block hot with these pizza boxes
So we split up and met back at the apartment
Hell yeah (yo ain't you hungry my nigga?)
Hell yeah (you wanna get paid my nigga?)
Hell yeah (ain't you tired of starving my nigga?)
Hell yeah (well lets ride then)
Hell yeah, Hell yeah
I know a way we can get paid you can get down but you can't be afraid
Let's go to the DMV
And get a ID
The name says you but the face is me
Now it's your turn take my paper work
Like 1, 2, 3 lets make it work
Then, fill out the credit card application
And its gonna be bout 3 weeks a waiting
For American Express
Discoviry card
Platinum visa, master card
Cause we was spooked as shit like we's was targets
Now we just walk right up and say charge it
To the game we rocking brand names
Goin on out the park store chains
We even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po Po never know who to true blame
Sto' after Sto' you know we kept rolling
Wait two weeks report the car stolen
Repeat this like a like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch
Coming out the mall with the shopping bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yea, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right that's how we paid the rent
Hell yeah
Time to get this paper
I'm down for the caper
Please steady on
It's a deadly struggle
We all gotta hustle
This is the way we survive
(repeat)
I know a caper
We can get some government paper
You know food stamps can we really do that
Hell yea, right there for the taking
Fuck welfare we say reparations
And, uh, you know the grind
Get up early get in the line and just wait
Everybody on break that's part of the game
And when they call your name
Ms. Case Worker let my state my claim
I'm homeless, jobless, times is hard, I'm 'bout hopeless
But I gotta eat regardless
No family to run to I'm 22
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
My sad story made her feel close to me
I made her feel like it was an emergency
When I came to the crib niggas couldn't believe
I came back with a big bag of groceries (hell yeah)
Every job I ever had I had to get on the first day
I find out how to pimp on the system
Two steps ahead of the manager
Getting over on the regular tax free money out of the register
And when I'm working late nights stockin' boxes I'm creepin' their merchandise
And don't put me on dishes I'm dropping them bitches
And taking all day long to mop the kitchen shit
We ain't getting paid commission, minimum wage, modern day slave conditions
Got me flippin' burgers with no power
Can't even buy one off what I make in an hour
I'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
I take mine off the top like a politician
Where I'm from doing dirt is a part of living
I got mouths to feed I gots to get it
Hell yeah (you down to roll my nigga?)
Hell yeah (you ready to get your hands dirty my nigga?)
Hell yeah (your woman need money and things my nigga?)
Hell yeah (well lets ride then)
Hell yeah
If you coming gangsta
Then bring on the system
And show that you ready to ride
Till we get our freedom
We got to get over
Please steady on the grind

Out In the World,"Turn off the Radio: The Mixtape, Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin’",2003.0,"Now there's two things that's the same
In every hood, in every ghetto across the world
And that's struggle, and that's dreams
In my hood, Southside Tallahassee, FL
I had both of those, still got both of those
I’ma let you in on somethin’ real quick

Let's take it back to the early ‘90s
Taleho, Florida is where you'll find me
'78 Omega automobile I'm driving
Bass bamblin’ with the wind behind me
Hitch from the attic is the name of the crew
‘Coz road shows and hoes that's all we do
And all three G's believe me, we got that hot shit
To the point that nigga 'bout to quit on college
Parents upset cause I shat on school
Beat spot got hot so I'm playin' it cool
Crew movin' to New York, I'm 22 years old
My girl's stayin' cause she's scared of the cold

Out in the world (Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world (Where they tryin' to take it at)
Out in the world (Where my folk tryin' to get fat)
Out in the world (And every time get set back)
Out in the world (Where my dawgs at?)
Out in the world (Uh huh, fo’ sho)
(Where my folk gonna stay strong)
Out in the world (Let us move on)

Now I'm in the Brook in Decater
Whole different look, different sound and flavor
Washin’ dishes at the Hotel Four Seasons
15 an hour, don't plan on leavin'
Homesick, skippin' work every weekend
Went down, found out my girl was cheatin'
Heart broke, tired, started freakin'
Year later terminated for no reason
Got a new girl as the leaves turn brown
Seein' me stressed said she would hold me down
Had to move to the Bronx where the crooks be juxin’
Sold my first track, moved back to Brooklyn
Music 101, the whole game is dirty
Got me 25, feelin' all of 30
Went from a lover to straight up hustler
Stressed a lot, developed clusters

Out in the world(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world (Where they tryin' to take it at)
Out in the world (Where my folk tryin' to get fat)
Out in the world (And every time get set back)
Out in the world (Where my dawgs at?)
Out in the world (Uh huh, fo’ sho)
(Where my folk gonna stay strong)
Out in the world (Let us move on)

2 G, Y2K bug is gone
Put my gas mask back 'coz them lights is on
Dead Prez in the stores and the streets is groovin'
Hi, I'm still broke and my beats is movin'
Gotta grind harder 'coz my bills is major
Got a cell phone, had to dead the pager
Can't blame the game 'coz the game don't feed you
Can't blame the world 'coz the world don't need you
Seem like every excuse I use is see-through
Help myself first, then help my people
'Coz folks sells hope, runnin' scams to burn me
Wash me, comb me, relax and perm me
Gotta get control and stop this car from swerving
Now I'm kinda cold, only the doe concerns me
Try to spend less than the amount I'm earnin'
Lessons everyday I'm learnin'

Out in the world(Where you tryin' to make it at)

For the days and the nigths
This is life

We born today, and gone the next, this is life
Take your soldier steps, have no regrets this is life
The sun will rise, the sun will set, this is life
We born to live so don't forget this is life
When you’ve done your best, you’ll have no regrets, this is life

Sperm to an egg, prince to a king
It was sent through my genes, run thick through my veins
The seed, the tree, the Ying and the Yang
It's the God within, I reject your King James
No chains on my neck but my mind bling bling
My future it's not defined by street dreams
The sky is the limit gotta spread my wings
And soar, like brainwaves throughout the cosmos
As above, so below to the crossroads
Bringing strength to a heart that has lost hope
Life is a methapor of the seasons
It's a time in your life for some spring cleaning
You got to live it to understand it
We only get a moment on the planet
Don't take it for granted
When you fall into a winter
And your heart turn cold like December
The summer gon' come back remember, this is life

(Mr Curtis, you have been
Lawfully tried in this court
And found guilty on all charges
I do hereby sentence you to the custody of the
Attorney General of the United States
For a period of 15 years to life.)

The gavel slam down, fuck you your magistrate
Another man down for a year and a date
To hibernate, a manchurian candidate
Fucked by the state or is he touched by the hand of fate?
It ain't the end, it's a start
Depend on your heart, it's a dark, like nightvision in darkness
Against the odds like the lotus in the forest
Concrete and bars is just soil for the harvest
You 'bout to incubate, rewind but think your fate
Reinvigorate, reach out for bigger stakes
Reinvent yourself, turn your worries into wealth
180 degrees, you gon' pinch yourself
In your chromosomes, buried in your DNA
Is somebody that's waiting to get free today

Ain't nobody promised tomorrow, that's why you gotta live life",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-this-is-life-lyrics

Ain't no rules when these iron shots are stoned dun
This heat burn through your flesh, stright to the bones
I reach for the buddha cess and zone
I probably have a future of stress, stay depressed and be alone
But as far as the present time its on
I represent mine til I return to the S and said I'm dead and gone
Nobody wanna be broke and you neither
Put me on the co'na, watch me catch a quick case of cream fever
If you be poppin shit my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face and take ya wallet when we see ya
But son it gets deeper
I'm runnin with a click thats bein' hunted by the grim reaper
To all my peoples in the man keeper
Let'cha situation be a teacher
Ain't nothin like a education
When I was locked down I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit, unless you need a motherfuckin face lift
And as a youth I was a outcast
Runnin around with pellot guns playin war but now it's all about cash

I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't tryin to hear shit til my got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol

My life has sped up, many years I'm straight up
Plenty bears for who ain't here and those who ate up
Test and get sprayed up in the club
We couldn't run it so we take the blade up in the booth
Since we couldn't shoot
We heat it up, losin the shirt, showin the bare chest

Don't have to blow the whistle on you

Or they ain't worth a cent
How can you represent, if you can't pay the rent
And leave a dent in my life time, I'm caught up in trife crime
In fights you neva know what you might find
We stand firm meanwhile cuz niggas that seem wild

Drugs Oppress the People Everyday

Selling dope, serving weed.  We had
To hustle to hustle just to eat

Ain’t no hope in the streets—you broke, you sell dope
All my young niggas outside hustling coke
Know the drama.  If you ain’t selling crack, then it’s ganja
I’ve been through it, dun, hitting niggas two for one
Pulling guns out and busting my shits too.  What?
I ain’t give a fuck.  I used to get a rush when I bust mine
Bagging up my nickels and dime, going through
Difficult time, writing my life’s story in rhyme
But when I look at all the niggas they hit with mad time
In proportion to the big kingpins, it don’t fit
You could get caught with barely a half a slab
And the judge sentence you like you ran the ave
I ain’t planned to get rich from selling that shit—it was survival
My game plan was not to get knocked by 5-0
But who am I?  Just a young nigga caught in the mix
And if this weed don’t sell, I'ma cop me a brick

Selling dope, serving weed.  We had
To hustle to hustle just to eat
Selling dope, serving weed (Selling weed).  We had
To hustle just to eat

It’s been a minute since I’ve been in the game.  Some years
Back, I held crack—I couldn't say the same thing
Ask my nigga Bang Double in Raleigh.  We was trouble
Got the fiends’ spot bubbling hot.  We wouldn't never make
A lot—I mean, not like Scarface or Nino Brown
Or George Bush.  No matter what you pushed
It was politics and camera tricks, very deceptive
Criminalize us and fooling the collective
For the most part, we don't own no boats and planes
We just cop it from papi, bag it in the cellophane
It’s a family thing.  You got to hustle all night
Yo, I seen fiends losing their brains for hard white
Ask my aunt and my brother and my stressed-out mother
How realistic it gets.  It’s sadistic
Statistics show it’s sick how we living
The one thing bigger than dope games is prisons
One million niggas inside.  Over three
Million is tied, but the president lied because
The white house is the Rock House, Uncle Sam the Pusherman
This is for my people on the island

Selling dope, serving weed.  We had
To hustle to hustle just to eat
Selling dope, serving weed (Selling weed).  We had
To hustle just to eat

But what we gonna do when we’re caught up
And have to face responsibility?  (This that ghetto shit.  This that ghetto shit)
What we gonna do when we’re caught up
And have to face responsibility?  (This that ghetto shit.  This that ghetto shit)

"Food, Clothes & Shelter Pt. 2",UnKnown,UnKnown,"(stic.man)
Yeah ... for all my peoples that's hungry
(Chorus)
A nigga need food
You got to have food for ya health, and clothes
Gear to keep esteem for yaself, son, shelter
A place to lay for rest when ya stressed over life
Cause it's trife and ain't no god gon help ya
(stic.man)
I feel the winter heart creepin
Vicious as the wind, which is life, when it's deep without a meanin
A trife scene it screams, niggas fiendin
The pipe dream and some be seemin like the only way to keep
Breathin in the slums -- but nothing comes
And keeping funds is like dreamin
My situation no solution, even the young become demons
Where I'm from shit is unyielding
Something like three-hundred million gun wielding black rats trapped in one building
With low ceilings, and no feelings
Cutthroat villains, dope dealings, and glossy eyed pavilions
Sunken faces, and powder traces
My people slave for the basics
The powerless devoured in the matrix
Of politics, pimps and glass pipes
From gun blast and flickin off blunt ash, the cash heist
The fast life where the have-nots rule
Stick and grab plots, toting tools, victim last by some jewels
Round the world, we stay stuck in capsules, shackled
And crackas got homes like castles
I figure the only way this nigga got to go is wild
Plottin licks for liberation, stockin cap style
(Chorus x2)
(M-1)
I was born in the storm hearin gun clap from thunder
See my childhood peers, catchin years in the numbers
I wake up from hunger, try to lift the stress that I'm under
How I made it this far makes me wonder
You in a fight for your life, for basic human rights
Can't afford the boomin prices, it's economic crisis
Life is a sacrifice, I'm down to my last bag of rice
They forcin us to live like laboratory mice
Like fuckin laboratory mice that's right
You wear the camaflouge, but do you choose to live the soldiers life
I told u before this is a war not a play fight
Taught to be a slave from the womb to the gravesite
Some of us even share the views of the canaanites
Tryna be white, but they gon lose in this game of life
So dead that! I tie my dread back and scheme
Put a star on my Red, Black and Green
(Chorus x2)
(Bridge)
What do power mean
Our team seem to think it means sour cream
Cause our dreams got us fiendin for the power, son
And Huey P. said political power come from the barrel of the gun
What do power mean, I believe in thieving
And smoking weed, everything happens for a reason
I hope my seed grow up and get even, it's open season
And if you poor and black, you know the reason ... yeah",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-food-clothes-and-shelter-pt-2-lyrics
“Wolves” Dead Prez,LETS GET FREE ALBUM Dead Prez,UnKnown,"I'm not a hunter but I am told
That, in places like in the Arctic
Where indigenous people sometimes might hunt a wolf
They'll take a double edged blade;
And they'll put blood on the blade
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice
So that only the blade is protruding
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat
And it'll come and lick the blade, trying to eat
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade
Of course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds
And he thinks he's really having a good meal
And he drinks, and he licks, and he licks
And of course, he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself
That’s what the Imperialists did to us with crack cocaine
You got these young brothers out there thinking that they’re getting something
That they’re gonna make a living with
They is getting something so they can buy a car;
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something so they can get a piece of gold;
White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They’re getting something to get a house;
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there’s something that’s bringing resources to them
But they're killing themselves just like the wolf was licking the blade
And they're slowly dying without knowing it
That’s what’s happening to the community, you with me on that?
That’s exactly and precisely what happens to the community
And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn
Handle and the blade in the ice for the wolf
What happens is the wolf gets blamed for trying to live
That’s what happens in our community
You don't blame the person, the victim
You blame the oppressor!
Imperialism, white power is the enemy
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa
Snatched up the first African;
Brought us here against our will
Is the enemy today
That’s the thing that we have to understand",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-wolves-dead-prez-lyrics

I'm a African.  Never was a African-American
Blacker than black, I take it back to my origin

Everywhere we go
Every day on TV
They be talking about
Who you gonna vote for
You got a black man running
But I wonder if he get in
Who he gonna open up the door for?
I don't wanna to discourage my folk
I believe in hope
I just want us to want more
Politics is a game
How they keep us contained
There gotta be more that we could hope for
Democrats and Republicans
Just 2 sides of the same coin
Either way, it's still white power
It's the same system
Just changed form
You wanna vote? please do!
Cast your ballot, let your voice be heard
But what I do want to say is
After the election
You'll see
Mark my words

It's politic time again
It's politrick time again
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again
Shoot the messenger!

This is the most important election of all time
The government's committing the biggest of all crimes
These bullshit politicians say they speaking for the people
Before they ran for office, they were shitting on the people
Billion dollar campaigns
Trillion dollar bailout
Anybody know the definition of a sell-out? huh?
And if Obama win, he wouldn't be the first black
Take your 2 dollar bill and turn it over to the back (you see? right there)
But with the TV on, you only hearing they voice
The system is broken, they trying to beat a dead horse
Go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils
I plot, plan, and strategize with the poor people
The middle class will say this opinion is irresponsible
But if you ain't got no healthcare, they kickin' you out the hospital
McKinney, Clemente, off in the Green Party
No disrespect, we need a Red, Black, and Green Party
Like Marcus Garvey's

Even if Obama wins
Uncle Sam ain't my friend
It's politrikkks time again
It's bullshit time again

The time is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor
And truth is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor

If I Fail,UnKnown,UnKnown,"There was a little and a pur... 
Through two Suburbans and... 

Word is bond, bond is life
I give my life before my word shall fail
A soldier's oath, freedom of death
And I won't stop if I fail

If I fail get back, can't be soft got to be tough
If I fall get back, can't be soft got to be tough
If I fail get back, can't be soft got to be tough
If I fall get back, can't be soft got to be tough
Failure, it's not an option
Real recognize real let's get it poppin'
With mathematics you can solve any problem
That's how we make it from the top to the bottom
Keep ya head up homie and stay confident
It's negativity around but I'm positive
Cuz I'm givin' everything that I got to give
Stayin' true to myself, that's how I keep it real


If I fail then I'll rise
Like a phoenix before yo eyes
Out the ashes and from the dirt
Report for duty and put in work
Eternal life, an iron will
Man sharpens man, steel sharpens steel
The hate you gave, we turn to love
Rest in peace, one thug one love

We can't be stopped if we don't give up
Even though they hold us back we still find ways to come up
A lot of people make promises with no plans to keep 'em
But me, no matter what I'm ridin' till I get my freedom
If I fail, then it's only a challenge to go harder
Don't want to be no martyr so I adapt to things smarter
It's death before dishonor
And I put that on my son and my momma
And don't take it as a threat, that's a promise


If in my quest to achieve my goals
I stumble or crumble or even lose my soul
Those that knew me would easily co-sign
That there was never a life as hard as mine
No father, no money, no chance, no God
I only follow my voice inside
If it guides me wrong and I do not win
I learn from mistakes and try to achieve again
Dedicated to the youth, the truth is the seed
The stronger the root, the stronger the tree
If we eat from the fruit, the stronger we be
If we do it today, tomorrow we free

Yeah, y'all put ya twos up for 2Pac

""The economy right now, is extremely supportive of the president and his policies.""
""FBI scientists have found chemical traces, consistent with a bomb or a missile, on a piece of wreckage.""
""police using clubs and tear gas against demonstrators.""
""they called me a mother -(bleeped out)-ing so-and-so... and a white

Telling lies, to our vision
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our babies
Only truth, can take us...

You can't fool all the people all of the time
But if you fool the right ones, then the rest will fall behind
Tell me who's got control of your mind? your world view?
Is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to?
Know what I'm saying cause Uncle Sam got a plan
If you examine what they telling us then you will understand
What they planting in the seeds of the next generation
Feeding our children miseducation
No one knows if there's UFOs or any life on Mars
Or what they do when they up in the stars
Because I don't believe a word of what the president said
He filling our head with lies got us hypnotized
When he be speaking in code words about crime and poverty
Drugs, welfare, prisons, guns and robbery
It really means us, there's no excuse for the slander
But what's good for the goose, is still good for the gander
See...

I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago I would've been a Panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is propaganda

Verse 2:
I don't want no computer chip in my arm
I don't wanna die by a nuclear bomb
I say we all rush the pentagon
Pull out guns and grab the intercom
My first words will be I believe
Man made god, outta ignorance and fear
If God made man, then why the hell would he put us here?
I thought he's supposed to be the all loving
The same God who let Hitler put the Jews in the oven
We don't fall for the regular shit, they try to feed us
All this half-ass leadership, flipping position
They turn politician and shut the hell up and follow tradition
For your TV screen, is telling lies to your vision
Every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
Running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots
It's a plot, but busta can you tell me who's greedier?
Big corporations, the pigs or the media?
Sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
Commercial airplanes, falling out the sky like flies
Make me wonder what secrets went down with Ron Brown
Who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
It's not coincidence, it's been too many studied incidents
It could've been the Klan who put that bomb at the olympics
But it probably was the FBI, deep at the call
Cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law


Police is telling lies fooling millions
What are they teaching our kids in these school buildings?
Televised, enterprised in all the killing
Controlling our lives, this ain't living
No this ain't living

FBI, CIA
ATF, KKK
IRS, TNT
CBS, NBC


""Uh, we view each other with a great love and a great understanding. And that we try to expand this to the general Black population, and also, people-- oppressed people all over the world.

And with this realization, we attempt to form a strong political base based in the community with the only strength that we have and that's the strength of a potentially destructive force if we don't get freedom.""",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-propaganda-dead-prez-lyrics
“They Schools”  Dead Prez,LETS GET FREE ALBUM Dead Prez,UnKnown,"Why haven't you learned anything?
Man that school shit is a joke
The same people who control the school system control
The prison system, and the whole social system
Ever since slavery, naw I'm saying?

I went to school with some redneck crackers
Right around the time 3rd Bass dropped the Cactus Album
But I was reading Malcolm
I changed my name in '89 cleaning parts of my brain
Like a baby nine
I took a history class serious
Front row, every day of the week, 3rd period
Fucking with the teachers head, calling em racist
I tried to show them crackers some light, they couldn't face it
I got my diploma from a school called Rickards
Full of, teenage mothers, and drug dealing niggas
In the hallways, the popo was always present
Searching through niggas possessions
Looking for, dope and weapons, get your lessons
That's why my moms kept stressin'
I tried to pay attention but they classes wasn't interestin'
They seemed to only glorify the Europeans
Claiming Africans were only three-fifths a human being
HOOK:
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we trying to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Telling me white man lies straight bullshit (echoes)
They schools ain't teaching us, what we need to know to survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies
You see dog, you see how quick these motherfuckers be to like
Be telling niggas get a diploma so you can get a job
Know what I'm saying but they don't never tell you how the job
Gonna exploit you every time know what I'm saying that's why I be like
Fuck they schools!

School is like a 12 step brainwash camp
They make you think if you drop out you ain't got a chance
To advance in life, they try to make you pull your pants up
Students fight the teachers and get took away in handcuffs
And if that wasn't enough, then they expel y'all
Your peoples understand it but to them, you a failure
Observation and participation, my favorite teachers
When they beat us in the head with them books, it don't reach us
Whether you breakdance or rock suede Adidas
Or be in the bathroom with your clique, smoking reefer
Then you know they math class ain't important 'less you adding up cash
In multiples, unemployment ain't rewardin'
They may as well teach us extortion
You either get paid or locked up, the principal is like a warden
In a four year sentence, mad niggas never finish
But that doesn't mean I couldn't be a doctor or a dentist

Cuz for real, a mind is a terrible thing to waste
And all y'all high class niggas with y'all nose up
Cuz we droppin this shit on this joint, fuck y'all
We gon speak for ourselves
Knowhatimsayin? 
Cuz see the schools ain't teachin us nothin
They ain't teachin us nothin but how to be slaves and hardworkers
For white people to build up they shit
Make they businesses successful while it's exploitin us
Knowhatimsayin? And they ain't teachin us nothin related to
Solvin our own problems, knowhatimsayin?
Ain't teachin us how to get crack out the ghetto
They ain't teachin us how to stop the police from murdering us
And brutalizing us, they ain't teachin us how to get our rent paid
Knowhatimsayin? They ain't teachin our families how to interact
Better with each other, knowhatimsayin? They just teachin us
How to build they shit up, knowhatimsayin? That's why my niggas
Got a problem with this shit, that's why niggas be droppin out that
Shit cuz it don't relate, you go to school the fuckin police
Searchin you you walkin in your shit like this a military compound
Knowhatimsayin? So school don't even relate to us
Until we have some shit where we control the fuckin school system
Where we reflect how we gon solve our own problems
Them niggas ain't gon relate to school, shit that just how it is
Knowhatimsayin? And I love education, knowhatimsayin?
But 
if education ain't elevatin me, then you knowhatimsayin it ain't
Takin me where I need to go on some bullshit, then fuck education

Camouflage fatigues and dashikis, somewhere
In between N.W.A. and P.E
I'm black like Steve Biko, raised in the ghetto
By the people.  Fuck the police (“Fuck the Police”)—you know how we do

Ayyo, my life is like Roots: it's a true story
It's too gory for them televised fables on cable
I'm a runaway slave watching the North Star.  Shackles on
My forearm, running with a gun in my palm
I'm a African.  Never was a African-American
Blacker than black, I take it back to my origin
Same skin hated by the Klansmen.  Big nose
And lips, big hips and butts dancing—what!

It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

One thing bout music when it hit you feel no pain
White folks say it controls your brain; I know better than that, that's game
And we ready for that, two soldiers head of the pack
Matter of fact, who got the gat
And where my army at, rather attack and not react
Back to beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, whether your project's put on hold
In the real world; these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world, it's bigger than all these fake-ass records
When poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1-2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do; if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame-ignitor, crowd-exciter
Or you wanna just get high then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent with a wire
I'm gon' know it when I play it

Because they not, MC's get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talking bout how much money they got; all y'all records sound the same
I'm sick of that fake thug, R&B-rap scenario, all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video, monotonous material
Y'all don't hear me though, these record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice, a dream or some substance
A Beamer, a necklace or freedom

When Mama Cries (Censored),F*ck the Law / When Mama Cries,2003.0,"Dead prez ft. Jamila and Umi - “When Mama Cries”





Why do babies cry?
‘Cause they knew they were born in the eye of the storm
And my mama cried
On the day I was born ‘cause she knew I would die

Aww shit.  Another young brother hit
They got me doing my dips and loading my clips
Bloomberg name taste like shit on our lips
Projects flipping, niggas is shitting on pigs
It ain’t a war where we live no more.  It’s a massacre
Brothers ain’t trying to ride.  We’re in the passenger seat
And everybody just trying to eat
But I’m trying to eat, then live, get high, and get free
Don’t tell me I’m deceiving myself.  If that’s the case
I’d rather meet reality now, a gun to my face
Than play-fight with police and get shot in the back
So they could dirty my name and sprinkle some crack
Tell me that’s not how we’re getting down.  We had some principles
I guess some things is different now.  Broken promises
We made to my homie’s mom.  They killed her only son
And now she crying in my arms.  Be strong

Don’t cry, don’t cry, don’t cry no more
‘Cause it won’t be long.  We will survive
Don’t cry, don’t cry, don’t cry no more
‘Cause it won’t be long.  We’re gonna ride

I cried when 2Pac died.  It was a Friday
We sat up that whole night, bumping “Shawtay”
I felt the same way when I lost my cousin Padre
Why so many niggas had to go out the hard way?
Nobody knows the reason we’re here.  We’re just surviving
From day to day, caught up in a game you got to pay to play
Life is just a series of days that fade away
Every day, the sun rises, but nothing changes

I feel the sadness.  I’m trying to console his family
And tell his mama that her son is still standing
I know he left you and life is full of pressure
But, in me, you’ll find a piece of his spirit
And, as children, the block was our prison
We couldn’t escape the bid that we was given
Learning lessons, searching for directions
Clinging to the truth, poverty kept us desperate
Was steady grinding with our minds on survival
Had plans to build a fam without dope or violence
But, in a second, niggas is left breathless
We was caught in a storm, being born as black men
And life is tragic.  My nigga’s in his casket
It got me loading clips, ready to bust a cracker
I can’t replace him, but I’m here to help you face it
Consider me your son ‘til it’s my time to face death

Don’t cry, don’t cry (Don’t, mama), don’t cry no more (Don’t you cry)
‘Cause it won’t be long.  (You know that) We will survive (We will survive)
Don’t cry, don’t cry (Don’t, mama), don’t cry no more (Don’t you cry)
‘Cause it won’t be long.  (You know that) We’re gonna ride (We’re gonna ride)

Mama, hold your head up high (Hold your head up high)
‘Cause it won’t be long (You’ve got to be strong).  We’re gonna ride
Mama, hold your head up high (Hold your head up high)
‘Cause it won’t be long (It won’t be long).  We’re gonna ride

“Police State” Dead Prez,LETS GET FREE ALBUM Dead Prez,UnKnown,"You have the emergence in human society of this thing that's called the State. What is the State? The State is this organized bureaucracy: it is the police department. It is the Army, the Navy. It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you. This is the State; it is a repressive organization. But the state and gee well, you know, you've got to have the police because if there were no police, look at what you'd be doing to yourselves -- you'd be killing each other if there were no police! But the reality is the 
police become necessary in human society only at that juncture in human society where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct
You know how we think:
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, Black, and Green instead of gang bandannas
FBI spying on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watching society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P
While all you fake niggas try to copy Master P
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street where the people live
I'm sick of working for crumbs and filling up the prisons
Dying over money and relying on religion
For help. 
We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades are ready, we're just spreading the seed

The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
Cause 
the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate?
We living in a police state

No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back, pretty niggas be running with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back
We tired of that, corporations hiring Blacks
Denying the facts exploiting us all over the map
That's why I write the shit I write in my raps
It's documented, I'm in it, every day of the week I live in it
Breathing it, it's more than just fucking believing it
I'm holding M1's, rolling up my sleeves an' shit
It's Cee-lo for push-ups now
Many headed for one conclusion
Niggas ain't ready for revolution


(That's right, that developed?) me: brought me here and worked me like an
Animal. Built the political economy off my stolen labor. Made them rich
Made me poor


Why is it that Black people and everybody like us live in the kind of
Poverty and misery that we live in? Everywhere I look around me are nothing
But poverty and misery, on the one hand. And yet, what I'm seeing is that
Everywhere there's wealth and riches in the world it's in the white
Community somewhere, whether it's in Europe or whether it's right cross the
Street from where I was born",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-police-state-dead-prez-lyrics

Or remain being the victims
????
Slave to the system
Don't blast on your fam
Blast on politicians
Or at the stitches
The pigs and the prisons
Shoot for the truth
Don't be wasting your bullet
Cops they pussies
Scared cause we're angry
They made us this way
?? brings hatred
While we waiting for heroes and gangsters
They feeling up the streets with heroin and base heads
Generations capable of changing
The face of the hood
And the state of this nation
Reparations we gotta take them
Put a foot up that ass
In exchange for some paper

A lesson to the youth don't be scared to riot
When i grow up i going to be a riot starter
Freedom fighter
Red sea ??
When i die i am going die harder

Information news

Everywhere we go
Every day on TV
They be talking about
Who you gonna vote for
You got a black man running
But I wonder if he get in
Who he gonna open up the door for?
I don't wanna to discourage my folk
I believe in hope
I just want us to want more
Politics is a game
How they keep us contained
There gotta be more that we could hope for
Democrats and Republicans
Just 2 sides of the same coin
Either way, it's still white power
It's the same system
Just changed form
You wanna vote? please do!
Cast your ballot, let your voice be heard
But what I do want to say is
After the election
You'll see
Mark my words

It's politic time again
It's politrick time again
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again
Shoot the messenger!

This is the most important election of all time
The government's committing the biggest of all crimes
These bullshit politicians say they speaking for the people
Before they ran for office, they were shitting on the people
Billion dollar campaigns
Trillion dollar bailout
Anybody know the definition of a sell-out? huh?
And if Obama win, he wouldn't be the first black
Take your 2 dollar bill and turn it over to the back (you see? right there)
But with the TV on, you only hearing they voice
The system is broken, they trying to beat a dead horse
Go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils
I plot, plan, and strategize with the poor people
The middle class will say this opinion is irresponsible
But if you ain't got no healthcare, they kickin' you out the hospital
McKinney, Clemente, off in the Green Party
No disrespect, we need a Red, Black, and Green Party
Like Marcus Garvey's

Even if Obama wins
Uncle Sam ain't my friend
It's politrikkks time again
It's bullshit time again

The time is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor
And truth is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor

And I'mma die probably *because* I'm black
Because some cracker that knows I'm black
Better than you, nigga, is probably gonna' put
A bullet in the back of my head!!
Yeah our lives fucked up, no doubt
All this shit we go through every day
Sometimes a nigga don't know what the fuck to do
But see I got my niggas
And we gon organize a people army
And we gon get control over our own lives
And I mean that shit right there from the bottom of my shit
I Ching

Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war
Could you take the life of somebody you know
Or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died, when they registered

Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me wanna break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free, we need more than MC's
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today, it's kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us
But I'mma stand up on my own, like a man do
Dominate the land and make wealth, like Fu-Manchu
Yes the peoples army stick togehther like glue
We represent the I-Ching, and to this we stand true
Military formation, anyone participation is welcome
Each one teach one, son help son
Just one gun is all it take to get it started
Livin in the wilderness of the west we cold hearted

If you don't think it could happen think again my son
Be prepared for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclsym, niggas be like fuck the system

I don't wanna be no movie star
I don't wanna drive no fancy car
I just wanna be free, to live my life, to live my own life

Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is, crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
Cuz a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lot of niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, trying to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear in the coming years
Ahead of me, I'm ready for whatever they bring, though
I'd go against a tank with a shank for my dreams
And that's my fucking word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hanging on the curb",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-we-want-freedom-dead-prez-lyrics

Shuffering Shmiling,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Jorge Ben Jor, Talib Kweli, Bilal & Postive Force)
(Jorge Ben Jor) (scat singing)
(stic.man)
(to the ancestors)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot (to the warriors)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot (to those who came before us)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot (long lived the revolution)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
(stic.man)
Religion is like prison
Keep the people locked up in different divisions
Some of them promise you heaven
But I see a whole lot of bullshit ism-scism
Imperialism in the form of spirituality
Slave mentality, escape reality
What we supposed to just suffer and smile and be content?
Sendin our prayers to the clouds? (stic.man - uhn uh)
I want my heaven now, freedom on earth
And if the preacher ain't with us, then we takin his church
What is it worth to have the biggest religion
When the people got miserable living conditions?
No water, no lights, no rights
All over africa we fight, but we have to unite
Cause ain't no power in the gospel
When the priest puttin powder in his nostril
And the elder's council fails to lead
And the children suffer from daily need
And the people can barely eat
Is it a sin to stand up
To fight against the ones that put is in handcuffs?
Goddamn, what happened to the daily bread, spread love
And not what the bible said, but in the name of the bible
How much love is spread compared to how much blood is shed
Chorus:
(Bilal)
Everyday my people get inside the bus
(women - shuffering and shmiling)
Everyday its the circle
(women - shuffering and shmiling)
Everyday my people get inside the bus
(women - shuffering and shmiling)
Everyday its the circle
(Jorge Ben Jor) (scat singing)
(women - shuffering and shmiling) x4
Everyday its the same thing
(Talib Kweli)
Yo
Every day I wake up is a miracle, thank you
Seperate religious and the spiritual, thank you
See, I dont be askin in the air, every action is a prayer
The bear won't attack me, I be, attackin the bear, see
Back in the day I used to work in a bookstore
My job was to find whatever book you look for
I remember one day this lady came for a bible
We was out, so I started showin here other titles
Tryna share information about a religion
Everything that I showed her was written by christians, still
She got the hell up outta the place
Wonderin something about me shakin her faith
Now, knowledge is power, we spread information
How strong is your faith? what it take to be shaken?
Yo, I think she missed what jesus was sayin
Can't keep your eyes closed to a revelation
You could be speakin in tongues
Could be speakin of sons and daughters
My reflection of course, within the water is
Beautiful, attractive, my musical contraption
Classified as unusual practice but
Thats what it take to be a man
Free the land, crash down on babylon like the sea to the sand
Peace to the fam, we want you all to stay strong and live long
Like a de la song, c'mon
(stic.man & Talib Kweli)
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
Can't keep quiet
This time gon' be more than a riot
(m1)
This way of life, ain't right
Pray all day and night and don't fight
Poped up, doped up
Work three jobs to fill the gold cup
No water, no food, no lights, no rights
No power til the people unite
It's gone - divison and they work us in prison
Look round, how my niggas is livin
Everything we make, they takin it to the bank
While we sittin up in the church to give thanks
Don't you know the preacher got bank? (m1 - uhn uh, uhn uh)
Don't you know the deacon smoke dank? (m1 - uhn uh, uhn uh)
Did you ever think the bible was a prank? (m1 - uhn uh, uhn uh)
Somebody bout to faint
Before they came
They had the bible, we had the land
Now, we got the bible, they got the land
And what do you believe in, heaven or hell?
Life is what you make it, so thats why I rebel
Uncle sam, got blood on his hands
Good god, how the devil can dance
Nobody wanna help a nigga
Put your hands together, do it yourself my nigga
Don't sit there
You won't have nobody rushin to die
So do something don't just suffer and smile

White folks says it controls your brain - I know better than that, that's game
And we're ready for that two soldiers head of the pack, matter of fact who got the gat?
And where my army at? Rather attack and not react
Back the beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock and roll, whether your project's put on hold
In the real world, these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world (world), it's bigger than all these fake ass records
When poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1,2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do, if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame ignitor, crowd exciter
Or you wanna just get high, then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-cry
Agent with a wire, I'm gonna know it when I play it

Because they not, MC's get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talkin' bout how much money they got, all y'all records sound the same
I sick of that fake thug, R&B, rap scenario all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video, monotonous material, y'all don't here me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed, and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice? A dream or some substance?
A Beamer, a necklace or freedom?
Still a nigga like me don't playa' hate, I just stay awake this real hip hop
And it don't stop until we get the po-po off the block
They call it hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
It's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
It's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
It's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

Yeah, for real.  Long time, poor people have suffered.  And check this: long time, we fighting.  Even pull out gun for the food, see?

We ain't trying to hear shit but what? (Cash money)
The whole world operating off of (Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lot of (Cash money)
Watch your back, money

You couldn't never
Understand how my mind tick.  I'm on some old school
Crime shit, where niggas hold tools to keep their dimes lit
Ain't no rules with these iron shots of stone, dun
This heat burn through your flesh, straight to the bones
I’ll reach for the Buddha cess and zone.  I’ll probably have
A future of stress, stay depressed, and be alone
But, as far as the present time, it’s on.  I’ll represent
Mines ‘til I return to the essence and I'm dead and gone
Nobody want to be broke and you neither
Put me on the corner, watch me catch a quick case of cream fever
If you be popping shit, my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face and take your wallet when we see ya
But son, it gets deeper.  I'm running with a clique that's being
Hunted by the grim reaper.  To all my peoples
In the man keeper, let your situation be a teacher
Ain't nothing like a education.  When I was locked down
I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit unless you need a motherfucking face lift
And, as a youth, I was a outcast, running ‘round
With pellet guns, playing War, but now it's all about cash

I'm caught up, caught up and amidst this shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit, son.  My crew got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol if I have to
In my mind, it’s all about cash in the fistful (Fistful)
I'm caught up and amidst this shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit, dun.  My crew got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol if I have to
In my mind, it’s all about cash in the fistful

Up late night
And upset, I’m fed up.  Niggas is coming up
Wet.  I'm dead up.  Fuck trying to keep your head up
And when it go down, word bond, we got to dead up
Too many locked down upstate—son, it’s a set up
My life has sped up many years—I'm straight up
Plenty beers for who ain't here and those who ate up
Test and get sprayed up in the club.  We couldn't run it
So we take the blade up in the booth since we couldn't shoot
We heat it up, losing the shirt, showing the bare chest
I'm blessed.  Puffing the skunk make me care less
The best that you can do is duck my fucking crew
If the slugs don't get ya, Lord J'll dig ya
Acting artificial get you burnt by the pistol
Before it’s done, even my guns'll turn to missiles
Don't have to blow the whistle on you ‘cause everybody knows
You got to watch yourself around borderline psychos
Who know my people got to hold a mint or they ain't worth a cent
How can you represent if you can't pay the rent?
And leave a dent in my lifetime.  I'm caught up
In trife crime.  In fights you never know what you might find
We stand firm, meanwhile, ‘cause niggas that seem wild
Be bucking blanks.  If they was men, they wouldn't fuck with pranks
I’ll leave them niggas alone and stay home until
It cool down and they remember how my tool sound

Caught up and amidst this shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit, son.  My crew got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol if I have to
In my mind, it’s all about cash in the fistful (Fistful)
Caught up and amidst this shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit, son.  My crew got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol if I have to
In my mind, it’s all about cash in the fistful

To all my niggas with a whole lot of (Cash money)

Forever keeping
My shit cocked for drama.  Stainless steel, shit is for real
The way these rats is known to squeal, making sour deals

“Animal in Man” Dead Prez,LETS GET FREE ALBUM Dead Prez,UnKnown,"*Two Guys Talking*
(Guy 1)
Help me!
(Guy 2)
You want me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction
(Narrator)
Once upon a time
There was a very serious situation growing
There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals
And this is the story of their times
Verse 1
Old man Sammy had a farm
Walked the land with the wife
Most of the time shit was calm
His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor
From the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable
This is how we kept food on this table (maxing)
You would have thought he was disabled by the way he be relaxing
Acting like Mr. Magnificent
But the animals were thinking something different
The sentiment was tension in the barnyard
Throughout the years they had been through mad drama
With the farmer, word is bond
And they all came to one conclusion
They argued there was no way they'd ever be free
If it was up to humans
Therefore the only course left was revolution which was understandable
And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals
They planned a full attack
Under the leadership of Hannibal
The fattest pig in the pack
The next morning on the farm
Everything was calm
Just before dawn
But before long
The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric
Now check it
This is when that shit got hectic
Directed by Hannibal, the animals attacked
Old Sam was in a state of shock
And fell up on his back
And dropped his rifle
Reaching in vain
Each and every creature from the field at his throat
Screaming ""Kill, feel the pain.""
Chorus
This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true (2X)
Verse 2
After they ran the farmer off the farm
The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn
Hannibal spoke for several hours
But when talks about his plans for power
That's when the conversation turned sour
He issued an offical ordinance to set
If not a pig from this day forth then you subordinate
That's when the horses went buckwild
One of them shouted out
""You fraudulent pigs, we know your fucking style!""
Hannibal's face was flushed and pale
All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal
He felt the same way Sam felt
They took his tongue out of his mouth
And cut his body up for sale, for real
You better listen while you can
Its a very thin line between animal and man
When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand
What would you have done?
Shook his hand?
This is the animal in man
Chorus (4X)

Rest in to my niggas who gone, forever you gon live on through this song
You gon live on
Marqeese rest in peace my lil homie marqeese 

When the weight of the worlds on your shoulder
You can't look back at all
See the world as a hole that's gettin colder
I watched you in your child hood gettin older(take a look into your life)
This one goes out to all my fallen soldiers

Yo, my little homie marqeese he was a trusted soldier
Had the whole world on his shoulder
Took him under my wing, I watched him gettting older
Watched you disagree with the school system
Them fools don't listen, they thought you was I'll n
The truth is that you was brilliant
Ya mom, you must forgive her she loved you
I know this world can be ugly, she did the best she could
I put that on the hood, see he wanted organization
The streets was there to imbrace him
So we tied that blue bandana on his face, then for life
Married to the block took a oath made her his wife
Then she stabbed him throught the heart with a knife
Ain't that a bitch?
See it's war fare on flatbush & clarkson
Eye on the scope heart of a lion see you niggas is marksmen
You shoulda missed a few niggas and hit up a few pigs
Politcal education underdigg
I really want to say this to the face of them niggas
Ya'll don't know me, why you had to kill my little fucking homie?
Marqeese


Rest in peace
Can't bring you back but drink this yak
And I'm thinkn bout back in the day
And I wonder how it woulda been if my homie padre never woulda past away
When they put them bullets in ya, that night I remember when I got that call
I was sittin on the edge of my girl bed, and I could'ntbelieve they shot my dogg
I wish I coulda been by your side on the night you died
If I coulda been reincarnated as a 45 I woulda opened fire
But everything happen for a reason every thing got a time and a season
It all boil down to what you believe in, you only got a lil time to achieve it
So hope a nigga find some kind of peace where ya at, cause only peace here is tha gat
And it only get worse when you poor and you black and the system is holding you back
If it ain't the young homie with a strap, it's the punk police that'll shoot you in the back
Too many homies get deep in the game, get caught up in a trap and they never come back
But life is a winding road everybody got a time to go all a nigga could do is ride out and persevere
Grinding mode
But now you free so rest in peace, my nigga R.I.P and if there is a heaven for a G say a prayer for me
(Padre)

Rest in to my niggas who gone, forever you gon live on through this song
You gon live on 
This for my homies who ain't here...

I'm running with a click that's being hunted by the grim reaper
To all my peoples in the man keeper
Let your situation be a teacher
Ain't nothing like a education
When I was locked down I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit, unless you need a motherfucking face lift
And as a youth I was a outcast
Running around with pellet guns playing war but now it's all about cash

I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit

I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
Only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
Curried falafel, barbecued tofu
No fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
Only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
Exercising daily to stay healthy
And I rarely drink water out the tap, cause it's filthy

Lentil soup is mental fruit
And ginger root is good for the yout'
Fresh veg-e-table with dem ital stew
Sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods

Life brings life, it's valuable
So I eat what comes from the ground, it's natural
Let your food be your medicine (uh huh)
No Excederin (uh uh)

“Psychology” Dead Prez,LETS GET FREE ALBUM Dead Prez,UnKnown,"Intro:
""I was born, in a dump
My mama died and my father got drunk
They left me, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shack
All I owned was hangin on my back
And Lord knows, how I learnt
This place called Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, you're dirty and you're filthy
Tobacco Road, gonna get me some dynamite and a crane
I'm gonna blow it up, Lord knows gonna start all over again""
""My mind is the place where I make my plans
The world is the place where I take my stand
The beauty of life is mine today
They cannot take my mind away""

Fuck what you heard, I'm from Africa
This ain't no act it's mathematical
Past the black radical
I choose the M1 because it's practical
Nothin was changed, we ain't protected
No names, it's all factual
They push the wrong buttons, count down to detonate
Brooklyn blown away and the world will have to speculate
This is what we learn in the streets, fuck a degree
Believe in none of what you hear and half of what you see

It's like watching your own father smoke crack
I have nightmares on shit like that
No way in hell I'll ever get like that
I seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
It's like a tour of duty
My life is booby-trapped, it's hard to see the beauty
When your heart is turning ice cold
Cold like your hands exposed to blistering winds
My mother keep her eyes closed, she say she prayin
I listen close to what she sayin
When she speak of Jesus I ignore it
But when it's practical I'm all for it
You got to think like a soldier
I'm training myself to snatch pistols out of holsters
Discipline keep the mind focused
This whole world is a corn field son
Look out for flying locusts
Chorus (x2)
Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wan
na do?

You can't walk the streets with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
And if you know the time, give me a sign
Tell me where we draw the line, I got your back if you got mine
My enemy's enemy is my man, one dreadlock is stronger than one strand
While the crackers got the upper hand my comrades stands
On lands stolen
Every tooth a golden opportunity, who holding my community
Hostage? 10% ransom
Costing us time we lost and some
This is how the plan runs, thinking with a fugitive brain
What we do to live is insane
Hold in the weed, healing my membranes, just like crack
You know it all boils down to the dollars-and-cents of it
Niggas commence to get rents to sentenced to serve terms
Jumping the fence, the black germ is loose
When will they learn?
Psychology

We piss on walls and smoke reefa in the halls
No respect for their laws
I cut your face with a kitchen knife
In gladiator times, man against machinery
The tree bark fatigues help me blend in with the scenery boy
Life is a series of serious choices
Theories is formed from experience, never mysterious forces
Various courses of life can lead to failure
Too much of anything is a trap
My mind snap
Guerilla warfare for two grand
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man...
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man
Chorus (x2)
Bridge

When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted

“Mind Sex” Dead Prez,LETS GET FREE ALBUM Dead Prez,UnKnown,"It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

Pardon me, love, but you seem like my type
What you doing tonight? You should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed, play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown: Brooklyn, New York
Now I know you think I wanna fuck, no doubt
But tonight we'll try a different route
How bout we start, with a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon
See, I ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me wanna show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just taking our time
Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't trying to say I don't wanna fuck..cause I do
But for me, boo, making love is just as much mental
I like to know what I'm getting into

(singing): before we make love

African princess, tell me your interests
Wait, let me guess, boo: you probably like poetry
Here's a little something I jotted down in case I spotted you around
So let me take this opportunity
Would you share a moment with me, over herbal tea?
Take a walk verbally, make a bond certainly?
Cause in my hand I bet your hand fit perfectly
And it's like we floating out in space when you flirting with me
C'mon, a little foreplay don't hurt
Imagine my chest under this shirt, your ass under your skirt
It's like walking the hot sands and finding an oasis
Opposites attract: that's the basis
Our sex is the wind that separates the Yin from the Yang
The balance that means complete change, our aim
Is to touch you in a delicate spot
And once we get it started, I ain't trying to stop

She smiles; I smile
She walks - no - she glides softly by me, changing night into day
She opens her mouth to speak
And so sounds ring in my head
She speaks, and I want to dance to her rhythm
She moves ever so gently, increasing my desires
As I place my arms around her waist
Hold and squeeze unto me
I want to melt into her body, and discover the base of her warmth
Her beautiful black body that no human mind could ever conceive
She's love, she's truth
She's real, as real as the stars that shine in the heavens
As real as the sun that bathes her body
As real as the moon that glows and the birds that sing and the rose
That blossoms in Spring - for she is that rose
And not just any rose, but a black rose
Black rose stands tall and stronger than any other plant
A black rose, that stands as Creator
Of nations of black roses
That never loses her petals, and blossoms all year round
Black rose, sweet rose, thornless rose, eternal rose
Please look my way
Please look my way
Please look my way

They dollar's losing value, but the hood knew that already
The price of gas been rising, at times we can't afford it
The oil supply is leaking, facing a global shortage
According to news reporters, every year its getting warmer
These violent weather patterns, some say it's just nature's karma
They planting they seeds of fearing, genetic engineering
Interfering with the crops and now the bees are disappearing
Don't know what is upon us, just know one thing for certain

It's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

White folks says it controls your brain - I know better than that, that's game
And we're ready for that two soldiers head of the pack, matter of fact who got the gat?
And where my army at? Rather attack and not react
Back the beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock and roll, whether your project's put on hold
In the real world, these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world (world), it's bigger than all these fake ass records
When poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1,2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do, if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame ignitor, crowd exciter
Or you wanna just get high, then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-cry

Because they not, MC's get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talkin' bout how much money they got, all y'all records sound the same
I sick of that fake thug, R&B, rap scenario all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video, monotonous material, y'all don't here me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed, and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice? A dream or some substance?
A Beamer, a necklace or freedom?
Still a nigga like me don't playa' hate, I just stay awake this real hip hop
And it don't stop until we get the po-po off the block
They call it hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip

“Overstand” Dead Prez’s,“Information Age” Dead Prez,UnKnown,"Are we addicted to the struggle or committed to success?
Are we focused on the positive or holdin' onto stress?
Not sayin' thing's perfect but in many ways I'm blessed
Learnin' how to take the negative and flip for the best
Everyday bring challenge, every challenge is a chance to advance
The power is right in our own hands
From a youth full of rage, to a wise grown man
Here I am, life is beautiful now, I overstand

I'm lookin' forward through my rear view mirror in hindsight
Gotta be more than just a G if you keepin' your mind right
Better be ready for the battle or focused on my fight
I ain't sittin' on no sidelines watchin' them highlights
I'ma be in the game playin' to win but learnin' from setbacks
Strengthen my weaknesses and masterin' what I'm best at
Power of refinement until you get right and exact
It's all in your mind, but that depends on where your head's at
Life is a chess match and lessons come from your mistakes
Try not to end up in checkmate no matter whatever it takes
Long as you're breathin' then you can be problem solvin'
Stayin' involved, evolved, world keeps revolvin'
For the cause be all you can from the mornin' to the sunset
You never have no regrets

Not just understandin' but overstandin' is the objective

Just let me be what I am

Unless you see for yourself, then you won't comprehend
The caterpillar don't care what you think about him
He was born to be fly, his nature gonna bring it outta him
By the struggle I was never broken, I was broken open
I tapped into a source that was omnipotent
Had to shift my focus to my higher purpose
Ain't nothing weak about broke, it takes a fighter's courage

We think we found the absolute truth
But only to discover it's a labyrinth, we go from one maze into another
So many chambers and angles, peelin' the onion layers
Within it all I see the same gang, just different players
So I rebel from the prison cell of the pigeon hole
And dare to be myself, original
A man lives on principles --I don't posture to be popular
Born to be a leader not just a blind follower

It's family before the dollar, your priorities in order
And like Bruce Lee say: ""Be the water, be the earth, be the wind and the fire.""

The universe contains incredible diversity
And you cannot experience it all within the confines of one comfortable lifestyle

Remember that what seems now to be disaster may be an important step toward evolution
And may even be identifiable as such at some point in the future
Every great loss takes you out of a rut and starts life anew

“No Way As The Way” Dead Prez,“Information Age” Dead Prez,UnKnown,"My way might not be your way
But it’s okay
It’s alright, your way might not be my way
But it’s okay
It’s alright

Yea, I used to go to church
But the church didn’t quench my thirst
Mama taught me to put god first
But she never tried to block my search
I was curious, young but serious
Why's religion so mysterious
Why is black life so hard?
They say you’re not supposed to question God
Well is it okay to question the pastor?
Was it passed down from the slave-master?
It was only the truth I was after
But I never could get a straight answer
So I couldn’t relate to the sermon
Put down the bible, then I start learning
About life, didn’t know where the path would lead
But I had to get off my knees


I build with the 5 percenters
On the God within us, there's no limits
Study the Metu Neter from Kemet
Also I remembered
Smoke herb with the Rastafarians
Grew my locks became a vegetarian
Following the tao, filling what the bible lacks
Jewels being handed to a innocent child
My mind is a Buddhist temple, the truth is simple
I try to be principle
Walking with a warrior spirit
It ain’t nothing like learning from first hand life experience
I’m a realist, that’s all I deal with
Respect & truth, that’s all I build with
A child of the universe
My religion is life and it’s just as valid
I strive for balance


I gotta admit, I don’t know
In the end which way it’s gonna go
Why we sit by the project window?
Instead of living off the land with my kin folk
Is there even a master plan?
An unseen hand? Is God a man?
Some say that’s sacrilegious
Same folks selling us lies about Christmas
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny
Just so the capitalists can make money
They say God will take care of it
But you a terrorist if you say the same thing in Arabic
It’s so hypocritical
It’s a miracle, listen to the message and the spirituals
Wade in the water, I’m following Mr. Tubman
And Nat Turner, I’m paying for my freedom

Dairy free, until we're free
Lady Liberty, wanna kick with me
But that bitch ain’t never mean shit to me man
I stay away from cocaina
That’s white Jesus, I’m a non-believer
I was taught not to fear no evil
But I don’t wanna catch no jungle fever

Yo Snow White, Cinderella
Don’t wanna get no salmonella
Mozzarella, not the fella
Blacker the berry, the darker the better
Devil’s daughter, I don’t want her
Shit'll have you strung out on the corner
Crack in your hand, that’s Ku Klux Klan
No blonde if a nigga meet a real Roxanne

Dirty white girl, she’s so addictive
Don’t wanna go so you win all
Dirty white girl, she’s so addictive
Don’t wanna go so you win all

Milk on your mustache, ew
What’s that? I don’t trust that, that’s suspect
(?) toast, soup froze
Dextrose? I’m lactose intolerant
I’m not buying it, I don’t swallow it
I’m not fooled by your white power politic
White flour? Want none of it
I don’t sleep with the government

Just the kush, not the yayo
Cause that Barbara Bush is fatal
Ebony and ivory, society done a lot to me
She been around the industry
I know her history, it’s not a mystery
Crystal meth, PCP, LSD, that’s not for me


I stay away from them see through panties, that’s paraphernalia
With a poor white trash of kid, ya ain’t fucking with Virginia Slims
Cancer stick, she no good for me, bitch make me sick
No, I’m not the one, I’m not the trick
I need a sista souljah, not a Dixie Chick
No dairy queen, no Lindsey Lohan
What that mean? I ain’t with your program

My cup, styrofoam
Tell you right, won’t steer you wrong
Make you lean, make you fall
Michael Jack, off the wall
Hard white, my wife
She like to ride that glass pipe
Fast life, popping pills
Cheap thrills get you killed
Big syringe, pick your skin
Make you thin, she not your friend
Frying pan, brain on drugs
Back hand, ain’t no love

“Learning Growing Changing” Dead Prez,“Information Age” Dead Prez,UnKnown,"We could grow
We could develop
As we know, the heaven is not a place
And happiness lives in the heart
Long as the world keep turning
I duty is to keep on learning
Ya heard?

Keep on learning, and soaking up game
We gon' make mistakes, we gon' go through some things
Keep on growing, keep on soaking up game
If something ain’t working, don’t be afraid to change

Nobody know it all, as soon as you think you do – that’s when you fall
We gotta do more than survive, we must evolve
Things change just when you think you seen it all
We trip, we stumble but we get back and strike
Each day, all the way, one step at a time
Don’t wanna let my ego and pride make me blind
The elders say “when you stop growing – that’s when you die”
The one who gets the knowledge is the one who asked “why?”
Through the course of life, you gon' taste some humble pie
But I love it – it makes me appreciate the things that I take for granted
Gaining insight and understanding
Each one, teach one, we got to pass it on
Keep doing the knowledge, building and had in all
With faith in the assumption
That nobody knows everything but everybody knows something

The more you know, the more you know – you don’t know
And if you don’t know there’s more you can know then you won’t grow
What you don’t know can hurt you, discipline is a virtue
You gotta ask the right questions
It helps you go into cycles and cyphers and spirals
Information is viral, it infects you
It’s contagious and have you going through stages
Like deny, you don’t believe that, no, we didn’t do that
Then reality set in, there’s no disputing the facts
Yo I’m sorry if I woke you up, but when I open up
It’s like I’m smoking but I’m high off the people, watch me soak it up
Huey said the best education is observation and participation
Study how the people be relating
Different points of views turn bad news to good news
See, it’s kinda like some shoes cause they gotta make you move
Treat it like organic food, make it something you can chew
Information you can use, make it something you can do


Aye man, it’s okay to say you don’t know
That’s when you let go your ego
You’re free from all illusion, dig?
Can’t make moves in confusion
Don’t look for conflict, man
Always look for the solution
And my pop said “humility is a sign of wisdom”
But to really soak it in, now that’s a different kind of listening
See men sharpen men, and every day is another lesson
And it’s not fair you only learn man, it’s a blessing
And as the Buddha says, “nothing lasts forever”
You gotta manage your expectations
The less we pray, the less we suffer
And this way we awaken
Right understanding
Right thought
Right speech
Right action
Right livelihood
Right effort
Right mindfulness
Right focus
Keep soaking
Soak it up",https://genius.com/Dead-prez-learning-growing-changing-dead-prez-lyrics

You know these politicians, they change with the seasons
I’m starting with the man in the mirror, my vision getting clearer
Feel like I’m at the dawn of a new era
I see a free world with no more police terror
A foundation I could pass on to E Twella
I look ahead to when their system is dead
When everybody in the hood is sheltered and fed
A black and brown real life heaven on earth
Where the last shall be first and your work is your worth
I've never been free so I can only imagine what it’d look like
But I know we need it with a passion, the good life
I ain’t got to live in no mansion
To me being wealthy is being free and healthy
Power in the hands of the people, not the state
I’m so ready, how much longer? I can’t wait
Can't Wait

If we take it light, end of conversation
No hesitation, that’s the time that we facing
Count down to a new beginning
We’ve been losing too long, it’s time to start winning
On this land with this love and this life that we live
If we stand with each other and we fight, we can give

A good morning to your neighbor
A good night to your dreams

A loving touch upon a child’s head
A strong warm hug to keep away the doubt
Grandma's, grandma’s hands upon your face
The wiping of the wavered tears
Holding back the fizz
In between in-between the shoe shines and the dish washing
In between in-between the GED’s and PhD’s
In between in-between the out-houses and crack-houses
We, we create waves to live and love
We live on the move
Moving, moving forward through the bling bling
The prison camps, the clothes castors and the hoes and bitches
And the alcohol and Jesus all on the same corner
We are the one and true living God
All around us is life
Our humanity, our humanity is the essence of life
Our blood, our blood nurtures the soul
Our humiliation and pain gives an expression
Our ignorance gives vision
To what’s like living contradictions, living paradoxes
Living phenomenons, living just for the city

For hip-hop, for the glory of our ancestors
