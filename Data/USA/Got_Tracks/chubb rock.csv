Ya Bad Chubbs,And the Winner is...,1989,"This is an introduction
To music that just be pumpin'
While hits just be dippin'
The intention is for humpin' the floor
Shinin' the wood with our jeans
If it's denim don't worry
It's hip hop don't hem 'em
Money earnin' concernin'
I'll be teachin' and learnin'
Gettin' hot from my rhymes and my looks
Not from bourbon
No solution no remedy
No cure like a deodorant
Yo you have to be sure
That if you talk up or walk up into myface
That wouldn't become a big public disgrace
Cause I'll ban you, burn you up, and tan you
Treat you like the elephant
And man you will be hocked and locked in a jar with a lid
Hangin' on a wall in Michael Jackson's crib
Cause I'm bad, in fact I'm a thriller
I drink milk, that's why I'm a top biller
Like a funeral home, I'll make a killing
I'm not Giz even though I'm still chillin'
Guys say that I'm scary, girls say that I'm cuddly
Rough like bark but dark and lovely
This ain't no game and I'm no toy
And like Anita Baker, I'll bring you joy
With my word when I open my mouth
Ask Oliver North to go and break south
A homo is a no-no but you know I'll smack a faggot
Boy, you got to see me, I'm rich like Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a loon and ya know, comin' soon
A rhyme kicked to this Popeye tune
This is hip hop with a little be-bop
And I won't flop cause I can't stop
I will mop up the slop and then go to the top
I am not Robocop, I'm Chubb Rock

I'm Chubb Rock risin' and I'll break your leg
And I'm more than a forty ounce, I'm more like a keg
And I'm the big dipper, rippin' like Jack the Ripper
And if you want the proof, the proof is in my liquor
So you knew it and you blew it, let's get to it
Gonna run you over with a rhyme that's like a big Buick
And since you think you're slender, I'll slap you with a fender
And bind you up, wind you up, and grind you up in a blender
And then I'll serve you with coffee and cake
Oh damn, I should've had a V-8, oh well
I'll put you on a plate so it looks a little neater
You're a tramp, so I'll sprinkle salt and pepper
And paprika on your face, like mace
So you can taste immediately
Just like the base that went up your nose previously
So it seems you're too zooed to battle
What up chump, acne bump, skidaddle
You're a nine, I'm a ten
Victory is mine again, this Bud's for me
So here, take a Heineken
With your self-esteem, you will never redeem
Like Martin Luther King, you have a dream
That maybe you will beat me, maybe defeat me
But you're too illiterate, so I won't consider it
Weak is the word and the rhyme is identical
This is not the late show
And I'm not Arsenio Hall
But quite tall with the gall
And I have magic and I can play ball
And guys won't boo this, girls will jsut screw this
It's ludicrous but we can do this
Cause you're new to this, Brutus
I'm so smooth that I'm the smoothest
I'm not handsome but I am the cutest you ever had
That's why I'm so glad that I'm so good I'm bad",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-ya-bad-chubbs-lyrics
Bonus Beat,And the Winner is...,1989,"Back in the days we wished to be a star
Rap in the street, bang the beat on a car
Swany D banged the hood so hard it would dent
While Dave and Rob just invents
A style so smooth and unique
But then Rob went to school, Dave's on Wall Street
With a suit and a tie, Rob has a book bag
But deep in their hearts I knew they wished they had
A chance to rap on the record heard on the radio
I was making my second album and said, ""Yo""
No time to rehearse
Yo, Rob, you're first
To kick your text
Homeboy, you're next

This is Rob, first to rock the microphone
To see all the chromosomes
The DNA structure
Will make you pucker
Up your lips
And say, ""Boy, he's a trip""
To Africa
People want to go and laugh at ya
Up you mighty race, you can accomplish what you will
Cause I will kill
The beat not the person, cause I don't ill like that
I just rap and attack
It ain't wack
I love being black
But you're scared cause society went boo
Don't judge me as one of the many, but one of few
That will do
Anything I have to do
To open your mind because you're numb
This is serious, but I won't extract the fun
So when I kick it like karate
Bite you like arare
If you kiss your teeth
There's beef
I have a shotty
That's home waiting
There's no escaping
Bum, don't you know the sum of the parts is equal to whole
And if you've got heart
Check out the roughest part
It's part two
Dave it's on you
To kick the text
Homeboy, you're next

My rap is synonymous with perfection
Suckers try to play me then they run for protection
Think about it when it comes to the rhyming
Originality, that with all the great timing
Cause rapping with authority is the style that I am using
So when you're at a party and you get to choosing
The best
I mean compared to the rest
For style and class there is no contest
I'm not offended
Or pretending
I'm just lending
A bit of my rhyme and then I am sending
A musical note to whom it may concern
You wanna battle me, then you'll have to get burned
Cause I'll meet you
Beat you
Over again
Send you to the bar for a Heineken
And then you'll come back for a rematch
Or some haps until we kick it
I'll say a fresh rhyme
Of course you'll vick it
Then I'll have to just beat you again
I'll have to slay you
Burn, broil, fry, and saute you
Cause taking out a punk like you is pure fun
I'll stick you with a fork when I think you're done
So savor
Cause I will not do you any favors
And all these suckers out there just Flava Flav imitators

Yeah y'all
No time to fall
I'm gonna go to the top
But I won't crawl
Gonna jump and leap
Not walk I'm gonna run
My pops is forty-five and I'm a son of a gun
It's Chubb Rock
If you was wondering who
It's a collaboration merely of the two
With Rob and Dave
They both had a page
We was all down back in the days
Doug, Martin, Gary, Johnny, Stan
Jamey, Danny, Tony, Ezra, and
Derrick, Joe, Russell, Kurt, Louis Roddle
Gene, Malcolm, Sean Fisher, and Donald
And the others that lived on Troy
This record goes out to my homeboy...

DJ Innovator,Chubb Rock Featuring Hitman Howie Tee,1988,"The tune is very slow, potent and sleazy
Guys  like Jamaicans (Just easy)
And my DJ is very scary
He has a multitude of cuts and he's also very
I learn to model the things that I knew
Containing a meaning, a moral or what have you
I rap hard, sing like Rigoletto
And we shall acclaim fame right in the ghetto
And Howie can anyone take you? (Nah)
I thought you might have lost it (Moi?)
Well I'm a DJ innovator
Well now I should think you might remember the faces
I'm Chubb Rock and behind me ten paces
Is a, individual who's happy and gallant
A remarkable producer who's showing his talent
Playing synthesizers, making musical chords
We'll be sitting next to Janet at the Grammy awards
And all the stars will never figure out why
A rapper like me is feeling up Janet's thigh
And I will be rubbing elbows with Frank Sinatra
Cause when I perform, I gotcha
Well I'm a DJ innovator
The records sounds hard, as Gibraltar
And when he does a scratch, he can alter
The pitch, the style and go berserk and wild
It will linger cuz of the secrets all in his finger
He had to show his talent sooner or later
He's Howie Tee the Hitman, a DJ innovator
Well I'm a DJ innovator
Just easy
Many major record labels made offers, to steal us
And even Soul Train, huh, Don Cornelius
Had to come on over with my pen and pad
All the way to California, he'll pay for the cab
And the gesture is quite understood
He knows talent when he sees it cause he's on my wood
For being an artist and a good producer
They want me to do a duet with Luther
But it's okay cause I like the brother
That Kentucky Fried Chicken mother-to compete with
Me, he has to eat more solids
I'll do the rap and he'll do the ballads
But without Howie Tee it can't go for
Yo Howie you're def! 
Well I'm a DJ innovator
Just easy",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-dj-innovator-lyrics
Yabadabadoo,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Diggity da-di-la-di-da-di, baby, there's a party
But you can't have a party without a large Bacardi
You got to keep the hottie moving like a Maserati
A hundred million women wanna tone up their body
And I can never pass up a chance to romance them
Don't call me soft just because I'm handsome
So money take a tip if you flip and you slip
You'll be using all your teeth for poker chips
So wiggedy word wiggedy word I don't smoke the herb
And if my hottie smokes the shit I'll kick her to the curb
Every morning breakfast in bed is served
Cause on women I have an affect like a quadra verb
So can I whip yes what yes like buddha sess yes
Shot em all dead when they try to test
So keep me in like Flynn this year I'm gonna win
If my balls are on your chin then you got the D.I.Y.M
So can I get a shout
Peace to Chubb Rock, TrakMasters, the Gigalos and I'm out
Yabadabadoo

Wow look at the size of his chest
Never the less I jump upon ET list and then phone my home
Before the little kitten throws a stone
The holder of the Rock, one two and ya don't stop
Rhythm to the dism while the ism forms a prism
Suck the dism stand like a Chisolm dimension prison and is he
The One, The One, he says he's the one, the only one
Take the two subtract the one and uh-hhuh
He's handsome ya see, big strong and sturdy
Watch the birdy
 I'm 
nerdy on the IQ set
Caught nuff wreck
The grim reapear what said Charlier Brown's damn teacher
Wa wah wah wa wa wah, damn
I cram to understand the plan ma'am
I mean I've been hitting the books for a long time now
Real long time now, look at the furrowed brow
Drink Slim Faster, delete the chow
For a strong sequel word up to the people
The people; you mean power to them
While Eastwood Clint plays misty for the buddha
He's buzzing, cummin at cha
And you know we had to watcha, time for some lyrics
While I kick it and you hear it
Even Helen Keller word up can hear it
From the rustler lyrical hustler
The fat lady sand I crusher her, word up the Chubbster
Yabadabadoo

Rob Swinga loves jazz so I'ma swing this like a cool cat
Down with A.T.E.E.M., Trakmasterz got a dope rap
Humongous vocals; I'm quick to flick a jab
I'm not Michael Jackson or the Chubbs but I'm bad
Chew up a sucker like a stick of gum
And then I spit out the bum once the flavor's done
I'm nifty powerful like an M-60
And I'll pop your girl like Jiffy popped Dippy
Well I swing a lyric like a swinga would
And I swing a ho in bed like a swinga should
When it comes to getting hoes I'm rated quadruple X
Just like Dr. Ruth my mind is strictly on the sex
And style or position is my selection
But I won't play without my contraception
Like Ramsey's or Trojan's, oh, yes, that's chill
If worse comes to worse then I use no frills
So check it, check it, check it, check it, check it, one, two

Don’t Drink the Milk,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Intro: MC Nasal (Chubb Rock)
Word up it's the Nasal on the scene one mo' time!
With my man Kirk Gowdy on the mix
And my man Funky Owl in the mix
And my man Frank Nitti on the mix
While the Chubbster in the mix, I'ma kick it like, thissssss
Check it out
Verse One: MC Nasal (Chubb Rock)
Don't drink the milk cause it's spoiled form the racists
If you look up all the judicial cases
You see the niggas yo, dead in the woodwork
Cause of these KKK jerks
And I'm vexed, real vexed, let me tell y'all
While I kick it from the cellular
Well I'm the Nasal on the scene and fuck it
I hate cream in my coffee, so take your fuckin redneck off me
Concerning that Mississippi, stop that fuckin Burning
While I'm over here chillin, ready steady learning
Every racist summer, kill a large number
Of you son of bitch, who switch to Archie Bunker
Ignorant, accurate, coagulate, you imagine it
Hate the nigga boy, and stabbing it
All over, the odor makes you wish he was down with the Force
So you can mess around like Yoda
But no-no, and also, you knew so, the nigga grew so
Advances like Caruso... Robinson, Jackie, smooth and jazzy has he
Been respected, for the past three
Decades finds his baseball cards
Niggas have them then discard, and I'm vexed
Should I flex my pecks on the set?
And watch those Bill Cosby niggas just plex?
And his kids buy a white school kit, ana
And you know he talks, bullshit, ana
Throw your hands in the air
And look at that nappiness of your hair
And if you're proud of your peas, nigga say please
And niggas out there say YEAHHH!
*crickets chirping*
I guess there no niggas out there
Here comes the chorus for the year
Because, the Nasal... will eat shrimp and basil
Remaining head to toe on the foes
And he says he will
Flip on the brothers if they don't pump their fists and
Get busy, yell and scream like this
Chorus:
Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (But why?) It's spoiled
(Hey daddy tell him why) The milk is spoiled!!
Verse Two: Kirk Gowdy
Every night (night), youth get tested (ested)
Mr. Establishment himself is well rested (ested)
Miss Sectretary, holds his message (message)
I would not make it selling drugs in Texas (Texas)
Which way would you look, or was you lookin? (lookin)
Every day, a nigga life is being tooken (tooken)
Vietnam, synonym Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
If ain't a nigga, it's a pussy I'm juckin (juckin)
Alex Haley, Rasta roots soil (soil)
The beginning, and it's over (over)
It wouldn't make sense if things wasn't so tense (tense)
Snatching purses, jumpin over fence (fence)
It seems so negative (egative)
They even got you robbin your own relatives (relatives)
Daily adventure, extravaganza (ganza)
No time to watch an episode of Casablanca
Bonanza, Highway to Heaven
Stray bullet, down goes a kid, who was eleven
Community sucks (sucks), no such unity
Kids die before they reach puberty stages (stages)
Look at the ages (ages), the parent wages (wages)
The reason was in school they never turned pages (pages)
You get vexed (vexed), and temperature boils
It must be the brat and not the milk that's spoiled (spoiled)
Chorus:
Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (Will you tell me why...) It's spoiled
(Yo punk tell him why...) The milk is spoiled!!
Verse Three: Poke
Well I'm the Spanky of the crew and I'll Alfalfa you
And if you step to the Poke I kick nothing but jokes
One of the Masterz of the Trak, stick it groovy
Man I got more fuckin Juice than the movie
Lights cameras actions, I'm on a fuckin mission
Hissin, white boy fishin
Z-28, Camaro, Buick Regal
The will of these automobiles don't appeal to
The better half, and don't interview my staff
For four hundred years you stole, sold my craft
Now my ignorant dome is hard boiled
I won't drink the motherfucking mic, I mean the milk
It's spoiled!!",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-dont-drink-the-milk-lyrics
I’m Too Much,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"I'm coming around the mountain when I'm coming
I'm coming around the mountain when I'm coming
Because I came around the town
And everybody knows my sound is profound
And I'm worth every pound
The fourth LP and consumers don't sweat or fret
Just go purchase the cassette
The album comes on wax and on CD
And hits hard from Ft. Greene to Chelsea
Walk through The Color Purple, then through the Black Rain
Always succeed cause I always use my brain
Married my one and only fly cutie
And always keep my same booking agent Rudy
My pal partner Sal and my main man Al B. Sure!
I'm sure the friendship is secure
Your advice about the miec is always in me
And B Sure!  Peace to little Quincy
And the Miss give a kiss and insist the Miss pump her fist
And catch the gist of this *singing*
I'm Mr. Chubb Rocker... I'm Mr. Fun
I'm Mr. Smooth Rapper... I'm Mr. Number One
Friends call me the Chubbster, any mic that I touch
Seems to melt in my clutch... I'm too much
Because I take a snake and shake and bake the flake
Until I say for goodness drake
Don't make no more damn mistakes
And then I dunk a skunk, hunk, a punk who drunk some junk
And sunk into the soup of life mixed with conch
But I don't know what to do or what to say to him
If he wants to h it me, let him destroy his kidney
I don't care, no te ars for fears, give the kid another beer
Let him lose another year
How can you do that, he knew that brew that, pursue that
Walk down the street I'll just say ""Who dat?""
Walk the other way, looking at him makes me say
Had a good complexion, now he looks gray
I can't leave him alone because I'm civilized
I don't want him drinking no more St. Ide's
So my man, I got the plan
You see the cyst growing on your wrist
Connected to your fist, feel the gist of this
And while you feel the gist of t his
Go to the party and pump ya fist because *singing*
I'm Mr. Chubb Rocker... I'm Mr. Care
I'm Mr. Good Rapper... I'm Mr. Brand New year
Friends call me the Chubbster, any person I touch
Seems to change in my clutch... I'm too much",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-im-too-much-lyrics
Lost in the Storm,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"I walk down the street, yo pick any one
I see a little ruffneck kid with a gun
I said, ""Little homeboy what's up with the Glock 19?""
He said a damn crack fiend just went and took his mama's life
And now the kid's over there smoking the pipe
I said, ""Guilt will let him know what he did
And you don't need to go to jail, you're just a kid
Give me the gun little G, just cool it down
You've got a lot to live for you're college bound.""
And so he screams and cries, we start huggin
On the corner in Ft. Greene, we're buggin
Tears drip as we walk to the crib
And I'mma try to be there to comfort the kid
I woke up it's a brand new day
Little man blew himself away
And I'm scorned, an emotional thorn
And I'm lost in the storm
Well back in the hood, understood, I mean understand
The conspiracy upon the first man
Death to the Klan pump the fists that's connected
To the elbow joined by cartilage to the dark hand
And the plan to conserve this confused violent land
Different races, faces share the same spaces
Sewed by arrogant laces
Taste this peach its real, real sweet
Extra reasoning seasoning to the weak
Will be done before the sun starts to nova
Or we'll be over
Reveal the passion button now hit it
Cause no one is born a bigot
Delete what you have engraved in your mind
And throw up the peace sign
And maybe be reborn or be lost in the storm
Well it's ninety-two we will make it to ninety-three
With no P-E, A-C-E
It won't happen so stop your damn finger tappin
Find the music of peace and start rappin
The answer lies in your hearts then your minds
And maybe then we can save human kind
Put away the guns and have fun was a strong motto in ninety-one
But a Woodstock ninety-two the many join the few to delete the racist crew
Without death cause that will be illogical
Peace will cover every newspaper article
So now then, where do we start
Everybody knows they have to play a part
Open your minds and clear your minds
And throw up the peace signs
Cause to scorn, be reborn, everybody let's be reborn
Or be lost in the storm",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-lost-in-the-storm-lyrics
The Arrival,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Artist: Chubb Rock
Album:  I Gotta Get Mine Yo!
Song:   The Arrival
The birth 1986 Brooklyn USA -- just signed the contracts today
Happy but later on came dismay -- Yo, where is my pay
Just wrote the lyrics to DJ Innovator
We throw the record out now and then you pay later
OK naive me -- the first plot for the Rock
Billboard spot achieved without a bullet so what now
I wanna stimulate the crowd but how?
Should I just sample James Brown
And then I'll just have the same sound
I did it anyway and yo it came off
The beat was abrupt word caught up
Part 2 only a chosen few knew
That it was hot so Chubb Rock was on his way
To express his many views
What record comes next do you haev a clue
The brain waves steady on impulse power
A song it never took an hour
You make an ass out of you and me if you assume
The popeye tune didn't boom didn't create a hip-hop recital
The focal point for the first arrival
Yes like in yes y'all land
Chubb Rock don't you hear success calling
So I pick up the phone then answer
Make it uptempo for the dancers
Floors exploding, club heads voguing
Journalists looking at the Billboard slogan
Number one rap records of the year ""Treat 'em""
From Jack the Rapper to the South of Medem
Reign on the charts like a thunderstorm
Verbal lightning cause I sound exciting
Minstrel shows never ever done 'em
Find the Uncle Tom who did it, gun 'em then we sun 'em
Play a cannonball and like Hannibal Lect it
Silence up the Lambs cause they're screaming like some next shit
Flow like the Nile, I'll smile at the file pile
Dial for the sure best guess test West, Kyle
Scandal and controversy
I'll throw Joan in the River if she hurts me
Sasparillar Diller Phyllis, bill us or kill us, Willis Bruce
Die Hard this album is the damn proof
Coming stronger and stronger hard like Long Donga Silver
For crews who will pilfer
The big man, the biggest of the large man clan
Ku klux that's for red neck fucks
I'm sorry cause I'm not about profanity
But racism let's me lose my sanity
It's a sin it's a sin that's born within
I know it's wack they're trying to kill the black
So every single and album I hit the problem
And all the copyright thieves I got 'em
Respect The Chubbster it's written in the bible word up
And credit The Arrival",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-the-arrival-lyrics
I’m the Man,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Well real smooth connected to the deep end bass groove
I set the precedent for emcees to lose
More than a spelling B it's compelling me
To let the I come before the E except after C to the H
To the U to the double-B, we respect that name cause the rock just G'd
All over the commercial hard like Herschel
The verse will insult but don't take it personal
Everybody knows that I'm the man and
Always got a positive plan for the fans
First concerns as the world turns
To expose the racists like Howard Sterns
George Burns, oh my God, takes a black comedian and he learns
Make more greens than ferns
Horticulture is not my main subject
The subject is microphone check one two
And you don't stop the royalty fees
The Chubbster you know he's
""Gonna get the night on fire...""
Anyway you put it when you see me you know that I'm the man
Hypothetically speaking who's speaking at the function
Well it's some genius who lives by the Junction
He's coming from a Harvard socialite luncheon
Yo -- I hear his jeep clunking
A jeep -- doesn't he make enough ends?
A genius like him should drive a Benz
Well he believes clothes don't make the man or a car
And the man still makes five hundred grand
Every six months yo the kid is no dunce
And he doesn't drink and refuses to smoke blunts
Cause the black must clear the smoke and grab the throttle
And stop livin in a bottle
The Constitution starts tearin
I hope you hear what Gil Scott was Heron/hearin
The destruction of the pirates will calm the seas
The brilliant man you know he's
""Gonna set the night on fire...""
Any female structure?  Biologically I'm the man",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-im-the-man-lyrics
3 Men at Chung King,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Check it out...
Verse One: Red Hot Lover Tone
The pen hits the paper, ink spills and fills, the lines
With lyrics that thrills like my dillz
Take it on the Grilled Cheese tour, then I drop it
Don't care about the niggas cause the girls are gonna jock it
Take her to my hotel, no speaking, just freaking
Leave my door open so the niggas can come peak in
Rip the nappy dug out niggas bug out with the hopes
They can get theirs, but in the meantime they takin notes
Here comes my kid, here comes my kid (ahhhhh)
But I caught him in the rubber lid, huh
Chitty chitty bang bang, gotta go gotta go
The ho is in a coma so I tippy tippy toe
Walkin in the dark (tripped) slipped on my shoe
(Arrrrgh!! Ohh shit!!) 
Damn, more fornication
Puba take the mic cuz I'm here for the duration
Verse Two: Grand Puba
Before I get this wreck I usually start with a 40
But forties are no more cuz now I'm drinkin 64's
Call on Grand Puba, Chubb Rock if you want it done
Hon spread the 411 as if her name was Kaity Chung
Into devil bashing, always stay in fashion
Love maxing and relaxing, hittin skins with a passion
As a shorty I kept some dice I banked on seven or eleven
’Cause my pops had it hard, similar to James Evans
Now shit flipped, I'm on the hip-hop
To the beat you don't stop, rock on!
I kick the new type of lingo, hit the spot that'll tingle
Make the girls wanna jingle, so they run and get the single
My simple task is to make you shake that ass
On the quick fast, and to make it last
It's just three men at Chung King getting busy
We've come a long way since Kunta Kintizzy
And you don't stop, rock on
Chubb Rock flip the script cuz I'm gone
Verse Three: Chubb Rock
Yippi-yi-yeah, stay, hooray, yo, hurrah
I jumped up upon the mic with the Chubbster, Tone, plus the Pu-ba
Intricately go far
Chillin in the mansion, nuff fashion (ahhh)
Relax, and dig into the track and react
I want a Martin Luther riff cuz I don't like to pack my iron
Watchin kids on the corner buyin, gettin zooted then lyin
Test and I commence, to firing
One two three shots and then I tune the black watch
Reclean my cylinder and then I grab my crotch
And squeeze, the testes and then I grab my wood and cup it
Oh there goes the nut I just busted
Get myself together, cuz I'm the man
I knew it, I wanted to do a duet with the Grand
Mystic ruler took the 40 out of the cooler
Now we're rippin the track, we shoulda did one sooner
And then we roll up on the groove field assist the team
And now I'm straighter than 9:15
Get a little dough for this three man skit
I'll end the jam with a curse
Uhh, umm fuck?
Or is it damn?  Or what?
SHIT.  And slide out of the vocal booth and get a dollar Chung King soda

I Gotta Get Mine Yo,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Because I really don't know if I really deserve this
I tried real hard this year took many risks
And so I feel I'm the lucky one so money son
Hasn't diluted the fun
Cause breaking it down until it's broke is no joke
I'ma continute to fracture the groove until I croak
Lyrics flow from the soul, the heart plays a part
Delivered like a dart
Stick to the wax, engraev in the lines
Music awards given to the rhymes
The Chubbster returns for the year ninety-two
Never doubt the clout, the stout
Figure of the person, your brains cells start bursting
When you're alone I know you start cursing
What is that makes him unusual
The rhyme
But yo, I gotta get mine yo
I gotta get mine yo
I propel lyrics like this
And then I attempt to get you to pump your fist
In the air yeah prepare to glare at the big chair
And the album isn't near a million
But several million cildren start clapping
Look at me like Patton
Am I in charge of entertainment
You can hear it pin the tail on the lyric
And then the fan base over there cheers it
Real loud, piercing the ear, can you bear it
But I'll go up and drop a rhyme yo, one time
Say ho bro and yo
I gotta get mine
Well it seems I ripped the show by the seams
Just like the several scenes in my dream
Came on top made a knot so the Rock
Just got three number one Billboard spots
So what should I do next for denerata
Chubb goes in the theater
Well it might but rapping on the mic comes first
And on TV they don't let you rap your verse
So come this summer if you see me on a tour
It won't be the same crew that you've seen before
But the crew in a different form will be back
Kicking buck wild sytle all smiles
I'll come again with a positive conscious rhyme
Cause bro yo, I gotta get mine yo",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-i-gotta-get-mine-yo-lyrics
I Need Some Blow,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Just like on A.T.E.E.M, I'm an addict, I'm an adict
Back at the crib I just cause nothing but static
I think my mama-san is pissed and vexed cause she's had it
Snooped and found my stash in the attic
Not tickled pink she threw my my shit in the sink
My gut is rumbling now I have to think
My sister's jewelry, take it, no more jingling
On the crazy down low take my mom's wedding ring
And float on to the shop called the pawn
And he gives me two yards and my disregard to nothing
The antonym of a hero
I used to be the one now I'm less than zero
But I can feel like a million real fast
Put my lips on the god damn glass
And make a little snow using the snowman
I can't help it I need some blow man
I used to get A's across the board now it's down to H's
And the H's stand for hatred
Kicked a lot of bogusness, conned out of rehab
It was easy -- my man worked at the lab
So I jetted like the Concord but I made a crash landing
Got back on the glass cause life is demanding
First thing to do now is to get a little pistol
I like to smoke blow but I don't like eating gristle
So the hoody comes on while I'm hiding in the corner
Just run ya doe or your mom will be a mourner
The blow make me actlike I don't know
And my ego and my moral go into escrow
The kid that I robbed the other day was my bro
Face covered by the hoody yo should he
Care about his worthless bro -- the answer no
I can't help it I gotta get some blow
My mom was sponsoring a child from Zimbabwe
Whem I'm on the pipe man I have to get my way
Donating about twenty dollars a week
80 dollars a month for that I get a blunt
Everyday I puff several trees
What do I care if he eats every other day
What am I saying, I can't believe I'm a junkie
I can't believe it yo Frank Nitty punch me
Suicide is too good, I need something harder
Maybe go cold turkey, that'll hurt me
Sweat drips on my back I react with a shiver
Eye flutters while my mom closes her shutters
She doesn't believe that I'm trying -- my body dying
She thinks I found a new way of lying
While I revolve the revolver, my mom hears the tune
I'm sorry mom *BOOM*",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-i-need-some-blow-lyrics
The Hatred,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Extremeties excite pulses and in turn different entities
Won't break bread or split the peas
But in the soup the mixture of several racial groups
Minority troops flavors the broth of Wall Street suits
Armani or maybe Versace
Monetary gain can't stop the White House frolics
Judicial alcoholics
Cover up versions of death in the Persian
Now a right angle equals eighty degrees
The Haitians brought the AIDS disease -- NEGATIVE
The scapegoat becomes a raging rhinoceros
Bush is steady watching us
How can we kill their Asiatic crew
Ahh develop a harsh addictive brew
Flood their beighborhood and let their leaders debate it
Part one of the hatred
The sequel the birth of many Uncle Tom's
I myself I can't stay calm
I shake in Bensonhurst rest in Bedford-Stuy
School in Sheepshead Bay, move to strong LI
But my self inner-self breaks North
And like Moses I'm judged by the cloth
Of my heritage who will bring forth the people
In all people there lies that certain evil
The enemy within spreads to the next of kin
A baby's no longer cute, here comes David Duke
Bring a halt and with a wound sprinkle salt
To the black -- lock them in a St. Ide's vault
Burp up the progress, the agony, the pain
Put down the brew have a brain
The freedom ice is thin and we're the first ones to shake
Then comes the real hate
Why should you hate me?  What have I done?
We all have eight fingers and two thumbs
To feel the oppression so every studio session
I try to kick a positive lesson
U.S. coverups are neat like Tony Randall
Brotherly love is melting like a candle
Humanity without human beings
They even said Chubb was against Koreans
I just wanted to state the facts
It seems that no one is against Blacks
Uhh, what should we do?  Should we run?
Uhh, if we run we'll succumb
They're mad so don't you know they're scared of the dark so
And the dark so rule the bank so
So you know that they're mad so
This style developed by Shabba Ranks so
And with that I wanna give thanks so
To the temperment of the strength of Miss Parks
But even now in the nineties we will spark and respark
The hatred",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-the-hatred-lyrics

But I'm married, my ass got carried to the room
But delph, in layman's language for self
And I'm in love -- in love with my health
So honey phone while I click the Nick Nolte
And down a can of beer and watch Cape Fear yeah
Watch DeNiro my hero fry like a clown
It's all for one I hope you have some
Slown down as the puss from the hot itchy burning little stunt
I bet on is what you really want
Cause by the cheek smile, eyes that are hazel
You know who's really vex -- my man nasal
The nigga who ate the sauteed shrimp and basil
Bitch stay still I'm not over with you yet
My man got burnt now it's time to fret
Airport bathroom I wasn't too far to hear my man go

Dance or some bust ass advance so to enhance
Your appreciation for one creation
That God didn't make a mistake to make
Flake if you wanna, gonna, hauna, trama, go tell ya mama
And your honor my actions don't believe the drama
During the chorus found Chuck Norris and so then yo Chucky
You had juice you fought Bruce and now you wanna duck me
And hug me damn Vanilla Chutney
You wanna shut me down like Chuck D
And I will kill, act ill, thrill with skill, Bill
And then I ass whip and I then skip
To the loo n wax you and your crew and
Give a liter to some damn pupil booin
Like Uhh yo, you, sensei rock
Act like you know a judo a chop chop chop
You know I walk down the streets of the Soho in Tokyo
On my arm no Yoko Ono so yo
I don't know the vibes or the lives at the rice with chives
After the rice with chives is giving me hives
I don't know what to say about the place
I  mean everybody here has a smile on their face
So I'm rolling with the scenery and glad I came
If I see some o ill shit like black rain I'm O-U-T
Three strikes and take some Sony kid off his bike
And be ghost and step hard like a dyke
Yeeeeesssss Bruce Lee was the best
But the kid also drank more wine than they did on Falcon Crust
But no juice or blunt or stunt or brew
Or tres or hate or friends or crews
Will never stop Chubbs and draw four Uno
Act like you know a judo a chop chop chop
Why did you leave the palace when I told you not to
And now I have to put on the Gee and chop you
Into pieces not Reese's I hope no one yo see this
Cause your whipping will be the topic of my thesis
John Saxon please bow to the captain
Before you're waxing ignore all the clapping
That you're hearing, cause you half stepped on preparing
Your style, so be gone with the smile, I'll
Listen to your lest request, the S off your chest went West
And know yo test the last cess
That you're gonna get ya mess
Puff the blunt then begin to fret
You use the crane and I think I will start with the tiger
To extract all the blood and saliva
And puncture your structure with the art of the Sumo
Bow and act like you know, a judo, a chop chop chop",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-enter-the-dragon-lyrics
I Don’t Want to be Lonely,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"My better half steps, the door closes
Hence the realistic War of Roses
With history every war had an ending
With casualtoes, but half of these
Men, the battle was an ego thing
After I kick this rhyme Eric will sing
The true statement that lies here
Every day every month that's in a year
Has to be spent making this work
Sometimes I know that I act like a jerk
I have no experiences, I never felt this way
You misconstrue what I display
Love, honestry and trust is a must
Communication wrapped in lust
But being that I can't sing but the words are by me
I got a little help -- Eric sing it G
Passion easily mistaken for compassion
I know why you wanted to jet
No respect
I guess in that department I had a low rating
I remember in front of Crossland Savings
We said the magic words, I looked in your eyes
Blood percolates, hearts yells cries
For us to come together for better and for worse
I don't even know how to end this verse
Utopia, you're wishing and I'm hoping
We can keep on dancing to Michael Bolton
When a man loves a woman just like I do
Our joining will make little love struck crew

Communication wrapped in lust

If I walk down to the corner and shop I'm a goner
A Bodega is a no-no so where should I get my grub
Without you idiots trying to rub -- me out
Cause I'm the victim on your main route
You take me out and you might get some clout
Anger is driving around in a red Wrangler
Looking for all you black stranglers
To squeeze your reasoning try to find the answer
You try to rob you'll get a Jolly Rancher
For ya dragon, brotherly strength and gaggin
Put away the gun son, run
For cover, seek sanctuary with your mother
Ahh my brother
My brother four times
Take the time to check the clock and don't smother
Other being when both are already fleeing
From the same oppression, the lesson
Here has been ignored for many years and years
Fears has created many hostile years
Hoover sustained the first hate maneuver
Jiggaboo and now I have to also be afraid of you
Think like Brown or Franklin and be thanking
The one you pray to, they're after you too
Don't try to switch, they're not after no other
But us my brother
Mississippit Burning gets my stomach churning and yearning
I d on't care how much we're earning
Each year we dissipate in the air yeah
Change our line of thought put away the damn quart
Of brew the intoxicated crew knew
We couldn't come hither if we're destroying our liver
So what should we do earn our little pittance
And act real ignorant just like the Buttmins
Put away our t hings and sing a different sound
Come home and you might get beat down
Down down down you won't touch no other
Why not no other, my brother",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-my-brother-lyrics
Black Trek IV - The Voyage Home,I Gotta Get Mine Yo!,1992,"Intro/Chorus:
Ninety-two!  The rebel comes back
I wanna go home, so won't you please go home
I wanna go home, so won't you go home
I wanna go home, so won't you please go home
I wanna go home, so nigga go home
Verse One:
Yo, it's burning in Paris, Demaris, the madness, I've had this
The sadness, even Gladys, lost her Pips
It means it's time to make a trip to Johannesburg
I don't care -- what the word is about
Cause my history has to spout
From all over the land while I eat some trout
Cause America, my motherland ain't hearing ya
If I can catch her, Thatcher damn I'll use my Derringer
Political polls calls for death tolls, bullet holes
Wolves in the fold
The sum can't be greater than the whole
But many have died -- died while they cried
Pearl Harbord ninety-two, that's the idea
I mean Port Natal it's right there
The revolution won't be televised this time
The schematics draw from the mind
Besides physical we need mental fighters
For the destruction of the vipers
The coffee without the sugar and the cream is too strong
And we're back where we belong
Chorus
Verse Two:
The winners, legends or beginners
Get on the scene and then they turn into sinners
Yes they say they're a born again christian
Read a bible but they're really on a mission
That's hostile so sing your gospel
Check the region of the first man fossil
Plain truth embedded in hieroglyphics
The specifics of american civics get real sticky
Rap has put it back on track
With hard core conscious rap
But magazine fiends aim for the gut
What should I do?  Keep my mouth shut?
Hell no!  The editor scandal predator
Hip-Hop predator racist pig etcetera
Political henchmen why you never mention
Is it because you're trying to save your pension?
A lot of power and strength locked away in prison
Yeah yellow journalism cause we delete love
And push the word in our songs
And we're back where we belong
Chorus
Verse Three:
We need some kind of power, some kind of skill
Keep one FB-I/eye open cause you know they wanna kill us
Cause we're dangerous to their plan
We rule the whole damn land
Basketball, baseball, music, TV, movies, even art
But they're smart
Somehow makes us fight among ourselves
Place pictures of our prophets upon their shelves
They kill this, kill that one, paid us to kill him
Such a bright future now looks dim
But the empire will strike back with much more than a rap
How're you gonna react
I once said burn the plueprints on the counterattack to redeem
Causer racial peace is our dream
But it's a dream we have that won't come true
We've been talking peace for a few
Black is not, it never left
I don't need no beads placed around my chest
To be considered a black man
A picture of Malcolm is not on my wall
He's in my heart, that's smart
And then there's Uncle Toms that's partial
And kids that don't know Thurgood Marshall
Grab gold of reality G real strong
We're going back to where we belong

Rocking for the kiddies
To do shows for rows, no foes, dough in escrow
All the money went to goddamned Joe
For cleaning the bus, we cussed, caps were bust
On us, Joe should have adjust to the goddamn musk
We were the Christmas and Joe Damn was merry
And kids had nothing but jokes just like Perry
Every night at the show was a good night
Hot Dog and Ev in the morning had a food fight
Chicken all over, rice, ham, beverage, pastrami
Yo it was comedy -- The B.A.N
Back on the bust take the musk to the next city
And snoring by Frank Nitty
I'ma tell you I was about to be outtie
Lucky for me that homeboy Kirk Gowdy
Brought his tapes so flexed cause we were vexed
And seeked salvation in Derek X
So thank you thank you and alladat
Played the hell out of the Nubians
 -- the shit was fat
So now we're in Lafayette, Louisiana
Bought a three eighty from some little Dan Tana
Ripped the show got the dough and gained some fans
The grill dusty message to the B.A.N
On the whole tour Rob was a fiend
He had the ugliest girl I've ever seen
He was with her the whole time after the show
He turned the light on -- me and Jojo said YOOOOOO!
What is that?
Rob you're bugging G damn her grill is wack
Your grill ain't alladat but you can do better
My man even had phone calls and sent her letters
In at the Denny's on the corner no one seen us
On Pokey's burger -- everything on it -- even penis

Impressed all the peers
Now in '92 I find a brand new crew
That's real raw and go back on four
With the one to make gigantic funds
On the stage not with water guns
Oh I shouldn't say that, did they play that
There's a grudge the budget did pay that
Oh I did that's a fib close that lid
And you look at all the things in my crib
Not you or him but all, you want to end this shit make a call
I'm a man so you mice become men
Let's squash this shit and maybe then
We can say we're friends, to forget that
You niggas are weak and cheap like a triple fat
Check your sound and roundin no poundin
I'm Johnny Weismuller watching you drown and
Like lotto, orugh is the motto, Ricky Ricardo
Taxi has Elaine Nardo
Everyone has a title and they're idle
This recital refrains from the bible
Oh the Titans are the Tions tie ins
Cry in the hanky franky where's the fly ins
Or sample, example gold on the mantle
And no lyrics stand still
Friends trade em, rate em, never hate them
Or pay them and you can quote them verbatim
Yes the Chubbster, Hustler or the Rustler
Man with the planb I crush and you're just an imitator
Faker, five me a break, a taker
See you laer with a litigator
I'm from JA MA ICA
Not from Warner, Sony or RCA
We need a label based and run in Mecca

Bust I stand alone

The pubic box was locked locked

Never let a girl put you to the exit

I think I made a little dough and they say I'm fly
But am I?  Am I?  ""Yeah""
I'm I'm so fly why do I wear this gear
Clothes don't make the man it's the other way around
I live by this and I'm still platinum bound
Mistakes were definitely made in the past
Friendship contracts thrown in the trash
The guilt is not enough to tilt the game
Perseverance preserves the grame
Of an unusual talent with gallant views
Mimicked by other crews
The first attempt gets exempty
The royalty about 38 minus 8 and a quarter percent
For taxes point seven damn cents
Hence financial failure -- musical uplift
The depression didn't result in draw of a spliff
The production of the LP great by the hands of HT
Well appreciated G
Family bonds loosen then gone
Emotional debris contains memories tranquil and calm
Future seems to predict the Forbes state of being rich
But never switch Rich
But which way is up
The Webstorial monarch sparks once more
The beginning of a world wide tour
My show is fine, no props like last time
No visual effects on the rough set
Debuting hey portrait hard work
Fame ain't about chasing a damn skirt
And if I chase a skirt it'll be my own
And if not let me cast the first stone
The blood puddles paramedics on the double
Production huddles journalists write rebuttals
The question is he the best is he
Can't get an interview because he's too busy
No spotlight only concentrating on the duckets
Duckets to fill pails and buckets
The Chubbster, the one, the man who is flowing
If I get flam and change the pitch like Ryan Nolan
The undiscovered country is where I am going
Test and you get cancer of the colon
After the karm and the physical trauma
You wanna be my man and act like drama
Save that Yang and mix it with Tang
For your mama and don't ssstammmer
On the mic -- the mic can delete the squids
And the squids tell financial fibs
But it is OK hey still on the same path
Won't ever switch -- never switch cause Rich",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-which-way-is-up-lyrics
Caught Up,Rapmasters 7: The Best of the Laughs ,UnKnown,"Well I'm nimble
And I'm nice like Kris Kringle
But Joe I got caught, caught, got swindled
Me and a couple of boys at Kings Plaza
Walkin' through the mall to see if they had a
Couple of shirts, a few pants
Just out of the blue, went, took a glance
In front of Macy's I seen two girly-girlies
One looked def, the other looked like Mr. Furley
With my ego trip, my Wilson flip
I used my lip to get both on the sneak tip
Then I sicced it
Kicked it to the ugly one
Souped her up, I called her Lipton and honey one
Things like that, gibberish and crap
She's a skeezer, there's no need for chit or chat
Her body looks , kinda good, yeah, but
As for her face, Jabba The Hut
I shoulda played Michael Jackson, told her to beat it
I said, what the heck, I got a condom, freak it
Her nickname now is Mona the rover
She looks like a dog so I dogged it on the sofa
Some dumb reason though, it was fun
Now she's looking good to me, I'm caught up part one

I'm in love with an ugly girl, but hey
I'm gonna kick it to the pretty one today
She seems nice and she's a fly cutie
Called her up I said, ""Hi my name is Chubbs,"" her name was Judy
I don't have to tell you guys the rest
But I asked her to go out, she said yes
Took her to the movies and then to my house
Led the girl straight to the couch
Like a game, I have to score
Dim the lights, get the two-ply condom from the drawer
Took off her shirt and only then I asked the question
Yo? who broke wind? something smells bad, dang
It won't let up!
It was Judy, the cutie! yo, word up!
So now I got an ugly girl and one with the smell
But which one should I choose? oh well
I'm caught up

I know I'm hard, 'cause I'm Chubb Rock
But even to my chest I got a soft spot
That could easily be ripped apart
I'm hard like the Tin Man but I got a heart
Every night it seems I stay home sick
Trying to figure out which girl will I pick
Ripping my heart, damaging my soul
All these problems because of a little hole
And recreation in a bed
But Mona and Judy are getting me fed
Up to the point I couldn't even hold my own
I was like E.T., I had to phone home
To ask my mom a question she always knows
She says Chubby, follow your heart and your nose
Be celibate, no girl, be a loner
But I picked the ugly girl yeah, I picked Mona",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-caught-up-lyrics

I arrive from the steps of Sinai cause I'm fly
When you're high from the lye
You see me mingle in the sky
The dim light superceeds the street cock fight
Straight heterosex, but I still Dick Van, your dyke
From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship
The Brooklyn-based scholar and them niggas past Islip
And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that Fugee-la voo doo
Will do you like Italian deli kids slicing prosciutto
I barb you like Bobbito, the airport, right through Heathrow
Release murder niggas like Ito
Pure hatred, cause he picked who he picked to mate with
Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it
Hey, revamp the swing to parlay
How black power went sour, where's Brother Jay
Where's the pink Cadillacs protected by whoever
The red and the black, green, Hilfiger nigga
Indians wanna protect the Lone Howling Chief
So kids create beef

Back in the days when we had nothin but beef
At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids when they have beef, you might die
Why

While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the Rover, never sober, fuck that
Yo dun, I run with wild Crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back kid, that's why we hold something
And break your punk ass down just like you stole something
When I rock with Chubb your block show me love
Nigga what, want beef, we drawing first blood

Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name
I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefing in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, proving all these white folks right
We like some crabs in a barrel tryin to get on top
The Hit Squad, Chubb Rock represent hip-hop
So kill the beef


Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminating flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fucking up the game
But me you can't tame an outlaw like Jesse James
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest
Who's the best, but let it rest because there's no contest
Temptation, accusations need to stop
Unify hip-hop, PMD, Chubb Rock

Now - I will come back to the groove
Now my man Common on wax slayin Ice Cube, anyway, that's cool
That nigga somewhere higher learning
And of course there's that famous beef between Parrish and Sermon
And that's cool, both those niggas killed Jane
And now there's Nice without Smooth, that's insane
And I heard they squashed that and that shit should cease
Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beef",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-beef-lyrics
Life,The Mind,1997,"Yeah, it's like this..
Chubb Rid-dock, nine-seven on lid-dock
Son, rock..

Do you know, where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showin you?
Where are you goin to?
Do you know, what you're lookin for?
Do you like the things that life has in store?
Chubb holds it down for sure..

Ever since mom kissed me and said, ""Seek life!""
My mind had an idea like that kid with the kite
No 'caine slingin, strong-arm bringin check my eyes
Redness done, so I can script ""My Life"" like Mary Blige
I've, been around the world in 90 days, pro-rated
Like Prince no shame for that past few Sheila's I've dated
Made it, with only one but I'm foreshadowing the rhyme
Like a nice Pirollo(?) wine, life takes time
I'm, one of two and to see it a one who's part of many
The quarters of my thoughts will cost more than a damn penny
Any debate we can correlate as to my release date
A nine-seven slate, New York state will have to check me
It's been some time since the break of the dawn
The genre has definitely changed since I've been gone
Whether, bad or good the flow remain tight
So I can come and drop my li-ight, li-ight


Well in the past black men used to work for (?)
My age group was plotting to obtain Dead Nixons
The plot, had three vectors for young prospectors
School, entertain, or become Hannibal Lectors
Stressors, used to stress the best, cess wine
But at that particular time I chose to use my mind
Goody too, size twelve shoe the Troy Ave grew
Waited 'til, after eighteen to introduce the brew
Downed the suds and gave a street buzz
High in the +Forrest+ but stupid is as, stupid does
And, that's all I have to say about that
Flipped a Pulitzer prize script and started rap
Simplistic at first, and the knowledge came later
Rob-ski, Dave Wit, and Swanny on the fader
The struggle was on but the fame was in sight
And the tunnel had a light that distinguished my life


The low point was mad low when I lost James Los
Spent eighteen years livin next to this high-pro bro
And that's all I got to say, about that
While I give thanks to the man that my brother and I'm back
Onward, to the medals while the boys aged the mix
To the mental utopia, so walk past the six
And the rhyme and the flow, must stay real tight
Like it's always been in my li-i-ife, my life",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-life-lyrics
I Am What I Am,The Mind,1997,"Here we go, ha ha
Thou shalt not have no other great one but me
Transcribin my lyrics is the C-H-U-B
The lyrics that you hear is not his but mine
While, biblical words don't need to ra-hyme
I said, ""Let there be a light,"" and there was light
And the breeze (?), like that kid who made ""I-Ight""
But men took mad dominion, over men
Hard bondage with backs and, knees that must bend
But only in prayer, I make your head need Ibuprof'/Bayer
Call me, the number one player
But hey.. the one pharoahes, parlayed
In the land of Egypt, when that slave shit behaved
Bythia(?) drew me, from the Nile to smile on the people
After me there will be a sequel
And I'll praise my name, in the jam
Call me what you want, but I am what I am

Hehe, I live in the souls of men, and women
And pilgrims and children who wiggle, to the rhythm
Just go, the people have corrupted themselves
They toke the devil's smoke, puffing their L's
I'll send, my only son down, to bless you
And observe how you know him, and that will test you
Years, of sufferation, will burn the nation
With adultery, skirt-chasin and crotch-blazin
You never learn - look how many times I kilt ya
I burnt ya, I drowned ya, I froze ya
I stripped your land and destroyed ya culture
Next time you better give me some
R-E-S-P-E (C-T) now hold ya but I love ya
I invented AIDS but also, invented the rubber
Each one teach one brother
Take my name in vain and you're gone like damn
Call me what you want, but I am what I am

Ha ha
Now you got light skin, dark skin, East coast, West coast
Old school, new school, dumb-ass fools
One land, one people, I am the one
Figure you disobeyed so I made the word ""nigga""
You can change the diction, but can't change what I'm writin
I script those Pulitzer books for that kid, Michael Crichton
Like {*tch tch tch*} I am the hi-hat
I am the M-I-C, I am Easy Mo Bee
And Easy Mo is me, he gets down when I want him to get down
I put the heights in the crown
I wrote the dead sea scrolls, I'm ""Strictly Business""
I made Erick and Parrish go gold
My crew is tan, darker than tan, I made the Ku Klux Klan
I made Rush +Def+ but, able to +Jam+
I'm flam, and I'm intricate
You must and should be a fan and I am what I am

The praise of the ""Goodfella"" is long past done
DeNiro's an actor, on cue, totin a gun
ACTION! Forty-five colt bolt, it gets messy
Then copycat murders flow to Joe Schmoe Pesci
Then the ladies, sex, to the break of dawn and
Another quaalude, and she'll love me in the mornin
Fast pace, ""Scarface,"" you can't win, God's race
When you're sparkin Noah's Ark, and you're in God's place
Baby - cock up your foot and you act crazy
Every ""Distinguished Gentleman"" wants a lady
You can't bug, when you wanna play real life cocoa
When you're ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills"" with Oprah
""Mi Vida Loca,"" and then it turns to weed smokers
Then you're dead, dealin with them kids from +cosa nostra+
But no autographs you must, already be a fan
I am what I am and that's all that I am",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-i-am-what-i-am-lyrics

Rockin for the grassroots and up keep the people
The movement of the bowel from that lay shit of the vowel
Mad share yeah, from Mr. Mufasa with the growl
The party's mad dead until I care to appear
Kids wanna know where the hell I been for the past year
No beer or no parka Nike gear no wear or tear
The new mic holder who causes, any fair
Some max and relax then mellow then strive
Shock-value MC's goin platinums with lies
The neophytic critics, who need big bats to hit it
They zone with the metronome clone to dome split it
When I joke around like Zog, rename them is like fog
I can flow digital, though my style is analog
I, base my career upon these years of how I've strived
Three years gone but I will survive, ha

A little, always scared in the place I scare any new rival
Past years missin dissin scripting up this new bible
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican or some black nigga who's peakin
The lyrics are abundant, dirty fat blue beats are pungent
And now we gotta see how hot, will the son get
I'm a lyrical defamer, like Gloria I'm a Gaynor
In the music biz I opened up more doors than Kramer

Overzealous inhabitants flock with abundance
Paying tribute, to the one the circumfrence
Of the stadium, is paying homage, to my cranium
The sea of heads doesn't seem to hide the lady
In the back row, waving her hands for the ohh
The usual crowd rock line for a show
And I dispense with the usu-al, and keep it coastin
To boom up the set my advice is take a motion
Before you walk through the door, of a Chubb Rock tour
Buy the anthology in any store

Chubb Rock, KRS-One, get 'cha mind blown
Now we gon' talk about.. {Reputation!}
.. your reputation
(It's about to blow.. shit's about to blow big)
Reputation {Reputation!}
(Mental countdown) {Reputation!}
Lyrical skills we bring for the nation
(We have liftoff) Chubb Rock come down!

I am the big time figure, the bass drum hitter
The I am what I am rogueish nigga
A flow like lava, to heat up the chatta
Heat up ya mat'ta, then go stick her daughter
I oughta, 
Joe Cocker your opera
Crowd rock ya, I make you scream ""Oooh ah ah!""
I, indubital mental big head
Praying for a battle if ya battle, you're dead
Get diesel, I do ya like they did Bugsy Siegal
I'm on the mic and Kris is really on the me-tal
Cuttin, backspinnin and recuttin
Your english bugged so you can't do me nuttin
Laced up lyrics and the beat real tight
Your song is wrong and I get focused right
With the EQ, be who, be you
When you're trying to be me, you and your crew
Just stop, before the shit gets too hot
You need respect - just to get a rep

Tra la la la la la la la lay
We the freshest deejay in America today, hey hey!
Tra la la la la la la la lay
We the freshest deejay, in America today - hey hey!

Well the lyrics of my peers have changed course here's
Platinum LP's, the subject is to swear, yeah!
And who wears what and what, fashion is up
And which designer cut is more corrupt
It's an open and shut case, no ill look is on my face
While the bass growls, profound nouns buy a vowel
I'm concerned because, ""You Must Learn""
Before you croak, I've been dope since I was sperm
Sellin records, but of course with no return
On the mic you know I burn baby {*inhales*}
With your beats you know you have no respect
Kids haven't walked wild since ""Go Stet""
And I bet when they stage rock they get booed
They need qualuudes to get crude and extra rude
The spirits have haunted your lyrics so I slept
Got nuff Z's, tryin to get a rep

If you thinkin that it's KRS you wanna take out
You better reroute quick you got it, all wrong
See when I grab the microphone career is finished
You better reroute quick you got it, all wrong
I do not mean to diss you but we simply are the best ones
And you can call him Chubb or you can call me KRS-One
Either way you'll get done, anywhere, any one
Me and lyrics one ton, straighten up and choose one SON
In nineteen-ninety-sess, KRS is in his peak'n
You will weaken and collapse like Michael at the Beacon
You talk more ish than a senator
You can't last, just call me enema, cause I'll be in that
Ass-teroid, heaven to merkatroid
I'm that 6L microphone holdin humanoid
Psychological like Sigmund Freud
But I get annoyed, cause these rappers have no brain
These hardcore rappers crack me up like cocaine
They got no skill or game
They sound like that commercial that be sayin
""Ask for Minoxonil, with Rogaine""
True skills I will explain
The T'Cha breaks the campaign down plain
{People always talk about..}
Complete blowout, complete blowout {Reputation!}
Check, complete blowout {Reputation!}

Where you slave to the rhythm of con-troling the masters
I. Smythe, whether you drive a Benz or a bike
Whether you straight hit or you go strictly Dyke
Dick Van, no drugs I only snort Dristan
And I point to the sister, and yes I can can
A, gangsta lean get funky like a latrine and
Lyrics scream deep into the +Roots+ like Ben Vereen
Rockin, the Apple, since the Mayor were (?)
I smacked double platinum, or hit gold watch
I'll achieve, notoriety just like (?)
Squad squeeze, but they can mingle with the breeze

Journalists script shit, that gets me kind of pissed
No real award given to the, funkiest hits and
Lyrics get prolific and, kids start to sip it
Esophagus start bulge, specific and centrific
Get a dollar, if I sell more than the group Abba
The Source critics still want to diss my yabba, dabba-da-doo
The pulse that revived the crash crew
If I'm rockin, on the ra-a-adio eww
Why they, can't downgrade but if they try
I rock from Brooklyn to that Crooked-Letter-I
I, my temper, I remember starts to boil
The (? ?) but happy that the heads stayed loyal
The groove hits the ground from the maker of ""Get Down""
Peace love and all that shit plus five pound
Buy hey, parlay - you don't know my way
These are the games we play..


Mo hits the beat then Chubb handles the rappin
The un-thinkable flow is fly plus extra napkins
And the girls 'pon Flatbush look stush without my googles
And look as they squint then I blink push up the throttle
I, meet this to eat this I, leave this to Beavis
If I wanna smoke ya spliff I might get, stiffer than penis
Oooh, I had to go and rip your whole crew
With freeze love ran land butt rub and blue ooh
Dippi - dippi dip on you
With all my niggas and squads and the, funkiest jew
Ar-tistic lift it start the trend to the phonics
And, funk all pure lyrics that turn to alcoholics
Ghetto tales, start to prevail the shit

No blood donors, I credit diabetics who drink sodas
While in the pens lie the ruffneck soldiers, what happened?

What happened to all of that Malcolm X shit before he got trapped?
Before he got capped? When I mean CAPPED
When they put his name on all those cute little Spike Lee hats

For the past three years, I've been eatin more than lesbians
Lyricists, get fists, twists, careers become tears
Easy gold records, but with no, publishing shares
When I BELLOW, over a hardcore track with a cello
Lyrical structure, basting from a fellow, hello

Clear the Decks,The Mind,1997,"Like the blessing of kids, none budhist the breeze
And the vocal mist scared and gets maried to ?
Exec's 'recs, discripting I bounce checks and the big cribs
And the promise of sex layed
From costumes contaning Shell Adidas, and the Runners and Gooses
And the rap companion ?leaders?
And the phone and the celular way stayed Rome
?Lebotomizinc? the Aribic ??? ?
I arrive in a nick of time
Drowning in depht with the bullshit rhyme lyrics
After 10 to kill boom critics
With the chrome and my man Curt Hon with the ??
And this might, if you like the no mic holders
And the Flatbush ?gushies? the ruffneck soldiers
Told me: ""Come from stick place flex""

Strictly in fact on a ??? fort
Brought up on a first hot trend swift, no corpse

Done vibes bones and a chrome metronome
And the Lexus dreams to keep up with the jones

Back-back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today

For those who don't know the name
Or can't distingush the rame
It's the legendary Chubbsta who was arround when Jane
Was arround Eric and P
For something on that LIE homie
The bass of A Tribe Called Quest with
Hip-hop at that time was mentaly older
Had lyrical soldiers, KRS was the holder of the bolders
The mortals of Latin Quarter had no time for nickle and dimes
We need to go on 
+Great Adventures+ with Ricky D
 rhymes
I'm the biggest fan of this rougish gonra
Exec's will con ya while the regiments will be on you to harm ya
If you disrespect the microphone on check
Put 'em in a yoke and snap his neck and rip a 60 minute set
I will arive before the sampagne wishes
The caviar dishes
Chicken of....witch is P.E.'s +Gratest Misses+
When you meat and the movement I win
Getting stoped, it kills me but it was the birth of Mr. Rock-Rock

Back-back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today
Back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today

......in the hearse of themes
For a positive verse at this point I settle for one lace with a curse
All eyes are blue to the one that acts rod
Brilliant deep rooted talents somehow gets mold
Can I tackle this beast to ass
To calm the savage beast is a simple tentask
I am the best thing since sliced wheat bread
The anger in my-am turns graffit to led
We're on
Script nothing but black thought
Educated ghetto street want to meet me
Pure knowledge the sense flows through the smirkings
Touch my hand you start to shape like
I am what I am and what I am is the man
Never take it in vain but my man....but damn
I'm the lyrical all that hits the BS
Can't stop it bores me
And they call me Mr. Rock-Rock-Rock ya don't stop

Keepin it real, so you can feel

This is the 5th LP and this big kid is still alive
He is the shit like Windows 95 sharp like a zip drive
I've brought my tounge and its high sprung ego
Everywhere he go, we go, you know
I am still in tune with the rhythm
Clinton in the prez' but I voted for Sherly Chizm
The memory is erratic it snaps like elastic
Rap needs no doctor though some of the members are pedeatrican
That is fantastic it leaves room for adults
Crate diggers, beat freaks or lyrical goats
And I'm all three, it's me three time fold
The some of the parts must equal the whole
And some are measuring their words with nothing but gold
And platinum trinkets for those who sold
Is it the true art form or you can form for the not
I'm the artist of the year
And they call me Mr. Rock-Rock-Rock you don't stop

The Man,The Mind,1997,"Whenever you need good lovin
You gotta understand, it takes a man, a man
To keep you satisfied

Ha ha ha
Now toys are for boys, men don't need Mattel
Objects to manipulate and sell
The women or the girls whichever name flip your curl
Acts for nonsense delivered by the boys of the world
BUT I!! I.. am.. totally ignorant to that type of pride
Yell, when your groin starts to rebel
Yo L, I told you that we would sell
Oversell to the point now, that the pockets, start to thicken
How in the world did women become chickens
Is it the, Alize or the weed
Shredded on the tray, that make the queens flow this way?
Me, I don't need none of that.. type.. drama
No typical style, for the man who rules the genre
The opera, no choir boys, I'll direct your band
Change your tune for the man, and..

Whenever you need good lovin
You gotta understand, you need a man, a man
Who can provide..


Ha ha ha ha
To redeem, I heard black men, I mean boys
Sayin they beat their queen, that type rush
Can't paint the scene, dissipates the dream
Of black king, black queen, becomin one team
From actress purses, harlequin romance verses
Ghetto curses, ends up in front of nurses
The Yo-G male, the bourgeoise male
The two-car male and the male that needs mail
The woman start to, get empowered by Alice Walker
Waiting to inhale the fumes of the New Yorker
Question - did you trust her, in front of pimps players
And hustlers, does she need a Benz or a duster
End of question, start of answer, contradiction
Exhale, dangle in romance fiction
The love test, is like do you need to understand
Don't cram, you need a real man, and..

Ha ha
While the light gleams in her aspect
Does that mean respect, voiced by Franklin, ignored by the inept
Baggy pants wearer, Million Man March
 bearer
All those who suffered through the Agent Orange era
Do we really maim the beautiful ones
The sons similak by anger, while the women get shunned
It's above me, another cop out, another rot out
Swapping +Tears For Fears+, while we +Shout+ out
Past pain, that reverberates the claim
That the disrespect started when we, were in chains
Could be - but should be, it wouldn't be, if we
Real men, scriptured by the zen
And even then, women must know which is which
When their groins itch, for the rich damn
There's a lot to try, to somehow understand
Boys will be boys, but find a real man and..

Ow! Man.. the man.. ha ha

Treat ’Em Right,The One,1990,"Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robocop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, ""What...
Kind of music is this for you to dance to?""
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Throw the vial in the Nile; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation, sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins, and when you're walking, you don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Anyway the struggle is won, brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep, jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off, yo, smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it, and party people, sing it

Treat me right, I'll treat you good

Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
""Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
I'm his number one fan, yes I am""
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all times, ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans, I'm never mean
Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene
Always says hello, cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a superstar, that's hollow
Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens, and plus naked
So we owe them, so pull out your pen
Sign an autograph, you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it


Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the band rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ed Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it



Well, coming back
To nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, I'll definitely lead you right
Just treat me right, peace!

Treat me right
Treat me right
Treat me right",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-treat-em-right-lyrics
Just the Two of Us,The One,1990,"Yoooooo!
Chubb Rock comin back hard for nineteen nine-TY!
Word up, word up
Kick this out to my man Rob Swinga, Hot Dog Dinky
Manager (?) Ev Lover y'knahmsayin? Dr. No, here we go..

It's the Hitman, yes the Hitman, yo ya know it
The thirst quencher, the man on the sequencer
He was scared to kick a sixteen bar, he's not a rap star
Not saying that I am, but I'm the jam
I'm going to kick a little not a Dr. Suess riddle
No cats in hats, fox in some socks
But to the DJ jocks check your clocks
Half past what? Time to bust nut
Not a pistachio; he uses a Casio keyboard
And a Tascam board
To kick in the P-50, get nifty
Born with the gift, time to get riffed
Not with the manufacturing of a spliff
He never rolled one; never sold none
The beats give me the high that brought fame to us
And, how we gonna kick it, How?
(Just the two of us!)

Chubb has been dope since he came out the shaft of his pops' wood
Yes I'm (*good!*)
Yo he shouted and he plopped into the uterus
And they knew this about me; was gonna be a dope MC
When I get on the mic my windpipe strikes and ignites
A lyric when you hear it you fear it and like
Chubb is not a man to get souped like Campbell
I'm the man with the plan and my jam sells
Like a whore, in the store, hardcore and more
On the tour makin money you never saw
I don't like dreaming, never ever beam and
Never involved with girls like like scheming
Or skiing or toboggan sledding, cause I'm shredding
Any thoughts of a wedding, so Helen, Keller
Listen to the rules and
Me and Hitman Howie Tee is all about coolin
She went buckwild, screamed, yelled, hollered
I told her I loved her and then she did a solid
Did it real good like a nice girl should
Back polish waxed up the hood
Yo Hitman Howie Tee you should have seen her on me
She got all Vanessa Del Rio on me
But after she slept cause I had nothin left
On the Martin Butler tip, yes half step
But yo cousin Howie Tee and me
Our love is all about making a dope LP
That will crush and sell and bum rush
Don't hush, how we gonna do it How?

What’s the Word,The One,1991,"Mr. Bush, you better check out your OWN part
In the divine drama.  You may find YOU the Devil!

Listen.. cause in 1990
Chubb Rock and the gang is on a banned mission
Hostility will rule like a Jamaican ??
And ooh filled with dumplings, hopefully no dumpings
Like guns will be present while I keep the people jumpin
Not too much, South Africa isn't free yet
I spoke to the kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck
New Jersey, and they heard me while I cursed the
White minority regime, painted an ill scene
Brothers and sisters over there dyin
Mandela in a cell in Robin Island
Thank God he's out now - and while I sing
I know he has things in a full swing, yeah
This year crumb-snatcher Thatcher, we're gonna catch her
Being a klutz, her husband is a drunk putz
He acts absurd, now what's the word?
	""Johannesburg!"" (2X)
	""Okay okay, come on."" (6X)
	""If he's the President, pullin out my Ray-Gun"" -] Chuck D

Listen.. cause brothers and sisters
It's time for everyone to go fishin
For your history - open a book and read
Between the lines, don't recline your mind
Sometimes I don't know how to make it understood
That a lot of black movies have been tampered by Hollywood
So it's important take the name and date and step
Research it yourself, cause you owe a large debt
To yourself - your history is yours to keep
.. or you won't reap
In the benefits, don't let Mr. Rabinuwitz
Sell you something with a sing, to get blissed
Leave the rock to the Nazis, excel in Yahtzee
Be a bookworm, not a bookend, cause men
Before you have died so you can taste freedom
If we can't beat em we'll delete em, so now
What's the word?
	""Johannesburg!"" (2X)
	""Okay okay, come on."" (9X)
	""If he's the President, pullin out my Ray-Gun"" -] Chuck D

Throughout history, no physical might has ever crushed
The invincible spirit of a nation
And yes we are a nation, a different coloration
But that isn't significant - pull a ligament
While you're standin, pumpin your fist they will miss
And crumble and remain in the cold abyss
And now it's time for action, action is the verb
The pronoun I will say scream ""What's the word?""
Now come on.. what's the word?!
Alright.. I'm gonna bring in the aspect
Of my man Rob-n-O, the Jamaica aspect, come now

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm gonna chase up ?? and run down Botha
Botha betta run him betta start ??
I mash up ?? when he conquer
Your gun gonna fire, come fatter
Say it to the sky like a ball of fiyah
Jah come foot rule over ??
Gun gonna fire..
.. I'm a soldier

Alright.. time for the American, english aspect
From my man Rob Swinga - come now

Yo.. I wonder why is it that in Africa
The black people are the 2nd and 3rd class citizens?
I mean I thought Africa was black
Isn't that what they told us in our own history books
In America?  I mean yo it's something to think about!
They gonna tell me I'm black and I'm from Africa
Yet still somebody's tellin me
I have no right to say what goes on there
I mean I can't understand that at all!
That's something to really make you
Stop and think and say.. hmmmmmmm!",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-whats-the-word-lyrics
The Five Deadly Venoms,The One,1990,"Aiyyo ??, I got the batter, get the mixer
As the trickster will fix ya a batch of rhymes
You know that soothes, like an elixir
And sticks your ribs so let the cheese and wine
Or rather wine and cheese
Cause I aim to please with ease hope the crowd sees
That I'm, the man that loves to flam
And when I step into a jam I just slam like Jordan
And this is the world, accordin to me
The capital-H-the-O-the-T, the-D-the-O-the-G
Rockin, heavenly hype and ?? steadily
When I come in to rock'n'roll, I'm sure you will agree
That I got a hype type of style a family
But Diggy Doc gave it to Rob to rock and Howie Tee
Now, I'm talkin about Omega Psi Phi fraternity
Givin a little history
For some people, their lucky number's 7
For Q-Dogs, it's 1911
November 17th, underneath the ceilings
Behind the walls of Thirkield Hall

This is a family affair, rather a gathering of the brothers
United we stand, we're not divided like the others
And when I mention the word divided, you know what I'm meaning
Show a brother something they don't have they start fiending
First the ear-grabbin, then the back-stabbin
This from brothers that I call friends, I'm not havin
The other negative things in a friendship
An occasional whipser, gossip, a loose lip
I once trusted a brother with an eyeful
He told the next man, cause he's livin trifle
But now I'm not worried cause I'm part of a family
United til death simply cause we choose to be
An occasional joke, a diss, or a crowd pleaser
Callin your moms a ?? look-a-like skeezer
Whoever wins the diss battle, respect is given
Fightin over words is not how we are livin
Then there's ?? word I almost forgot
Three-on-one, no heat, but the rumor's still hot
The bro's get a ho that you know is totally widdit
There's no need to be discrete cause you know she won't admit it
When I think back on the memories
Just like these - is it a wonder that I love the 80's

Well I'm Rob, a.k.a. as the Swinga
Comedic at times, and a stone-cold thriller
I got somethin to say I'll make it short and sweet
Me I'm the Swinga I'ma swing it to this beat
Now I talk to a lot of people with the large vocabulary
Colloquial language I'll use that's secondary
And then there is slang and I would use that third
And I'll say outrageous things that might sound absurd
But - right back into my large vocabulary
I'm the type of guy that'll always be primary
Never secondary, to any adversary
If they want to be like me, on the contrary
They try to compete, but I will always delete
I'll leave them cryin from the agony, of defeat
And when they try to return to repeat
I make them hold on peace signs, say ""Swinga I retreat""

Well the Toad is immensely strong on the instrumental
The lyric can hit and shock the pure metal
Chubb Rock has a weak spot, creatin
An iron maiden cannot pierce my skin when I hit top 10
Run for shelter, cause you're gonna fear this tune
More than you feared the age of Helter Skelter
Watch how we behave, Diggity Dog and Dave
The Roadrunner and Swinga always sayin that smegma
Is the product of ten intense games of balls under balls
I have Professor Paul's
Kicking ability, the Snake's agility
The ricochet speed of the Centipede
And the devilish mind of the Scorpion
The Lizard is unrealistic and simplistic
And loitering is prohibit, the tune is illiterate
Diggy Doc no, Ed Lover forever my brothers in crime
They watch my back at the drop of a dime.. when we climb
And work and work hard and struggle to stay alive
And strive, the Venoms, the Five - check this out..

6 foot 3, 260 and change
Read ’em and weep, a little comedic and strange
Because we can have many friends, at least people that they call that
They use your brain but they're insane because I ignore that
No ego, cause I will be no, platinum big-headed rapper
That don't realize 
there's two directions on the ladder
You wanna go 'head, walk straight, walk good
Don't blame your sales on retails, thinkin that the store should
Think of reordering about five-hundred thousand
Just be glad of the success you had and you're arousin
Somebody's brain out there, your year's gonna come
You didn't live by the pipe or the gun to be like me
Waitin for my turn to burn
And get a 
million-five, and a

That be reapin up, and no keeping up with the Jonses
Long live P.E. and ban Guns'n'Roses

The Chubbster, a man that came out about 1986
With the help of Dr. Ice in the mix
And even then, kickin lyrics that was quite potent
Howie by my side, with his pesticide for the rodents
I'd flow - get on the mic and say, ""Yo one two""
Test and MC's start fessin
Jettin cause my weapon among the children was my gung-ho attitude
To use my tongue and lash and lick them up
Then pick them up then just fix them up then mix them up with
A knowledgeable man that went to college and astonished
Racist teachers with all the modern preachers
Crack beepers, yes knowledgeable creatures
But that didn't effect, The Chubbster
I'm from Brooklyn, so I have a little hustler
In my blood, when I kick the scam, they all will flock to it
Get my music and bop to it
Gassed my head but I was goin for my doctorate
Or my Ph.D in P-A-I-D, see
I got into the business to get paid not sprayed
With BS which is an acronym for a much larger word
And if preferred, I'll say it
But then again; 
radio won't play it
Cause they're cracking down on hip-hop
But it will not slow down or stop
Every year it creates a sellout tour
And this year has room for The Chubbster

Conceited I'm not, but convinced I am
Slam a jam that'll scare even the Son of Sam
In Sing-Sing he will sing simple songs to bring
Tears to your eyes, because you deny he's a king
Such as myself, cause myself is on his shelf
As for myself, I went for self cause myself needs financial
Health and wealth like ki's for G's
Cause cocaine ki's is for those that have morphine needs
Veins all ripped up, capillaries all stitched up
A grand a day, hey you slipped up
The Chubbster doesn't believe in the drug scene
Able to make me feel hip? I'd rather wear gabardines
My quarter fill will be my thrill
My Clyde's will collide with my grill, as for drugs that's nil
Not or no, cause Yo! MTV will never see me smokin rocks
McDonald’s and The Box will diss me
Cause drugs can't assist me or assist you
Blood on your tissue that's ill so chill
And when you come back you better come back even harder

The rest of the people involved, the problem isn't solved yet

The One,The One,1990,"Now here comes the one on the scene to redeem, a dream
Seen a couple of years ago when I was just a teen... ager
The need to come off at that particular time wasn't major
Now I have to wear a pager on my waist
Just in case I have to go someplace
Somewhere can't bear to be late, cause the race is on
For all with the ruffneck song
Even though they weren't born in the Carribean like me
And others that were all brothers there's a lot in the pot
Floridian Sibian to be Divvian
I waited for a few for mine, I knew the time was gonna come
You can bet I'ma collect the whole lump sum
Of the green, the revenue, the ducats, the monies
Is whatever you call it there's some complementary honies
I'm just the ultimate Don Juan nig-Jacabozi
Never fell, I can spell, F-E-L-L like Yahtzee
For each I'm gonna reach and teach with the speech
If you riff, 
I'ma flip like Nadia Comaneci
Win the gold; the bronze is for Hans and Franz
I'm not  on no dirty hoes, I know the pros and cons
Which will enable me to wear a cable
And collect large sums of funds
And here he - here comes the one

Now here comes the man - the man that had the plan
That in one year he will gain a million fans
Heh - and if you map it out he did
Accomplish and astonish, grabbin' the hearts of every kid
Yes I've created a realistic mirage in my garage
That one day Chubb'll be large
Not large in the sense that I'll be immense
But my financial status and my pockets'll be the fattest around
With a boomin' sound which bounds
To give Hitman Howie Tee a royal crown
On his head or his noggin I don't how be loggin'
Or the simple sounds you hear in your Walkman when joggin'
Or toboggan down the hill with a few minutes to kill
You flipped in the tape you just barely escaped
That tree in your way you just realized that hey
You have to be very careful of the tape that you play
If it's one of mine, you have to sit and relax
And max and prepare to hear funky tracks
And the lyrical storm cause when it rains it pours
Into retail stores, a little comedic and yours
But you know, deep in the gut, the nut
Was you-know-what, all over the cut
Yes we worked real hard to make it def and it was fun
And made it suitable to be ripped by the one

The one has the mentality of
An ignorant ruffneck, but then to get loved
Is in my heart even though externally I rarely show it
I'm not the guy you wanna go wit'
If there's beef, I'm the butcher that will go and settle it
I don't preach their rhetorhic
The One hates when you say he's number two
Or number eight on the countdown - my sound
Is unique, you sleep, you'll weap
You'll wreak of my words dangles in your cheeks
So spit em out now, read about thou - take our your camera
Take a flick of the man with the stamina
To get your girl Tabitha to have a crush on this
I don't use Nautilus - cause I don't pump no weights to get dates
The One is the only one
And I shall not have no other one but this one - word up!
Yo Howie, flick on the beat, show me where the rhyme at
And then the jam will kick like Timac
Howie takes a style when he's developing my track
So you'll have the feeling of the flavor to buy that
So your audible appendages will be numb
And say, ""Where did hip-hop get 'em from?""
Long live the ANC, Walter Sisulu
From South Africa, Mr. Mandela you're the real one",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-the-one-lyrics
Organizer,The One,1990,"""No one can do it better""

You see that black man over there, bring him here
You see the one with the blunt, put him in the front
Cause it's time to prepare, some kind of strategy this year
It's only been about ten million months
That we were lost in the sauce
But of course with the help of the boss
We prevail and now we're on this positive scale
But now it's time to take it one step further
Preferably without any obvious murders
If you don't ?? I don't give a shit
If you do it to a man of our shade
You definitely played, yourself and us
And then the heritage crust will be crushed to puss
Cause of your lust that you must just bust
A man of your own kind, you must be blind
Archie Bunker and Joey's gonna snuff ya from behind
One day - cause we easy prey to get
It's not a threat place a bet recollect the terms met
Many years ago that we're inferior
And inferior people shouldn't know they're really superior
And yo - it's time to listen, tick-tock, tick-tock
Comin from Chubb Rock so check the clock and organize!

Anytime you look at yourself
Be you black, brown, red or yellow
A so-called negro
You are you represent a person
Who poses, such a serious problem for America
Because you're not wanted
	""No one can do it better""

If the battle of the races was a basketball game, who'd reign?
Look for the blacks we have
Strickland Ewing Magic course Jordan is the don
Isiah Dominique Barkley and Akeem Olujawon
For the whites Bird ?? McHale and Paxon
Shouldn't go any further you know it's gonna get wack son
But if the black players have an ego, and won't let go
The rock no matter how nice they are they're gonna flop
Look chop - in a sold-out capacity crowd
The upsets will be so loud
Yes teamwork, yes y'all teamwork
If a jerk wants to go for self he gets hurt, and now
Dinkins is the man, so Magic form the plan
Yo Strickland run the point, Jordan is the guard and
Organize!

So we are all black people, so-called negroes
Second-class citizens; ex-slaves
You are nothin but a ex-slave
You don't like to be told that - but what else are you?
You are ex-slaves you didn't come here on the Mayflower!

I shall not have no other one but this one
That is description now here's the full picture
Frame it, aim it, name it proclaim it
To be a Chubb Rock original.. ain't it, funny
That four years ago I wasn't making an inkling of money
Had to put four chicken wings on layaway
And had to come back the next day for the fried rice
The price you could let me chill with a quarter
But I oughta just order, a lettuce sandwich
With a large water, drink it down
Until I can make up a Chubb Rock sound
That will end all this, then I take the risk
And if I fail I won't do a fishtail, in the abyss
That's a diss, I'm strivin not Drivin, Miss Daisy
And Patrick Swayze don't amaze me or faze me
Me look up to these stupid clowns - you're crazy!
My mama raised me on Mama Mabley
Dorothy Dandridge crossed an ill bridge
The media got involved into her shit
Gashed her grill and boggled up her wit
Took her name like a crook
And how long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Here's the hook - open your eyes
And organize

And we unite - on the basis of what we have in common
And what we have foremost in common is that enemy;
The white man; he's an enemy to all of us
I know some of you all think that some of them AREN'T enemies!",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-organizer-lyrics
Bring ’Em Home Safely,The One,1990,"""We left the people of Israel with, one thought..
That they are not alone -- The people of New York

Indeed decent freedom loving people
Everywhere stand at their side in this hour of need.""

Cries of wait please wait wiggity wait but Kuwait won't wait
Desert Shield a field full of confused hate
Soldiers fight because they're loyal, while tempers boil
On U.S. soil, they're screamin no blood for oil
Groups of recruits get fitted for troop boots
While business suits shoot hoops eatin Fruit Loops
Yo I don't understand the government plan
Goin on holy land, killin a family man, and
Tearing loved ones asunder
When things were really sunny, strictly for the money
The money.. yo money
You might reinstate the draft and I'm gettin bummy
So I clear my head by goin testin testin one two testin
And countin my blessings
And pray for the brotherman with an M-60 in his hand
Eatin spam
So one more time, testin one two, and ya don't stop
That's why we got this war Hobbes
Yo I only got one thing to say chief
Let's bring 'em home safely
""The State Department's ?? wants to mediate
The Iranian president wants to meet with Iraq
And then maybe the U.S
A Middle East expert here in New York has an explanation""

Deep in the Middle East, in the belly of the beast
We got men and women losin blood for black grease
Oil - how could such a thing spoil
A whole nation and turn it up into a turmoil
Stealths wipin out every man's health
Bombers got sisters brothers daddies and lonely mommas
Cryin, ""Oh my son, oh Lord help my daughter
Calm the ragin seas, please fill the waters""
Readin letters under candle, delivered by camel
Layin in a dug-out channel's kinda hard to handle
So I say a little prayer to my maker in this blood filled place
Please bring 'em home safe
""Baghdad radio is calling for terrorist actions
Against the nations fighting Iraq in the Persian Gulf
And the allies are concerned that cryptic messages
Broadcast this morning could be a signal to terrorists.""

President Bush will bring us out of this recession
We'll all have jobs when American numbers are lessened
Blessings are said, so no one will get hurt
Yo - I need a Shield, but it's not for the Desert
It's a shield for the ills that builds
With this rampant nationalization; we're not dealin in humanism
P.O.W.'s, M.I.A.'s unknown soldiers in unknown graves
Let's bring 'em home safe
""The F.B.I. continues to look for those responsible
For placing six pipe bombs on, chemical tanks
In the Norfolk, Virginia - or near the Norfolk, Virginia naval base
The bombs were safely..""

Well hostility jumps on the scene in ninety-one
No fun, large sons shooting machine guns
Population adjustment will be adjusted by an intellgent villain
Guerilla warfare killing
Amplifies, fear tears blood embedded in mud
Daddy falls to the accuracy intricate of a SCUD
Black gold soul, patriots told nothing but lies
Atmosphere develop permanent red eyes
Destruction a product to develop and enhance
Presidential fees, blood from overseas
Spilled, uphill, peace of mind
I'm, waiting for, waiting for the time
Inner soul craves, for guidance
For safety for the brave, P.O.W. slaves
Will be used as shields to pierce and drill
To drip tears, when a declared won't mingle
With the Man Upstairs, funerals for fear
Confusion, nervous hands from a scared wife knittin
Siblings infants weepin, continous tear drippin
Impaled men please God let them cease
Come home, Red Hot Lover Tone, Rockin Robin
MC Serch, and for the last the verse
Let us rehearse, excluse men in the hearse
Everybody what's the verse?  Peace

Damage and loss of life would have been tremendous

Bring 'em home and preserve those family roots, peace!

The Big Man,The One,1990,"The bigger of the biggest made a hitlist
Not a lot of people, but a sequel, so witness
The evolution of a seed planted four years ago
And now the offspring today is the new thing
The people wanna jock but if they won't here's a quote:
Jealousy has arisen but don't - sweat it
And in this particular case - don't let it
Hold you back from pledging allegiance to this
And your girl wants a kiss but I have my own miss
On my side til the skeezer in me died
Like the (?) to the John, the Crosby to the Bing
The Dave is to the Benny and the Big Man is ready
To take a stand for all big man-kind
And I'm gonna succeed with the rhyme
So potent that a consultant said that rappin rodents
Have two-thirds of my intelligence quotient and knowin
Just that, secures me from all the muskrats
And my degree tells me I don't must rap
But the fans of hundreds of grands know I slam
Love the jams of the Big Man - chorus!
	""A big man!"" (repeat 4X)
{Uhh his lyrics are.. so extrordinary..}

The Big Man on the Campus want people to chant this
And I mean this; if I have to I will get fiendish
And you will be the main course of a mean dish:
Scrub - Sucker a la Chubb
The plate will be a test or your test of fate
To see if you have any kind of heart, you fart
I'm a soloist and knowin this you better grow an extra fist
I'm not Razor Ruddock but you'll land on your buttock
Back up move, you're dealin with a rudebwoy
Raggamuffin with a funky somp'in
Listen - Chubb is the one on a respect mission
Ignorin all that BS you're dishin
Out cause the man with the clout came forth
To show who's the boss lyrical force
(?) monarch to spark the plan
For the Chubb's the Big Man - chorus!
	""A big man!"" (repeat 4X)
{Well I don't think that.. my lyrics are..
That extrordinary but uhh..
I do think that me and Howie do have a..
Diverse style of music..}

The Bigger Man used to be a trigger man
Bang was the slang for the one man gang
But now with a plan with a few called The A.T.E.E.M
Diggidy and the Swinga will paint the whole scene
Paint the background first, that means we rehearse
Exercise cardiovascular - and then the thirst
Will be quenched - the throats will be drenched
With the finest wines when we dine
Cause 1989 was an okay year
I mean I lived through it - in 1990 I'm gonna do it
Climb the mountain of the hits
Put a #1 joint at the tip if it fits
And if it is a size too small, yes y'all
A new creation for the nation cause I'm here for the duration
Like the pilgrim village when they claimed this land
Gave birth to the Big Man - chorus!
{Chubb Rock is definitely coming out
With a different style this year.. he's..}

Keep it Street,The One,1990,"Yo, keep in the street let the groove stay rough
Rougher than rough, ignorance is enough
On the media tip, so that the read must grip
On reality, don't let 'em gas up your mentality
This style started from the essence
Not the magazine, Maybeline Cold Cream Afro-Sheen tip
Comin deep into the soul cause I mean it
Disciples of pop want to redeem it - nope
I don't know why, why is that
Why must I, chase the cat?
Nothin but the dog, in me
Continue you just gonna, fall in the
Midst of a hip-hop blitz with a trip
Back to the batter to the Gladys of the Pi-dup
Watch me ri-dup, all
Type of TV screens movie type scenes
Just like blues, hip-hop paid dues
Dues can be recouped if you act souped
Makin pop beats, so keep it street

Block party, nineteen-eighty-one
People havin fun, no one with a gun
No ducats, you pay nothin at the gate
You escape to the sounds of a Cold Crush tape
In your back pocket, rap is always clocked then
Jump on the Realistic mic then rock it
No clock don't stop until mother nature says
No conflict between usual knuckleheads
That didn't affect the morale of the crowd
Just those kids pumped the set up loud
Nowadays, our appearance is a big part of it
Everybody wants a Mr. T starter kit
Hip-Hop has always been you have a beef
With another man step to him, and throw ya hands
Come back and dance to the rhythm
Of a James Brown beat - and keep it street
	""Children grow and women produce
	 and men go work and some go steal it!""
	""Children.. children grow and..
	 children..""

In nineteen-ninety you will get another treat
That's harder than concrete, unique don't compete
Lyrical format uses your rep as a doormat
You shoulda come sooner if you wanted to kick a rumor
Never try to jest unless you like your flesh
All scarred, ripped and done hard
Cause kid you don't realize, that in my part of town
You'll get killed if you wanna act a clown
Grab your heart, play your part and pledge allegiance
School's in, so let's begin, your first readings
Open your book, here's a number two pencil
Feel the vibe of a Chubb instrumental
No pop tunes only rough street beats
You can sample butt-snagger Mick Jagger
I'll stay with my crates and make dope beats
And I'll keep it, definitely keep it street

I want you, Cat
I want you, Cat
I want you

You're so soft and delicate, may I get, funky
(Funky!)  I'm not a sex junkie
I would like to get high upon your love
You're so silky smooth, just like a dove
It might sound odd
I gave birth the second time around at the promenade
Deck, kissed your neck
You gave me more than a peck, but wait a sec
Am I goin too fast, should I just chill
And cool things down, until
I know whassup and I know how you really feel
Cause I got no time for a brain game
But you play one anyway for about a half a year
Tears felt, love went tilt
I said, ""What should I do, what should I do, should I step
Like stairs, cause I care?""
And I want you, Cat
I want you, Cat (2X)
I want you..
I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you..

Love understanding, plus demanding
Honesty between us two, will make us last for a few
Word up, then you will just.. mmmmmmmm..
Trust me, and maybe never try to bust me
With another squaw, not even in my car
I walk down the street while I kick a 12-bar
Rap on the Harlequin tip, chapter 5
Upon my knees, I tell you do I care
Maybe this year, maybe this year
Maybe a little Chubb Rock will be formed upon the scene
His life won't be based upon the dreams
That I might make, when I create a fat rap
Jumpin upon the scene like that
I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you.. (dun-da-duh-da, dun-da-duh-dah)
I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you.. (dun-da-duh-da, dun-da-duh-dah)

Do what you want like Humpty.. does..

Fat Boys, Redhead Kingpin, Cool C
And my man Kurtis Blow, yo..

The battlefield, the synonym - call it the wax
The recording sciences developing the tracks
Is not the essential fabric but if you have it
Might make you a household name and let you gain
A million fans, coliseums all out sold out
And when they call out your name you pull out fake clout
Cause you're sauerkraut, you're not really about
Nothin... you're bluffin
But I'm callin your bluff to see if you're really tough
Show me your stuff... enough!
Shut up, close your mouth, put away your tap shoes
Your feet can't say a rhyme this time, you lose
But I respect you for what you accomplished, a great deal
Just admit you can't handle the steel
Gregory Hines can't take mines
The Winans can't start rhymin
And you're just like them, you had a top ten
You have a rap feel, but you can't wield the steel
It takes many many moons, to create tunes
But loons assume that half past noon
They'll have rap down pat, but it's wack
You must be on crack, you're buggin cause your head is at
A place where reality doesn't seep in
Practice makes perfect then you might reap in
The benefits of this respectable field
And all respect due to the regiments of the steel
Assemble!
Word, this is goin out to some hip-hop greats, yaknowhatI'msayin
Rakim and.. Chuck D

The obese boulder, will shrug your shoulder
If you say you're a regiment and you can't hold the
Steel with some kind of appeal
Not dealin with sex, or a bicep flex
Has nothing to do with physical appearance
But the way you stimulate the kids and their parents
Will fulfill the applications to be inducted
Into the regiments, respect to the veterans
And the pioneers, with dying tears
To see rap has survived after 15 years
And ready to go 15 more
Three-fourths of every store has only rap on their racks
Rap force goin strong, on and on
Take a few seconds, to say peace to Sarah Vaughn
Now back to the steel that will wield a golden reel
And when you kick it to a James Brown feel
Field was made twenty years ago
And not a penny-oh was saved cause the way he behaved
Was kinda ill, the regiments to his skill
Was extrordinary.. until
He took a fall, the regiments will keep his style
Flowin for a long while
The regiments made this artform universal
Whether it's a street sound, or commercial
Obstructors, are just realizing, that this is real
Respect to the regiments of the steel
Assemble!
More hip-hop greats, youknowhatI'msayin?
Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, Kool G. Rap, Super Lover Cee
Biz Markie, Heavy D, Lady Kazaam, Special Ed
Slick Rick, Lakim Shabazz, Queen Latifah

Sugarhill, that sold about eight mill'
When ""Rappers Delight"" caused media fright
How could a bunch of kids possibly sell more than me
And Randy Travis kickin all that country madness?
Failing star, failing guitar or a banjo
Your whole artform needs to retire in Orlando
Rap has developed in the motherland by storytellers of wisdom
No wonder we're best-sellers
The art was passed on from generation to generation
Developed in the mind cause the rhyme
The track is just a cosmetic background
Cause we all need some kind of sound..
To complete the whole feel
And it's wield by the regiments of the steel

The Night Scene,The One,1990,"The night time is an ill time cause 'nough crime
Happens that never gets aired on the prime
TV stations, public relations
Gives the okay for what gets aired in the nation
You got the whole world lookin at ""I Love Lucy""
Talented bitches on the corner sellin pussy
A variety'll give your friend for a 10-spot
Christians doin rimshots!
Do more heads than barbershops will
Open their legs to the public for a meal
Damn it's a shame, the shit looks unreal
College graduates sometime kneel
Check out the crack scene over there
Those two motherfuckers gonna make about a million this year
Sell to their friends for a Benz
Kill their race for a taste
For what they call or see as being the good life
Gold nuggets, lots of ducats
Beeper number 1-800-Asshole
Sellin' stone so we can see your bones
Cause most crackheads don't have fat legs
Skull all soft, it can crack like eggs
You fiend for the flavor, steal for the hit
Grandma's walkin home, so you bust her shit
Send her to the hospital for twenty bucks
Beam for a half an hour that's fucked
At eleven your high, for a few stay low
Ten minutes later, you need some blow
So you'll eventually croak maybe by a stroke
You don't want the good life no you want coke
Now come the robbers, they just steal
They move like cats some on crack
They'll vic anything up to Jeeps
These motherfuckers play for keeps
They'll do anything that's on their mind
They come nine deep, plus pack nines
They don't care won't shed no tears
Don't try to appeal for pity cause it's silly
They wear Polo coats, baseball caps
The elderly is the main course and the snack
These young kids that leave their cribs
Hang on the streets, then these squids
Slide up on the scene with a certain lean
And then slide out but they're countin' your green
And now you're vexed and you want to redeem
But it's a different world with different rules
The night scene
Yo baby check this out
Times is gettin' kinda hard, youknowhatI'msayin?
Yo bitch, you gonna have to get me some serious money
Out this motherfucker, youknowhatI'msayin?
You better go out there and
Find some friends for five dollars or some shit
Cause y'know, if I don't get my money
You know what's gonna happen right?
Somebody gonna get hurt out this motherfucker
You know that, you know that
The night time is a different time to flow
You gotta know the rules or they'll let you know
Your heart can't take the pressure, of the scene
Peripheral vision and decisions must be keen
'Cause this is a place that's far from clean
Apocalypse Now, but later on you say it's a dream
But it's not a dream, it's reality
Stand on the corner and you're a goner
Go home and chill under your mom's wing
I will sing, hopefully bring
A new alternative to make some green
But stay home, not the night scene, come on!
What?  Yo where the motherfuckin money at huh?
Nah I don't wanna hear nothin' about no
College and tuition shit
I just want my motherfuckin money now bitch!

But I'm convinced, that I can make a funky jam
So if you wanna, support the man that's gonna
Jump up on the scene deliver lyrics that are sorta mean
With the cream of the crop, Chubb Rock will never stop
Showin his intelligence quotient, things are potent
Prime time rhymes that's floatin blowin and knowin
That it's goin to be considered the topic I've hithered
Feelings between the music scene
While I move to the groove like Akeem.. Olujawon
The don upon the team that plays real calm, ego all gone
Chubb doesn't like to be hyper
I wait for my prey and then I react like a tiger
Clip up, pick up, rip them all up and
And then I heard my history callin
Readin readin, Chubb never had a clue
And this is not what I was taught in school and
Decoyed, made every grade was a ploy
That mislead the head of the Bad Boy - Robin!

Last summer, my tune went to number
Two on the countdown, I had a frown
On my grill cause I knew that until I went
To number one I couldn't consider myself The One
But The One came back with a hardcore devilish rap
Fully strapped, definitely aimed at
Things that made me, no one can pay me
Enough to sell out, call a bluff and huff
And blow the house down that I built
And meeting old homeboys like Giz and Milk
Definitely happy - Howie Tee kept me
On the level of a star so the squads can sweat me
Cause Chubb Rock always seem to rock the place
Peace to the homeboys Amityville and Mase
On the Anita Baker tip I'm gonna bring ya joy
The overjoy of the Bad Boy - Robin!

Tell him!  Excuse me, I beg your pardon
Inform him, that Chubb is playin in your secret garden
Cause he didn't cut - the lawn, correctly
I have a green thumb, you're not dumb, that's why you sweat me
You wanna have your cake and eat it too, so do I
You're sneaking around, we're sneaking around, so why
Do you wanna continue, comin to every venue
You don't tell him, I'll offend you
This ain't right so put him down on the scoop
That you're a blow-up sex doll for every group
Where are the footsteps that you followed
Tippy-toed to my crib and did me a solid
You answered every question I ever had
On the female anatomy - after you sat on me
Cheating is more serious than the Taking of Pelham
So tell him, before I tell him
If Mary had told her boyfriend
Like she was supposed to, none of this would be happening

Tell him!  His feelings, you disregard
You took his credit card, went on the boulevard
You bought me shirt after shirt with his hard-earned work
You treat him like dirt
My conscience said to me, ""Yo Chubbs you better be
Careful, she gave you the keys to his Cherokee
Jeep - but I don't wanna go six feet deep
In the dirt for some skirt""
I was gonna cut her off but the stuff was kinda dope
The dope even paid my car note, nope
I'm gonna let her go yet until I get
This girl can really get me out of financial debt, huh
So I chill, passion kills, tears spilled
On an innocent grill then overspilled
The guilt, stuck in my chest so I suggest
That you tell him, maybe you can start off fresh
Cheating is more serious than the taking of pellum(?)
So tell him, before I tell him
If Mary had told her boyfriend
Like she was supposed to, none of this would be happening

Here's one more bang for the road - uhh
Never again will you explode
Like this you might miss the imprint of my fist
Embedded in the bed by your head
""Don't leave me Chubb, don't leave me Chubb,"" she screamed
""I got access to all of his green
I lust for your pelvic thrust so why don't you trust
Don't fuss, he'll never find out about us""
But baby, I can't see you no more and..
{*knocking*} .. let me see who's at the door
{*door creaks*}
Yo who are you?
Who me?  You don't know man?
Why I'm gonna shoot ya
{*machine gun fire*}
If Chubbs had kept his prick in his pants
Like he was supposed to, none of this would have happened",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-another-statistic-lyrics
Enjoy Ya Self,The One,1990,"Enjoy ya self cause life is too short
Everybody dismantle your shotty
Your nine millimeter needs to take a long breather
For the white black jewish koreans need to
Grab a neighborhood skirt, go to a concert
Scream for Chubb while I rip up the club
The rhythm of the vibe was alive and you felt it
Your girl is provacative, you take her home and pelt it
And after the pelt, she feels like a cheddar melt
Just play it cool, and just..
Chorus: {sung}
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself, and just enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself, and just enjoy yourself

Chubb is not a party animal
But when it comes to a jam, I have the plan like Hannibal
Smith - I don't take a draw from no spliff
The scene of the beam doesn't redeem and if
I wanna get high, I just fly
Walk up to a cutie, and say, ""Hi..
When I wake up tomorrow, are you gonna be next to me?""
She's confused, but she sweats me
I wear my galoshes so I can protect myself
Carry yours G, if you just wanna..
Chorus

People used to say that I was a fuddy-duddy
Only used to care about how to make money
Up from the Hamptons to Flushing Meadows
Decorated by an Art Deco
My nickname was ""The One""
Now ""The One"" was the only one who didn't have fun
But no more, goin buckwild on the tour
Keepin people in stitches on the floor
Clark Kent and Tracie thought I was spacy
The funniest in the nation laughed for the duration
Don't play yourself cause yourself needs a good self
And just, {enjoy your..}
Chorus
{singers}
Enjoy yourself
.. and just enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
.. and just enjoy yourself
Chorus (1/2 to fade)",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-enjoy-ya-self-lyrics
Rich Get Rich,The Time Has Come!,UnKnown,"Raptivism, yaknahmsayin?
Yo this live and direct, LIVE and direct
No More Prisons, yaknahmsayin?
Don't need no more baby
No more..
See we can walk through the streets, politic all night
Start to make our own tracks, for these cats to recite
Recite, rip through your jugular vein, right out your throat
Make these cats wanna provoke, I'm holdin it down with my folks
Cause we walk about it, with Helamic and Knowledge
Shinin bright like a diamond, sittin in BK rhymin
Holdin it down, waitin for the sun to set now
Look in the sky, see my man B.I.G. floatin around
One day we shine so bright, livin life so right
Lost my man tonight, settin it off, aight?
Check it like this, you got to go with the flow
Some people may not understand, but you know how it go
Because life ain't shit, you got to work for yours
Got to hustle from the bottom just to feed the poor
Niggas think shit is funny, got to work for yours
See the rich get, rich, the poor get poor
Jump up and grab the nina son you gotta get yours
Life ain't shit, got to work for yours

The elements of life, got a nigga scared to death
I'm up to my neck, and I can't, hold my breath
Who woulda ever thought, at 22, goin through this
My young thugs bust guns, it's kinda foolish
My young ladies sell sex, it's kinda clueless
Let's get through this, illuminati's tryin to screw us
Blood for blood, ash for ash, life is bigger
The poorer man poor, while the rich gets richer

A lot of niggas think that pro-black, is so wack
Like the old school I'm a throwback, you know that
We plantin seeds that don't grow back, while the black
Still shinin like Kojak
You ain't never gave a shit, yo we OWNED that
Monopolize the whole game and control that
A lot of cats get scared so they hold back
Thinkin that they won't get paper sayin pro-black
But they think they get rich screamin blow gats
Bubble cracks on hot produced tracks and still dispute facts
I ain't tryin to hear another nigga schoolin me
Bout my paper my car or my jewelry
And who is he?  The one that tell you not to spend it foolishly
Cause this whole black movement, is movin me
Keep your head above water, or drown below
On the dee-low, not cool to have a P.O
You shootin craps, not cee-lo
Small time hustlers, who never reach the kilo
You know the steelo

From the committee of 300, niggas can't get blunted
The JFK niggas, UHH, died in cellblock niggas
From the crack lackeys, hold your asshole and cock backey
Warm green eggs in pens sweatin like pigs
Niggas get clockwork for five to ten blockwork
Then cry for balance, then toss the salads
Of the long wrong life, beaten knife, wound cabbage
Green veil niggas at night, for bail adage
Tim Allen bend, went to the pen, for twelve pounds of M
Home Improvement now rules the zen
Charles Dutton locked for eight moons for nuttin nuttin
Came back tougher than Martin Martin for fuckin
The Guiliani's, Armani's, who laundry
The ducats from the Mexicans sweatin niggz from Rahway
How the fuck can street crack rule the NASDAQ?
That's like a rap nigga getting a check from ASCAP --
-- can't happen, after Attica rule the Richter
The poor went raw and the rich got richer

Because life ain't shit, you got to work for yours
Got to hustle from the bottom just to feed the poor
Niggas think shit is funny, got to work for yours
See the rich get, rich, the poor get poor
Jump up and grab the nina son you gotta get yours
Life ain't shit, got to work for yours

Uhh! Uhh, uhh, nineteen ninety-nine
Huh huhh, with my rhyme
And low line, page ? means pace
Raptivism, means peace and peace PEACE *INHALES*
Bass Records, peace peace and p-peace
Rob Swinga, peace peace and always peace
D-Rock, peace peace and one time peace
Freeze Love, peace peace and peace peace
Cocksachie, Greenvale, Greenwald
Attica, one more time, hold on
Rahway, come back cell block H
And everybody in Riker's, one love
One love..",https://genius.com/Chubb-rock-rich-get-rich-lyrics
