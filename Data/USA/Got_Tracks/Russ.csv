Losin Control,There’s Really a Wolf,2015.0,"She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh",https://genius.com/Russ-losin-control-lyrics
What They Want,There’s Really a Wolf,2015.0,"Yeah (Ooh)
Yeah (Oh)
They let us in the rap game (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I swear they let me in this motherfucking rap game (Mmm, yeah, yeah)

Got a chick, I call her Lola, she feel like the ocean
Like to drink and smoke some doja and I feel like smoking
Plus she good at charming cobras, I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia, she be acting boujee
Then she came through and topped me off, now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the Mafia, her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones, no, no

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I been at this shit for nine years, now they start to call
I'm a DIY pioneer, they trying to get involved
Yippee ki-yay, ahh yeah, 'bout to set it off
I'm probably the only one, yeah
Come correct when you approach me, I can size you up
Taking all the shots like Kobe, almost 81
Guess I got to play the goalie and go and save me some
I'm probably the only one, yeah

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Who wants my money? I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Who's pulling strings? I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck, they be talking like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me, dollars, lot of stock in me
It ain't nothing personal, it's business and I'm a commodity
But honestly, Pop Pop would be turning in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss in me, I'll be damned

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know its what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't foolin' me at all",https://genius.com/Russ-what-they-want-lyrics
Goodbye,Pink Elephant,2014.0,"Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
Bitch, you're a black hole, sucking me in your vacuum
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?
(Why you acting like a peasant?)
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye
(Fucked it all up! Stupid!)
Goodbye!

Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it 
and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying

You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye (Know you fucked this up!), bye
(And I'ma call you from the Grammies, too!)
Goodbye! (Hopefully you pick up, so I can tell you again)
Goodbye-bye-bye!",https://genius.com/Russ-goodbye-lyrics

She got me going down, down, down

I don't know you, like

Just to reiterate the commitment I have to explore
Like would you ride it like a horse, like my last name is Lauren
I'm more than interested
Baby, I'm infatuated
You been held back
I'll get you to graduation
Help you with your cash
Steer you clear of tax evasion
Death grips on your ass
I call that assassination
I'm getting carried away
Let's get married today
Fuck
Here I go again like Whitesnake back in the day
I'm crazy and you're crazy too
But I love that shit
You're bad and you're broken too
But I love that shit
Just be open to the possibility of me and you
That's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash, now I want you

Ain’t Nobody Takin My Baby,UnKnown,2016.0,"I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back
I stay put I want you, I don't care I want you

I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane Cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here

Pull the Trigger,There’s Really a Wolf,2015.0,"[Intro: Russ & 
Francesca Frame
]
Yeah, eh, ah, nothing
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger
Maybe, you should pull the fuckin' trigger

Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

Yeah, why you believin' the propaganda?
Why everybody sound like they wanna be from Atlanta?
Are you the voice or the echo?
Are you the nail or the hammer?
I be talkin' while chewin' my beats, I don't mind my manners
Choruses that fit the opera, that's why I need phantoms
I got my doubt at gun point, that's why I need ransoms
And I be handsome, that's why I got your girl before the money
Honestly, I thought I'd have 30m's before my twenties
But I'm cool with how it's happenin'
Girl in San Fran. who wants to cross routes with me
Like a young Colin Kaepernick
Treat the money like a lateral, I'm passin' it
'Cause my family's number one, never put 'em number two
Tryna buy a house in cash for all the times we had to move
All the times my mom cried 'cause she ain't know what else to do
All the times she lost hope 'cause she ain't know what else to lose
All the times I shoot shots 'cause I don't know what else to shoot, man

Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

I'ma stay winnin', I don't believe in luck
I believe that life's a buffet, better eat it up
I've seen enough to know that I'm really 'bout to blow
Never felt like an employee, always felt like CEO
Even when I stacked shoes, I was never clocked in
Yeah, I always walked out, but I never walked in
That's a tribute to my head-space
And lately my Devils have been Spanish chicks in red lace
Doing Brujeria on me for ten days
More like ten months, but I got out of it
If I fall in love again, it's probably with a Saudi chick
But I keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher, yo

Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot",https://genius.com/Russ-pull-the-trigger-lyrics

Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92, with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we, have memories, and we also got this song (yeah)

Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know it's been a while but I'm still me
But honestly it's been so long that I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
There's a gap now, big enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moves so fast now, damn
I miss things going slower, I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life, I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to improve my appreciation, I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded, for real

Can't forget about the beats too, I'm the best kept secret
Real shit or fake shit, pledge your allegiance
I was off for so long, now I'm on though

Thank you to anyone who ever slammed the door on me

Seven figures when they tax me, that's a blessin'
Diss me, I'ma diss you back on a hit song
PDs love me worldwide, you'll get shit on
Get it on your own or I can't respect it
See me in person, don't call, don't text it
Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it
Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it (yeah)
Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be
No rap name to hide behind, this the real me
Before the plaques, I was certified
I do business, I keep my income diversified
I counted 35 thousand with my family last night
And another 35 before this verse
I be layin' wide awake up in my thoughts at night like
""Goddamn, motherfucker, this worked""

Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back

Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her, she's a freak
I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace

Way before the Rollie, you was just my homie

Teaching you the language of the universe Rosetta who?
Put you on a pedestal
All eyes on me but you loved me when I had seven views
You lookin' like I should go half on a baby with you
And if I'm wrong, I won't debate it with you
I'll own up to it, you voluptuous
They not down for the curves but I'm up to it
Come gimme all that
You the only girl I'll call back
I tell these other women fall back
They be hating on the preview
They think that it's only for the entertainment

You were cheating every chance you got while I was faithful
Then you went with who you, told me not to worry 'bout

Yeah, I take another shot
Tryna just forget all the negative
Devil laughin', meanwhile God explaining the benefits
Listen financial freedom
Come and go as you please
Arenas packed out
Plus a bunch of hoes on their knees
You got your mom a house
Yeah, I know it seems bittersweet
Because your parents separated
You thought money sewed seams
Now you think it's your fault
You enabled the breakup
But that’s the power of money
Now you just funding the makeup
With the same tool that brought it down
Tell the waiter I don't want no ice
I just want tequila
I don't want it watered down
Everything I bought for y'all
I figured that I bought a crown
I figured that y'all know that you can get it since I got it now
I saw this goin' differently
I be lookin' at the seven year old me like don't come visit me
The public took the fun away
You’ve been robbed of all of your innocence
I’m talkin' to myself, I hope I’m listening, damn

Mask up my pain, hold back my tears
I'm going insane; nobody knows
All by myself, let the rain hit me
I'm going insane; nobody knows

Juggling the inside and outside heavy
I might call a ex-chick and drink some Henny
Starting out my day with some shit already
Answering the phone like I'm pissed already
Media is lyin’, gettin' used to it
Crucifying me, I need a crucifix
Guess I look the part, so I might as well
Heaven's where you get when you fight through Hell
People keep slandering, but I can't respond
Because if I do, y'all call me crazy, sayin' my focus is wrong
I'm feelin' fed up, yeah
This isn't natural, no
Keep it together, let it fall apart in music
I can't let them see the pain
When I'm the one that gets them through it
This some real life shit, no

Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
Go where my body got candy

I'm a cavity to your cavalry of love
Got you spell bound
So sweet, for one of hell's hounds
So sugar coat me in your energy
Sugar coat me in your energy

Whenever,UnKnown,2016.0,"Yeah
Aye uh...
Everybody means somethin' to someone
So yeah

Running the city wild
I think you're in denial
You drinking just by yourself
You thinking just 'bout yourself

Okay I'm pouring out a bottle for two of my ex's
Like Dos Equis
I tell the girl I'm talking to right now
Don't tempt me
Cause you're really looking like my next breakup song
She don't sleep on me, I'm the one she stay up on
But why is every first date like an interview
Why I gotta' take you out just to prove I'm into you
Why I gotta' trust you just to find out if I care
Shit, why I gotta' fuck you just to find out if I care
Yo listen

Since forever ain't forever
Lets just kick it 'til whenever
I can't promise that I'll love you
But at least we'll be together
Oh-oohh-oh

Running the city wild
I think you're in denial

Yeah, I'd rather slap you with the truth
Than kiss you with a lie
You're so busy making a living
That you forget to make a life
You should come through
Let me plant diamonds in your head
She said ""I'm tired of always sleeping diagonal in my bed
I'm tired of always leaving in an uber
I'm tired of losing lovers and loving all these losers""
I say ""You bring it all on yourself
Then we smoke, then we drink
I tell her ""Go think it over, but don't ever over think""

Since forever ain't forever
Lets just kick it 'til whenever
I can't promise that I'll love you

Psycho,Pink Elephant,2014.0,"I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know

This bitch got me feeling psycho
Living on a tight rope
Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole
Guess I never had to go
Oh, so my love ain't enough

Yeah, you should've kept the love that I gave you
You passed on a top notch ride for a motha' fuckin' Prelude
I came through, tryna' save you but I can't do what God can't
So I bargained with the Devil
Tryna' argue my point
We in room 420
And you rolling up joints
Still at the dirty hotel
You still call it to trap
And you climbed on top
I still got you back to back
In the back of my Nissan
Fuck that dude who ran up tryna' be on you
Got you in my car with my beats on move
To the back seat, let me change your mood
Too many questions, what, where, when, who

This bitch got me feeling psycho

Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole

Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole
Guess I never had to go
Oh, so my love ain't enough

Yeah, everybody that was close to me
They could feel the distance
I fell in love with a girl
Cause she filled what was missing
And I tried to fill you up
I tried to fill you up
Tried to fill you up
You're so empty
But your potential tempt me
To dive in to your ocean, let me swim
Just don't let me drown (drown)
Just don't let me drown, drown, drown

Exposed,UnKnown,2016.0,"Yeah, I feel like I'm the only one
Feel like I'm the only one

Y'all gon have to do better
I can't believe what I'm seeing
All this bullshit going on
The industry is deceiving
All the masses
Pitching rappers as these independent grinds
Meanwhile there's been a label right behind them the whole time
Fake shit call it out
You were plugged before your first song
I was puttin in work
You were getting worked on
Yo fans are fickle
Cuz your come up is a mystery
My fans gon stick with me
Cuz me and them got history
Longer than 2 songs
You don't know how to build
You tried to start at the roof ah
You won't be here for too long
I don't fuck with crews unless you're the one who put the crew on
The rest of y'all got buzz because he put you on a few songs
Ooo umm did that strike a nerve
If the shoe fits then wear it
Either way I know the truth imma share it
See these rappers sign deals
Labels know what they're doing
They tell the rapper don't announce it
So the people keep rooting

Try to keep me on the hush but i do not give a fuck
This is Russ uncut ill expose you
You ain't really seen shit just wait till im on
Then its on gotta lot i gotta show you
Why you gotta lie
I'll bring it to the light
Gotta expose fake shit
I put in too much time

I'm comin thru exposing fake shit
God can't save you
Youre a boss?
You gotta boss
And that boss rapes you
Barely pays you
But you cool with it
You're a soldier unaware that you're a lieutenant
I gotta gripe with the media
All of y'all are wanna be's
Producers and rappers
Down for sodomy
Dick taking
Cuz the industry tells you to
It's fucked up I had a standard that I held you to
I'll name names if you provoke me
So shut your fucking mouth
My platform is way bigger
Than the ones that turned me down
Bunch of grown men and women
Talkin bout grown men and women for a livin
Man you gotta be kidding
Call me bitter
Call me jealous
Call me this
Call me that
This is 10 years grinding what the fuck you call that
Made the beats wrote the songs sang the hooks
And I mixed it
Everybody's gotta switch and y'all just flipped it

Try to keep me on the hush but i do not give a fuck
This is Russ uncut ill expose you
You ain't really seen shit just wait till im on
Then its on gotta lot i gotta show you
Why you gotta lie
I'll bring it to the light
Gotta expose fake shit
I put in too much time

You're an industry artist
I'm an artist in the industry
Me myself and I that's the holy fucking trinity
I partnered with Columbia
Partnered is the key word
We split the profits 50/50
Better do your research
Came in with my own fanbase
Sold out tours around the world before the handshakes
You see I play the game well
You let the game play you
You don't know your own power
You think the label saved you
Now subconsciously you owe them
You're submissive with your actions
Then you flop flop flop
And you wonder what happened
Couple things
You dropped one song and signed a deal
You have less than 10 songs out
You're not real
So the song became bigger than the artist
People know the song but they don't know the artist
Not enough songs to become their favorite artist
Not enough songs to be a headline artist
I could do a week long set if I performed my whole catalogue
Every single song the crowds sing and rap along
Fuck a summer I'm a decade rapper
You're here now I'll be here a decade after
I put out 11 albums
Produced by Russ
Mixed mastered engineered written by Russ
I put out 11 albums
Produced by Russ
Mixed mastered engineered written by Russ

Try to keep me on the hush but i do not give a fuck

My baby, my baby
My baby, I got you

Mmmm
You got a little bit of liquor in your system
Hard headed so you never wanna' listen
Feelin' trapped in your world like a prison
Ain't nowhere to go, dad always go missin'
So you gotta' shack up
With a bitch not on shit
You should back up
But you can't cause there's no other options
How's a flower, in the dark
Suppose to really ever blossom

Tryna' tell you I can water your seed girl
Introduce you to the real world
Put you on a plane, get to clackin'

Eliminate your pride, let me help you

You workin' three jobs tryna' get a little cash
You think I'm only fuckin' with you for a little ass
Girl I got groupies by the dozen
I can get 'em when I want
It don't really mean nothin'
I just want all of your lovin'

I’m Here,There’s Really a Wolf,2017.0,"I'm here

Yeah, the cash came, I ain't trippin' on a past flame
Even if they were dimes, you know how many 10's want my last name?
Is this the rap game or high school politics?
Bars could be on Maury 'cause they got a little pop in it'
Before I show up, that's when the deposit hits
You only want me now, that's what I have problems with
Five-star suites, Trojan wrappers on the floor
That's the aesthetic when you gettin' half a mil' on tour
Not bad for six weeks, plus I should receive my plaque soon
Shittin' on the game, I'll probably hang it in my bathroom
Last June I was broke, this June I made a hundred
Before and after, didn't change me though I stayed a hundred
Show me someone else who's doin' what I'm doin'
Singin', rappin', mixin' masterin', engineerin' producin'
That's every song with no exception, plus the catalog longer than a lot of veterans
Mention me amongst myself 'cause I'm the first of my kind
You live a Semi-Charmed Life, 'cause your third eye is blind
I'm a shepherd, not a sheep, but I heard it's my time
Was in the shadows for so long, I deserve all my shine
Got some women you would love to fuck, left on read
Got some homies 'bout that arm leg, leg, arm, head
I should call it a night, too many women can be dangerous
You let 'em behind the scenes, all of a sudden they start framin' us
I make enough to alter her perception of me
The older you get, the more expensive lessons will be
Gotta tighten up, move a little bit more militant
Comin' down your block, lookin' like we copped the whole dealership
Penthouse suites, but couldn't tell you what city
Same ones who stayed down with me gon' be up with me
See that's the code you uphold when you know what it took to really grow into the star you all know so
When Bugus touch down, I got the Bentley waiting for him
In L.A., the next time I'll probably play The Forum
But for now, catch me selling out the Novo
No debut, no openers, I'm solo
You're trapped in the club 'cause you can't sell tickets
Your album flopped and you went ahead and fell with it
But fuck y'all, I'm a business man
I'm smokin' caviar cones in my sprinter van
On the phone with my lawyer talking about eight digits, yeah
Just to be safe, even my safes got a safe in it
False accusations, think I'm done with the groupies
'Cause one bad scene can fuck up the whole movie, so
Fuck these hoes, man I'm out the game
Plus they jump around quicker than House of Pain
Break the bank for the family, take everyone to Waikiki
My homies are big and African, knock you out in dashikis
To my family, I'm Russell, to these women habibi
Ex's know they played themselves when they see me on TV
Big money offends, small minds too bad
I give my girls a new life, you give your girls a new bag
Doin' interviews with Forbes 'cause the come ups amazin'
I got a new fetish for jewelry and expensive vacations
I got the industry shook, like, ""How's he's popping like this?
How I don't know him, but he still got 60K on his wrist""
Now I can't go to the mall, 'cause I'll probably get mauled
And I lied, I wasn't busy, I'm just ignorin' your call
'Cause maybe I feel like you don't really deserve a response
'Cause you were curvin' me crazy when I was tryna get on
Now I'm fresh up in the game, and I already went gold
'Cause I gave them what they want now they losin' control
Had to do it myself, pull the trigger on my dreams
Always knew that this would happen, manifested everything
Now they gon' write about me, like they were right about me
Some people lookin' like they wanna snatch the white up out me
That's new to me, forgive me for bein' jaded to my race
But I been color blind, that wasn't just a mixtape

Yeah, one of eleven, yeah, I put out eleven
Produced, mixed, mastered, engineered, written by me
Yeah, this just the beginning though
Yeah, debut shit",https://genius.com/Russ-im-here-lyrics

Luckily the money getting longer than Manute Bol
Sumo it's time to put my foot down
Picked up the gin around the time I put the kush down
I still smoke a little but not without a shot in me
Connected to my higher self yeah that's the God in me
I'm just tryna stay on top like an apostrophe
Bitch I'm tryna win fuck only being a nominee
I'm a one of one, Russ is an anomaly
Coming to your city and boosting this economy

No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I saw I conquered
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I conquered
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
And they always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say

Just live your truth and do you
They hate honesty boo hoo
Just count up all your blessings
Big or small they're still all blessings

Three accounts each over a milli
Rap game so crazy if I'm sober I'm silly
Yeah I drink, yeah I smoke
But that's natural elixirs
You live like your future ain't in the picture
I'm high up out in Malibu
The road to real wealth is always paved with different avenues
The difference in dividends
Is multiple businesses
I got end of year goals too big for Christmas lists
I'm dropping these jewels
I'm breaking the rules
I take your negativity and I use it as fuel
These rappers are food
Yeah I'm still hungry
I own apartment complexes that's real money

No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I saw I conquered
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I conquered
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end
They always gonna hate
Always gonna have some shit to say
And they don't wanna see you win

If you hate but you follow, you're a fan, that's understood
You got million dollar goals, but your work ethic's a penny
I take trips around the world, you still taking trips to Denny's
That's your budget? That's so sad, you're like thirty and some change
If you're hating, just be patient, I got way more on the way
You so salty that I'm popping, my success is pepper spray

Man, I'm blessed these days, never forget these days
Took a lot of long nights, just to get these days
And to be honest, I think I'm the best these days
You got now but I think that I'm next these days
Follow my gut, I never second guess these days
I passed my test 'cause all I see is checks these days
Say it direct these days with your chest these days
Got some real life monsters on the text these days
I saw the gross but I wonder what you net these days
A few legends but way too many trends these days
I'm not impressed these days, I invest these days
Runnin' the game but you won't ever see me sweat these days

I can't wife a girl who's fucked half of my colleagues
This is for every dude that hates me
'Cause women wanna date me
I put in work, I earned my stripes
I'm like the Yankees
I swear lately I been tryna wrap my head around this life
Used to sleep on couches, now it's thousand for the night
I'm winnin', you losin', I know that it irks you
European flag shit, I got stars in my circle
Look at my life, look at my come up, look how far that I made it
Honestly, if you don't feel inspired by it, you hatin'

We Should All Burn Together,Pink Elephant,2014.0,"I guess this one's for the world
Yeah

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

Yeah, I'm a lover, I'm a fighter
I'm a brother, I'm a writer
I'm a soul equipped with the voice
Who took the choice to turn the mic up
See a lot of human beings doing life inside they mind cause
They're born into the bondage, mental slavery till it's time to
Either die or break the shackles, tell me what's the difference
I'm just tryna live as free as I can while I'm existing
In this realm, I swear it's hell until you break free
But I'mma break the boundaries
Before the boundaries ever break me, but

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling our father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

I need your ears, I need your fears to disintegrate
I see the years, I see the tears, but put love in that place
I know it seems like sometimes the sunshine forgets to do its job
Cause all you know is rain and pain
And the chains just won't come off
Cause God doesn't feel so close anymore
When your mind is so far gone
The Devil's got a hold on your soul, they've got this bond
That's so strong, I just hope I encourage you to break it
There's no wrong in trying to do right even if you don't make it

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling our father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together

Make money off of bein' myself
Get a glimpse of my potential when I believe in myself
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

It's gettin' harder to tell the difference between reality and dreams
The lines keep blurrin' like I'm drivin' half asleep
I'm invitin' you to see who's next up in this rap shit
Hooks, beats and verses, every song I score a hat trick
Always said I'd never sign but lately, I been tempted
'Cause my dad just asked for gas money, my mom just said she spent it
It's easy to pass judgement when you comfortable in life
But desperation breeds a beast, the truth won't always be polite
So I'm fresh up off the flight, headed towards a life boat
Hope their word has good credit like a FICO
Only time will tell but I been feelin' like it's my time
How long you gonna keep a star player on the sidelines?
But, I'm the coach, guess God is the owner
Guess I'm just waitin' for that tap on my shoulder
Tellin' me to go in, I'ma stop the game
Blow the whistle like Snowden, young Terrell Owens
Makin' noise, still one of the greats though
I never RIP, I want MVP written on my gravestone
Your boy buzzin' in I swear this life is like a game show
One man army, when I sing, I get Tank hoes
Yeah, you know that R&B freak love
Weed so loud, Imma need you all to speak up
I hope every album that I drop has Carter III buzz
Wake up, I'm tryna live a life you couldn't dream of
I'm careful with who I include in all of this
'Cause most want a free ride but I ain't handin' out scholarships
Went to college for a semester
All it taught me was that college ain't for everyone
I'm not like everybody, so I left
My mom still supported but she was upset
'Till she saw the crowd scream my name out on Sunset
She got to watch her son light up the whole spot
Right there in that moment it's like she understood my whole plot
Different women, different offers every day now
I could see the reason why some people wanna hate now
'Cause my past 24 been more action packed than Jack Bauer
Made 100 thousand in the past hour
It's been a whirlwind, let me hit the blunt with you
Barely in the industry and I already got trust issues
Damn, or maybe past relationships, did that
I gave 'em all my trust and I ain't never get this shit back
But, fuck it, 'cause I'm on to new things
I looked up at the sky, long enough, I grew wings
Now I'm talkin' to myself like they gon' try and break you
God forbid it happens, breakdowns create break throughs
I'm sittin' on the debut, sounds like a greatest hits
Labels tryna eat, so of course they want a stake in it
And of course they talk of money, so of course I entertain this shit
Of course they lookin' at my table tryna find a place to sit
I'm patient with my process, weighin' all my options
Ya'll talkin' way too much, all these phone calls sound like auctions
Funny 'cause you used to laugh when I would say I'm ready
Now the ones who doubted me are gonna tell you how they met me
When I'm standin' where I knew I would, number 1 spot
Another year, another rapper, yeah, another one flop
Ya'll barely fuckin' the game, you on the scene for 5 minutes
Then you bust and it's over, I'm a movie, you're just a snippet
This that '89 Pistons, fuck the game up, get rings shit
Name your favorite rapper, bet I got him on my hit list
Name your dream girl, bet I end up on her wish list
Tell me how you want it, beast raps, or I could sing shit
It's time to wake up, industry full of hypnotists
I speak for myself, I don't need a ventriloquist
I need a vacation to where the real people live
You just stay on vacation, havin' real ego trips
You don't wanna admit, that without you I'd be fine
But the truth is hard to swallow when you chokin' on your pride
That goes for the girls I swooped in on
Made their brain drool, they gave top with a bib on
Always keep my switch on, watch me illuminate
Up at the studio, Drake is just a room away
Maybe I should barge in, maybe I should wait
This gon' be a funny story couple months from today

I don't wanna spend my 20s on the road
To spend my 30s wondering why I'm alone
I might buy a 40, take it straight to the head
50,000 dollars could get all my haters dead
I won't even feel it and they won't even trace it
Devil sees my blessings, swear to God he's tryna take it
Guess I gotta pray that I will not engage that
'Nother sleepless night, dark circles are my face tats
Middle finger aimed at anywhere the pain's at
RIP Pop pop, wish that I could change that, yeah

Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you

Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now

Got a face full of scruff like Shia LaBeouf
Tryna find some love, dipped off in the cut
I don't wanna talk right now
Even though I need to talk right now
But I'm hidin', I'm lonesome
I can't seem to shake this off
This zoo is a nuisance
I'm steady tryna break these walls
Yeah
I'm takin' care of my family, I'm sending wires like texts
I got a lot of mouths to feed, I'm 'bout to hire a chef
It's all on me, I gotta get the bag like Mike Conley
And hope the money's always on time like Ashanti
Omni-present, gotta be everywhere
For my family, for my friends, for my fans
It's not fair to myself, but it is what it is
I'm runnin' low on self-care, but it is what it is (fuck it)

Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you

I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now

Comin Thru,Silence,2014.0,"Yeah, see the difference between me
And whoever fuck is tryna do this shit too
I don't need to speak for you to hear me

Yeah, the rewards of self belief have turned me into an addict
Girls cheating, being hoes has turned me into a savage
Before I knew I was a prodigy, I was still bringing havoc
And my musics full of movies, all my shit's cinematic
Sometimes I feel insane, sometimes my mind should be padded
I'm just fucking up my walls, but I still build a palace
Cause there's more gold in my mind than you can mine in the Earth
Imagination flying free, my potential's my worth
Searching, saying for the longest, I'm gonna be rich any minute
Rich is just a state of mind, believe me, I'm in it
Vanilla Range, peanut butter seats with the windows tinted
That's the car, I'm getting my sister off these iTunes digits
That watch says its coming, that car says I did it
I'mma drop a classic debut called ""I'm not finished""
And I'm not fishing, but the money's swimming closer
So these hoes are getting thirstier, tryna grab my super soaker

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now
Yeah, I do this for you now
Let me tell y'all something

Yeah, now when you have everything, you don't need anything
But when you have everything, they're down for anything
See there's a lot of people who just look at you as a come up
So they mistreat you, they see the ornaments
They wanna take yours to hang they own on they Christmas tree
I just believed you cause I was raised with love
You thought I was the lick, but you ain't slick
See people change with love, try to take advantage
Cause they view it as a weakness like I'mma do whatever I want
And he won't see shit coming, but I peep bitch running
Keep it moving with your basic ass
Y'all small town hoes are all the same, I gotta plane to catch
Might sign a motherfucking deal
Might buy some motherfucking wheels
But just know, if I offer you the lifeline it's motherfucking real
Unless you DIEMON, my family or my fans, heres the plan, fuck 'em

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now
Yeah, I do this for you now
I'mma just talk shit one more time

Yeah, money right around the corner
I'm just waiting for the pick up
You call that shit a sixteen? I call that shit a pick up
Listen to your songs, sounding like you give up
Rappers sounding weak, I guess it's time for us to lift up
This whole game, cause Drakes the only one who's fucking shit up
The rest of y'all, hiding in the shadows like a ninja
But fuck your stealth, Russ is making noise
Turning up on myself like what

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now

Tsunami,UnKnown,2015.0,"Yuh, I pay my dues and get paid for it too
The outcome of my input
Is my favorite review
I do the work of two and half men
Like Charlie Sheen
This is what you get
When you don't care about the party scene
So pardon me
If I don't really look amused
I'm just shootin' for the masses
Like I'm tryna make the news
All this winning by myself
Got these labels all confused
I should do a deal with a Nike
'Cause these checks are comin' soon (ooh)
Am I the only one lifted?
The money ain't as fun
When you're the only one with it
I need a smaller table and a bigger fence
I see these leeches campin out
It's like they live in tents
I'm too advanced for your advances
Man I'm feelin godly
Russ is the wave
Nah Russ the tsunami
Te quieres casar conmigo
Yea they want me
This is for my Spanish girls in Brooklyn screaming papi

Everybody's in the same game
Different levels with it
Same hell
Different devils with it, yeah

Lemme tell you how my life feel
This past year has felt like a high light reel
I chew my beats
And I spit out anthems
If you wanna stand out gotta be outstanding
I know what I gotta do
To make my mom stop crying
Trying times doesn't mean it's time to stop trying
I'm flying with wings
That grew from leaps of faith
Feelin star struck every time I see my face
Oh that's crazy talk ain't it
I'm just gassed off my drive though
Whole album fire
I might call the shit pyro
I could go to Saudi
Make 20 racks a night
By the time this comes out
It's probably 5 times the price
5 mics use to mean something
Nowadays I don't give a fuck
About your magazine it means nothing
I change the world by example
Not by my words
I move around with a handful of people
That know they worth
Ain't no playin us
We were born to make a dent
We understand that there's way more to life
Than just paying rent
But speaking of rent
I think we bout to lose the house
Think they repoing the cars
Think we gotta sell the couch
Think they cuttin off the lights
Think they turnin off the water
And I'm still turnin down every single label offer

Top prospect
Projected high draft pick
I'm in my own league though
Own my own team though
Making hooks like lay ups
And verses like free throws
I beat the game and I ain't even use a cheat code

You hatin from the stands
I'm ballin out
Peep the seats though
Too young for this wisdom
Make them wanna check ID though
I been psychic
Motherfuckers doubted
I suggest you listen when I talk
And shut yo mouth it's
Very evident I know some shit you don't
What you gonna do if they don't send a boat
Better learn to swim lil guppy",https://genius.com/Russ-tsunami-lyrics

They tryna to kill me but they can't do it

To get through it I go through it
No losing, just learning
I'm in Sherman Oaks
I just got back from the German coast
Middle eastern women love me
Put me on a Persian throne
Some people angry they believe I'm too proud
Out here I lose all talk and the arenas too loud
Got a target on my back

That's what confidence attracts
That's what winning does

While I pursue perfection
I'm using your negativity
Channeling my aggression
Into hits, plaques, shows, they happened
Grateful that I don't get lost in hoes and fashion

Used to work at Outback
I found rap
What would I be without that?

Doors are openin' that were previously locked
Treat this game like any other bitch, I just need me the top
Always knew that I'd become what I'm becomin'
That one that's got the movers and shakers all in discussion (Blat, blat, blat)
Peep my percussion, it's no wonder why the bands about to come in
I see y'all fightin' but my fans about to jump in
I been calculatin', livin' in this house of patience
Quarantined myself down here, but now I'm breakin' out the basement
Ended up at Lyor's house, bein' great is a choice
Always workin' in silence, let my success make the noise
I'm on my wave now, welcome to my stakeout
The type of focus where I don't count the days, I make the days count
I can't take the same route, I got this mapped out differently
What I can get myself, I won't give you a cut to give to me
I'll give it to myself, put my family on my payroll
Conductor of my train, nothin' moves unless I say so, c'mon

I had to talk with my mom
She said, ""What if you're the one you've been waitin' for?""
I treat my obstacles like stepping stones
And keep climbing and climbing some more
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Yeah, no matter what, I never lose my ambition
I soldier through the bullshit, turn my wounds into wisdom
There's some new women itchin' for some love and attention
But I'm still scratchin' the surface of my potential
Won't let them fuck up my focus, I rarely ever like they advice
'Cause they gon' try and dim my light because I shine in they eyes
I'd rather be hated for what I am than loved for what I'm not
I wanna give my mom the world without worryin' 'bout the cost
I'm gonna make it crack, savin' rap, y'all should be ashamed of that
I'm not red or blue when I say that I cannot bang with that
Hooks, beats, verses, tell me who the fuck can hang with that
Rappers shootin' out the gate so fast but ain't maintainin' that (yeah)
My goals are more and more tangible
This buzz that I'm building's becomin' more and more flammable
'Bout to blow, oh yo, you should be up on this already
But in case you're not I'll let you catch up while I sip this Henny

There ain't no prize to be won, no, no
No, I've been fighting for the top, I'm ready
All I know is I want it all, all

Yeah, it's time to pack
Luggage full of dreams with the tags still intact
But the plastic's still wrapped, I haven't opened it
With my feet up on a top floor screaming ""Jesus""
But I want more, it's all good, though
This feel like that blow a pound with my dawgs on my Suge flow
They love me in the hood, so
Shout out Macivan spreading CD's round the discount mall like a virus
Bosses choking, hope your employees know how to do the Heimlich
Left the bullshit way behind like Kirk Hinrich
I'm the first of my kind, ain't no doubt about it
Slightly schizophrenic, I'm in the studio with myself
There's still a crowd around
Think I finally found the youth, it's in the truth
Since 50 rocked the vest, I had the jukes
With my feet up on a top floor screaming “Jesus”
But I want more

I won't stop until I hear the world scream my name out, name out

I made a promise to myself in '99
Not to shoot for the sky would've been my biggest crime
Sifted through my teens, growing now, I got a dream going
People said you sick for believing so I sneezed on 'em
Spent the rest nights focused on the lights
Aim for the stars, cock back, open flight
Then I got caught, hot fingerprints on the shotgun
List of success suspects and I'm the top one
You could see me live, getting swifted
You could call my momma, if you ask, she'd admit that
Climbing from the bottom got grit and the fools take hits
But the shooter in the pit cause she fit
So please don't pity me, you see me holding keys
I always like to tease, won't be the bitch to appease
Soon the hoes come running and the checks start coming
But I'm in it for the height, not the summit (aye)

I won't stop until I hear the world scream my name out, name out
Who you are is what you do, not what you say
I bring the bang out, bang out

Got a little bit a hesitance, keep one eye on you like a wink

Aint Goin Back,Beats (Netflix Soundtrack),2019.0,"Yeah
Ain't no fucking way I’m going back
Got way too much shit to take care of
And I'm having way too much fun pissing y'all off
It’s starting to look real rough out here for y'all
It's just the beginning too
Yeah, come on, come on (Yeah)

I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To splittin' five on McDoubles
I ain’t goin’ back (I ain't goin’ back)
To when there was no Russ, just Russell
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin’ back)
To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
But I stay tapped in to that hustle
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To splittin' five on McDoubles
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To when there was no Russ, just Russell
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
But I stay tapped in to that hustle

Yeah, I go way harder than most of y'all
If one of y'all died, wouldn't toast to y'all
I don't really care to get close to y'all
I live in a gym, I'm supposed to ball
Mom was applying for the food stamps
Every night studio boot camps
All I had there was a lot of free time
Cheap wine and my mind and my two hands
And the same confidence that I have right now
It was more back then to be honest
Before the world got a hold of me and started controlling me
Now I'm more tapped in to the comments than I should be
I admit that, so fuck y'all, give me my dick back
Middle finger gift wrap for the chit chat
And to anyone thinkin' I should quit rap

I ain't goin' back now (I ain't goin' back)
To splittin' five on McDoubles
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To when there was no Russ, just Russell

I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
But I stay tapped in to that hustle

Who's in my league? Not you
Who makes your beats? Not you
Who does your hooks? Not you
Bitch I'm elite, top 2
And not 2, bitch, I'm the one
It's crazy to think that I barely begun
Already on Forbes, Already in Staples
I still got four years 'til my twenties are done
I'm having my fun, my house is a brothel
I'm fucking a Baptist, her pussy is gospel
Your life is awful, that ain't my fault
Yell at your mirror, go talk to your god
I'm not letting up, fuck how you feel
I got my boots laced and I'm out
I threw 20k in my studio
I brought the blue flame to my house, bitch

I ain't goin' back, ah (I ain't goin' back)
To splittin' five on McDoubles
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To when there was no Russ, just Russell
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)
But I stay tapped in to that hustle
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)

Our Time,ZOO,2018.0,"Yeah
Maybe it's just not our time (our time)
You got your life, I got mine (I got mine)
You're too far away, let's be real (let's be real)
To get too attached, let's be real (let's be real)
But baby on the other hand
We be kicking it, can't find nothing wrong with you
You stay up with me, help me with a song or two
Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too (oh-ooh, oh-ooh)

I love you dearly, love it when you're near me
Love how you don't care I make weekly what they make yearly
Yes, I love your accent, I love your compassion
Plus you singing sweetly
Then on the flip side, barely sent an invite
But that's all it took, you're on a plane, I'm in your insides
Talkin' to my homies, I can't be the only
This can't be her first time

Maybe it's just not our time (our time)
You got your life, I got mine (I got mine)

You stay up with me, help me with a song or two
Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too (oh-ooh, oh-ooh)

Yeah, I can't tell, do I miss you enough to drink?
Or did I drink enough to miss you? So in love, I'm scared to blink
God forbid I miss a moment with you, we sharing the bed
Taking leaps of faith of love together, we sharing the ledge
And around that time my trust issues be kickin' in
I swear Latina and trouble is just a synonym (synonym)
Despite chemistry, it's so hard to overlook how we met
Miami hotel, girl, it's hard to forget

Maybe it's just not our time (our time)
You got your life, I got mine (I got mine)
You're too far away, let's be real (let's be real)
To get too attached, let's be real (let's be real)

PARANOID,SHAKE THE SNOW GLOBE (DELUXE),2019.0,"I been feelin' paranoid
I been feelin' paranoid
Every day and everywhere I go
I been, I been feelin' paranoid (Yeah)
Pistol on my lap while I write this
Never thought I'd have to rap like this
Gotta watch my back, I'm strapped like this (Yeah, yeah)

I ain't gon' lie, every night I got stress
I ain't gon' lie, I be thinking I'm next
That's why I got a gun to the right and a gun down the hall
And a gun to the motherfucking left
That's why I got cameras all over the place
Fame ain't as glamorous as everyone thinks
Lot of people wanna see me gone
Plus I've had a lot of strippers from Atlanta all over my place
Brought a little on myself, oh well
And the joint that I'm smoking don't help
And the letters that I'm getting from the women I'm in bed with
Knew I should have fucked them at the hotel
Instead of havin' them pull up to the house
But like I said, I don't like going out
'Cause the times that we're in
Could have a good kid try to kill me for some likes and some clout

I been feelin' paranoid
I been feelin' paranoid
Every day and everywhere I go
I been, I been feelin' paranoid (Yeah)
Pistol on my lap while I write this
Never thought I'd have to rap like this
Gotta watch my back, I'm strapped like this (Yeah, yeah)

Thoughts in my head would put most in jail
Fame and the hate really don't mix well
If I get locked up, Milan post my bail
Gotta just chill, but I know myself
Liable to do somethin' nutty, uh
I don't give a fuck that's your buddy, uh
I need to meditate where it's sunny
And just hum like Cudi
Just stop for a second, slow down 'fore it gets too late
And I fuck around and drown off the waves that I made
I be ridin' 'round my town and I don't feel safe
Let alone when I'm out, let alone out of state
Everybody strapped up, everybody stressed out
Think my nerves are contagious
I be tryna play it cool but deep down I be feelin' like YG
Bitch, stay dangerous, c'mon

I been feelin' paranoid
I been feelin' paranoid
Every day and everywhere I go

Sore Losers,UnKnown,2018.0,"Yeah
So many sore losers keep tryna talk to me
Y'all need to focus on winning, stop focusing on me
Yeah

Thirteen thousand in Portugal, that's arena talk
You still on your Training Day, you Ethan Hawke
Rappers with your get rich quick scheme gimmicks
Instead of hating you should focus on your sixteenth minute
We are not side by side, ain't no split-screen image
I'ma be around forever like a Springsteen ticket
I'm just bathing in success, yeah I rinse clean with it
I put my best foot forward like a Nowitzki pivot
I got blitzkrieg critics
They ain't wastin' no time
But I ain't wastin' no money, so I pay 'em no mind
That's a lie, I be snappin'
That's my fault, I'm adjustin' to people spreadin' lies about me
Just hatin' and judging
For the sake of discussion, in the hopes of some clout
Shit's been stressful, I just need some pretty hoes with some mouth
Put my home in the South, 10K square feet
Name your favorite rappers now, let's play ""where's he?""
Probably chasin' a hit, probably lost in LA
Probably paying for likes, probably paying for plays
Probably owns a Corolla, but probably rents the Aventador
Business manager furious, like ""What the fuck did you spend that for?""
Fuck y'all though, I'ma keep on winnin'
I got angels all around me, y'all can keep on sinnin'
'Cause ain't no way y'all are fuckin' up my light light
I spent two million just on taxes, somethin' light light
In hindsight, I was right all along, life of a don
Writin' songs, all those hooks were a fight to get on
You gotta see it way before it happens, yes yes
I'ma be the greatest, I won't settle for next best
Got your girl in her birthday suit, that's best dressed
Plus she likes girls too like Ellen DeGeneres
First class Emirates that's how I'm flyin'
SUVs on the tarmac, that's how I'm arrivin'
Presidential treatment, ooh this life so good
White skin, they can't believe that I got friends in the hood
I know the love songs and melodies throw y'all off
Don't give a fuck about your face tats, we know y'all soft
People we know with face tats got them for a reason
You use them for the gang culture aesthetic, you reachin'
A lot of kids are poppin' xans and sippin' lean now
A lot of rappers using Instagram to teach how
A lot of kids OD'ed that you don't read 'bout
'Cause they don't follow rappers, they just follow fiends now
But I'm the bad guy for callin' it out
I come in clutch with the truth, y'all are stallin' it out
I only get in trouble when I say the truth
Which means you gettin' fed lies everyday, you fools
Do your research before you try and speak on my name
Rappers wearing CZs and leasing the chains
The beats classic, I amaze myself
I'm a boss, I'm a owner, yeah I pay myself
Fuck the capes of society, I saved myself
Even after all the millions bitch, I stayed myself
I still take my mom with me, Bugus still right here
New people think my buzz got here in a lightyear
Fuck y'all, this ain't a Toy Story
I eat Nigerian, save some moimoi for me
Yeah, lot of y'all girls I coulda hit
But I'm the type to pass the pussy to stay home and cut a hit
Never fuck a chick at her house, she got exes
I just bought a crib, I got guns, I got exits
Cameras at the entrance
Try if you want to
Bugus told me, ""God forbid they get you, I got you""
I'm an idol, people treat me like Billy
Singin' and rappin' goin' platinum, people treat me like Drizzy
Take the studio with me
Set up shop in the telly
I've watched a lot of rappers talk but then they flop like Belly
There ain't shit you can tell me, you can save that shit
Fake convos before favors, I hate that shit
Yesterday turned down a 150,000
I ain't trippin' 'bout it
I get that every week like allowance
From my independent catalog
Fuck these rec league rappers tryna battle 'Bron
Stay in your lane, this is big business
Move bitch, get back like Chris Bridges
I remember only sellin' like six tickets
Now I make the girls crazy like Sid Vicious
I coulda played it different, coulda silenced all my truths
Coulda buddied up with rappers for the sake of looking cool
But it's not in me to be fake, I can't do it
I can see through it, man this game is translucent
They twist the truth for the headline drama
Clicks create traffic, traffic creates dollars
The sheep believe it, they ain't up on game yet
Smooth rides ain't as fun to watch as trainwrecks (damn)
Controversy is currency, controversy is clout
That's why my haters keep my name in their mouth
Y'all are hopeless, this is a decade of devotion
It's hard to stop my movement when I'm already in motion
This ain't luck, this is by design
I had to work in the dark for my light to shine
A lot of people are dope, they just quit too soon
A lot of rappers go broke, 'cause they got rich too soon (damn)
My confidence plus my success is just a mirror for some
It forces them to look around and see what they haven't done
That's a line for any hater, y'all are mad at yourselves
Judging every move I make, y'all distractin' yourselves
You could do this shit too if you wanted
But you would rather sit around and bitch and make comments
Oh well, suit yourself, be miserable
I'm country-hoppin' in a jet, that's the visual
I saw this coming in my hoodie with the plaid flannel
I bet on myself, yeah I had to gamble
I feel like I'm half god, half mammal
Bitch I turned my life into the Travel Channel
I'm not home, I'm in Stockholm
With heated floors and the beds with the soft foam
It's like clockwork watching sore losers poke their heads out
Every time I big myself up, they get stressed out
I'm the best out, yeah I said it
Self-made millionaire, you know what's up with the credits
I'm the best out, yeah I said it
Self-made millionaire, you know what's up with the credits

Bitch, yeah

Where am I livin'?
Table full of legends, I see
Where am I sittin'?
I'm out your life, but I'm still in your search bar
Still humble, still riding in my first car
Took me 10 years to get here, I work hard
From a basement
Now I'm an all around the world star
Supported my dreams till my dreams supported me
I'm lookin' at views that you don't see 'til 43
I'm half they age but twice as paid, this the good life
A bad chick doesn't always mean a good night
Heavy bars with light hooks so it seems pop
Lately they only want my responses for the screenshots
Upgraded to a Rollie from a G-Shock
The Alchemist, Napoleon Hill mixed with Deepak

The girls coming quick but the money coming faster
Red carpet treatment for yourself and whoever you with
Any girl you want the answers yes whoever you pick
Cause you poppin' now
You're a come up
My homies look like security so think before you run up
I'm one of few who did it their way
Taking over airwaves
5 course meals and lay flats on my airplanes
Your dream girl sending I miss you texts
I fly her out cause I miss that ""I miss you"" sex
Then I fly her back home
She a Florida State Seminole
Cause I got bands lined up like a festival
All over the world and I brought my mom with me
Just to say thank you and make her happy I spend 50 (thousand)

So can you get back to me?

Before your boy bails

I guess be careful what you wish for, right?
You say the truth and they come at you with pitchforks, right?
I'm in Copenhagen, overthinkin', every single moment, pacin'
Round and round the room, it's 4:00 AM, I'm at the phone just waitin'
For your call, I need a pep talk, God
It's getting harder to keep going I need a rest stop, God
I swear none of these massages get the stress off, God
Sometimes I swear I wanna get a gun and let off, God
Aim it right at my enemies, make the Devil obey me
They tryna kill me, can you blame me for the thoughts I have lately?
I know it sounds crazy, that's why I call daily

So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?

Family issues make success bittersweet
Sometimes a cold shoulder's the only way to deliver heat
That's the situation that I'm in with my dad
Me and my mom dipped quick, no one lives with my dad
Yeah it's sad but he brought it onto himself
Last time we talked, we didn't talk, we just yelled
He knows he got issues, he told me he's gettin' help
'Til then I gotta put this relationship on the shelf
Deal with what I'm dealt, welp, boohoo right?
I shouldn't care 'cause I got houses and some new coupes, right?
But money's not an adhesive that can take all the pieces
Of a broken family and put them back together, arenas
Ain't as loud as inner turmoil, get to the roots, replace any burnt soil
While the world boils over fake problems with me
I just need 60 seconds, yo God, hit me (Please record your message)

I've been callin' tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)
Feelin' lost and I don't know what to do
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?
So can you get back to me?

Fuck
I guess I'ma just keep callin'
One of these days you gonna pick up, hopefully

Ooh, this pussy's good as fuck, it's temptin' not to wrap it up

Stay on office, keep on winnin', gotta make it, take it mine
I got many checks, I'm swimmin' in it
Henny sex, we hittin' different
Heavy chest, when Nipsey didn't
Make it through, give me a minute, yeah
Only thinkin' vertical
Run the marathon from top to bottom on some personals
McLarens and convertibles, my Porsche's name is Percival
I studied this shit inside out but I am not reversible
Livin' way too purposeful, my values ain't coercible
You made a hit but shit you probably still not reimbursable
Money every Friday, indie catalog, I'm versatile
My throwaways are hits for you, one day I might be merciful
Shootin' for the stars, I never hesitate, I'm first to pull

Weed burnin', never call a truce
So you never want a problem, just a legend how I move
Head rush, me and Russ comin' like we Dre and Snoop
'64 Impala, just the way we play with loot
Big bank ballin', in the paint, I'm known to shoot
Dolce & Gabbana or Versace be the mood
It's no love for haters, so far from neighbors
Six chains swingin', make it so hard on traitors
Start off in Avis, now it's the latest
Made top five in this, I'll be the greatest
Thought I was minor, my thoughts were major
Call it designer, sharp as a razor
Your shit declinin', thought it would phase us
Call it vagina, your Uber is waitin'

The Game,UnKnown,2017.0,"Yeah
Now you can hear the gold just jangling
But, its still about the take over

It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that, yeah

Where do I start damn, man my mind is racing
Hip hop awards getting chosen by some racists
I'm in the yo, with a bottle of some clear shit
You don't know the truth, you just hear shit
Homie's on a Learjet, upgrade from the block
If you too big, fuck fades they gon' use the Glock (use the Glock)
I do a lot for everyone around me, y'all don't see it
I'm in the club for half an hour then I'm probably leaving
I got paid, dip off with the gang
Got Bugus in the Bentley, got Herb in the Wraith
Got Tim in the Ghost, got a gun on his waist
Life or death, ain't no time to start reaching for the safe
So I play it safe
Real ones that would really go hit for me
Low overhead, no-one ever wrote a hit for me
I be making history, bigger when I'm dead
I'm so on (on)
But it's off with they head
Fuck MTV, y'all really snubbed me
How you choosing people with numbers that ain't above me?
Oh wait, politics
Playing at these colleges, getting paid more to perform than any scholarship
I'm lit, I'm gassed, I'm me, I'm me
Two platinum singles, two years they were free
As I'm writing this, I know that this ain't accurate no more
By the time that all y'all hear this I will most likely have more
I really did eight tours, headlined them all
Your contacts were bullshit, we redlined them all
I spent time in awe, on some amazed shit
Then an O.G. told me to embrace this
I will never waste this, never get complacent
Lotta these rappers got rich and got jaded
I'm still on the same shit, take over the game shit
I just can't relate to your wavelength

It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that, yeah

I get everything for free, from your girl to my wardrobe
Half a million dollars smiling on my torso
I buy property, you just got foreclosed
Money running low, you gon' have to do more shows
But you know no one shows for your shows
So you do club hostings but you drink what you gross
Then you go back home, fall asleep frustrated
Girl laying next to you, whispering ""Russ made it""
You asleep, you don't hear her so she sneaks out
And she pulls up on me and brings the freak out
I send her back before your eyes open
I'm her fix 'cause your life's broken
She might try chokin'
On something you don't wanna kiss after
Lifestyle of a young handsome rich rapper
It's all laughter, it's all big bucks though
Call the buzz ""Vegas"" 'cause it stays on a bus though
Girls gone wild, rich like Rothschild
I'ma make you sign an NDA, now you're on file
I'm the President, the CEO
People that I've never seen, tryna see me go (uh)
Billionaire minds in my circle that's a fact
Faded off Clooney liquor we don't know, how to act
If it's based off of fans, y'all should really do the math
If it's based off of sales, y'all should really count the plaques
If it's based off of pussy, y'all should really count the ass
If it's based off of money, y'all should really count the cash (uh)
Move around with duffle bags like Floyd does
Sometimes nothing makes more noise than poise does
Coin us the best movement of all time
Dreams too big to think small time
I'm just on the same shit, take over the game shit
I just can't relate to any B-level wave length

It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same

Yes, oh!
)
Peekin' through you, chiefin' and eating fufu
We see what this dreamin' grew to, arenas in Honolulu
Doin' streams like I'm Hulu, Lambo talks via Bluetooth
People tryna do voodoo, this zoo is making me coo-coo
And fuck the media and the politics in this industry
The snakes and the lies and the gossip in this industry
And fuck these WWE-ass rappers
High school mentality, glee-ass rappers
Fake family ties, y'all say brother too much
Y'all get played by the same women, y'all say you love her too much
And y'all be runnin' from the truth, y'all take cover too much
I'm gettin' tired of this shit, man, enough is enough

Now you leave me no choice
I have to kill 'em all (

Yeah
Rappers dissin' for attention that their music ain't gettin'
I understand, it's frustratin' watching my rapid ascension
Watching arenas sell out, watching my plaques multiply
When you ain't headlined a tour, and when you drop they don't buy
But you got followers though, but what they followin' for
But that's 'cause most of them are fake, let me let your followers know
That y'all be payin' social media agencies twenty thou' every month
Just to comment, like, and follow your account
It's all a front, y'all are glorified Instagram entertainers
Got millions of followers, but can't even sell out your basement
Y'all droppin' antics and skits 'cause you can't drop a hit
Flashin' jewelry, posting lean, poppin' Xanax for clicks
Infatuated with designer, costume shop carollers
Bunch of crackheads and clowns, bunch of Boondocks characters
Damn, y'all not scarin' us with your Internet loose lips
I been at the same festivals y'all don't do shit

Now you leave me no choice
I have to kill 'em all (

Man, I don't even like that it's this easy to write whole songs and shit about this type of shit. Sometimes you just gotta get it off your chest though.

We were too young, not ready
I was wide-eyed, I loved heavy
You, made me think accidents ain't real
You, made me get passionate and feel
I think I get it, you really loved me
I learned my lesson, now I can trust me
Looking back, yeah it was a mess
At least you cared, got shit off your chest now
Guess I'm stuck, go back home
Grady baby, but she think she grown
Blowing up my phone like ""where the fuck are you at?""
""Girl I'm in the studio, I thought you knew that""
Doesn't matter that we living in the same city
I promise I'm not lying when I say I'm busy
You ain't ready for the lifestyle I'm living
25 and settled down is not in my vision
Girl we not the same, our life's so different
Yeah
I think we should call it quits
I ain't got the time for the back-and-forth arguments
Unnecessary drama, gotta cut that
Everything but that, energy on fuck that

And if you don't, I ain't got the time to tell you why you won't—
Ever get it, better end it now

You can't stay, now just admit it
For the longest time, you ain't been with it
Is it something I did?
Is it something I said?
'Cause I felt like I gave you more than I had to give
Oh I tried, I tried and you tried a little
I cried, I cried, I still cry a little
You say we both know what's up but
I don't know what's up with you
I don't know what I could do, I could do
You say we both know the deal but
I am scared that after this, I won't ever heal

Yeah, I need y'all to listen
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
Know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't

Yeah, my parents' marriage in shambles, I won't lie, it hurts
I thought money would fix it, but it just made it get worse
See my dad was the man, 'til his job cut ties
He went broke, I got rich, that shit fucked with his pride
Yeah, I recognize it was disturbing to see
The family stopped turnin' to him and started turnin' to me
Going through it, I know he tried to hide the pain
If he gave up and got a job, his dad died in vain
'Cause his dad ran a business
So my dad tried to run one too but there's a difference
No income, my dad started loosin' his confidence
Meanwhile everyday I got brand new accomplishments
At the height of my career was his lowest
And that's a lie, 'cause we both still goin'
Me up, him down, it caused a lot of angst
Argument got out of hand, had to call Frank
All my efforts ignored, he threw it all in my face
There's not a song long enough where I can say what I gave
Shit's crazy, mom couldn't believe him
I mean she's cried in the past, you know, threatened to leave him
But she never had the money to, but I got it now
It's bittersweet that this is how I bought my mom a house
Oh well, guess I should have seen it comin'
All the tears, all the threats, all the fightin' and fussin'
Hardly any lovin', way too much hate
Finally tried to change, mom said it's too late
Move out day came and went, still in shock, shit
Doesn't even know where my mom's new spot is
Wasn't the first time but this was the worst time
Hurt by your own family is the worst kind
All this shit been happenin' while I was blowin' up
And it's still going on, now you know what's up

Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
Know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't

Yeah, I got way too much stress for any more bad press
Especially another lie that they make up and stretch
Damn, I can't lie, shit is takin' a toll
So much hate sent to me, some stays in my soul
To the point that when I walk into the booth, that's what I let out
Makes for good songs but mentally I'm tryna get out
Tryna focus on the good, not the evil
Can't complain, is how I always greet people
I'm exhausted, exasperated from the pain that I'm facin' and masquerading
Don't get it twisted, I'm grateful for everything
But the devil's still asking for a wedding ring
I decline, try to focus on love
Try to focus on fans, try to focus on Russ
Everyday another lie, sometimes it feels like a curse
Sometimes it feels like necessary preparation for first

Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
Know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't
Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
I know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, no",https://genius.com/Russ-parkstone-drive-lyrics

Cause they told me that I couldn't have a dream

Contemplating suicide
Tryna' tell my people we much smarter when we unify
Tryna' move these units, out here livin' like it's do or die
We be on MTV, often dreams is self belief
Got my confidence, my self esteem is shootin' through the roof

Odio a todo el mundo
Yo creo que soy mejor que todo el mundo
¿Y tú sabes qué? Oh
Yo creo que es todo el mundo lo sepa, ah

Yuh, I'm cool on your opinion of my strategy
Phone full of women all mad at me
Cause they ain't on my mind like they use to
Cause I ain't got the time that I use to
Money tight as usual, but it's cool, because it's coming
And I don't ever follow your strut
I don't ever follow money, I just follow my gut
Now they following Russ
Yeah your boys gettin bigger now
Y'all careers dying, start pouring out the liquor now
Been at this since 06
Before it started being cool, to drop albums with no hits
I'm out here coming for all of it
I want all the acknowledgment
I want all the accomplishments
I want cars that's astonishing
Plus the house that my mommas in
Should be big as a continent
I make good on my promises
50 bitches to party with
Man, the world is my audience
I'm just tryna' give my statement
Billboard from a basement
The type of focus where you wonder where the day went
But do it all again
How to be a millionaire
It's getting harder to call a friend
Too many hidden agendas
You 50/50 with your character
My life is on the line
There's gone always be a barrier
Between me and most
I never let 'em too close
With the girls it's no different
I can't be falling for hoes
That's why I keep to myself
I stay recording tryna' upgrade
My life to the nights full of lights, cash, and runways
I haven't had a Monday since 18
I knew in high school I could go pro like KG
Lately it's been looking like I made the right decision
Found my way outta' the dark, I gotta' flash light vision
If her ass right but the face left, then I'm dippin'
I need a chick three for three like Pippin
Hang my jersey up, It's worthy of the rafters
I know their game, I ain't worried 'bout these rappers
It's too predictable now, it's so political now
And Im sorry if I sound a little cynical now
It's just that most my favorite rappers are invisible now
Everyday I make a song that's just habitual now

Ain't nobody gonna' do it like me
Ain't nobody gonna fill the void I see but me, so here I go

Twelve shots like the cops, now I'm wasted
It's in the blood of America to be racist
Land of the taken
Home of the cover it all up and don't say shit
Act like it ain't happen, cut, copy, paste it
Put it on every channel doesn't matter if you change it
I'm off it though
It ain't where I've gone
It's where I've gotta go
I tell these local girls what they wanna' know
Never fuck 'em twice, cause I won't be there to catch em
Self belief and a passion this is the natural reaction
I be singing these ballads
Like a young Mike Bolton
Sprewell with the raps though
Like Russ might choke him
Keep a few eyes open
I'm everywhere, I'm omnipresent
Wired with the drive of a Bugatti engine
I've been running non stop since fourteen
Ain't no time to slow up, man I need more beats
Even though I got 500 sitting in a playlist
I'm starting to realize that the money won't change shit
I'm starting to realize that y'alls basic ain't my basic
On the plane to the A making a list of all the shit matters
Y'all opinions didn't make it
'Bout to be a A list celebrity
Wife me up a singer
Hope she gotta' accent
Hope she drinks liquor
Board of advisors, I can count on four fingers
Leave the middle one open
To let you know I ain't sweet
I've been a shepherd my whole life
I can't relate to the sheep
It's a shame you asleep
But I'm about to make your bed shake
Bow down to me I'm the Sensei
Let's play who's gon be here in a decade
Lotta yall are barely even making it to the next day

Man
The fuck?
The fuck are y'all doing man?
You out here getting platforms and shit
Turning up talking 'bout dumb shit
Man
And the crazy shit is that, like, people believe you because you're poppin'
So you can say whatever you want
But that shit sound dumb as fuck
And all y'all got low fucking IQs
And all y'all figure out what's poppin' off in the water, like twenty-eight

She loves my long hair and my tattoos, how iconic, I know
Women pounce often and my sound poppin'
Y'all are clout hoppin', while I'm house shoppin'
You should make more moves and less announcements
I'm having sex with spouses
Watch me invest and count this, I got the best accountants
I'm looking at the aftermath off all my hours
Unfortunately, I rarely take the time to smell my flowers
Used to move around a lot, used to have to pack houses
Now I'm on the road playing shows for packed houses
Now I'm in Toronto smokin' maple leaves
I got the catalog of branches outside of the label's tree
You can't label me, I made all my shots
But that was when the crowd was ghost
Now the world is watching me, time to go repeat results

I'm an outlaw
I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off
I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all
I got a lot of hits left like a southpaw

With skin like cinnamon, bitch it's a Tuesday

Went platinum out a suitcase
Y'all too fake, your debut came and went
I'm throwin' a coup de
Ta da bitch, I'm here, y'all pop up and disappear
I want Priyanka in Bahamas, I want 20 mil' this year
What y'all know 'bout doin' sold out shows around the globe?
I bring the hoes out, the come-up's documented, you should scroll down
And peep game, you can say he changed 'cause he went and achieved fame
But he landed where he aimed
So fuck the chest you thumpin', fuck the threats you publish
I'm up in your city doin' shows, address is public
I never listened to the churches
I listen to Kanye, Eminem, Nipsey, J. Cole, Kendrick, Drake and Jay-Z verses
Rap is the new sermon, rappers are the preachers
Rappers are the doctors and the teachers, the world needs us
C'mon!

Bunch of fuckin' zombies poppin' pills and sippin' heroin
Y'all are so embarrassin'
Got your wifey runnin' all her fingers through my hair again
I'm starin' in her soul, your bitch has no control
She's lookin' at my platinum plaques, your bitch ass still ain't gold
I'm hot globally, you popped locally
I'm noticing this game hasn't really noticed me
It's okay, I understand, I wasn't in your plan
But y'all gon' come around 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' man

This ain't a thing you should try
I protect this with my life
Cause my life is what I gave
For my life I would die

I dare you to come and try it
But nobody's shaking round here
Yes I got it so you want it
But I ain't see you here last year
Bet you won't try it
No no
I bet you won't try it

All this time in between got me anxious
Family looking at me like, save us
I got to get to where I'm going now, oh oh
Stepping up to the plate when they need me
This is what I practiced for
This is what I'm asking for, for, for, for
I made my name get bigger
Stayed with my faith like liquor up in my vains
My trigger fingers my brain
I figured I should do me
Looking back I was blinded by what I really couldn't see
23, I'm so happy I didn't blow at 17
They be stupid
I don't play against you
I play against the idea of me losing
See the blueprint I sketched out
I was right all along to let your opinions get left out

I dare you to come and try it
But nobody's shaking round here
Yes I got it so you want it
But I ain't see you here last year
Bet you won't try it
No no
I bet you won't try it",https://genius.com/Russ-try-it-lyrics

When local girls were the dream girls, this is ten years with no sleep
Yeah, that ain't a Nissan, that's a McLaren
That’s what I told myself, that's how I got it

Into muses, do what I do's
If deaths comes in threes then pain comes in twoses
Thank you Mom
You're the only thing that keeps me here
I bought depression on the low, but it wasn't cheap this year
I think I reached a tier where everyday I keep a tear
Tucked in the holster like I'm tryna conceal a piece in here
I need peace in here, I'll do whatever
On the road to finding happiness, I'll lose whatever
That's how I'm feelin' as of late, got a lot up on my plate
These are shoes I got exclusive, I don't expect you to relate
It’s not written on my face, nah, it's buried deep
They see me as strong, so I can't come off very weak
I been havin' scary dreams of death destruction and despair
I guess I'm lost tryna find someone who really cares
Damn, fuck

I hope you find some shit

Thought you got me, thought you not like the rest
Thought you want me (Uh), thought you wanted what's best

If I saw you today, I think all I would say is—

It's betrayal 'cause I trusted you, won't happen' again (Nah)
I'll forgive an enemy before I forgive a friend (Yeah)
One is breaking a code, one is actin' in character
I won't do you how you did me, I won't laugh and embarrass ya
I was raised better (Definitely)
You just evil, I'm the shit before the eighth letter (G)
You showed yourself at last, like the late Etta James, I'm awake gettin' brain
But my mind's on how were you fake to my face?
Light a J, grab a bottle, pour it up, drink it straight
I can't wait to never hear from you, I was really here for you (Yeah)
You were never here for me (Facts), you were clearly here for you
I promise this ain't magic when you see me disappear from you
I just watched Hustle & Flow, but this ain't a trick (Whoop that trick)
You tried to take everything away from me, I take offense (Yeah)
What's trust? Now I gotta start from scratch

They say it'll make me a better man
If I forgive you, but frankly, I never can
I'm a frequent flyer to places you never been
You in conversations talkin' bout paper you never spend, uh
I caught the hints late, all women lie and men fake
You was my O-Dog like Larenz Tate
Thought my relationships was in shape
Guess I was blind 'cause bonds grow strong and then break
Yeah, how you kickin' me while I'm down?
I blame me, 'cause all you did to me I allowed
What's crazy is, you never figured we'd run the town
I bet you'd take it back if you coulda pictured me where I'm now
Watch who you call a friend, the game filled with snakes
Who use real as a shield to conceal they fake
So if you ask me, ""What's love?"" then I still would say
""What's love? Love is whatever, you can still betray (Damn)

From a Distance,ZOO,2018.0,"I've been outta state
You've been stuck in yours
It's not personal
When you call me and I ignore you, damn
I'm just tryna detach, detach
I rarely ever get time to relax
But when I do I'm just tryna rejuvenate, meditate

But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)
I fuck with you from a distance

You want me to free time
To talk to you, but I
Only talk to you when I got free time
I guess that's the difference
Between Ms. and Mrs
You lookin' for someone who's got time

But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)
I fuck with you from a distance

Yeah, she don't really care about the fame or the dollars
She be bad as fuck in a hoodie and some joggers
I be on the road ignoring all her FaceTimes
Not tryna break hearts, but I'm on my break time
I just did tours non-stop
Had girls on all fours and on top
I had sisters, I had cousins doin' freak shit
Now I'm tryna chill, smoke weed, make these hits
I know I promised
But sometimes shit pops up when you're poppin'
Damn, I know we text a lot
When I see you, best believe we having sex a lot
Connect the dots
Before you try and draw conclusions
Love is feeling like it's all illusions
I'm still young, lemme go through my phases
Lemme adjust, girl, I just got famous

Drake,How To Rob,2014.0,"Yeah
Yeah

Taking bottles to the face like Tony Parker
Half a million dollars, that can't be your only offer
Writin' 'bout the truth, hope I'm not the only author
Talking to this girl, feeling like her only father
Running shit like fugitives
Take my hammer to these MC's cause I'm too legit
No ones rapping for the passion, y'all just do this cause it's lucrative
Foolishness, that's why y'all barely make it to your debut
And never see your second, man I hope these minutes save you
Cause our time is limited
Hope you start something and finish it
Run that fucking marathon, shoutout to Nipsey spittin' it
Momma told me sign a deal, I know she's been waitin' on it
Labels tryna' gas me up and break me but I ain't breaking on it
Imma' wait it out and exercise my fucking patiences on it
Verses hit you like a shot, hooks, like their laced with chronic
Not to mention all the beats you've swallowed, Imma' make you vomit
Too ill, too real
This is what the truth feels

Like Mike, 23, by the time I'm 23
Imma' have some accolades that blow my brain like Kennedy

Five on five, Inside my mind, it's feeling like this ten to me
Hope that I can make it, to the day, where these are memories
Fade away to long, I hope this ride Isn't the death of me
Cause I got a duty to make these fooly rappers lemon squeeze
Emmys please
Oscars maybe, Grammys that's a definite
Imma' fuck the game, present the body just for evidence
Platinum albums on my wall, somewhere In my Bungalow
Universe is my judge and my jury, yeah I'm under oath
Got the weight, in my work, yeah I got a ton of dope
Money so clean it feels dirty, that's all I fuckin' wrote

That's all I fuckin' wrote

Emergency,There’s Really a Wolf,2017.0,"Yeah, yeah
Oh, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I been climbin', the view's spectacular
Even if I crash, I'd rather drive than be the passenger
Slightly philosophical, I wanna die young as old as possible
As of late, I been feelin' responsible
For my family's livelihood, I think tonight we should
Celebrate the fact that I'm a star and that the likelihood
Of me blowin', in the next couple of months is definite
Anticipate me comin' like the porn stars in my messages
Speakin' of porn stars, all my exes all Latinas
Hits them like tequila when they see me in arenas, and yeah
It hasn't happened yet but trust me, y'all gon' pay for
Bein' devils in disguise as everything I prayed for
I learned a lot though from all the above
I guess God got a job at the comedy club
But fuck that, I'm buzzin' now, whole industry flockin'
'Cause I'm the people's champ and you just industry poppin', c'mon

I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgency

Yeah, yeah, I swear I had a year that you can't ignore
I swear that no one's ever won, how I'm winnin' before
Pretty women like Julia Roberts come to the concerts
And scream daddy but I ain't about to adopt her
I gotta conquer and collect
Every motherfuckin' check, tryna pay a couple tuitions
Write 'em off as an expense
Let the takeover commence
If I say it, I believe it, you just dream of success
I stay awake to achieve it, it's crazy seeing
Girls I used to crush on, fuckin' to my love songs
Yeah, I'm gettin' commas but I'm 'bout to get my run on
Flights bi-coastal, everythin' paid for
That's just how it goes when you take what they wait for
Things are pickin' up, I'm just tryna find the peace
Some people shine and give it back but my shine is not a lease
This is permanently owned, if I lose it, it's on my terms
I don't wish for shit, I desire then acquire

I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgency

No failure is final, no success is permanent
It's madness, mom really 'bout to march like the tournament
Certain shits been fuckin' up my days and nights
Like yeah, my parents got no money so I guess I gotta pay the price
At least I have it, let me get my blessings straight
If this was last year, we'd be food stamps and Section 8
Awkward conversations with my dad he's feelin' cursed
He's askin' me for gas it's like the roles are reversed
Monitor what Russ is makin', feelin' like I'm suffocatin'
Feelin' like I need 10 shots and 2 blunts to chase it
Acceptin' what is and lettin' go of what was
Havin' faith in what could be if I just one up
Myself every time and let the chips fall where they may
I got pit stops in LA, makin' shit pop every day, yeah
People stumble on stones that I use to step on
The chips I mentioned earlier, I pick 'em up and bet on myself

I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency

Couple million tucked away, 25 to touch the stage
When I'm in L.A I'm probably in a Bentley or a Wraith
People tryin to bring me down cause they see me goin' up
If you try and play my life I'm sending people with some guns
I don't fuck around with that, anybody can get touched
Got the family on my back, you fuckin 'round with the wrong one

Hope the people still relate but my music is my life and my life just changed but

Wonder where I'm flyin next
Got my dad on private jets
Everybody's got a number I might go and buy my ex
Sellin out across the globe, if you really want to know
I just made 8 figures and I'm talkin net not talkin gross
Not bad for a dropout, see me rollin in a droptop
I can't stop no not now, 10 years I finally got hot

Dealin' with losers in their feelings, that comes with the winner

This is new for her, she's never fucked with no one that can do what he can do for her
Not talkin' 'bout the money, talkin' 'bout how he can groove with her
She be introverted, he be huggin' her, hah
She be shy as hell, but he be fuckin' her, uh
She's in heaven, never loved until he came along
He wrote love songs 'bout her and she sang along
Picture perfect, that's accordin' to the verses
That's the problem, though
Feelings growin' fast, she's tryna stop 'em though
She don't trust him all the way
She knows that he's entertainin' bitches that he shouldn't
They can't fuck with her, she's demonstratin'
Self-preservation, uh, utilizin' patience
Even though she wants him badder than ever like a vacation that he's never had

You wanted me to do this right? (laughing)
Yah, do it
Waddup Gianna

Communicating while anonymous doesn't accomplish too much
So imma get this fucking platform, keep on talkin' my stuff
Reachin' everybody
From the South Side of Atlanta
To the place I'm more familiar with but I paint panoramas
That'll make you trip like I love Lucy
By the way I took a trip and I love Lucy
She introduced me to the truth
I wrap a noose around your boss real quick
Kick his stool out, and make his boss' boss feel it
And nah my balls don't fit
In the palm of my hands
So don't ask me to grab 'em, I let 'em hang I'm the man
Fuck spelling it out
I'm yelling it out
Y'all flip then you flip
You're not hip you're not hop
I'm just a product of listenin'
To washed up artists submittin'
Feeble attempts to stay on, so all that garbage your givin'
Is getting you thrown out
I'm thrown, leave me alone I'm in my zone now
Too many clowns
Diemon is full of lions it's time to roam now
And my life, is a good book
Bugus, rollin' good kush
Never house a bitch because they bite and bark, woof woof
Look, look
The world is pulling me down I'm about to push push
And let the visions in my head pull my sled, Balto, mush mush
Y'all lay beneath the tush tush
And your pockets stay empty
Because your mouth is full of pussy
Go dive in ambition
Swim around in some talent
Bust a nut full of visions
Then hit it again with some passion
And get it crackin' like the sea monster
I see monsters with all that
Fee-fi-foh-fum
But y'all ain't scarin' no one so just fall back
Because it's D-I-E-M-O-N
'Till the motherfucking world ends
And I'm probably where your girl is

Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I wonder if the lord ever heard of me

Now them same mothafuckas wanna murder me

I had nothin' left to lose so I'm singin' nigga blues

Gotta gift, for the game, wrapped around my middle finger
No semi-circles in this DIEMON shit
Squares don't linger
I'm your dudes favorite rapper, and your bitches favorite singer
It's Jerry Springer in this hotel room, minus the violence
We questioning each other on some who what where and why shit
But back to the living out the dream or tryna find it
Fuck it I think I found it
Fuck that I know I found it
Y'all old dudes ain't new no more, y'all need a fountain
Y'all be king of the hill motherfuckers, I got the mountain
Y'all shoutin' making commotion
Barely making a wave I'll make the ocean
And park my yacht on your property with no apology for show boatin'
And I've met God a lot but I've never met Jesus
I've even met the Devil and kicked it with her on some G shit
She showed me how to get to hell
I showed her how to leave it
And close that fucking door shut as I walk towards my freedom (yah, do it)

Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot

Out in California countin' up my blessings

Off my catalogue

'Cause I'm on
And I got more songs than the Beatles, woah
That's a stretch?
Yeah, I guess
But you get the jist
Laughin' at the skeptics 'cause
I always knew I'd get this rich
Family knew and Bugus knew
That's probably about it
Quicker you come in the game
The quicker you go out it
Y'all ain't really 'bout shit
Y'all ain't got no substance
Yea I heard your little viral song
Some fun, dumb shit
Some one month shit
You're a seasonal rapper
You a bitch the world fucks
'Cause we leavin you after
Don't hit my phone with some stupid shit
That's not why I gave you my new number, you stupid bitch
Delete and block you
I don't have to, but I want to
I'm just trimming the fat
Haters drowning in doubt
Meanwhile I'm swimming in cash
I was never cool with y'all, don't try to link up now
Because my train left the station, but it's a brink's truck now
I switch up styles
Like I was dating Badu
It's common to hate on the truth
I'm carving my name on the roof of
Hip Hop then breakin on through
To the otherside like Jim Morrison
Guzzlin' gin wondering if I drink more than him
Scary thought
I got the juice like Barry Bonds
I ain't tryna blend in like white kids with sperrys on
You're faker than these rappers who keep tryna claim indie
Major connections millions behind you
You're not indie
Get offended, then I got you by Hip-Hops' collar
'Cause Bugus told me that only a hit-dog hollers
Top dollars what they pay me for the flows now-a-days
Free weed, free women, free clothes now-a-days
All we got is time, so my time is my investor
I'm single, so I save money and live better
I need my plaques advanced
Tell the RIAA
Underrated and overlooked
Yes but never underpaid
Blew up off the web like Peter Parker
Went from flying 32F
To private jets getting chartered
This is my departure
Use to think it was delayed
'Till I let go of the wheel and let my faith fly my plane
That's when I started taking off
Millions in my bank account
Manifested everything
Became what I would think about
20,000 dollars for the show is what I'm making now
And that's just the guarantee
Before the merch and meet and greets
And that's only accurate as of today
I'm St. Louis with my hoes fly 'em back to LA
That's when I'm there 'cause really lately I've been all over
Studios my gym I lift my family up I'm all shoulders
I fall forward I don't ever fail
I went from past due bills
To 50 bands I'm getting better mail
Every sale I make I keep 100%
I put in overtime cuz momma owes 100 in debt
That's low ballin'
No calling my phone I'm in Greece
Self pressures at my neck
Aegean Sea at my feet
Took my mom around the world
My bucket list is ever changing
Women wet on arrival fuckin' chicks is better famous
I'm poppin from the Southside to the Sudan
This time last year mom applied for a food stamps yeah
And now it's Michelin star restaurants in every country new guala
The only one in the whole place below 40 with two commas
I Love the way I did it
Can't nobody tell me shit
'Cause ain't nobody make me hot
And ain't nobody make me rich
Hope that cash that your flashings been provisioned for your taxes
'Cause the IRS is watching
Flossing could be problematic
You should chill, act like you've seen some money before
I can't date a chick that's never left the country before
So take your bra off, put your hair up
Put my hoodie on
Eyes are windows to the soul
Yours say ""put me on""
I got you baby every morning like I'm mark McGrath
And your body and my hands is my next collab
I'm texting back but not enough because my life is popping
You hop from dude to dude and club to club
I'm island hoppin'
Reminiscin' back before I had one track
Back when I would put a half a gram in blunt wraps
When me and Bugus got so high before our graduation
I think I got too high, I don't remember graduatin'
Laughing thinking fuck diplomas I got plaques now
Use to celebrate 1,000 plays looking back now
I realize that the journey is everything
There ain't no destination man the journey is everything
Looking back I realize the journey is everything
Ain't no destination man the journey is everything",https://genius.com/Russ-the-journey-lyrics
Last Forever,ZOO,2018.0,"I think this might be paradise
I just hope it lasts forever
I think this might be wonderland

Ricky Rozay
Yeah, yes
Maybach Music

Get you out to France, fly you out to Nice
Or we can chill out in Atlanta, let's enjoy the feast
We can do the spa, we can do the mall
I bet it do the job, she wish she with the Boss
Livin' like the movies, which she work for
I got the fitty in the crib, that's on the first floor
Belaire with the lemons what she thirst for
Digging for your soul, your spirit's what I search for
Bricks and baguettes, ain't nothing above this 
(
Maybach Music

Tongue-kissing with sex, we fell in love quick
Red leather double R, I'm on some Don shit
Black bottle boy and all white bosses

I think this might be paradise
I just hope it last forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it last forever
Yeah, yeah

Looking around at the collision of ambition and vision
I'm really starting to believe that I just dream for a living
I couldn't play it safe, that's way too risky for me
Instead, I'm walking out of shows with like 250 on me
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to hustle on it
Too busy looking for success, that's how I stumbled on it
Russ got the potion, fuck just hoping
Luck tends to bet on the ones in motion
Wrote one check, took care of my parents' debt, tell the IRS
Six figures doesn't make me sweat, I'm flying on jets
G4s for four of us, real spacious
Bought my family cars and I buy them all places
Apartment complexes that I own, low-key shit
Getting paid from rooms where haters probably send tweets
It's seamless, becoming what I meant to be
God just keep on blessing me in front of all my enemies

I think this might be paradise
I just hope it last forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it last forever
Yeah, yeah

Nothing last forever unless you talking 'bout my rap game
I can do it to you like this or like that man
No pressure on me, I'm the freshest homie
Walk by faith, to see me is to know me
Undeniable, reliable, as fly as they come
The prodigal son and I am the one
Insurmountable funds, that's for my daughter and sons
See I remember getting nickels, dimes, quarters, and ones
See I ain't looking back no more, I'm up in paradise
Eating steaks and shrimp like a pimp and that's err'night
Stepping out the shower, to a mink floor
I'm in the Hills, getting money, I got pink toe
Max my stacks just like Rico, penthouse suite at Tinico
I open my blinds to get a view
Now tell nigga what it really do?

I think this might be paradise
I just hope it last forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it last forever",https://genius.com/Russ-last-forever-lyrics

The kind of love you make a song bout
You loved me way before I ever put a song out
It was real, organic like its spose to be
First day I saw you, I was hoping that you noticed me
You the reason why I love latinas
Only girl I ever smoked with, without Tequila
Back when I use to cop a couple quarters a week
And smoke the whole thing with you, round them hood ass streets
That was good ass weed
It's crazy though yo, that plugs dead
And I ain't talkin dead to me
I'm talkin real blood shed
I'll admit a lots changed since then, yeah
I've been getting hot, makin waves since then, yeah
I've been outta state getting paid since then
Fucking girls off my name and the fame since then
But still, I almost wanna' call and ask truthfully
Am I the same or did I change from what I use to be, yeah

I've been thinking 'bout this girl I had a good thing
With, until I fucked it up, yuh
I've been looking for this girl in all these other girls
But they just fuck it up
Oooo-oo-oo, nothing like the first love, first love
Oooo-oo-oo, they're the best one and the worst one, worst one

Yuh, cause you were with me from the jump, even before day one
Now the girls, the more songs I drop the more they come
But none of my next girls were a keeper like you
I should call this, late night thoughts featuring you
Cause when I wake up
I probably won't feel the same but
That ain't gonna change the
Way the moon got me here tryna' make up
I fucked up a couple times, we never moved passed that
I'm sorry 'bout that Colombian girl, with the fat ass
And the other two I didn't mention, 'till we split
I gambled with your trust, I shoulda' never took that risk
I shoulda' realized what I had, a down ass Latin chick
The type of girl that you makes you see, there's no such thing as accidents
Wasn't on no hoe shit
She was on her own shit
I know I'm the reason why that winter was the coldest
But it happened how it's spose to
At least that's what I tell myself
Drinking, thinking I should try and call you
I can't help myself

I've been thinking 'bout this girl I had a good thing
With, until I fucked it up, yuh

For any peasant tryna play Deebo

You mad 'cause the girl you wanna fuck sucked my dick
You were a high school loser, now a bitter adult
I handle your karma myself, that's a quicker result
Raisin' money to kill me 'cause y'all be poppin' the pills
Take the money, save the money for your hospital bills, bitch
They think it's sweet because my skin tone
Little bitch, I been known, people that extend beyond my zipcode
Godby Road, Old National highway
Spelled it out for out-of-towners comin' at me sideways
Old Nat (Old Nat), I can't want for them to get you
Y'all stalkers studied up on me, can't wait for them to test you
Old Nat (Old Nat), I'm unassumin' so you're unprepared

Stop playin' with me, playin' with me

I got bigger when the media twisted the truth

If people like me don't exist, y'all don't have a job
You a bitch, you probably got fucked in the pen
You still a bitch, you just gossip with a pen
Fuck the clickbait, political bitch-made journalists
Most of y’all are pussy, smell like fishbait
I dictate my hours, how 'bout you?
I made four million in four minutes bitch, how 'bout you?
Like a Final Four moment that I'll never forget
I wore a fuckin' T-shirt and then I cut through the net
I win, we'll never meet, you're not rich enough bitch
All your disses don't reach, you're not big enough bitch

Yeah, this whole nation is so shaken by the approach taken
My soul is exposed naked, I’m blatant, I'm so brazen
That's why I'm the most hated, runnin' on low patience
I'm road pavin', screamin' truth until my throat's achin'
No chasin', after shows hoes waitin'
Y'all careers keep failin', study mine, start note takin'
Carvin' my name in the game in bold facin'
Nowadays, a hundred thousand dollars feels like no payment
So jaded, real gold, I used to wear gold-plated
That's when I was located in my come-up broke phases
I'm on a new chapter, turnin' back to those pages
It's hard when you're so famous, I can't be in both places
Jugglin' both stages, the most that I can do is show traces
All I ask for in return is just go where the growth takes us
I propose a toast to those who don't condone fake shit
Game is full of squares, I'm just here to reshape it
Mixin' up my message, stop trying to rephrase it
Listen to the truth, stop trying to translate it
This is coming from a winner, trust me when I say it
You'll never be a main act if you can't maintain it
And to the people threatenin', makin' bold statements
I got people that love the sounds of fists flyin' and bones breakin'
Your green room's just a box, they gon' catch you, no fakin'
They're the kings of fuckin' people up in small enclosed spaces

Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
Somebody gon' end up hurt
Stop playin' with me, playin' with me
I promise I see every word
They want me to shut the fuck up, fuck that

Turn my Nissan into a tour bus

I hope you understand the reason I can't see you anymore
I got a life I gotta live, you got one too, it's time to quit
I cannot fall back into my old ways
This is hard to hear, I know, we had our run but now it's over
We were drunk off arguments and texts but now we're fuckin' sober
This is far from something healthy, I can help you if you help me
We just gotta go our separate ways

I ain't tryin' to hang with you (oh oh oh)
I can tell you dangerous (oh oh oh)

Brooklyn Freestyle,UnKnown,2015.0,"Yeah, c'mon, yeah
Got some shit on my chest
Yeah, alright

I been livin off delusion 'cause I heard it's healthy
Pockets growing, labels talkin'
Hoes been far from stealthy
I'm still slightly flyin' under radars
I practice like it's playoffs
I lay brick a day I'm out here tryna build the Great Wall of yours truly
I need more groupies and less people tryna get a cut
Put your fuckin' hands back in your pockets, man you said enough
Conversation over
Lately I've been celebrating, hardly ever sober
True squad generals, no room for soldiers
I gotta classic debut right here chillin in my holster
My shoulders got the weight of my world on them
And her world and his world and your world on them
I need a Venezuelan or my Afghani chick from DC
To come fuck with my campaign and treat me presidential
Leave the politics at home, strictly Lewinsky
Then it's back to trying to get a buzz like 50
Cup full of whisky just to level out
I only keep kings around me sacramento style
You need to elevate your life, you've been living lateral
Get you a passion put some dream in a catapult
Being broke in America is unnatural
I'm just giving you facts
You start giving ideas
They start giving you cash
You start popping a little
They start giving you daps
You sing a couple fucking hooks and they start giving you ass
But I'm not mad at the slightest, the public praises you for what you practice in private
You've been cordially invited
To my showing out party
Reminds me of LA when we had cases of Bacardi, jars of marijuana
Rooftop was the lobby, too young for that money so the girls got wobbly
They want the whole crew like motley
That was right before 21
I've been fucking the world I'm 'bout to make the money come
Fuck what y'all got
And y'all squares time is up because I watched you let the ball drop
1 too many times
I've been hiding out in Brooklyn
I got too comfortable, I had to re arrange the cushions
Get in touch with my chakras
Pop Pop just died, I feel in love with some vodka
Fell out with the ex, then back in love with some vodka
My half brother Jimmy showed up at the wake
Haven't seen him since '97 what the fuck do I say?
He's got some baby mama issues, shit's been ugly
She's trying to take him down, raising money with Go Fund Me
Damn, on top of that, heroin that took my best friend
He hits me up to blow L's
But I'm just trying to catch M's
Hoes coming out the wood works, they see ya boy building so they trying to get this wood work

And if you tan with an accent, uh, it could work (Haha)

I don't know what month it is

Different states, different countries
Crossing different continents
Self-beliefs my diving board
I'm swimming in accomplishments
Haven't slept since '06
Main focus is stay focused
Santorini wine tasting plus I'm off Amalfi coasting
Took my mom with me because without her there'd be none of this
I think she'd agree, she probably needs a brand new bucket list
Eating off my dreams, I'm my personal chef
Seven women in one night, that's just my personal best
Sent 110 to the family, sent 15 to my homies so I don't feel bad about my chain or my Rollie though
Approach you with assumptions, I promise that you know nothing
My family legs got cut off from my bank account, keeps on jumping
So I, keep on going

They can't follow mine, tryna chase me like a jaw line
Shine like a gold mine so my bottom line grow four times in a week
Got a gold mind and it's go time, I got no time for the weak
This week been show time after show time, still finding my peak
Don't know what day it is, now, don't know what month it is
Trying to hold my girl down, I'm sure I love her more than this
""Now, Bassy why you always missing?""
""Bassy, baby on a mission""
So we gon' love cause haters rampant
Put that cancer on remission
Listen, followed my passion that led me to purpose
Took me so long just to find out my worth
I went from knee deep to beneath the surface, beneath the surface (beneath that)
Living above my lows, I'm living above my lows
The show sell out, but the boy won't
And God got us, these hoes don't
I dropped the hottest shit in '16 and they still sleeping
I'm just finna do that shit again, it's off of everybody head
You ain't gotta give me mine, nah nigga, pay me every fuckin' cent
I'ma let the squad handle all the rest and God gon' handle whatever left

Guess I should've known 'cause I found you outside
The sound advice my mother gives I tend to still ignore
And the reasons that I trusted you I tend to still explore
My self-respect went out the door by fuckin' with you
Life is choices, I ain't make the right one
When I saw you wave your red flag, should've waved my white one
You raised your right thumb, should've left you stranded
You came into my life then left me damaged

Don't disturb my peace (Fuck you) if you're at war with yourself
You could've left me alone, should've left me alone

We're going down, down in an earlier round
Sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down

Yeah, should've known how this would turn out
Yeah, you lit my flames, should've known that it would burn out
We started bickerin' and started flickerin' and now I'm left just livin' in the dark
You broke my heart, damn

Don't disturb my peace if you're at war with yourself
You could've left me alone, should've left me alone

Only job offers is flippin' pussy or marijuana

She just want respect
She just wanna be Aretha

She plays for money on the street now
But she still flippin' keys 'bout every other week now
In between she still at the hotel posted
Cause she a fiend for the money
She gets her fix but feels broken
Cause she knows she's livin' dirty
Knows she gotta clean her life up
Knew she needed grooming
That's the reason why I wifed her
But I had to leave
She got pregnant
Wasn't mine though

Makin' posts, braggin' 'bout some modified shit
In the hopes that it evokes some more Spotify hits
From the impressionable youth, that's followin' you
'Cause you ain't scarin' no one grown, and no one true
This ain't news to anybody in the know, uh
But there's rules, y'all are fuckin' up the code, uh
The only thing y'all would ever shoot is the messenger
A lotta kid's favorite rapper is a wrestler

Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it (yeah)

Lotta rappers are broke, flyin' coach and be postin'
Fake chains from jewelers who just want their promotion
Always showin' twenties with fives and ones
You gotta hundred on each side to disguise the funds
Flip through it, show us the denominations
You should call the IRS and get some payment confirmations
I know your deals 'cause these lawyers talk
You ain't a boss, you got a boss, let your employer talk
Y'all in royalty splits, plus you signed to a guy that just did a JV
Now you signed to a guy, that's signed to a company, and they got gluttony
They 'gon eat and give you what's left, I feel the oven heat
From here, too many cooks in the kitchen, look around
You don't own shit from your masters to your account
Plus y'all don't tour, no TuneCore, your buzz plummetin'
No indie catalog, you gave away your publishin'

Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
Postin' drugs all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' guns all the time, don't fall for it
Postin' money all the time, don't fall for it
Don't fall for it",https://genius.com/Russ-dont-fall-for-it-lyrics
Keep My Wits,ZOO,2018.0,"I keep my wits 'bout me

Especially right now, I got a rich bounty
I can tell that you don't give a shit 'bout me
I keep the same people that's been 'round me

Yeah, a lot changed but I'm still the same old me
I'd still rather make a song than go to KOD
I'm still a boss, I make everybody wait on me
I'm still tellin' mom and dad to put the weight on me, I got it
But according to the haters, they're a cheat code
But if they were rich, then why'd their cars get repo'd?
And fuck the rappers who pretend to be amigos
But want to see me finito like Pacino and Carlito
Plus these women want exploitable dick
I can't let the pussy drive me off avoidable cliffs
I've been there, done that, got the t-shirt and burned it
I studied for this shit, I did my research and learned it
Everything I'm getting right now, I deserve it
Everything that's bottled up is coming to the surface
I can look and see that the world is malnourished
They're hungry for some real shit, and bitch I'm about to serve it

Yeah, every week when the stats come in
All these basement recordings turned to plaques and Ms
I had to devise a plan first and get higher standards
I like wire transfers and Cheshire dancers, yeah
Gettin' on was hard, stayin' on is strenuous
Paranoid, I'm thinkin' everybody's disingenuous
Shots from the outside keep gettin' sent to us
We don't give a fuck about cliquein' up, y'all ain't friends to us
This is not pretend to us, this is non-fiction
I been makin' beats since y'all were bumpin' Sean Kingston
Never gave a fuck about my high school test score
Just bought a mansion and my high school's next door
Wave to the principal, wave to the teachers
I ran on the field, haters stayed in the bleachers
Now my show's louder than the football game
I'm goin' apeshit, I'm on my Jane Goodall wave

I keep my wits 'bout me

I keep the same people that's been 'round me

I'm tryna clear my head more, I know that I don't sleep enough
I should call my dad more, I know that we don't speak enough
Adjustin' to the fame, sometimes he's not discreet enough
I'm tryna run the game, I hope me will be enough
But fuck y'all, most of y'all talkin' ain't got the balls to do what I do
Don't worry about me, all my homies wanna fight you
Power's omnipresent, I'm the stranger right beside you
The universe sees everything, trust me, it'll find you
Path to the billions is the road that I'm walkin' on
Rappers playin' dress-up, the game looks like Comic-Con
Y'all ain't sayin' shit, na-na-na, na-na-na
I'm Badu with the hits, on and on, on and on
Bet your girl's car got Russ in the system
You don't feel yourself unless there's drugs in your system
I'ma be 80 makin' hits, I'm not lyin'
I see a lot of people get rich and stop tryin'

Hoping you don't pull it

But fuck that shit
Cause you lost out, I'm winning
Fuck you doing?
I got hits that deserve to be heard where the Knicks play
Like Patrick Ewing

You were getting too heavy
And I'm already holding the world
And I'm the one and I'm feeling too ready

Yeah, idols popping off my walls
It's feeling like it's 3D

Unless you're only checkin' up on me for a check

Yeah
I'm a public figure, so my privacy is compromised
It's like both of them are tryna harmonize
But one is always louder than the other
I don't think I know somebody prouder than my mother
So I gotta stay strong for me and her both
Took a couple losses, wish it hurt me the most, but it didn't
If you ask me what's wrong, I don't speak right
In the past week alone, watched her grieve twice
Two souls buried, so I try to come around more
Every day, weed and white wine around four
I ain't really trippin' though, I know she's a soldier
I hope that the pain gets light as Sammy Sosa
Grammy woke up yesterday as a widow, that's your parents
You're strong, but you're still just a human, that's apparent
And I'm scared of the potential of you spiralin' down
I was cryin' yesterday, but I ain't cryin' right now, yeah

Unless you're only checkin' up on me for a check

Yeah, given this grim situation
I'm tryna be the sun amongst this precipitation
Flippin' patience into people who hated
That send me DMs that say, ""I knew you would make it""
I'll take it, given the alternative, I always said the truth
They got mad how I worded it, too bad (Haha)
They tried to vilify me
But that ain't stop these millions that be chillin' by me
Get a M & B like Joel
Since 2016, I managed two commas so well
Odell Beckham, how I'm stretchin' for my goal post
I was too open and let some hoes close
I got real-life problems, I don't care about tweets
Or the guilt and the bitterness that makes you not sleep
Oh well, bitch, I'm not entertaining drama
I'm focused on my mama and alleviatin' trauma, for real

Cried so much (Woah)

New world traveler
New home is the airplane

Still got a German chick blessin' me, Gesundheit
Still wanna know ya fuckin' future, show me what ya friends like

Mama wants to go out break bread

She don't want no part of that, told her it's a part of this
Almost has a heart attack every time I acknowledge it
Told her that I'm sorry, it's just how it goes
But even if they take me out this life, they can't take me out this soul
I could never fold, I'ma go harder than ever
I'ma make it through the pain, I'ma weather the weather
Go to Bali just because, buy Ferraris just because
Blow a hundred, leave a fuckin' Maserati in the club
Just because I'm alive, I'ma own it
Memories are just the times we recognized the moment
So I'ma take the jet to Vegas, put my family on it
Appreciate the people that you got while you can hold 'em
It ain't about your lay up log or your designer
We shouldn't need no wake up call, fuck a reminder (Yeah)

Sometimes something happens and you hope that it's just one time
At least your foot is on the gas, you know it's crunch time
I think we'll always feel like we don't have enough time
So, foot on the gas (On the gas)
On my mama, swear to God I'ma ball
Keep my foot on the gas (Gas)

Mix Henny with the juice, leave my life in the booth
Point blank with the truth, that's me
Love yourself, make a move, to yourself, you should prove
Fuck the rest, let 'em snooze, let 'em sleep

And live life to the fullest
Try not to let it end with a knife or a bullet

Somebody who needs you would truly be hurt

What you fussin' about? Complainin' changes nada
I know I'm not your father but you gotta try harder, 'cause

Sometimes something happens and you hope that it's just one time
At least your foot is on the gas, you know it's crunch time

Standin' on the mantelpiece
Watch it turn into a stage

Right up on the beach

Cause I got your latest album
That shit sound like shit to me
Diemon makin' history
Check you're local TV Channel
Or the radio, DJ Haven got me in Seattle
See the truth inside of you
Found it right inside of me
When you hit that yellow light
Hit the gas like it's the green
Get the cash and buy a dream
For my family, fuck receipts
Do it for the nine year old inside of me who's tryin' me
Promise I'mma make you proud, promise you inspire me
Promise if I let you down, I promise Imma' fire me

Why You Fuckin Up So Much?,Color Blind,2013.0,"Why you fuckin' up so much?
I really don't know
Tell me when enough is enough
Should I leave or should I go?

Get your money
I'm not mad at it
I mean I am
But I got a good girl with bad habits
Or maybe just a bad girl with good features
I'll get you outta your nightmare
You fell in love with a dreamer
Who is all up in your speaker
Tellin you that good shit
I'm gonna rev your engine even though you wanted hood shit
I see you got the kush lit
But I gave up on us
Like you gave up on your future until I reintroduce hope in it
Never floating in your hotel rooms
You want to blow L's soon
I could make you my wifey but I'm not well groomed
Is this pot well brewed, is it hot enough for it?
I give you the world, is it not enough for you?

Why you fuckin' up so much?
I really don't know
Tell me when enough is enough
Should I leave or should I go?

Prostitutes and dudes who want to fuck make up your circle
You hurt people that love you and love people that hurt you
I'm here lending out my hand asking you to hold on
But you get high with these lowlifes and tell me ""Baby hold on""
That's why i've got my coat on, metaphorically speaking
Energy so cold its got me, metaphorically freezing
There's more to me than beats and making thoughts rhyme
I'm a real human being, don't waste my motherfucking time
Cause you probably at the club right now, with some hoes and some dudes that want to fuck that will get you drunk and take you home
Just waiting for you to slip up, until then go split blunts
But the thing about splitting your legs not the blunts
Step your shit up
You're dealing with a different breed
I'm at the top of the animal kingdom
Peek the symptoms of my pedigree
You kick it with the bottom feed
I'm tryna save you
But this rescue mission is draining, first I love you then I hate you
But wait ya its just me talking shit right?
Don't you want to get your shit right?
Oh you do but you're just stubborn?
Ok that's cool then fucking sit tight
And get real, real, real, real comfortable
Cause that will give me a real, real, real reason not to fuck with you
Shall I continue or did you get the message yet?
Smart girl living a dumb life
Just blaming she's intelligent
The fuck?

Why you fuckin' up so much?

Should I leave or should I go?

DiMaggio,UnKnown,2016.0,"Tours overseas
Couple million on the table
By the time I'm 24 I'll be sellin out staples
I got big plans
Sing and rap
I can switch hands
Crossover killer
Labels know that I'm the hitman
Women all on me
Tryna give me sex favors
Take your clothes off you're a starter not a bench player
Then I gotta go
I won't say I'm heartless
But after dating hoes
I began to use my heart less
Had to pump the brakes
Cuz my drive got GPS
Sometimes I feel like the only real genius left
I'm tryna hit the blunt with Snoop on GGN
Even my blind hoe say she wanna see me win
Even my ex girl got my old CD in
Rotation you gon' wish you didn't leave me when
I go and cop a little mazzi maybe cut the roof off
Cuz I'm all about the drop like EDM
I got my first arena show
I'm on the flight there now
I use to dream about the life that I'm livin right now
Makin money in abundance
Cuz I do so much for free
I don't work for the money
I make the money work for me
But the family going through it
That's a lotta my stress
Momma asking where's my iTunes and Spotify checks
It's funny cuz she use to ask when I was going back to classes
Now I'm paying off her debts off of melodies and raps
It's fun takin south beach trips every month
Spend a mortgage on my sister by the time we eat lunch
Just to let her know no matter what her big bro got her
No dudes can trick on her
No Harlem globetrotters
Entry into my circle is more selective than a Rhodes scholar
Ship is sailing already so don't bother
But I do business
So if it makes sense
We can talk change
Just play your role and do it well just be like John Wayne
I'm Tom Hanks except I always remain captain
In Atlanta I don't dance but I always remain snappin
Cash in quantity
In less than a year I dropped your favorite rappers entire discography
I did every single beat
I mixed every single song
Walked in as the opener
But turned it to sing a long
Rapping on my beats got it sounding like a gospel
I take my hotel rooms and turn em to a brothel
Women in rotation
Made it out the basement
Bank account lookin like a fucking donation
No amazement
I been patient
I've been cookin for so long I swear that I can taste it
This is laced with (yeah)

My streak is impossible to break
Dropping hits everytime I hit the plate

I'm detached from anything y'all attached too
I'm in and out with my groupies like fast food

I sell out shows quick enough to always add two
I laugh too cause some promoters are slackin'

Meaning you can sleep but we got that covered
You blew up in the spring and you were gone that summer
Money at my feet, life's a cake walk
They love me out in Asia you would think I made K-Pop
Too many J Kwon's, not enough Raekwon's

I swear the last few months have been the best few months
I can't wait to see what happens in the next few months
And I can tell you only come around when success does

Here I Am,UnKnown,2015.0,"Ok, laid back contemplating chess moves
Life heating up I just need someone to vent to
Cup full of stress so I'm sippin' like the rents due
Dialing the number for my visions hope I get through
Ten two seaters in the driveway
Chains on everybody
Welcome to the Ice Age
Murdering the moment makes me money
I guess crime pays
You probably have to leave your state
To change your mind state
Blind dates with my journey
Everyday I wake up
Runnin through these hoes
Never tripping keep it laced up
Cause all of them got cardboard signs
Saying save us
But after the last one
I chose to hang the cape up
Focused on myself
Ain't no time for distractions
Sometimes I can't believe it all
Like how'd the hell this happen
Gotta' keep it moving though
Ain't no time to look around
Jab you with the raps
Then knock you out when I bring the hook around
Now bring the hook around

Everybody here I am
Everybody here I am
Tanqueray cups got me woozy
Posted up lookin for some floozies
Devils get up off me like Boosie
Imma' always keep my first hoopty

Imma' pro juggler
Lately my life's a circus
I spent about 10k on purses
And every cent was worth it
Once I saw her eyes light up
It's me myself and I
Who the fuck wanna' fight us
Dreams overlapping now
Lines keep blurring
Drunk off my accomplishments
I keep slurring
And nowadays my contact list
Is stocked with enough weapons
That I'm pointing at the game
Like bomb that shit
Saddam that shit
And bring me back the loot
Hit the dealership
Go head and bring me back a coupe
I ain't got no time to hang
These hoes are looking like a noose
And I ain't got no time for exes, let alone an excuse

Everybody here I am
Everybody here I am
Tanqueray cups got me woozy
Posted up lookin for some floozies
Devils get up off me like Boosie
Imma' always keep my first hoopty

This ain't the best you
You've been so wrong since I met you
How'd it get so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong since I met you

You came into a fixed world, in a broken home
You lack guidance, so you feeling so alone
Cause out the womb you had no room to excel
Feeling like a demon seed so what's next, hell
Or better yet jail
And it's hard when its predetermined that you shouldn't prevail
So you throw on some 2Pac
Light a pair of L's
Crack a pair of bottles until you just parasail
Away from the truth, straight towards the lies
Go on hang a noose on yo life 'till you die
That's what you doing

How'd it go so wrong

You've been so wrong since I met you
How'd it get so wrong

I opened opportunity you should have opened the door
And once I drew the line
I had you askin' who am I?
Yeah, I got the password
Y'all frontin' like this world ain't fucking backwards
These rappers need their daddies
Hoes need their daddies
That's why they mix and mingle and get along
But y'all can pass me with that bullshit
You tryin' to fill this void inside a bottle
This void inside a blunt
This void inside a model
But your daddy's what you want
But you looking in the wrong place
And y'all idolizing lives
So y'all looking in the wrong face
And y'all do it all the time

Hindering yourself because your disposition, make a way

I'm the scientist
Twistin' up this potent for the stress
I'm depriving it
Really nothing serious
The theory is the sky's in it

Yeah, I make a beat and take a shot, and then I zone out
Lookin' at my feet taking off on their own route
Hip-hop is a grapevine, bunch of starvin' Marvins
Arguing 'bout Earth when it's really 'bout the martians
With DIEMON on they chest, lions in the flesh
Eyein' every prize in the skies of a test
I'ma pass it, wake up in the studio
The classics that I made last night
After late night flights
I'm a shark chasing minnow's, but I save my bite
For the big fish, you small times, I'm talking big shit
I'm tryin' to make 100 million when I'm 25
Not when I'm 25 or by the time I'm 25
I'm drivin' in a Ghost
Every day is Halloween
Lighting up my smoke
Probably blazin' Charlie Sheen

Liquor in my cup, so my mind's playin' tricks, hey
Girls are gettin' frisky
I don't have the time but
If you make those hips sway
I'll promise you'll be mine
Little Dominican dime with an attitude
Come up to my altitude

It's kinda funny watching you you and you doubt me
I'm going where I'm going
Ain't nobody stopping that
Shooting for the stars
This is barely me cocking back
I put in work what you think they're cheering russ for
Taking short cuts could have your whole career cut short
One more month or
Definitely by spring
Imma be a millionaire
Turnin thoughts into things
Couple thots couple tings
Doesn't matter I'm the tin man
Nothing frees the pain like some tanqueray gin can
And I hope you playin chess and not checkers
I know that's your best
I hope you know you need to do better
I hope you see the scarlet letter on your wifeys sweater
She acted single when she was with me she let me do whatever
But fuck the love and affection
I got this buzz that I'm building
I just want plugs and connections
I swear I'm drunk off the feeling
Of being me
Ain't nobody bout to sober me up
Understand me everybody's looked over me once
I gotta chip on my shoulder
I got this voice that's inside me
That's yellin ain't nobody colder
Dare somebody to try me
I'm comin thru with that real shit
Popping without a deal shit
I play against myself
I'm on some steel sharpens steel shit
Cuz ain't no competition
Only my potential
I don't even have to rap
I could be rich off instrumentals
Making other people stars
But I figured I should shine too
The games got her legs open
I figured I should slide thru
Now people round the world confirming all my prophecies
Name your favorite rapper I got double their discography
So add an apostrophe to anything you offer me
You need me I don't need you so just watch how you talk to me
It's comedy watchin how the game goes
Industry plants use steroids
So as far as hall of fame goes
You got an asterik
And ain't no getting past it
We all rapped to get here you were just wrapped up in plastic
And shoved down the masses gullet
I see your card imma pull it
We don't believe you
You need real people
It's all good tho I'm off it
Cliq full of young prophets
Like we all go by Muhammed
Its amazing what can happen when you
Follow your instincts
So in sync with myself
They gon give ya boy bands
Like NYSNC
I want wealth
I want Grammys
I want 100 foreign girls in just panties
I want you to stop being so scared to be you
I want all your dreams to turn into reality too
It could happen if you want it
Cuz dreams deferred turn into nightmares
And I don't think you wanna be haunted
I gotta lot to accomplish
Further than mmmmm boppin
No disrespect to hanson
But longevitys my anthem
Faith is my companion
My doubt got abandoned
My devil stills dancin
In a house in the Hamptons
Momma still waitin on her beach front mansion
And she still mad at dad cuz the money's been random
It's been tighter than the tension in this room
Coldest summer in a while and the winters comin soon
But don't worry I'm gonna make the snow melt
The prize will be peace like a Nobel
Imma be on covers with one hand on my balls like I'm Odell
I never let nobody ride my coat tails
Living outta duffle bags
ITunes checks lotta hotels
Only time I lose is when I blow L's
Go tell whoever got the game on lock
That I got the key
Man my train don't stop
I gonna be
Here for forever

Me and Bugus got plans to sell out Abuja

From the sound, we won like singles
Out of town, run wild like gringos

Are a bunch of fucking failed musicians talkin' shit to spite us
But secretly they like us
So dont stick out your hand to me
Get back to your 9-5 and your class and watch me live your fuckin fantasy

Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind
Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind

Yeah, my ex chick was a handful
Had to cut her off cuz i already got my hands full
Hate to break it to you, but your shows been canceled
Russ taking over every channel
Ran through some latinas in my area
Just to clear my head real quick
'Bout to fly to Paris on a jet real quick
We use to study Latin, me and Bugus
Now we study actualizing dreams into cash and
Makin' shit happen, what's up?

Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind
Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind

I treat this world like a canvas
My mind is the paint brush
Fuck you and him and her
Yall motherfuckers ain't Russ
Can't touch the young god, feelin' like a OG
Might as well hit the blunt, now where the fucks the OE?
Follow closely to the only motherfucker keepin' it so me
Authentic, short term
Beach house for my mom
Long driveway, cars in it
Superstar vision, while cigars spinnin'
I'ma Phoenix how I walk in it
Recognized the fire embraced it then I walked in it
Rebirth when i walked through it
Sinatra smooth with a Pac vision
Pop vocals, rock livin', got caught slippin
By the police had to ditch that bitch, God hittin' my phone
Devil pullin' up at my spot
Every once in a while they switch positions
Just to flip flop on me
I could turn a paddle boat into a yacht, homie
Only real ones let on board you better know me
I'm the gilligan, feelin' like I'm bouta cash out
Hair down, middle fingers up with my ass out
My mind is the traphouse
Man, this bitch is bunkin'
I'ma full time magician, turnin' nothing into something
Tell me what the fuck is up

Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind
Y'all needa get up and get out now
Do something with all of your time
Hope you recognize who you are and what you could do
Hope that you're not lost in your mind",https://genius.com/Russ-paris-lyrics
Connected,Silence,2014.0,"Ooh
I hope you feel what I'm
I hope you feel what I'm saying

Yeah
Connected to the infinite
Hope you feel the same way
Don't let the lies blind you and misguide you
Find the gateway
To the truth
I found my portal in this booth
I'm moving with the universe
Hope the world follows suit
'Cause it's less about diamonds, more about hearts
Less about bein' in the clubs, and drinkin' Spades to play the part
The flame I spark is from the embers
Of the truth we all belong to
The truth we all came from
That'll be here when we're gone too
Watching from a distance like a hawk
I see the prisons
That men and women build inside their mind and choose to live in
Or rather die in
'Cause that's not living if you ask me
Misery loves company, and it's happy just to latchkey
Child who learned, to be alone and fell in love with it
Unspoken agreement with the soul
Don't break the covenant
I'm glad you see the surface but what matters is what's under it
But don't get too attached because that path just leads to sufferin'
When you start stumblin'
Don't grab a liquor bottle and start guzzlin'
Try to chase your hate away and replace it with your love of gin
Till it's 1 AM and you've been gone
And you looking for the answer
But don't wanna answer
When the answer's been calling
I said the answer's been calling you
I hope you pick up
Ooh I hope you pick up
I hope you feel connected
I hope you feel",https://genius.com/Russ-connected-lyrics

Ride around town in a hoopty (Uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (Uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (Uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92
With a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we have memories, now we also got this song, yeah

Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know it's been a while but I'm still me
But honestly it's been so long
That I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
There's a gap now
Big enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moves so fast now, damn
I miss things going slower, I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing
But I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life, I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to improve my appreciation
I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded, for real

It's been way too long since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Ridin' 'round the town and stayin' out, don't wanna say goodbye

Davidson,UnKnown,2016.0,"Yuh
I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
You livin' your fears
I'm livin' my dreams
I was just seventeen
Focused on my game around fiveish
Damn time flies but I don't mind 'cause I'm the pilot
Definitely had turbulence
Week long molly binge
Luckily that got old quicker than the floppy disk
And I ain't gonna lie, I fell for girls that I shouldn't have
But if I didn't date a hoe and get arrested
That's a classic rap song with a couple million views that I wouldn't have
Lookin' back with zero regrets
But no more superhero S on my chest
My ego thought it was bulletproof
Till she shot through the vest
But it was all for the best
I had to leave who I was
To become who I am
Movin' militant
I just had to switch up the camp
Stayin' diligent
They might say they'll get around to it
But if my ship doesn't come I'll just swim out to it
I wanna talk to Pop Pop
Wish I had the power
I wish heaven implemented visiting hours
But here I am
Just tryna do my best
In a game where people win
'Cause they buyin' off the refs
All these people wanna fuck with me
Half of me is flattered
But the other half remembers last year I didn't matter
How convenient for you
You get to swoop in
And make bank off something I've been groomin'
For nothing less than 10 years, pursuin'
Childhood fantasies like Mike Jackson
Believed in myself that's when real life happened
Goliath is looking more and more like David these days
And depending on who you ask I'm gettin' famous these days
I got this mapped out
Go ahead and ask 'bout
The one that makes the whole industry ask how
This is easy and I'm only gettin better

I dropped outta college still bringing the majors in

But enough is gonna save you

I'm trying to get to the bottom of this bottle
Like I'm looking for something
Hollow people all around
I think they're looking for someone
Or something to give them love and fill them up
But I met a couple people and thought
Is love still enough? Fuck it
Hate harbors in their heart like an anchor
Bad shit is the captain of their ship
They're just the sailor

Society sucking the substance out of their soul
They don't want to be themselves
'Cause they don't know themselves
The mold, and whatever role, it's how they associate
And how they assimilate
To the bullshit they try and penetrate

You tell me that you're real
But you've been a fake
No parental guidance, so you looking up to Kim and 'Ye
Eating up what the tv shows you on your dinner plate
Ignorance with a side of intellect, we try to integrate
Welcome to America, home of whatever's in your face
Land of the slaves
Paralyzed by product
Power mixed with persistence can be poison if you don't watch it
And know when its time to pause it, stop it

So I'm gon' stay loose
Sippin' on some Grey Goose
Trynna run the game without the chains or the bape shoes

Marry it, carry it, ride on the chariot
Grow old, blow smoke, die when I bury it
But I just hope that I can handle all the lime light
I can set my clock but, God's got the time right
Nothing else left but I'm blessed 'cause my mind's right
One man's test is the same man's hindsight
One damn check makes a motherfucker shine twice
One plan left 'till I'm next so I grind like;
Three blind mice trynna find  a piece of cheese
Rewind nights tryna find the key to dreams
Speak my mind 'cause I'm keepin' alive
'Cause I read fine lines just to breathe, breathe

I wasn't born in the A but I'm scorched in the aye

Tryna use my fingers make the world in my hands
I was young and I'm still am, but I'm getting older
Money on my mind and my music's on my shoulder
Pain on my heart and it's only getting colder
Play the game, do my part, then I end up with the floater
Would've told you if I knew you Atlanta Brave girl
Burning doja in the booth, that Atlanta grape earl
Singing ""Shoutout to my ex's, hello to the future""
Bring around some blessings that my past is not used to
I'ma be the one, never two, never three
Trynna better what I've done and improve what I see
I'ma measure what I've won by the roofs that I breach
I'ma tread you with some drums and the proofs of my beats

I'm coming through, Imma' scoop you
Come and see the crib, I got views like YouTube
Someone tell everything in sight I might wreck 'em
When I'm on that ass, women bend it like Beckham
Travel the globe everywhere, I light reefer
Man I kick it all around the world like FIFA
Block from Alonso, coming in like ya' rent late
Knock from the Congo, coming in like dikembe
Want my autograph? Imma' sign it by ya' bosom
Grams likes eggs, bitch we buy them by the dozen
Cousins know Imma' get dough
Imma' jack ass
Im an asshole
I been a fat ass
I been overweight
Now I'm over priced
Shows been over payed
Flights been overnight
I'm overseas, blowing trees

Lately my next calls been better than my last ones
Wondering what it's like when the cash comes
Like what will I be driving when I pass them
And what are their excuses when I ask them
But fuck that, shots up, me and Boog
When were on, bulletproof all the vehicles
Strapped up and paranoid, that's how the bus looks
Self belief and passion, that's how Russ looks
I tried to expose all my ex hoes, to the other side
But they ain't got shit on my mother, I'm
A real one, you can't fool me
Groupies are bloopers, I'm tryna' wife a movie
Building up my team, I gotta' lawyer if you sue me
Connects in the hood, on call if you shoot me
I'm living through my truth
You just out here living through me
If I fly your girl coach and she giving up the coochie
Real player shit, come on

All I really know I was stoned like medusa
Next thing I know I was blown like a tuba
Gotta' let her know that it's time to catch an uber
Girl you gotta' go hit the road, real player shit",https://genius.com/Russ-real-player-shit-lyrics

Tell you how to do it
I tell you how to do it
Yuh

Ok, your boy's a frequent flyer now
Gettin' a little bit of money
So I might be looking flyer now
Quite down, Russ is talkin'
I mean Russ is chompin'
You catch fleas when you lay with bitches
Way to often
I just dog 'em
Keep it movin'
Flippin' thoughts into fruition
I just sold out shows in Europe
With no label, no booking agent
No manager, no publicist
Just me, myself, and all my visions
And self belief and passion
And a little persistence
I know some people
That know some people
That can get you fucked up
If you don't keep your distance
So homie keep your distance
I got my kin wit' me, kinkle me
Pretty bitches that sing for me
Alley-oop me the coochie
And then I'm dunkin' like Timothy
Aahhh

Niggas ain't gettin' no money
Niggas ain't gettin' no dough
Wouldn't know when I'm countin' my money
Wouldn't know if a nigga went broke

When I cop a mansion
I cop a gun for every room
Cause I know niggas campin'
And you won't catch me lampin'
Whole crew on some Ugo
Boss up
Say what?
Talk up
Birds tend to flock when I walk up
Here's my toast
I'm tryna' get bread
Get a loaf
For my squad divvy up
That's the pledge of allegiance
Unspoken agreements
If you ain't in tune, you won't peep it
Mufasa, mufasa, mufasa
All y'all sheep skin, gettin' eaten
Prayin' to Jesus, hopin' that he saves y'all
Y'all better save yourselves mutha' fukkas

Niggas ain't gettin' no money
Niggas ain't gettin' no dough
Wouldn't know when I'm countin' my money

Flex (Freestyle),Funk Flex Freestyles,2017.0,"I've handed out two hundred thousand dollars
To my family and my friends
Don't tell me I don't care
I put in work, free time is rare
I know my worth, my food is shared
If you saw dirt, then you'll be there
To see the perks of millionaires
I distribute inspiration for the low
I treat you how you treat yourself, you just a ho
I took a break from you I'm seeing shit clearly now
Bitch I'm me, I can never let you near me now
I'm in Europe with my family crossing country like a track star
My wallet is a Travelex with a black card
I been doin' this, I been true to this
I been producing my career and Bugus'
I remember when my life wasn't like this
But I always saw this all coming, bitch I'm psychic
I remember always dropping beats and gettin' 10 plays
10 year flashbacks are feeling like 10 days
Damn, my numbers raised quick
They used to treat me like a little what-his-name and shit
I can't fuck the same chick for too long, I need options
Unless she put a spell on me like Emma Watson
I'm out in Auckland fucking with the kiwis
I got a barber in New York call him Tiki
I got a couple bitches down by Peachtree
Tell 'em read the writing on the wall like graffiti
I be sellin' out two in the same night
I came a long way, I used to have stage fright
That was back when me and Bu' was doin' college shows
Up in UGA gettin' paid next to nada though
Six deep in the Volvo or the Avalon
We was smokin' cookie but we do not fuck with Tagalongs
Everybody pulls their weight in the huddle
Bitches thinkin' they're unique
Because they save my name as Russell, whoa
You didn't want me 'til I got poppin'
Which means you probably wouldn't want me if I stop poppin'
Gettin' mailbox money, like assists from John Stockton
Gotta dream,  like assist from John 
Travel non-stop and it's city, new city
Same day-one's ain't got no one new with me, uh
Couple new women I been adding to the roster
Couple new digits they been adding to the offers
Rap's new father got a few more kids
Broke rappers you should learn what a Tunecore is
I got a catalog that's more vast than the ocean
I'm good everywhere, I got a pass like I'm open
I'm grabbing the Golden Globe for the road
And I'm playing in my movie that I filmed myself
If your girl feels me it's 'cause I feel myself
If I woke up as you, I would kill myself (Laughs)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Less rushin' more trustin' in the process
I'm screaming out ""Less pussy, more progress""
You should talk less and do more homie
You were hot and now you real lukewarm homie
These are new times, you can see my 2 eyes
And tell that I was born to be different, I'm in Dubai
And I'm like 16 deep, that's what you get
When you paint 16's over 16 beats for like 16 weeks
In a row, times 6
That's like 96 songs
If you don't know my shit
I'ma question if you even follow hip hop
You probably follow magazines and what they think's hot
Dick-riders, politicians in plain clothes
Everyone in rap use the same beat and same flow
Uh, you're asleep, but your city's awake
""Hate It or Love it"" is what I'm bumpin', makin' 50 a state
Plus the buzz gettin' bigger than 50 estate
Private jet coast to coast cost me 50 a way, whoa
Haters lookin' for some validation
I know you mad 'cause my life is your imagination
What's that?
Women in bundles every city that I move through
I bring in more money for your city than you do
The money's cool but the life is more glorious
I came in clutch for my family, Robert Horry shit
I hope the people take the time to read my story
It's a real page turner
Bob Seger I need 40 hits before I turn 30, uh
That's a goal of mine
A 2 hour sing along, damn, that's a show of mine
I know the grind, I know myself, that's why you know me, uh
I got it jumpin' in Australia like a joey, uh
Just havin' talent ain't enough to succeed
'Cause self-belief beats talent when talent doesn't believe
That's how I did it, that's my advice if I had to give it
This is confidence, consistency and intrinsic
Motivation to be great, one-uppin' myself
No one made me a plate, I made somethin' myself
Man I fuck with myself, I don't give a fuck what you think, uh
I'm the one, I don't do the number two thing
Or three thing or four thing
Everything I say is newsworthy keep reporting
Everything I wear is camera worthy keep recording
I don't chase money, I am not JP Morgan
Flex I'm up here, it's really really important
Haha

Ridin' round with all these bands like a tour bus
I'm pullin' in a couple million every four months
People want to see you get, 'til you get it
Then you talk 'bout how you got it, then the same ones get offended
Make your mind up, are you a hater or supporter?
You either love to see my shine or you don't, no kinda sorta
My employee is myself, this is boss talk
They hang my pictures 'round the city, like a lost dog
I'm in the UAE, fuck currency exchange, I got USD
I make your bitch tapout like UFC
Muhfucker I'm the plug like USB
I keep a couple Trojans on me like USC
I'm way bigger than my body like a 2X tee
And I don't text you first, bitch you text me
I am not the one for you to try and U-S-E
I'm Jordan before the bullshit like UNC
Bringing hits from Atlanta like ""who's Greg Street?""
Half a billion spins later, I'm the new Greg Street, whoa
We 'gon let it lie

I'm doing everything I told you I would
Fuck you if you didn't believe until I showed you I could
'Cause now it's too late, everyday I'm in a new state
The boss is supposed to eat, who cares
Show me what your crew makes 'cause
Milan just put some diamonds in his Presi' though
I wanted this at seventeen but wasn't ready though
Shout out the universe for knowing more than I do, uh
Shout out the moms who were hoein' back in high school
That's condescending in case you didn't catch the tone, uh
Passin' tests, yes, I'm weaving past the cones
Watch me parallel park in the top spot
Before I popped, all the ladies been gaga
This ain't the peak but I'm proud I made it this high up
Went platinum with no samples, just synthesizers
And some drums too, I'm the one-two
I'm the reason that your boyfriend rocks a bun too
And there go sauce, let me drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Got an album will it hit, hit, hit, hit, hit
Little sauce, let me drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Got an album full of hit, hit, let me tell you somethin', uh
They love you more when you coming up
The strugg- I'm done hahaha

Platinum before the album, I predicted this
A lot of money, I provisioned it",https://genius.com/Russ-flex-freestyle-lyrics
I Think My Girl Caught a Body,Color Blind,2013.0,"Life is a gamble, a risk from day to day
As to which direction your mind will take, is only for you to say
Is time too short to stop and help your fellow brotherman?
People be strong, to love is not wrong
Help us take a stand

Yeah
You had a fucked up childhood
Didn't get the love that a child should
Now you tryna' find the good
You got a couple of bottles and a pile of kush
That you wanna' run away with
Everyday is the same shit
Daddy beat you, left you faced with
Dealing with dudes giving you facelifts
And a pistol that doesn't have patience
Especially when your friend ask, oh shit
Let it soak in so much emotion
Bullet's scrape you and you barely even notice
'Cause you gon' find out where they live any moment
So you get in the car feelin' fucked up
Gun in your lap like, what what?
Pull up to the house, see the lights on
And the brass sound off like trumpets
Fuck it, you don't even know if you caught one

I think my girl caught a body
I think my girl caught a body
I think my girl caught a body
Ohh

You don't know how to be a woman
Haven't seen your mom in two years
When she was here you ignored her
Now you shed a few tears
Swear to God you killin' yourself
Yeah, guilt trip is your hobby
Girl, you hardly speaking
Me, I'm speaking softly
Tell me that it's not me
I tell you that it's all you
That's why my homie called me
To tell me that he saw you halfway naked
In a bathing suit with a lame ass dude
Looking like you on vacation
Looking halfway wasted I can't take it
Swear to God you killin' yourself

I think my girl caught a body
I think my girl caught a body
I think my girl caught a body

Space,Apollo 13,2012.0,"And this that west coast, best smoke
Ride around and blaze shit
Dancing on the moon
As soon as I walk out my space ship
I make this
Music for myself
So fuck the fakeness
Either you gon' feel it
Cause you're real or you're gon' hate this
And my statement is my movement
I take it while you lose it
Facilitating dreams in between being a student
And the shepard
Converted she put every single record
And my good is always better than your best
So fuck your efforts
I'm a young gun
Gunnin' for your spot motherfucker
I'm the unsung, drumming at the top motherfucker
'til i die still I rise above the evils
Out in California steady lighting up the cheesel
Reminiscing chains on the veins in the people
Tryna end the pain in a world full of needles
Temptation runs deep when the truth acts feeble
And these beats are my canvas and my mind is the easel motherfucker

This can't be real this feeling that i feel, yeah
But don't you want it? don't you wanna have it?
Hanging in your face now you finally got to grab it
But i'm just me so how did i get this far? yeah
But don't i want it? don't i wanna have it?
Hanging in my face now i finally got to grab it

Flight light, brights lights on the runway
Rap dream, cash fiend
Life on the one way
I sneak around with the devil every sunday
Wrestle in the sheets as the beats freak to fungswae
We let the sun raise
Energize the power
Pass a couple blunts then we fuck inside the shower
'til it's time to go
I left my mind at home
I swear the world is always dressed up in designer clothes
But I'ma be a billionaire
Yeah you can quote that
I'm about to blow off my lines call it coke-rap
I make the best beats, but everybody knows that
And I find my way without directions or a road map
So tell me where the hoes at
I feel like acting reckless
I’m feeding dick to Tiffany, her man is eating breakfast
We floatin' in that deep blues
See if something precious
And she's trying on her necklace made of diamonds and resentment
God damn...

This can't be real this feeling that i feel, yeah
But don't you want it? don't you wanna have it?
Hanging in your face now you finally got to grab it
But i'm just me so how did i get this far? yeah
But don't i want it? don't i wanna have it?
Hanging in my face now i finally got to grab it

Yeah, okay my name stayed the same
But these girls can't refrain
From changing the way they call it
I'ma walk it like I talk it
'til the show's over
I'm a fucking alcoholic
'til the shows is over
And then I'm leavin' in a bucket
But i push it like a Benz
Cause I'm breathing so let's fuck it
'til i get some mo ins
I'ma make a couple hits
Then i hit the dealership
Black car, yellow seats
Ridin' like a Steeler bitch
I feel the itch to renovate my life
Separate the past with the glass full of life
I might be living wrong
But it feels so right
I'm a ticking time bomb
And i'm blowing up tonight
Cause trust me, I've been patient
6 years in the making
Beats everyday since 9th grade in the basement
Got me jaded to my own shit
So I'm just faded tryin' to own shit
Groupies needed two of me
But i don't have a clone, bitch

This can't be real this feeling that i feel, yeah
But don't you want it? don't you wanna have it?
Hanging in your face now you finally got to grab it

In the bleachers with the nuns

Kissin' on the rum hope my levi fuckin' hoes up
Funds will make you blow up
Laugh because it's possible
My optical illusions as a student was an obstacle
Had to break the fuck out
Dropped an armored truck now
Fuck your corny teens
Those were only fiends
We're more like drug routes
Guess we got the plug now
Diamonds got the dope bitch
In it for the bread so your music always loaves bitch
Faith in my own shit
Took me out to Jupiter
Feelin' like I'm God know for size tellin' Lucifer my dreams
And I drew the first scheme a long time ago
Apeshit make-shift the basement chronicles
Chronologically a part of me the futures optimal
Overdosed on ego trips
Now I'm at the hospital
Layin' next to sanity, tellin' him to fuck off
Hand me all the candy weed, I can't believe I'm stuck off
Half a cup of crazy half the youth value shot like
Watchin' pregnant babies gettin' rabies on the block
Yellin' save me to the cops but
I don't need a gimmick all you rappers tryin act

Find time to kick it with yourself til' the rhymes tight

I love you tonight, I hate you by morning
These drugs on the table got me talking too much

Dirty hotel, you call it ‘The Trap’

We living in hell, I was showing you heaven
You are far from an angel and close to a blessing
You went up to Michigan sucking some dick again
Swimmin' in bottles and blunts and lies
Your life jacket was my sympathy, my naivety
And now you dying drowning, you try to bring me down, too
You were barely floating when I found you
Paddle quick, paddle quick, paddle quick
I be grabbing billions you be grabbing dicks
What’s up, you were lying, your looks like a hoe
And you ain’t gonna ever, ever, ever again

Climb on top, feels like we’re on drugs

Then I climb on top, fuck you like you need
Me on top is cool but I really want you on top of me

Now its just skill
Minds on Pluto hands on the wheel
Damn right Russ is crazy
I'll take it as a compliment
Met a little lady she kept tellin me that I'm the shit
I call it braggadocios someone grab the roaches
Take a shot with Jesus then I passed the blunt to Moses

Fuckin devils in disguise
Tan skin round thighs brown eyes round five
Different reasons why I shouldn't even do it
But we're drinkin bombay bumpin all my music
Movin like Beyonce she sharp with every movement
But I'm feelin like I'm Kanye
So I start to lose it can you blame me?
How about we blame it on the game
Cuz this ain't me, maybe I'm a psycho
Learning how to juggle all the voices in my head

Crossing into other lanes
And the lights go ... off behind me
Remind me what I been doin

Bugus and Russ blowing blunts in a cop car
Motherfuck your handcuffs, you know that we stand tough
Coming for your head, what a rap game.. stand off!

I see you won't leave us alone until a nigga goes crazy
Ridin' through the slums, trunk full of drunk babes
Mercedes was stolen, a couple of ladies were chosen
Would've thought we were the mob by the way we was rollin'

Oh you think we the mob?
I think we the mob
In my head I get head and these hoes call me god
Word, they call you god? Well I guess i play satan
Back to killin Katy Perry in my basement
Wait, have patience
Nah, fuck patience!
I wanna see this bitch's blood wasted
Nah you don't need to you really don't have to
I don't give a fuck she's chopped up in my bathroom!
Shut the fuck up Bugus, who the fuck asked you?
Shut the fuck up?
Don't let one kill gas you, you don't kill for the villain
Cause one will catch you and will leave you on the mat and I don't mean Matthew
Fuck him, fuck you, and fuck the whole world!
Cause while I'm rappin this I'm probably fuckin yo girl!

Sometimes I feel like this
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes I feel like this
Sometimes I feel like that
Sometimes I'm feeling dark
But then I'm light
But then I'm back
Sometimes I feel like spazzin'
Yelling out that I'm the one
Cause I been mapping this out
Since before I knew I was the one
Sometimes I feel like shaking people
Just to get through to them
But they're old, dumb and confused
Man, this ain't nothing new to them
Still I got some news for them
Hello Mr. Landlord
Russ is here, I'm moving in
This is just the mood I'm in
Killing shit while I'm feeling it
Then I blackout
Wake up with a Dominican
And dip out while she passed out
Looking for the credit for the hat
Telling her I maxed out
Bitch I'm tryna' rob this whole game
Ski masked out

Now I don't think that you should fuck with me
Not until I at least fuck with you

Dreams and aspirations growing
Living in my head
Like a mu'fuckin' tumor
If I don't remove them then I'm dead
Imma' get this shit popping
If not, my list popping
In the meantime
I bought my sister a new wristwatch (Yeah)
Next comes the Range
Then a house in the sand

Reading Deepak Chopra
I've been sober since the holding tank
Thought I was Superman ridin around with Lois Lane
She tries to keep her poker face, but she's gettin beat on
And when all your friends got shoulder pains when you're supposed to lean on this  onomatopoeia for flexing sound
Guzzle, guzzle, pop, pop
Stop fucking with this ""onomat-peons"" don't you watch
What it's doing to you
They're not moving with you
They're just moving through you
Get up out the way before they do it to you
Hard-headed with the soft spot for burglars robbin' you of your jewels
You're like a watchdog who got lost in his own damn household
Dancing in the heat til you get knocked out cold
Your intro isn't done so why the fuck can I hear your outro?
I'm out yo, cause I think I'm too invested in somebody shady so I need some proof before I mess with you
But I think I got it
Couple run ins with your exes too
Many pilots in the cockpit, is it true?
Empty the pockets of your past
I'm looking for loose change
Letting the noose hang on some new things
My sun shines, I don't do rain
But all I see is lightning bolts
What the fuck is you I saying?
Man shit, what the fuck am I saying?

Girl... hold on...
Yea... what the fuck am I saying... Yea

People sayin' that I shouldn't see you
If that's the case, then why did I meet you?
Feelin like I already met you and I don't want to leave you again
Are you feelin' like I'm feelin' like?
Is it wrong that I'm feeling right?

You're my adrenaline
Your lips are like my medicine
Late night like Letterman
My friends say don't let her in
But either way I'm pedalin' faster and faster
I ask her what she's after, there's laughter and she's flattered
But what does it matter
I think when it comes to our situation we're just stuck underneath the ladder
But I always think the perfect picture is just splattered
Yeah, damn

People sayin' that I shouldn't see you

Pouring up that Tanqueray, with freaks

It was all a stream, it was all a dream
We could make a wave like tidal
Now I want the world to stream my songs everyday
On your internet waves like tidal
I want these waves to guide you to the shore, I'm sure of it
Been a drought on truth and passion too, just know I'm pouring it

And I got a French girl who says she loves my je ne sais quoi

Or maybe one, fuck, ignore that
There's been Henny involved, you trendy that's all
You won't make it past the next five
You don't got enough product
Your fans are looking for the next high
In walks the next guy, with a stash
That'll last, way longer than that mid that you saying is gas
I'm not chasing the cash, but some more zeros would be lovely
In the meantime, I'm just tryna get the whole world to love me
It's funny how they say it's too ambitious of me
I think it's funny how y'all sounding like some bitches to me
Wishes can be, more than wishes if you wish 'em to be
I mean, want 'em to be, I mean
Act on 'em, and out comes the piranha in me
Sinking my teeth in my dreams until reality bleeds
Waking up is motivation
I know the basics, and then some
I got more clips than ten guns when the feds come
Fuck looking fresh, I'm tryna look unassuming
If your eyes are in your pockets
Stop looking towards my movement
I move with a, certain type of bravado
Your girl loves me like Jamaica loves Mavado
Moscato is a little too weak, I need something stronger
You sound like McDonalds, I sound like Benihana

I used to run a race against myself, I always lost

Another young kid with an old mind
Living on a tightrope so he might go psycho but he stay sane for the goldmine
I don't mind if I die in the process
Life's short but I long for the Loch Ness Monster
Sponsor pain and the progress
Aim for a battle but I land on the conquest
Got a crown on my head
Fuck a fitted, got a crown on my head
I'm the one that did it when you wanted me to quit it
Admitted I'm bout to get it off the sound of my head
When you drown in the dread of the hate that you made
I'mma count bread to replace what I gave to the world
That's a whole bunch of hits for free
I'm my own drug dealer my life's for me

Another day goes by
Another base in this game I slide
Can't stay home safe, and won't wait
For the moment when the rain gon' dry
Waitin' for the minute, I get the recognition
Gotta get out and get it
Not a second for decision
No time to wait, no time to waste
Give a time and place and I'll kill it
I've been patiently waiting to take it
Make no mistake this is real
Jesus had made me to make it
Just can't explain how I feel
Even if caged in steel this pain you feel my name is real
I'll remain right here, all the lames stay clear
This lane I made I steer

Beast from the east I'm hard to tame
You lookin' at us like we in it for the fame
But really we are just fuckin' soldiers in the game

Lookin' at my life through a different intersection: DIEMON
Cause I am boppin' and droppin' motherfuckers who fake
Up in the AM tryin' to wake and I bake
Step up in my city let me show you what it take
God is on my side so tell me how I'm gonna lose
Contemplating life so tell me why we pick and choose
Tryin' to kill the track when you can barely make a bruise
Life's a fuckin bitch so now you giving 'em in twos
Smoke a couple more, let me lighten up the mood

Blue skies and Cognac, paintin' Mona Lisa's
While tryna' fight amnesia
No structure to my routine, just rubbers
New queen, no lover
Blue dream and Lucy in the sky

I got to say, I miss you
But now I'm doing shows in some of the schools I couldn't get into

My life, roll some kush up

Will dope get ya' hook up

Embarrassed to ever rap at home
Afraid my parents gonna hear me so
I go outside and pack a bowl
Let me drown my worries, in a cup that's made of promise

And I used to be in college but the shoes never fit me
So now I'm making beats from my class in the city
You ain't fuckin' with me, excuse me while I compensate
Over what I need to, yeah sometimes I over complicate
Like simple things in life, so much it's hard to concentrate
Like I ain't I got the juice

I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

Drop-top got hot in my mind
You see stop, I see a sign
Livin' the life for the chase of emotions
You waiting in line, I'm just taping the motion
I'm lacing my potion with faith and devotion
You making a wave, I'm making an ocean
I'm giving my soul, taking a toll of who's real and who's not and who's chasing the goal

These images haunt me
I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

Yeah, I see the camera, Russ
I see all the flashes as I'm driving round Atlanta
See the future through my glasses
I look down at my steering wheel
Double R's its feeling real
Louie shades, whole crew is paid
We smoking j's, you know the deal
But I'm currently on my way there
Asking God if I play fair
Is it possible for these obstacles to be gone by the time I have grey hair (Grey hair)
Just say yeah
I'm about to be worldwide 'cause my beats bounce
This deep south
So you know I keep my purp fried
Search high and I search low
Tryna find a way to make the earth flow to
My circle means business
Urkles keep your distance
Cuz its top secret
Stop peeking
This ain't for you bitches
This is all inside my mind
In due time I will get my wishes

These images haunt me
I'm tryna run away
And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

And they say Johny get your work on
7 hours deep at 10 a.m. shirt on
She perfect with them birks on
From here on, to so long
Boy John don't I lift her emotions up like Vultron
She skirt off I work hard
Zone 3 my graveyard, lanyard
Hanging around my neck my finger itchin around this check
Boy I'm feelin make a million on respect like
Nigga I'm feelin' make a killing on these deaths to whats left
But 8 fingers and 2 thumbs strangle money with no one
 with no 
Told my mamma I was gonna be famous when I grow up
And now a nigga grew up, but I blew up
Like twin towers, whiskey sours my  like

And now they're tryna taunt me
I'm tryna run away

Can't believe I cheated but I guess
I had to learn some
Now I've just been dealing with karma
In the form of broken daughters
Lookin' for fathers
Man, y'all better keep searchin'
Diemon's in my blood
Damn I see I really own shit
Keep on acting brand new
You gon' turn into my old chick

And then fill it up with Latinas

Lot less lovin'
Lot more thinking

Just green, and the mights on my headlights
Gotta do it because I live to be dead and I sit til I get right, trips on the jet mic
Climb into a place where I can't get, jet it
Penthouse, palm trees, long time with it
Had a couple dreams and I motherfuckin' admit it
And you motherfuckin' haters livin on givin' faith in it
With a face full of smoke, chased what I hoped, stakes so high I don""t wanna be broke
Plates on mine
I don't wanna waste time

And I saved my mind for the bongs i smoke

I float, I float, I float
It's my right to be wrong so cope

Can't live it right

You hustle knockin' yo shit
Whack in that hell problem

Voiced it into action
I was poised but never passive
I went after it and then I mastered it
But Imma' play until my name is in the Raptors bitch

Astonished at my odyssey
Made my own policy
I don't need apologies
I just need a pile of cheese
So I can take a breather

I still my need some reefer

Almost there, tok it up

So I might as well help a couple birds find a feather
Then proceed to go
Down the easy road

But now I'm acting in my own play
Racking up my own plays
Laughing cause rapping like
What happened to the old days
But fuck my old ways
I'm sippin' on some gochay

Close your eyes
The bullshit is over

And your dad wants to kill him
But he's not really sure
Of what his face looks like, but he knows what he did yours
Bruised up, lip busted
And your whole attitude is like
New cuts
Shit fuck it
And that's only because
You don't love yourself so you cut yourself
Drinking at the bar, smoking blunts to yourself
And you wanna just fold the cards you were dealt
And you mom getting worried cause you starve yourself
People trying to judge they don't what it is
Say you doing drugs just to cope with this shit
But I got you, cause I know what it is
The fuck?

Close your blinds (I got you)
Don't worry about your shoulder
Close your eyes
The bullshit is over
Close your blinds (I got you)
Don't worry about your shoulder
Close your eyes

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, mm-mmm

Yeah
Hey, Gianna fuck them bitches cause they ain't shit
You gonna' laugh in all they faces when I'm famous buying Rangers for you
I would die, I would kill, I would grab a stainless for you
Fuck around and end up doing something fucking brainless for you
Cause people doing 180°s, constantly turning
I'm sipping Tanqueray constantly swerving, learning
Constantly earning, but yearning
For some better shit
I took the life that I was handed, flipped the script
And then embellished it
I'm the president

Fan, player, and the coach
Don't forget about the owna'
I know bullshit when I smell it
All of y'all got the aroma
But I swear I'm coming soona'
Then a bitch in Oklahoma
Self-belief could be the drug that could get you off the corna'
But you been sleeping on yourself for so long that you're in a coma
So it's feeling like it's ova'
And your baby mama hate you
The Devil's at your door
But your kid motivates you
Cause what starts as a mistake, could be the same shit that saves you

Who would of thought?
You could of popped, you could of been me
Excuse me for my arrogance, but I was just on MTV
Plus labels wanna' sign me, so I'm out in NYC
Fuck the politics, got a lotta' chicks, out in DC
Fuck 'em with the campaign
Every night there's champagne
Bottles pop, me and Bugus, lions that you can't tame
Went from getting set up, to setting up set list
Everyday I wake up to a check on my checklist
I could buy a necklace just to say I own it
But I'd rather buy a breakfast for my mom, I'm out here making moments
That's the main component
Talking to myself, like ""it pays don't it?""
Mutha' fukkas' wanna' be me, that's when they hate on 'em
But I don't pay attention, they're not real to me
I got a Puerto Rican chick that keeps it real with me
This is real easy, to dismantle y'all
Y'all turning into actors, just because the camera's on
But Russ is what it sounds like when the mutha' fukkas' cameras off
I said, Russ is what it sounds like when the mutha' fukkas' cameras off
One more time
I said, Russ is what it sounds like when the mutha' fukkas' cameras off
(Yeeaahh)
Yeah
Ok, lack of self-belief, that's the number one disease
Out here killing everybody, better hold on to your dreams, mutha' fukka'
And what it is, ain't what it seems, mutha' fukka'
I mean, sometimes it is
But you gotta' kill your ego, If you wanna live
 See me man, I'm nothin' like you
Got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leaning in my ride, fo' fifth, cock banging
Me, I'm riding by you, on the corner block slanging
Livin' that boss' life
Girls come running when they see me coming
Livin' that boss' life
You can have anything, just don't touch my money

From a world of poverty (b-o-s-s)
To the front page of magazines (l-i-f-e)
Oooo, we boss'
Feeling so good, feeling so good, it feels so good (feels good)
A boss' life
Wantin' shoes on my feet (b-o-s-s)
To riding 'round in limousines  (l-i-f-e)
Oooo, we boss'

Bugus
 & (Dartlin)]
Hey
Damn
That man Dartlin just doin' bad shit
(To a bitch)
That man Bugus is back here doin' some bad shit
Smokin' blunts, fuckin' bitches
Ayye
Yeah man, we're all doin' some bad shit so fuck off
Gettin' money nigga, throw it up

Uh, I was 15 comin' home from school and makin' beats
The lessons that they taught me didn't make it past my seats
So I, taught myself how to multiply my wealth
Add up all my talent and subtract what others felt
Cause I don't need that feedback
Just need that weed sack
Never been to rehab
But I'm feeling like I relapsed
Cause I'm high off life
And college wasn't right for me
Dropped out to blow up
Cause my knowledge needs the right to breathe
And yeah I battle with myself on the daily
And yeah I'm rattled by myself is what saved me
'Cause I'm not cattle, so I won't behave see
Imprisoned by society is the modern form of slavery
So I got out and sought out what I dreamed of
Then I got a team, plus the means and drew a scheme of
To feel alive every day and get our green up
Snoozin' while I'm movin' so no wonder why your feet stuck

We battle all the time
I win and lose no matter what
My mind's so rattled cause it's me verse me
And I won't budge
But I'm alive every day
I feel alive every day

Uh, the beat knocks
The beat won't drop
I rose to my feet
You know the heat won't stop
But I'll leave you niggas rattled
If you bitches wanna' battle
Get cracked with a bottle
Leave you leakin' like Seattle
I'm outlandish
Can't stand this
Can't damage
My plan is to paint and create on my canvas
My Porsche screamin' yolo
In the court pleadin' Nolo
In the corner sittin' solo
Yeah, I'm dolo blowin' jolo
Getting hoes like Manolo
Get a pose in my photo
My folks know my ring froze
It glows like I'm Frodo
You hoes are Manolo
Meaning that I'm Scarface
Rich ass immigrant
Rich ass cigar taste
My flow game, propane
Cocaine, gold chain
No pain, no gain
You no names, so lame
It's B-U, G-U
I ain't gotta' finish, I'm in it
My windows are tinted
So I ain't gotta' see you

We battle all the time
I win and lose no matter what
My mind's so rattled cause it's me verse me
And I won't budge
But I'm alive every day
I feel alive every day

Uh, finding your soul is like mining for gold
A reminder that the time's slowly takin' it's toll
Intricate thoughts
Into the vault
But this is off
Gotta' re-track my mind right back
To where I lost
Roller coastin'
Cold emotion
Roll and coatin'
This bud got me buzzed
But fuck it, I'm so focused
Stuck but hoe I'm rollin'
Remember I was goin' to Cali for college
Well now I'm out in Cali balling bitch
You acted like I didn't exist
Never imagined I had it but I got this swish
And now it's swish
Ballin' like a mu' fukka'
We just living every night like the last supper
Living it up, no giving it up
Cause shit got rough, times got hard
But we got tougher
And I've been scuffed, fell, got up
My mind got scarred
Yeah life's tough
Just smile while you suffer

We battle all the time
I win and lose no matter what

Talkin' back was rude
But then I started smokin' blunts
And walkin' back to school
Like, fuck it
My shirt won't tuck it
Take it back to tenth grade
Blowin' blunts in the bucket so
Lookin' for me, I'll be on the beach bitch
Countin' C notes on a boat gettin' sea sick
Now you quote what I wrote, I'm a beast bitch
Cause when I spoke, always spoke of the G6
Chrome spokes, always hope I would reach this
Now I reap results of what I spoke and I don't need shit
I won't preach shit if you won't purchase
You're sure to find a purpose in my sermon every service
And I don't give a fuck
You only live once
So I need the gold Rollie with the diamonds in the front like
Bling

I know how to make it stop
But I just want my shine
So I'm never gonna' stop
So let me be
Don't envy me

Oh-ooh

Uh, got the prezi with the bezi for my whole team
Cause at 18 I told 'em we would mold dreams
Now I'm almost 21, I'm gettin' closer to the one
Tryna' make a million bucks so I can buy drinks
Yeah they sellin' a lot but I don't by dreams
Get your wack ass act out of my scene
Stackin' plaque on plaque
I'm back on track
My Mack intact
And that's just that
My rhyme scheme
They love it
Can't touch it
Or budge it
No budget on buds
Cause I love it
Hotbox, hot rides, pot smothered
Roast in that ghost
You hoes are hokes
Cause I know what I know
And doesn't a bomb blow
If you had it all
Maybe you would half it all
Everybody's tryna' grab it
But they ladder's small
Separate the actual from factual
Strategize and improvise
And maybe you can have it all

I feel it all the time
I know how to make it stop
But I just want my shine
So I'm never gonna' stop
So let me be
Don't envy me
This is all that's in my mind
Oh-ooh

Uh, I'm zoned out with a bad one
Honey's taken action
Back seat, flat screen
Let her grip the Magnum
But if she acts dumb
Imma' have to dip out
Smoke a blunt, make a beat
Probably put the shit out
Cause it never stops
Even when I'm fuckin'
Hits are running through my mind
And I don't say nothin'
Til I should bitch
And if I do, I'm saying something like
What's good bitch
I wish you would bitch
Anyways, back to this bangin' ass beat that I made
You'll probably try to buy it but I keep what I make
I don't give a fuck
Cause this my life and this my child
I won't give it up
So start givin' up
Cause you ain't gon' get it
Unless you part of DIEMON
Unless your cheese is breaded
You can find me on an island
With my feet in the sand, weed in my hand
Even in my dreams I'm makin' beats cause I can

I feel it all the time
I know how to make it stop
But I just want my shine
So I'm never gonna' stop

Got me drinking 'til my livers gone, I'm still at home
But I'm traveling more often
Life got me speechless, so I'm babbling more often
I'm lucky for the mic, so I can rap instead of talkin'
God, it's kinda' funny I've been laughing kinda often
The gas got me coughin'
There's some ass that I'm lost in
Cause it's more than just ass
She makes me feel like I ain't ever, ever had a past
But I wonder, does she know?
And does my sister really know how much I love her? Does it show?
My momma told me long ago
That I better be a role model
So when the cuffs went on me, they didn't tell her
But I told her, I was holding bottles
Don't ever make the same mistake
Showing people love, that have no interest to reciprocate
This worlds been curving on me
Ones are getting straight

Shoutout to Calvin

Shoutout Macivan

In the ground in the hood

I just wanna' write, I don't wanna' think about that night

My uncle got killed, he got taken out the shits
See, he was with his girlfriend, coolin' out, vibin'
Then he had his world end, people drunk drivin'
Drunk mutha' fukka', swerved, hit him on the side
Then his car flipped over, then it was all sirens
Listen for his heartbeat, it was all silence
Layin' in the streets, little chance to survive
Then he died before the mutha' fuckin' ambulance arrived
My momma got a call, she picked up sounding all surprised
Cops said, they think he's not alive
He died on the scene, his face hit the glass, I know it's sad
I just hope before he past, he had peace
His brother had kids, now he have niece

Uh, who got the answers?
Who could bring people back and cure cancer?
Uh, my grandma the strongest girl I ever met
You an angel, I love you to death

So put down the rope, and light the blunt again
Cause I'm living the diamond life, I got on my head
Gotta see the light, I really wanna' be livin' it right
So give me the mic, So I can take off, and show off
That's this music feeding me more dog, it's making me slow mo'

Wait For Me,UnKnown,2015.0,"I see my vision in my mirror

Hope it doesn't run away from me

Drink until my problems drown
Cruise around sunset
Hopin' that the sun don't go down
Makin' life on sacrifices
Yeah, I make these beats
Cause I been wrapped up in my vices
My advice to myself
Listen to yourself, trust you
We fuck over ourselves
So it's never really fuck you

Step up to the plate
You can't undo the past
So just rely on your faith
But fuck faith, make a wave

I'm just hoping that it waits for me
I see my life in the distance
Hope it doesn't run away from me

I been homeless two years today
And I swear that I'm in motion
And these times are
Harder than bone marrow
I'm gloomy as rainy days
My momma say
Never thunder only the rain
Ok, hot as August
Close shore this summer
I'm here to die
She's here to smoke
And I wonder why
Cause I'm the fire
Mr. Crazy, I'm oil heavy
She's red papaya
Gave me a hundred dollars
Mr. Without A Dime
You can call that love
I call it trapped inside
Cause I got six mistress'
Two businesses
And I keep singing sugar lies
Oh sugar why
Oh sugar why

I see my vision in my mirror
I'm just hoping that it waits for me
I see my life in the distance
Hope it doesn't run away from me
I see my vision in my mirror

Yo Boog

Tryna fly right by them

Sometimes I'd rather be blinded
Deaf, Dumb and ignorant

I won't miss what I missin
Sit back cuz this Mazdas coming out
I'm brain dead
Legendary life
White skin but I pay rent
Murderer, I wanna murder her
But I resist
Nice to meet you Lucifer
Who the fuck is Jesus?
Tell the girls that fuck with me
To hit me when they need dick
Otherwise don't bother
I understand your daughter's out here looking for your fathers
And Y'all can call me Papi but it's prolly best if you refrain
Even though I got that Kurt Cobain kinda love
Die for it
Sometimes the truth is too much
I might lie for it
Protection is a blessing until you fuckin wanna ride for it
Haha or ride against it

Bring your blues like cold train

Fly me to the promised land, all I need is one check

Shock non-stop, got hot so you flaunting chords
Everybody tryna' live the life of luxury
Kick and sip and fuck with me
Slip the rug from under me
So fuck the subtleties
Rebuttal with a couple B's
I double up then funnel luck into my cup of dreams
Cause what it seems, is what it is, at least in this case
So fuck your schemes, I'm getting rich and leaving this place

Shows about to sell out

Ten albums deep and still droppin'
Haven't found a coffin yet, for these flip floppin' bitches
But I'm still shoppin
I think I hear the fat lady singing though, Jill Scott
I'm still watching people pay themselves, that's a damn shame
You'll remember what I do and what I did when your man came, from my fan base
It's what I'm focused on, zoom in
Have me on the Wake Up show, NYC radio, tune in
There's a movement, that you should move wit'
On some cool shit, like George Gervin
My fingers rolling down these girls curves, got 'em purrin'
'Til the birds chirping, then I'm ghost
Imma' make a bunch of my money, move my family to the coast
Imma' put the cape on, fix the game, cause it's broke
Best man for the job, let's have a mu'fukin' toast
Looking back when I closed, my text book
Now I'm known in places round the globe, where I ain't step foot
Blowing on the best kush
When I do smoke, cause I prefer the Nuvo
Actually, Tanqueray, phone full of new hoes
Had to block my ex bitch, like Manute Bol
Team full of MJ's, no Toni Kukoč

Who's show is this?
Are you double dollar sign?

Fuck the show biz, I show you what the biz is
No limits, mutha' fukka'

Penthouse dreams, basement realities
Foot up on the gas, should I pace myself gradually?
God damn, Lord
Give me a sign
Give me your words
Give me your sight
Give me your mind

Deaf and dumb

The rich, the poor, can't you see I'm the one?
With this real shit
And I hate to fuckin' say it, but do you feel this?

I sleep better when my lights been awoken
Then I might leave the lights on
So you can see I'm focused
This game has a plague
So all I see is locusts
In most of you
But I just hope the world can see what I see
Hear what I hear, breathe what I breathe
It's a farfetched idea
But at least I have it yeah
At least I have it, at least I have it
Maybe I can work a little magic without the rabbit
Maybe I can turn a little passion to a palace
Cause after all
I'm standing on the 3 point line wide open
Pass the ball motherfuckers


Before the sun comes up
I gotta' love, love, love
I stutter when I pray like
But-but-but
God, please don't take it personal
I just feel outta place
My mind is just a vehicle
I'm runnin' outta faith
Please believe I see the reason that I, that I
Keep on breathing in my freedom, that's why, that's why
I'm gratefully dead, to the life of the impossible
I never thought I'd get so high off the obstacles
I know it's gonna' pay off and these songs are gonna' be comical
When I put my mom somewhere tropical
These optical illusions keep on movin' tryin' to fuck me up
Where's the four leaf clover when you need it in this lucky cup

If it’s a broom that you flew in on
'Cause I’m tryin' to break you out
So I'm not the one to be goin' in on

But I'm not the type to fold a hand
You say it's the Beetles, me, and 2Pac
I gotta hold your hand to keep your head up

Oh, oh, oh
I’m willing and able

To be everything
You say you feel it
But little did I know
About the lies you were concealin'
Now the truth comes out
And all hell breaks loose
When the goose comes out
Or better yet tequila mixed with all your pride
And your anger
But you feelin' like a stranger when you sober
So drink up and let me get closer, fuck

Swear I hear my name
Bouncing off these 4 walls
Tryna' to make me go insane
So I watch the cookie crumble
My sanity's on vacation
I see these rookies fumble
And wonder, how they made it
And around this time I pour up
Fantasize about four sluts
Getting freaky on a tour bus
If life's a bitch, she's gorgeous
I just need a plug
Cause I already got my outlet
And I already found my fountain
And I'm 19 but who's counting?

Swimming till they drop

Out here chasing emotions, baby, you can't blame us
And you definitely can't contain us

Ok, it's Hennessy and Baileys for my enemies
Hey ladies, my remedy is memories and bottles in Mercedes
But, honestly, my policy has changed: I'm trying to save me
And if you hate me, you still gonna play me
So back the fuck up, 'cause your words don't mean a damn thing
Still, I'm just romancing, guess it's just a man thing
I keep dancing as the Devil stepping on my toes
Guess it's how the lesson goes, blessing me with stressing woes
But either way, the Rifa's blazing and I keep making beats
Yeah, I put my voice on them so I don't have to face defeat
And even if I do, at least, I took the last shot
Now, I'm on my last shot
Bailey is my Mascot

Me and her just riding with the Devil 'til the last stop
'til the last stop
Me and her just riding until the fucking last stop

Gotta slow down but the Devil's on my ass

But now, he's back out
Fuck the bitch that put him there
She was mad that he was making moves and thought he wouldn't dare
Dipped to Cali, leave her ass
Thought the valley had a pass
And bitter bitches tryna bash
Youngin' tryna get his cash
Guess not, 'cause next step was the end part
Gone 'til November who or why, when God?

Gotta slow down but the Devil's on my ass

Uh, hey Gianna, how you doin' pretty girl?
The greatest little sister in this pretty ugly world
You're a princess, I'm a witness
You inviting me to moments and I say that ""I won't miss this""
But I know I will, I'm always gone
You're always right, I'm always wrong
'Cause knowing me I'm blowing tree, I'm always making songs
The faith is gone, the wait is on but I'm gonna come back
With lavish luxuries, a palace off for one track
I'm nineteen, by twenty, I'm gonna have some money
Deck you out in Gucci, Louis, I'll just keep it bummy
Just stay away, there's Devil's everywhere you go
But God is on your side so go where you go

Next is a couple platinum plaques and a neckless
Tremendous how I walk into a room and leave you breathless
Maybe not you but your girl is tryin to mess with
Everything I talk about
I let her in and taught her how
To pick up on the signs
To the M's in my Slaughterhouse
I got it now and you can't fuckin handle it
Lights low candles lit ready to dismantle it
She channelin her inner Jenna Jameson
And shes got the swag that these bitches gettin famous in
Only thing I chase is gin mix it with some tonic
In the city of the brave bumpin dre
Blowin Chronic nothin left to say
But fuck you to the comics

And my beats are bubonic

The one to turn a nun to a Nikki Nova
She got that super soaker
Tell her go and bend it over, I walk in I ball out
When I leave they all down
Big dog and I beat the pussy to a coma
Drill it like Oklahoma fill it like a filling
If you light up dim down the lights just a little bit
Perfect, you might ask is one night worth it
We can get deep it ain't about the surface
Undercover lovers under covers
We can work it shawty move that body

Diemon is my team
It won't stop until its red carpets
Nineteen with seventy tracks
Bitch I'm head-started
Lets get started with some shots
Blunts rolled bottles popped
Y'all know how it goes
Y'all know moscato got hoes
Top , rock hoes
Lookin like vatos
Tryna be great why niggas hate I do not know
Find 'em a plate
My niggas ate when I got dough
Finding my way
Through my mistakes and potholes
But God knows that I feel it in my soul
My life full of flight
But tonights full of ????

I love it when you move like that
I love it when you talk like that
I love it when you move like that

In less than 360 days
My life did a 180
Feeling like I sipped 5 40's
I'm still spinning it's been crazy
Pop Pop died
My girl got pregnant
Thank God it wasn't mine though
She played me but still
I wouldn't press rewind though
Label offers
Crowd surfin
Damn it's been a blur
Sold out shows around the world
And it's just me getting started forreal

The Ceremony,5280,UnKnown,"Yeah
I'm drinking heavy, smoking often
Running from the devil, thank God, I think I lost him
But I move with caution, head is on a swivel
All you bitches bite, I'm tryin' to find the one that nibbles
Ain't got time to play the fiddle, meaning no strings attached
These rappers act like champions but don't have rings to match
I'm Kobe and I'm Shaq, they gon' hang my jersey up
Wheels in the sky keep on turning, yeah, this journey's tough
Feel like I got hernias, every time I wake up
That's probably why my glass is full, probably why my J's stuffed
But I'm making beats and skipping sleep until my day comes
Running through these hoes, grab my Gucci's and I lace them
Sorry Mom, I said it, Sorry Dad, I did it
I know this ain't the life you thought I live but I still live it
I know that too much liquor can't be good but I still drink it
I know I'm gon' make both so proud any minute
Yeah, it's coming any minute

Yeah
All I need is one shot, fireworks will spark up
Never made a gun cock, but I'ma shoot the charts up
My guards up, looking at the mirror, feeling starstruck
Guessing it's a blessing to remind me of my start up
Stressing but my heart's stuck in this crazy game
I'm going off the rails living in this crazy train
But, we all have a choice, I just choose to be chosen
I'm out here running circles around your squares, that's my slogan
Yelling someone pass the potent, someone call some chicas
I'm looking for some accents, couple curvy features
Couple bottles of some Bombay and some reefer
Celebratin' life my boy Nick, I'm glad they freed ya
Get the party rollin' the girls we hardly know em
I said I wouldn't tell but it's amazing what they showin'
Ya broke because you're broken in the mind, here's a token for ya time
And keep it open don't be closing every moment that you find
Wassup

This is the Ceremony, all you who barely know me
Tryin' to be my friend but way back when was embarrassed for me
White kid making beats, said my life was make believe
Now they hit me up with verses cause they hate the life they lead
I laugh and then I light the weed, I might just be, all up on ya TV screen
Run and tell ya momma ""Hey that's Russ I tried to kill his dreams
How the fuck this happen? Now he's fuckin' rappin'?""
It cuts you like a knife because you busy folding napkins
I'm the captain, I marks the spot
Meaning everywhere I go, got some gold in my thoughts
Scotch on the rocks, things become thoughts
But way before I'm gone I'll have yachts at my docks",https://genius.com/Russ-the-ceremony-lyrics
Brand New,UnKnown,2015.0,"Baby girl
I see myself with you
Baby girl
You make me feel brand new

And when the lights go down
And that liquor pours up
And less is no
That the truth comes out
And you can't control your anger
With your Colombian mouth

Baby girl
I see myself with you
Baby girl
You make me feel brand new

I'll follow you into the dark
And I'll ride your wave
Until it crashes on me
Drunk off you
And high off floatin'
In this Dead Sea

I see myself with you

The Lookout,Straight From Limbo,2013.0,"Another lost soul, standing at a crossroad
Insanity is priceless, but I just heard the 
Maybe if I fall slow, I can land on both feet
Maybe if the song's slow, they can hear my bones speak
But then again it's limbo, nothing here is simple
Nothing's what it seems, every dream is a symbol
That makes you want to float away
And smoke away every problem that you stowed away
So float away, float away motherfuckaaaa'

Yeah, are you good now?
Or are you feeling like you never could now?
For every voice of doubt there's a shout screaming success
But if you let the doubt in, I couldn't give a fuck less

Are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are  off the ground
And are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are off the ground

A lotta y'all enjoy the trap, but how is that so?
Don't you want to join the top?
The driver stops if you don't pass go
Even if you're speeding through a red light
Thinking it's the best night
Look beyond your headlights, the grass grows greener once you step outside your home
You say that you're too busy when your fate is on the phone
You've escaped what you've known all your life
Chasing highs, wasting times
Tricking, rolling dice with disasters
Gambling your laughter
Just because your daddy died doesn't make you a bastard
But still you're running after what he could have felt like
She grabs the needle in, feels what he felt like
This is what hell's like
She can't even spell life, let alone comprehend the meaning
And everyone around they acts like she don't even need them
But she's bleeding on the inside, smiling on the out
She's driving on the wrong side, drinking 'til she's out

Are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are off the ground
And are you feeling good now? Feeling like you should now?
Catch you going down, catch you going down
I can be your lookout, easy as it looks now
Listen to the sound, your feet are off the ground",https://genius.com/Russ-the-lookout-lyrics
Yung Pacino,The Edge,2013.0,"Yung Pacino, trying to get DeNiro
Ride off in the sunset, let 'em flock like seagulls
It was nonstop weed smoke, till I stopped and got Cleco
It's Russ, and any artist 'till I blow is a placebo
You know when I touch down smoke a Philly like an eagle
And getting so high off my shit like you sniffed the whole kilo
Dare the devil to fuck with me, it sounds evil
But what's a gamble when you own the whole goddamn casino?
I'm talkin' bout life, roll the dice and hit the jackpot
Harvest on my field of dreams, thoughts on my cash crops
Only fuck with will-dos, I don't fuck with have-nots
Making sure my will's move up until the last stop
Chicas in front of me, Italy in my backdrop
Shit so pretty, makes me wanna take a snapshot
I'm going out in a glass coffin so you could look in
And see what's up

Here I come, I hope you're ready
Because I am coming through
And when I'm dead, you won't forget me
Consider I'm closing in on you",https://genius.com/Russ-yung-pacino-lyrics

Woah, and why?

Okay, I'm traveling
Through this world unraveling
Pieces of sequence so please don't speak unless you have a ring
Gotta get it 'cause you said it wouldn't happen
Whole lotta thoughts and I turn 'em into action
Cooked up a plot, changed it with passion
Look what I got, look what I'm asking for
I'm feeling cursed with the drive to be after more
So I flirt with life, let it catch the door
Hurt her proud, I don't have remorse
Let her know her dad so I'm at the morgue
So bounce, bounce, home of the brave
Land of the free but my bones are the slave

Wiggling, giggling, tickle me down
Please don't be fickle, I trickle the sounds
Sizzle the ground with the riddles I found
Fiddle with middles 'til no ones around
Keys to my city like no ones around
Jesus, my city be holding it down

One minute you're young, the next you die
Appreciate the minutes you're living because it's ticking
Don't sit around and wonder why
Gotta just go out there and get it
All these things sitting on my mind
Tryna slow it down so we go around
With the windows up and we blow it down
When the temp goes up we roll them down

This is me and some alcohol
Fuck the shit I'm about to ball
Primitive simpletons listening to these neanderthals
You can't evolve - ain't no excuses
But fuck you motherfuckers
All my new shit's leaving bruises
I'm smoking on some Hades getting higher than what Zeus is
If we don't know life, how can we know death?
Confucius said at first I'm blackin' out, I can't see shit
I want to be a millionaire, where's Regis?
Telekinesis defeats my demons
My looks are hella deceiving
I do this shit for no reason
Competition was doomed as soon as they said I was breathing
So I'm here now walking through the club like I was Moses
Girls can't put their finger on me
Stuck in my hypnosis
I'm the dopest, quote this quotable
Climb the rope up the totem pole
Time is so uncontrollable
I don't know when the whole world will notice me
But I know I'm supposed to be
Sitting on the throne getting thrown off the potency
This ain't even the coldest me
I'm just warming up
I'm about to grill the game
I got George Foreman luck
In a four-door truck
With the windshield cracked
I'm just hitting home-runs
Move your infield back
I just reveal facts
And my shit will last
I'm just trying to stay young
Cross, beats, still smash
So don't ask my glass is full
Why I got some ass to pull
I could die right now
So right now is twice as valuable
I could chase my dream
It's palpable and I'm accountable
Failure ain't allowable
Talent is surely powerful
But I'm still working making sure my crops are bountiful
The moon might move the ocean
But Russ gon' make these mountains move
Rolling up an ounce then poof
Disappears like magic
Somersaults inside my lungs
These blunts must do gymnastics
I'm just stuck here making classics
What the fuck do you do?
I'm smoking Pacalolo getting laid in Honolulu
These rappers need a Blues Clue
Best advice is just do you
'Cause underneath those J's, I can see a fucking tutu
And who knew
Life would be this easy
Just do what you love
Then it's Veni Vidi Vici

Give it to my sister proceed to take over

Every leap of faith is a practice

Knew that I can have it
Soon as I can find it
Jets out to NY feelin like a Giant
Young and so defiant with a purpose
I'm about to jump in a fire and I'm shirtless
Better call the nurses
Preferably the tan ones
With a little accent, hips like handguns
Grips like phantoms

Man chases boy, watch me as I floor it
I'm soaring, through the open cosmos
I got no Rubrik, I do this blindly
Woke up to the screams of my soul saying ""Find me""
Splash some cold water on my face
Took a shot of something light
Living in and out the dark, spark blunts, get high
From the second-hand smoke, and the Nissan beat up
Breathing all this gas, I know my life's gonna speed up
Let the past pass, hope the future doesn't freeze up
Jesus, he's just Santa Claus to me
Someone tell the tooth fairy there's a monster in my sheets
So she better be discreet, but she's filling up my dreams
'Cause my cup is running over to the world of disbelief
And I don't need that, I leaned back, let the whisky wisp
Walk up to the edge, look around, then I enter, yeah

Oh-oh, I'm drinking again
Oh-oh, not thinking again

Okay, I'm numb to the elements
Blunt for the medicine
Henny in my cup, and it's feeling like I'm better than
God, whoever that is
Trying to figure out just what the path is
Past is, wanna not know
But the color of the grass is
This mash shit, floating in my mind
Perching on my soul, like a butterfly on fun
At least that's what I tell people (Huh)
Ego is the real evil, ego is the real evil

Oh-oh, I'm drinking again (Drinking again)
Oh-oh, not thinking again (Thinking again)

Hanging on to belief, my fingertips
Are so numb that I don't feel my life
Don't wake me up, I'm just rolling around
And just floating until I get right

Oh-oh, I'm drinking again
Oh-oh, not thinking again

In the moment, I get a little buzz
I get to feeling like a million bucks
'Cause I'm one of a kind, every time
I'm taking the pop job, I feel I'm in love
Jack-sipping, posse living in my other cup
Turn it up, giving life another uppercut

When 1-800 calls feel cold
When a phone call from home

Will I do better? Who better?
Seems like these crackers made of gold
They made of gold
Seems like that everyone around me is doing better than before

Thirty thousand feet with my seat way back, Maybach laid back
I call it payback for your bitch ass

Cold ice in my glass, slow nights, livin' fast
Arts and crafts, the only class I ever passed
See my craft is my art, my rap is my heart
My swag is all aboard so my flow is a la tart
From the start I was a prostar, a dope bard with dope bars
The Mozart that flows hard, on those beats, he go hard
It's hard to find so don't argue mine
'Cause tryin' to grade my art is just a loss of time
Yo' time that is, I'll be buyin' the cribs
You'll be tryin' to figure out whose line that is
Wayne Brady, the game shady, screamin' pay me
In Mercedes with your lady Hailey playin' the ukulele baby
Wavy, broke problems can't phase me
Let me go mama, no, commas can't change me
So look, mama, the world is ours
'Cause life is but a show and we're the stars

I'm feelin' like this, you're feelin' like that
Do you like this or do you like that?
Thirty thousand feet with my seat way back, Maybach laid back
I call it payback for your bitch ass
I'm feelin' like this, you're feelin' like that
Do you like this or do you like that?
Thirty thousand feet with my seat way back, Maybach laid back
I call it payback for your bitch ass

My sentiments are infinite I kill it every sentence
Not to mention my intentions cause i'm fuckin' never catchin'
Any feelings, keep my head up to the ceilin' with my eyes low
Pride keeps me high though, dim down the lights so
We can light up the night, we won't give up the fight
Underrated and jaded and my mind already made it
It's my time and I been patient, just been rhymin' in the basement
With this time and in this placement, so take it, I'm 'bout to break it
How she make me hard then make me soft?
Slow it down a little, when in the middle, I stay calm
Remember times I had time to get my cake on
Now only thing that's on my mind is gettin' my cake on
How ironic I'm on it, pimp shit
Young pale mothafucka walkin' with a limp, bitch
Ya'll all stale, suckers pay your rent quick
Im a lieutenant, you're a tenant, better get this

I'm feelin' like this, you're feelin' like that
Do you like this or do you like that?
Thirty thousand feet with my seat way back, Maybach laid back
I call it payback for your bitch ass
I'm feelin' like this, you're feelin' like that
Do you like this or do you like that?
Thirty thousand feet with my seat way back, Maybach laid back

'Cause I got all these questions I can't seem to figure out
So damn
I wish I was the answer man

Looking off the balcony
Imagine my life in a sea of people
Not even passed my preview but I see my sequel
Living my story everyday just another page
Demonstrating thoughts as I color in this liquor stains
Tryna find a quicker way
Always end up slowmo
Making monopoly everything else is a no go
Yeah I'm so drawn

Damn, I wish I was the answer man
Cuz I got all these questions I can't seem to figure out
So damn
I wish I was the answer man

Kids wanna grow up
Grown ups wanna be kids
One wants to escape
One wants to relive
But we just sit fast and live slow
Die never whiplash from my instrumentals
Instrumental to the mental game I'm winning never seasonals
Like I just couldn't understand creation is my vehicle
Either way I'm zooming off
Society breathing down my neck
Living in a getaway
Luckily my mind's a champ
Legends in that compact, uptight
Living by some fake rules
Running in a fake race
The finish line is some fake jewels
So go ahead
Live life through competition
All I see is mirrors getting clearer once I got the vision
But still

From my bars to my whip, dog, all my shit legit
Y'all fallin' for a bitch while I'm ballin' callin' chips
Y'all all up on my balls and my drawers on my dick
Yo she tryin' to find my tip while I'm tryin' to find me vic

Man we got this bitch turnin', I'm slizzard and I feel it
The realest, I kill it, I'm in it 'til I finish
Man, fuck a million dollars, I could make it in a minute, nigga

Let me see your hands go up right now, right now
All my ladies, dance, leave your man right now
'Cause I'm about to kill it

Ok it's time to set the record straight, get up out your seats
I'm rhymin' with no effort, wait, and I make the beats
So I'm livin' it up, not givin' a fuck while sippin' a cup of this Henny
The women I sus, I'm swimmin' in bus, I blink, there's twice as many
So what girl should I go home with? Nah let's make that plural
What girls should I go home with? Throw your hands up for referral
Just like turtle, this my entourage, 'cause she just for ambience
Spanish women flockin' 'cause I give 'em what that cacha wants
That cacha talks, tells me I'm the greatest
Usted es el mas grande, motherfucker translate it
And you hate it 'cause I made it, I'm laughin' 'cause I'm famous
And Diemon's full of lions, go ahead and try and tame us

Your bitch wants me, your girl do too
I'm grippin' on her butt, what the fuck you gonna do?

And if you don't know I blow dro, oh so fact

A to the B, see I'm stickin' to the G code
Bitch, I mean he throwed, overseas, three shows
Pickin' from my zips, smokin' three O's with three hoes

Running from the rat race
Pitched in through the people
That I dished it like a half day
And God plays probably a little bit too much
But my lesbian chick owe me their head
She's my fruit punch
Total round sun down
They're gonna fuck the moon I tell you
Rayna she can join in just turn my nap
Toes up dismember all your members yeah
I'm coming through with crew cuts
And I never liked snakes in my hair like Medusa
Moved up to two cups I used to get stoned
New sluts to school  my tuba till I'm blown
I just had to get off
Pants our passion
Visualize and making it happen
Maybe i should fasten my seat belt cause
My training Das is on a railroad it's on a fast track
To laughing to the bank no D-Rail
Hate now love later
Playing around in the playground and I'm the playmaker
Make way just plays best
Its a bet that I'm up next
I'll take your money and your people
And if she calls me honey
Then she's got to leave because
She's buzzing to close get the fuck about my hive and all that loving you quote once turned a ho into a wife
Hate to break it
Looking up to famous people is your downfall
Living boxed in is why I can't be around y'all
My crowns on bossed up King shit
This Jack made me wanna fuck Queens brain drinking

Tell me why you're doing so much
Just relax

Yeah I used to fuck this Mexican when I was 17
My dad told me it was dangerous but it doesn't seem
So irrelevant caught up in teen embellishment
Fucking next to bullet holes
Tell the baby daddy I'm innocent
Don't need those problems in my life across the street
Her older brother so my survey every site and especially at night
I got the bethoven in some rundown apartments
Finding out what makes the most
I ain't tryna start shit
Fuck

Yeah, you're doing too much
Swear to god, you're doing too much

Million from a beat, that's the feed it will cost ya
I'm that guy, I dont need the credits to prove it
I'm getting ahead of my music, you up for green but you blew us all
Maybe cause you knew us so you got past
It's for the green, only speed and my shots fast
I got a shot glass filled with the finest
The world added me and your bumbs got minus
Now I'm bout to climb this ladder to the stars
Henny bottle straight to the neck like scars
I stepped on Mars, so Earth hoes go away
I put blumbs up and watch the world rotate
And back in '08, me and bugies used to kick it
Maybe for the studio, we where shitting on your bitches
On the highschool team, have a highschool dreams
Never follow sue but the clues on screen, motherfuckers
Damn

I celebrate life, everytime I wake up
Thank god, I can breath and I ain't cuffed
You need to shape up, yeah at the line with your attitude
Go and hit the bank up, and get a sence of grattitude
I'm mad at you but glad at you and not me
I went and bought a couple diamonds at the swap-meet
Guess what it cost me, about an hour
Just because its stores doesnt mean it ain't a flower
Basically I'm saying that, half a mankind
Tries to be the judge but ain't trying do the time
I'm just tryna rhyme, only over my shit
Cause in my mind theres a fullblown marspit
Guess I gotta watch it, and record my observations

Out here feeling like give me the million
Give me the platform for wanting
I might as well ask for it
Too much mileage
Mileage on the dashboard not enough stamps on my passport
Trying to let the bullshit fly by

A little bit of bark just to let you know
Move to the states when she was like seven
Who would have thought she found hell in heaven
Rebelling, black sheep of the family
Doing drugs way too early
Damn she's dropping out now
We're only seventeen
What the fuck is up now
Lotta coke, lotta reefer
Half of the family moved back cause of visas, ya
Just heard from the dad
Before she got arrested
Month and a half in jail
Worried about getting deported
No papers 10K
Luckily some dude swoops
Sets her free but she's not include in
He's beaten, cheating into the lifestyle
She left him more rum shots
And moved in with another motherfucker not about shit she discovered your
Trick game throw him
Old enemy tryna turn to a new friend
Of course she's better
Of course she's got middle fingers up stupid nigga

Legendary status, secondary is the cabbage
Arrivederci you fairies all y'all are barely average
I'm very savage when it comes to this
My blood is in my beats as if the keys were here to cut my wrist
I ran out of fucks to give, ain't no way I'm turning back
'Bout to heat this game with this flame, where's the furnace at?
Might have been the first to bat, but you striken' out though
And I'm battin, clean up while you reason with the Valpo
Catch me with some alco, all for Columbians
Before the fun begins I reinforce what kind of fun this is
I'm just Kurt Cobain makin sweet Courtney Love in this
Paradox of power picture perfect purple succulence
All up in my lungs and shit, livin like I'm dead already
Maybe cause I am so when I speak you get confetti ready
I'm ahead of many let me demonstrate my tactics
Just  sippin' Henny, got machetes in my classics
Tell me who can match this?

Move out, move out
It's about to be a motherfuckin' shoot out, shoot out (Yeah)
Move out, move out
Cause my words'll fuck your world up and my beats will blow your brain so
When you hear my name, act accordingly
Move out, move out
It's about to be a motherfuckin' shoot out, shoot out (Yeah)
Move out, move out
Cause my words'll fuck your world up and my beats will blow your brain so
When you hear my name, act accordingly

I'm barking like a dog on my smooth instrumental
But dog is God backwards so I'm Zeus in the kennel
In this booth going mental
Envisioning the podium
The world is in the stands so in my hands is where I'm holdin' them
Shoutin' out to God, let me know if I'm controlin' them
Maybe with some Jays and some chains, they be noticin'
They can try and sleep, but these beats will osmosis them
I got a motive to promote with them
I'm the doctor, just be patient, I just got the diagnosis in
I'm focusin' on soaking in the reason that the hope is dimin'
What's provokin' it is flaws in the public
The people gettin' chosen got no flows and got no substance
Only got that club shit, how long can that last though?
Granted I get drunk and love the club but not for cash flow
Bunch of assholes whine about how they women drop they ass low
And yet they buy the music that these rappers use for lassos

Move out, move out
It's about to be a motherfuckin' shoot out, shoot out (yeah)
Move out, move out
Cause my words'll fuck your world up and my beats will blow your brain so
When you hear my name, act accordingly

Move out, move out

When you hear my name, act accordingly

Okay this 8x11's gettin' smaller
Dreams are gettin' bigger 'bout to grab' em by the collar
'Bout to get some dollars, then some South Americans
Fuck first names I'm just worried 'bout a heritage
Says she's got swag, but she needs someone to share it with
Pour another shot, rollin' leaves like I'm Erickson
Maybe we'll experiment, only for a night though
Tell her brainstorm, blow my horn, I'm the maestro
After that it's back to makin' fire like a pyro
Gettin' love from the A, all the way to Cairo
'Bout to do some lipo
On this whole rap game
Cut the fat and throw it out back in the trash can
Livin' in the fast lane
Ridin' with my beat on
Couple mamacitas blowin' reefa in my Nissan
Soon to be a Gotti cause I'm shitting on you peons
And the fucking weed strong
That's what we on
It's Diemon motherfuckers

Move out, move out
It's about to be a motherfuckin' shoot out, shoot out (yeah)
Move out, move out
Cause my words'll fuck your world up and my beats will blow your brain so
When you hear my name, act accordingly
Move out, move out
It's about to be a motherfuckin' shoot out, shoot out (yeah)

I overstayed my welcome (Sorry)

Fuck the clouds you bringing through
You can't rain on my window
I'm ashamed you'd even try
My  armor's full of bullet holes
And honestly I'm getting sick and tired of always pulling hoes
'Cause everyone's the same

Then that feeling won't remain
After I'm done with the brain so
Where's my cup? Fill it up
I'm drinking to alleviate
Please don't try to mediate
Hugging curbs keeps me straight
I'm looking for some weed to bake
A beat to make so back up
Running through this jungle making rumbles, fucking tracks up

Hands to the sky, put your hands in the sky

I do it like no other, I see Grammy's in my dream
So everything between is living life until it happens
Postpone the moment but I own it when it happens

Hope is on my back you don't have to pressure that
I'ma bring the better map, God is all aboard too
Faith in my fate makes me great when I forge through
I missed the blow up, I'ma grow up to a king though
Trying on the the crown and looking down will help drink slow
So while this brown gets in me this crowd will get me
I don't have to specify, I set aside the envy
And keep moving on through the storm
Fuck the rain, fuck the norm
I don't give a fuck no more

That's how I used to wake up, then I had to wake up
Change the scenery, I still got greenery to faze out motherfuckers

Snow White so straight but her head so curly
Cold white skin but her soul's so dirty

Everybody  move
The  ship's about to leave the dock
If you wanna board then sword from in-between the rocks
We gone wave our flags high, the bad guys
Flippin'  of the Rabbis
Why  the fuck you take it there
Why the fuck you ask why
Askin'  were I'm goin' who I'm bonin'
How I know I'm what I'm smokin'
Why is everything a question that's provoking me to lash out
My ass is out cause I don't give a fuck
Livin'  life on thin ice
Still try a flip the puck
Bugus sayin' hit the blunt
It's the purple lurkel pack
Our circles got no  though we hurdle all your turtle traps
Running 'round the finish line
I'm gone make the top stop
Blame it on the spinach guy
'Cause I'm gone make your eyes pop
Who's coming with this heat?
I could paint the Sistine
Chop it with my beats and then I'll touch it up with sixteens
I spit dreams out like they were mucus
You're praying to Jesus while your girl's lying with Judas
I'm a student of my enemies
Whiskey mixed with Hennessy
Got me feeling fucked up
Feeling like there's ten of me
I'm smoking on some Kennedy
Straight to the head, that's Russ' secret recipe
I play until I'm dead, 'til my last breath
Looking, looking for some queens out in Maspeth
I spot an actress, brown hair and red lips
Living to be dead rich
Hoping that's a bad girl that give's me good head
It's a Venus flytrap waiting in the f**king audience
Ambiance alone makes them redefine what naughty is
But I don't need no snotty kids so I'm going that way
Robbing all you jokers of my riddles in my batcave
What the fuck's the rap game?
I've got my own rules
Bumping Billy Paul, standing tall in my sole shoes
Hoping it's enough to beat the cuff's they're tryna put me in
Weed is color purple like I picked it up from Whoopie's friend
Used to be on campus, now I'm in the Hamptons
All these bitches on my racket so they call my Peter Sampras
Leave it for the canvas that I'm painting
Modern-day Picasso
Feeling like I've been vanished
And they're waiting to get on so

Here I am, peekaboo, see the roof I'm reaching through
Give her time and I'll be fine
The world's about to see the truth

If you can't swing then you better block your chin or move

Chew you up like dinner food, I'm in the mood to spaz
Fuck making beats, I make bombs, I make fracks
Name your favorite rapper and I bet you that he gags
More than lethal lip sucking dick for the cash
Blunts getting ashed, tops getting screwed off
You could buy time but you're amazed by a new watch
Living off an image, putting faith in a shoe box
My dreams are up fro sale, it's only costing me a few thoughts

Fuck you and your whole team, my flow's mean motherfuckers

I'm yelling at the universe to hurry up and open
Maybe God ain't chose me first but best believe I'm chosen
And even with my loans and my bones feeling broken
I'm dancing on the throne, blowing kush feeling golden
'Cause I'm living in the future, fuck this present day shit
Present time is past time so present is too late bitch
I'll be on my spaceship, crumbling these craters down
Drop a couple meteors and watch 'em take the haters down
I'm just tryna save the town, matter fact the galaxy
Paint a couple memories and hang them in the gallery
Fuck you if you're mad at me, I'm just living young God
Liquor in my cup and some swishers in my lungs
City slicker in my blood, Corleone state of mind
Made the universe an offer that it can't refuse
So I'm 'bout to blow up
Shock the world and take it then go back into the basement
My team will say ""We made it"" 'til we grow up

Lotta skill and no luck
You can keep the glitz, just mail me my award
I'll do speeches from the Ritz
Singing sweet songs and melody
Marley ain't no felony
Go and find the bird birds in the streets like Sesame
Yeah, I'm about to eat 'cause Russell's got the recipe

I would let the pen graze the paper, that was routine
Decked out in Jordan writing 'bout some bluejeans
That I didn't have but damn it they was sagging
I said I was from Queens just to believe that I was rapping
Wonder if my parents thought ""How'd the hell this happen?""
""How's my white kid got a black mans passion?""
But round of applause for the King and Queen
Yeah, they'd never mind when I would sing and scream
Always let me pick my dream not matter how unlikely

That we should go sex

But then it's back to traveling, all around utopia
Where phobias' don't have a friend
Yes, I am imagining, I prefer it this way
Lost enough to love in my reality it was misplaced, no mistake
I escaped, all the way to Shangri-La, lounging in my palace
Feeling like I'm Genghis Khan, scotch is in my chalice
Hummingbirds play my song
Clouds are my mattress
No more feeling anxious, I'm having

In this golden place of mine
Where I've chosen ways to find my euphoria
This is story of crossing over to the other side where the glory's from
Everything is ideal
Goddesses wear nothing but some high heels
You feeling wrong, they cook the right meal and serve you
And I'm not talking 'bout food
I'm talking 'bout the lips down low, talking rude

By the chimes of my melody's and rhymes
Smoking paradise
Nothing else to do but think and cherish life
And stare right in each eye
And see why I'm living
Access to this world is by taking, it wasn't given
I'm tripping of fishing and catching what I've been missing
So this is where I'm gonna stay
In my own mind, wouldn't have it any other way 'cause

No stress, wake up with no cameras on

Leaning on the shoulder of Summer but she's the Fall type
And I'ma winner, she's a sinner, this a false life
Hope  I'm in my phone when dream's call
'Cause  they don't call twice
But if I'm there I'll play the hand that I'm dealt
Piss  off all the dealers 'cause I'm scratching off the felt
As I'm going all in, going out with the bell
Middle fingers stay raised, zero fucks, how they felt?
Oh he's back? I'm myself
And  some may call that trust issues
I call it: My money's probably safer if I don't fuck with you
Even if it feels so real and the glove fits you
Take that shit off and examine it like your gut got you by
Don't try chancing it, once you put your hands in it
Past the point of no return, the burns don't bandage quick
I got a plan and my plan's not to plan this shit
Except to try and live alright and meet some Spanish chicks

I've got the city in the background

I've got some drugs in the background

This is what I call life
You nickname it how you wanna
I got the golden ticket from Willy Wonka
I treat the drama like apartheid
Which mean I segregate it
And separate it from myself
'Cause if I hesitated I'll be in a deep hole
Tryna find my way out
What's the use of steeples when I ain't got shit to pray 'bout?
I mean I do but what's the use? I can't be saved now
Or maybe I can if I just raise my hands and say it loud
And say it proud, I need help, I need guidance
If Sally could sell seashells could she buy this?
I'm being honest
We believe what we perceive
What we achieve, what we have seen
In the dream in between when it manifests itself
And when it was just a vision
I just hope that I'm not jaded by the time I change positions

Rotation,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lyrics from Snippet

Yeah, yeah
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Yeah

Something about you, I can't explain it
I keep you in rotation
I know I shouldn't, 'cause you're no good
I keep driving myself crazy

You got something that I'm feelin'
Hoes that I'm fuckin' in the evening
Sit back off shadows
2 A.M. knows all my secrets
Need to take way better care of me
Never learn my lesson, need therapy
Settle down, I got you on loop, though
Bumpin' on my stuff on a saturday (Woah, woah)

Something about you, I can't explain it
I keep you in rotation
I know I shouldn't, 'cause you're no good
I keep driving myself crazy

Yeah, McLaren whippin'
I'm leavin' early, like cherry pickin'
Wars with the stars, I'm Carrie Fisher
For something that will reel me out the scary vision
Your intentions are like rates and I'm barely hittin'
Marry spinnin' with the Julio dances
How does love built off of love lies feel truly romantic?
We be actin' like it's good, we need movie 
Somebody hit the gavel, Judge Judy show antics
These are spooky dynamics

You got something that I'm feelin'
Hoes that I'm fuckin' in the evening
Sit back off shadows
2 A.M. knows all my secrets
Need to take way better care of me
Never learn my lesson, need therapy
Settle down, I got you on loop, though
Bumpin' on my stuff on a saturday (Woah, woah)

Something about you, I can't explain it
I keep you in rotation
I know I shouldn't, 'cause you're no good

I’m crazy and you're crazy too
But I love that shit
You're bad and you're broken too
But I love that shit
Just be open to the possibility of me and you

Why we gotta argue?
We should pass around a bottle and a joint

I'm tryna touch your belly (Please), belly
Can you feel me? (Yeah, yeah)
I know you weren't there from the start
But, we got a lot of moments together
People tryna tear us apart, but they don't know what holds us together

I loved you quicker than most

Let Me Down,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
It's fucked up, yeah

Kevin was a young man chasin' goals
Met a girl last year and tried to take it slow
She was all broken, heart was real froze
He was all open, heart was real gold
He could tell she wanted love, just need convincin'
She could tell he meant well, he would listen
To what she was going through, he would show her the pain
But at the same time, she think it's apart of his game
She's been hurt in the past, you know, beaten and lied to
Same dudes that cheated, were the ones she would cry to
See, they had it twisted, thinkin' it was her fault
Now, she don't trust no one, even her on thoughts
So, she started runnin' games like her exes
Kevin came along at the height of her deception
As she felt a spark, not enough to make exceptions
How did men love while she was off gettin' pregnant?
With another dude Kevin always used to question
She would just deny it, get to undressin'
Fuck him just to shut him up and he still asked
She was too far gone, though, becomin' the past
She was lyin', he would plead for the truth
Kevin hung around, actually had him in a noose
'Til one night Kevin brought a gun and lost it
The last thing he told Ashley before he cocked it was, ""Will you let me?"" (Damn)

Down, let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down, if you-
Down, let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down

Now, Megan was seventeen, she was a senior
Friends with the pretty girls, jocks, cheerleaders
Got good grades, was loved by her teachers
Friday night games, she would party in the bleachers
Life so easy, parents both well-off
Breakfast every morning with each other, eatin' Kellogg
Maybe got it good, she ain't worried 'bout shit
But one Friday night changed her life in a blink
Post-game party at the star player's house
Got parents, got me, 'cause the parents outta town
Megan and her friends all drinkin'
Typical football players on a high, they invincible
Megan had enough, she stumbled upstairs
Down the bed, locked the door and laid right now
Tried to sober up, starts to hear the lock jiggle
Star player opens up the door and just giggles
She's on the bed and he takes it as a signal
She tries to resist, she's so drunk, she feels crippled
Plus, he's 6'2 and she barely five feet
She's laying on the bed, gettin' raped, ""Why me?""
He finishes up, makin' shy
She shakin', her thoughts do tornadoes
Her eyes start rainin'
Next of a week, she feel over and then she ever did
Tried to tell principle, but he said there's no evidence
Tried to her friends, the police, they ain't believe her
They were on the star player's side, even the teachers
Megan felt helpless, so one day, she skipped class
She was gonna home, she was drivin' fast
Parents still at work, so, Megan's all alone
So, she closes the garage, grabs a stool and a rope
Tears in her eyes, there ain't no other way out
Before she hung herself, the only thing she thought about
Was, ""You all let me-""

Down, let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down, if you-
Down, let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

Новая жизнь,UnKnown,2018.0,"Я выпил спрайт, и нет проблем, Передомной новая жизнь.(жизнь)
Это замкнутый круг,поможет мне друг,ведь я не такой как ты,проблемы со мной это игра судьбы

Моя новая жизнь я создал её сам, и мне ни кто не нужен ведь я не обрыган
Я добился всего сам мне никто не помогал и ни кто не предлагал
Друг есть всегда и его надо учить дружить
Я появился что-бы изменить этот мир
Но он наполнен кучей дряни и фигни
Меня прикроет мой бро, ведь ему не всё равно
Ведь ты не настоящий это видно по волосам
Мы так связаны с природой
Я уже устал жить, в этой коробке
Хочешь быть мне другом, но ты этого не достоин!
Ты стреляешь прямо в спину, но мой бро так не считает
Ведь он так круто меня прикрывает
Сделай харакири, и всё будет не так долго

Новая жизнь снова гуляю и отдыхаю
Новая жизнь снова я мои братья
Новая жизнь снова ты и стая ишаков
Новая жизнь жизнь жизнь
Мы найдём так быстро выход
Но ты крутишься в этой мусорке проблем
Повторяй за нами, ведь мы едим в сбербанк снимать кэш (кэш)
Смотри хоть сколько на меня, ведь ты не будешь прежним
Пока я писал этот трек, попивая новенький blazer
Чувак это жизнь но у тебя она стара
В мире много дураков таких же умных как я
Опять ты приходишь домой но тебе там не уютно
И не возвращайся к нам
Ведь мы не будем ждать тебя!
Мы поднимаемся выше,но к сожалению ты идёшь не снами
А только опускаешься, тебе этого не исправить
Вся твоя банда улетела за три дня
Передавай нам привет из маршрутки, пока мы ездиим на Бентли
Но мы едим не к тебе, а сбер
И ты был никем много лет, а сейчас у нас свой блок
Но у тебя ничего! Ведь новая жизнь только наступает

Новая жизнь это как будто New game
Новая жизнь всё снова новое
Новая жизнь Пацаны меня прикроют
Новая жизнь,жизнь,жизнь",https://genius.com/Russ--lyrics
Russ Power 106 Freestyle,UnKnown,2016.0,"Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

Strippers in Houston, I've dabblin' with quite a few
Couple million up off SoundCloud, that's quite a view
Why are you so mad? That's something lames do
I don't need a pistol, but that's something that chains do
My visions, they came true and they keep on comin'
I got women wrapped around the block
And they keep on runnin'
If I show my face, know your place
Think before you comment on this DIY pioneer
Reach before I dot it on this line, don't cross it
Mine, on some boss shit
That's why I parted, instead of signed, fifty-fifty profit
Movin' state to state to state to state, then country hoppin'
Poppin' twenties for these bitches, nah
I got my twenties poppin'
Yeah, by my forties, forty P's is what my fortune reads
My advice could adverse and let the chorus breed
Forty G's, that's unlike me
I ain't gotta say shit, they just get offended 'cause my ice speaks
Why he got so many bad bitches down to be wifey?
Shout-out to my women in the bay, gettin' hyphy
I can get with the family, 'cause that's good for my psyche

Russ K104 Freestyle #1,UnKnown,2016.0,"Turkish baths, Italian dinners, Columbiana women
French wine, Saudi princes in my Egyptian Linen
That's just how I'm livin', lately it's been fast-paced
Not racist, but my Rollie got the black face
Yeah, I tell your wife, ""Take the night off""
I fly out, I turn my hoes into write-offs
One-man band, I'm seven people in the studio
I drink Tanqueray (Uh), not Don Julio
Do you, don't worry 'bout what I'm doin'
Got a chick out in Houston, don't worry who I'm screwin'
Movin' (Yeah), livin' out a suitcase
The Middle East loves me, I got wives out in Kuwait
Too many women, Milan said I need a second phone
Hartsfield-Jackson startin' to feel like a second home

If your hands up for my money
Just know I don't play Patty cake
Don't tеll me to keep my cool
I'm not The Fonz, this isn't Happy Days
I mean this is, but I'm smart with my dividеnds
Pool full of savings that my kid's kids swimmin' it
Synonym for self-belief is ""R-U-S-S""
Ten years of looking in the mirror, are you next? Yes
That's what it really took, I came a long way
I remember stackin' shoes that are off broadway
Back when I fell in love with a co-worker
But I had to leave, 'cause I'm a boss, and not a co-worker
And now, women fallin' for me daily
But how am I suppose to save the day if any bitch would date me?
That's marriage talk, but I'm young and too reckless
Twenty of your wifeys wouldn't raise on my necklace
What was once expensive is fancy illusions
Guess it's all relative like family reunions
I never started, would the family be ruined?
If I haven't stopped what would the family be doin'? (Damn)",https://genius.com/Russ-russ-k104-freestyle-1-lyrics
I’m So Disappointed In You*,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lyrics from Preview

And you so nuts, crazy as fuck
Beggin' me just to get a response
I'ma ignore you, fuck what you want
Pick it up with you and yourself and your guy
You do your line now, just do your time now
I'm so disappointed in you
You end up bad, now
Ain't no coming back, now

Yeah, yeah
Why you gotta act so crazy, girl?
You know I wanna break from this crazy world
Last thing I need is some drama
More, I shoulda listened to my momma
But I'm only twenty-six, plaques on the wall
12k square feet and I live alone
What you expect? I got women on call
 make use of my home
So, I had you come through
You walked in on 10
We ain't even make it to the room
Soon as you left, though, I left you on rеad
I thought 

And you so nuts, crazy as fuck
Beggin' me just to get a rеsponse
I'ma ignore you, fuck what you want
