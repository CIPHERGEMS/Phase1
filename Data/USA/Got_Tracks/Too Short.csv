Life Is... Too Short,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"I remember how it all began
I used to sing dirty raps to my Eastside fans
Back then, I knew you couldn't stop this rap
No M.C. could rock like that
Then the new style came, the bass got deeper
You gave up the mic and bought you a beeper
Do you wanna rap or sell coke?
Brothers like you ain't never broke
People wanna say it's just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mic and I'm not jokin'
Sir Too Short comin' straight from Oakland
California, home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block
Short Dog, I'm that rappin' man
I said it before and I 'll say it again

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short

Life is to some people unbearable
Committing suicide and that's terrible
Was it much too much or nothing big?
If you live my life, you'd be fightin' to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin' all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
I'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place
Everybody's got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz, keep your bank right here
Never hear me stutter once 'cause I talk real clear
It's on you, homeboy, whatcha gonna do?
You can take my advice and start workin', fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day, homeboy, ya soon find out

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short

Life is too short, would you agree?
While I'm living my life, don't mess with me
It's been a long time, baby, since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
'Cause I don't stop rappin', that's my theme
I make a lot of money, do you know what I mean?
Life is, complicated, you must stay up
You're asked a simple question boy, don't say ""What?""
Ya only live once and ya callin' it hell
Policeman tryin' to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you don't know
In a matter of time, I'll be runnin' the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin' big money, slangin' hop
The task force tryin' to peel your cap
Turn around, homeboy, you better watch your back

Life is too short
Life is...

You can take back all the things you give
But you can't take back the days you live
Life is to some people heaven on earth
Livin' every single day for what it's worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfying one person I know, that's me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when I'm on the mic
'Cause if a dream is all you got, homeboy
You gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
No time to waste, just get on that case
Can't be down 'cause you need to taste
A good life, livin' like a king on a throne
Getting everything you want and trying to handle your own
It's your life, don't be stupid though
'Cause when you waste it, you'll know life is...
Life is...
Alright, that's it",https://genius.com/Too-short-life-is-too-short-lyrics
Blow the Whistle,Blow the Whistle,2006.0,"I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated, do the math
I made 1,000 songs that made you move your ass
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word?
BITCH!
Why they gotta say it like $hort?
BITCH!
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs
Stay on the porch

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Where you get that from?
Grab the mic, spit one, let me hit that blunt
Pimp-C, 8-Ball, and MJG
Keep spittin' that P to the I-M-P
Bun-B, that's Texas, baby
Ball and G, that's Memphis, baby
$hort Dog, that's Oakland, baby
Ain't nothin' but pimpin' these days, G
My nigga C got locked up
But these real hoes still know they gots to fuck
Give a fuck nigga what you say
$hort Dog fuck with UGK
Do you really wanna be like me?
Spit game like Snoop and T.I.P
Pretty girls in the VIP
They came with Dre... they don't need ID

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Your mind is gone
Your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last 3 days
Poppin' pills
It goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my shit gets around
Leave the country, come back, and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York, and ATL
Houston and LA, ask Dave Chappelle about my rich bitch
He got it from me
And made 50 million dollars
I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it!

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
BITCH!

Don’t Fight the Feelin’,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"Say ho
Yeah you
Can I ask you a question?
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don’t want me to talk to you like that?
Would you like to make love?

I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and you’re so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I’m a mack, I cold turn you out
I won't ask, and I sure won’t beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it? Don’t watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I’ll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I’m the man
I take you out to the finest restaurant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers? I’ll buy your ass a rose
But later on you’re coming off with them pantyhose
You want gold, girl what’s next
Its me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I’m just a freak
Give it up baby, I can’t wait two weeks
I want it all, Don’t say I won't
Get it girl, now I’m telling you don’t

Nigga please, you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort because of your height or your width?
Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
This is Entyce and Barbie from the Danger Zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...

Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...

Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust
Wait, small thing I hate
For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me shows audacious behavior
I've got to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step into my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Dare to say you got some? Nigga please your lying
Cause to fight the feeling, there would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...

I am the rapper that they call 4-tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't nobody tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really don't take too long
But a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give her some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a camisole
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me none...

Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way too real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank ho
Go get your bank ho
My little dick'll have you screaming no
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I really can't say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!!",https://genius.com/Too-short-dont-fight-the-feelin-lyrics
I’m a Player,Get In Where You Fit In,1993.0,"And we sure do like to play
I'm a player, and I'm playing just to play

You see I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I'll be a player for life, so where's my wife?
Probably at the rehab stuck on the pipe
'Cause she must be smoking and I'm not joking
Too Short baby comin' straight from Oakland
Got way mo' bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
'Cause I can give you a bitch and wouldn't give you joint
Bitches ain't shit and now I made my point
So you can light that weed while I spit this rap
And tell you 'bout a player from way back
I was only fourteen when I first got my dick sucked
Now I'm grown up and I really like to bust nuts
Gettin' freaky in the right situations
You wanna rap, well that's a nice occupation
To get pussy when you want and how you want it, fool
'Cause I was fucking ugly hoes back in high school
I used to fuck young-ass hoes
Used to be broke and didn't have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tell a story 'bout rags to riches
'Bout a pimp named Shorty from the Oakland set
Been mackin' for years and ain't fell off yet
So if you ever see me rollin' in my drop top Caddy
Throw a peace sign and say 'Hey, pimp daddy!'
'Cause I never would front on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
Bitches come a dime a dozen
So don't get mad when I fuck your cousin
Your two sisters, I even fuck your ex-bitch
Short Dog in the house with some player shit...


All the fake players peep game from the real
Player hatin' lover tell me how do ya feel
When you front to the homies how you grind 'em
Look fo' a tramp, but you can't find 'em
You got one girlfriend and see her every night
Come around her partners, lyin' about your life
Looked at your watch it said 6:22
Cut to the house and said 'Baby, I love you'
Can't act like a mack like playboy Sho'
And the rest of the macks in the streets of the O, bitch!
Comin' up we learned how to break these hoes
And when you're through gettin' yours then you shake these hoes
And when you're older, it's nothin' but a routine
Makin' G's every day, workin' blue jeans
I know I seen it before, I see it again
Young tender saying 'Short, would you be my man'


Yeeeah, there's a lot of fake players out there
Talkin' bad about Ant Banks, you know what I'm sayin'
But I ain't trippin tho
Short Dog, what you do about them player haters?

Tryna stay away from Kris Kross imitators
Put ya in a cross 'cause they're really just haters
I thought you knew, Short Dog is a player
Born to mack, and got bitches everywhere
I ride around town in my clean-ass cars
Screenin' these hoes like movie stars
Checkin' my traps like a dirty rat
I was born to mack, I'm hookin' hoes like crack
I be a monkey on your back, bitch
Until you kick that Short Dog habit got you all on my dick
And even though I can't fuck you every day
That's cause I got another bitch around the way
We can all get together on a late night
Cut to the house hook somethin' up real tight
I really don't care
'Cause I'm a player...",https://genius.com/Too-short-im-a-player-lyrics
Gettin’ It,Gettin’ It (Album Number Ten),1996.0,"That's right, album number ten, Short Dawg's in the house
It's gettin close to the end y'all
But we gonna kick it like this on the last album

Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
In your ear for a minute, quit complainin'
'Bout how you can't spend it 'cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get your mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
You should be gettin it, gettin money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnnie Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, 'Hell nah I didn't pop him'
Get your kids in school so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin real good, taking care of my folks
Roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short Dog's in the House, I know you ain't trippin'
'Cause Life is Too $hort, you gotta Get In Where You Fit In
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think, you got to read between the lines
'Cause life ain't long for a young black man
Tryin' to make money doing all he can
Sellin' dope, don't ya hope he would go to class
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
With the twenties on top and the fifties on bottom
A flock a top notches, oh yes, we got 'em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds

Get your money, mayne
Get yours

You should be gettin' it
Get it while the gettin' is good, get it while you can
You should be gettin' it
Get it while the gettin' is good

Get your money, mayne
Get yours
You should be gettin' it

I know you tired of bein' broke, just hangin' out
You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set yourself some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
And work hard, never stop hustlin'
'Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin'
(So what are you sayin', Todd?)
It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
'Cause I'm one in a million, black men risin'
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise 'em
Spend my money in the 'hood, I know it's all good
And you should do the same, I told you peep the game
From Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand 'cause I know I can
I keep goin' and goin' but I'm not the pink bunny
Instead of beatin' on the drum, I never stop thinking money
I'm gettin' all I can, if you don't, ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich, I can't be fake, I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep makin' these funky sounds


I earned my respect in the street
The ghetto's been good to me
I'm never going to turn my back
The true and living so I gots to kick the facts",https://genius.com/Too-short-gettin-it-lyrics
The Ghetto,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Talking bout the ghetto...funky, funky ghetto
Trying to survive, trying to stay alive

The ghetto
The ghetto
(Talking bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)

Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same and it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
Black man trying to break into my house again
Thought he got off dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto

The ghetto
(Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto
(Trying to live our lives)
The ghetto
(Won't ya tell 'em 'bout it Too $hort)

So just peep the game and don't call it crap
'Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby died just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house, no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She'd rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself
Housing Authority and the O.P.D
All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto...

The ghetto
(People are dyin')
The ghetto
(Children are cryin')
The ghetto
(Don't have enough to eat)
The ghetto
(Don't even have shoes on their feet)
The ghetto

Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like TOO $HORT
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

The ghetto
(Tryin' to get out of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(But I got no place to go)
The ghetto
(Tryin' to survive in the heart of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Ha, 'cause that's the only place that I know)

So much game in a Too $hort rap
Can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short Dog is in the house, you better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black, stand tall and hard
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen, it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my people try to get out

The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Funky, funky ghetto)

The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Tryin' to stay alive)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)

Make your ass touch the floor till your legs is broke
Take that big ol' booty girl and scrub the ground
You can do it up and down and round and round
As long as that pussy ain't stiff
Dance and make all the niggas look at that shit
Like a stripper at a club in the 
ATL
Lil bitch tore it up and started raisin hell
I remember Magic City before the Freaknik
Before the police went on all them weak shit
All them big hoes, get loose with it
All them skinny hoes, let Bruce Bruce hit it
Let a nigga fuck tonight
Damn right bitch, fuck my wife
You my slut for life
You know all I do, is count that cash

I bet she can't wiggle like with a dick in her
Have a motor booty contest and pick a winner
When she runnin', you never see a ho come in last
She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
Its been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
Its lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink, Tequilla shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

Now put your ass on his dick
Let him know you the baddest lil'bitch
Put your hand on your clit, ask him do he like that shit
The way you move your butt
All he wanna do is fuck
Outside him and you in the truck
Sex so good you can't do it enough

Bounce that ass bitch
Bounce that ass bitch
Bounce that ass bitch

Freaky Tales,Born to Mack,1987.0,"These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard she was freakin' from my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She'll only start talking about signing a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
An X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than a tail on a whale
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames in hell
I G'd this girl, her name is Tammy
I didn't wanna do it 'cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespan
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name's Janine
She was 32 and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back and I watch her mop me
Two tons of fun, big Mamma Jamma
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her trying to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Dinah
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm having so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my house and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I'll tell you more
She was down on her knees begging to blow
She's like another freak named Renée
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Renée, you can have it your way...

I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than a Century Safe
Let me tell you this since we're talking young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talking about having fun
Once again at the pad I had it going on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get funky like ""Female Funk""
So when you see me coming or see me going
I keep my money, let the hoes keep hoeing
I once met a hooker, she did it for free
On the Foothill bus number forty-three
All the way in the back she was working me
Had my big beatbox and I was jamming the beat
I met this freak named Antoinette
Macked on baby like an ice cold vet
Everything she had is what I get
'Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that Too $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she could suck my peter
Or either go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name out my telephone book
Never again took a second look
'Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept looking while I kept staring
Baby came through with my homeboy Darren
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearing
She never left, he cut out
I know you all know what I'm talking about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's getting thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's going on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door working lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
The homeboys called her 'Belinda the Blender'
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl looked like Olive Oyl
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad, her blood would boil
But I wrapped her all up like aluminum foil

Sugar Delight
Friday night
It's going on
Too $hort
Three weeks ago, I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hid around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita
Her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my house and homeboy, I G'd her
Sent her on her way
The very next day, Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped into this girl, her name's Roshawn
We hit the motel and had it going on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Shari
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg and let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top, she was up under
The bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with a girl named Kitty
She was so fine with her big fat titties
All night long she was acting shitty
So I macked on baby like I was 
Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to ride baby like brand new Vogues
I never saw Rose wearing clothes
She's a Penthouse pet, ready to pose
I was riding down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to palm it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I'm the only man who ever called her honey
Everything I did to her was funny
I macked on Bunny and I took her money
Eight, tonight, a date, with Shirley
She was real short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirley was freaking like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed, then I got on
I grabbed the microphone and started singing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freaking
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment...",https://genius.com/Too-short-freaky-tales-lyrics
Cusswords,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"So you motherfuckers thought I was gonna change my style?
- So what are you saying Todd?
To all you bitches, hoes, and all that shit
Here's another rap that I'm ready to spit
It goes like this, my name is $hort
I'm tearing shit up like never before
Pimp slaps, making snaps
Cold cash money and Too $hort raps
Oakland, California that's where I'm from
The city where the boys say you don't want none
But if you do, I'm gonna tell you this
Trues and Vogues ain't really shit
Wanna roll so hard, all of the time
You and that bitch playing Too $hort rhymes
If you ask me what it's all about, I'll say it's about that money
But if you ask me could you have some, I'll say it doesn't concern me
Ronald Reagan came up to me and said, ""Do you have the answer
To the U.S. economy and a cure for cancer?""
I said, ""What are you doing in the White House if you're not selling cocaine?
Ask your wife, Nancy Reagan, I know she'll spit that game
Like one night, she came to my house, and gave me a blow job
She licked my dick, up and down, like it was corn on the cob""
What is life? Life is Too $hort
I play young bitches like it's a sport
Yeah, I play the bitches just like y'all
Like Dr. J played basketball
You can call me Too, don't say it twice
You'll get me real mad and I'll fuck your wife
You see I'm not proper, I'm rarely polite
Too $hort, Too $hort, don't say it tonight, biatch
It started on a bright morning in 1987
I was in my drop-top Caddy y'all
Getting sucked by a bitch named Helen
Nasty bitches, around the world, I wrote this rhyme for you
You might not like my rap, but I'm telling you bitch it's true
So much death in the Oakland streets
Am I gonna live till next week?
Will I get shot by a dope fiend
Trying to get high, trying to steal my ring?
I really can't say, 'cause I don't know why
People out here dropping dead like flies
I used to see a home boy, give him five
Now I say, ""Man, you still alive?""
Cold as hell, this town I'm from
Won't last too long when you're faking the funk
I'm the master rapper, so unique
Clap my hand when I want my freak
You can't deny it, you know I'm right
I turn any rapper out when I'm on the mic
And I won't kick back, or relax
Till he knows I'm the best at the MC rap
Till he knows Too Short, set the trap
That got him caught up in my serious cap
Motherfucker can't spit straight game on the mic
'Cause he's worse than a fag or a 
Frisco dyke
He's a sucker MC, I call him punk
Trying to spit that rap, you can scratch that junk
You little punk-ass boy, wouldn't listen to me
Think I'm faking but I'm taking all you sucker MC's
To the end of the world and push you over
Good luck couldn't find you in a four leaf clover
If I ever said a rap trying to cap on you
I wouldn't even sweat it 'cause you'll be through
Looking so far up, you might fall down
Getting clowned by the hound from east Oaktown
And the look in your face when you're looking at Too
Could make a grown man die, laughin' at you
'Cause you're a no rappin', no rhymin'
Played out fake ass Simple Simon
I never understood one word you said
But you're swearing up and down that you're killing me dead
There's only one thing, I wanted to know
Sucker motherfucker, where's the joke?
I'm the player of players, just call me Pop
My name is Too $hort, no I don't stop
I just don't stop mackin', don't stop cappin'
Don't stop rappin', now you see what happens
Your mind is gone, your crew just cut
Sucker MC I'll tell you what
Your rhymes are weak, your rap the same
And when it comes to game, you are lame
Never even heard of Too $hort baby
Hit Oakland in 1980
Singing more raps than a rap could rhyme
Telling sucker MC's don't waste my time
There's a girl I know her name is Betty
Straight to the head just rock it steady
She's so freaky she'll juice you up
All the home boys just can't get enough
She's a Ph.D., don't even stop
In the back like that going chop chop chop
I won't say white girl, won't say she's black
She's the kind of girl that make your knees go crack
Feel the beat, rock with me
Let me tell you what I be
I'm a MC rapper, a MC rapper
A big bank roller and a cold, cold capper
Hey baby, I got this rhyme
It's not gonna stop till the end of time
Like rock and roll I'll play that song
To the beat all day and all night long
So listen up, to what I'm saying
I'm a Oaktown mack, bitch I ain't playing
To all the home boys doing time in the pen
Gonna rock this beat for you once again
If you can't get out and you're mad as hell
Say beeatch, now make it sound for real
I'mma tear shit up if I get the chance
I could give a fuck less if your ho don't dance
See I'm a big mack now, I'm so great
I was born and raised in the Golden State
Call me T.O.O.; if you say $hort
I'mma rap my ass off till you give me some more
Big bank, now just make me rich
Bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
Check out my style, baby I don't quit
I heard this freak say, ""That's the shit
He took the cake, fucked the rake
Too $hort baby damn sure ain't fake.""
But the sucker MC's are screaming loud
Saying Sir Too $hort, shut your mouth
How can you talk about me, and call me weak
When your father smokes coke and your mother's a freak
So I keep on rappin' if nothing else
Keep your jealous ass thoughts to yourself
 Picture this, he's a MC right
 Ain't saying nothing but he's holding the mic
 Fuck with me, and boy you're doomed
I'll send a trick with a ho to the motel room
'Cause I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Like a .357 pointed at your dome
I got cap for cap, you never heard
So fresh again with cusswords
Motherfucking shit, fucking with me
Fuck a skank bitch and a sucker MC
All you bastards got the claps
And fuck you punk 'cause you still can’t rap
Cusswords, just let em roll
Motherfucking shit, God damn asshole
Cusswords, just don't quit
Motherfuck you damn shithead bitch
It's Too $hort, on the mic, and it don't stop
And it don't stop, and it won't stop, beeatch

Cocktales,Cocktails,1995.0,"These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
You dont like my dirty raps? You can go to hell
Cause $hort Dawg is on the mic spittin Cocktales

H-E-A-D
All you washed-up hoes trying to throw that P
You're just a big freak, you better not complain
When you hear these cocktales and you hear your name
If you a fake bitch, ain't no thing
I'll pick up the phone and call Janine
If I call Marie, I know for a fact
I'm getting sucked in my drop-top Cadillac
I met this freak named Naomi
Straight dick-sucker, worked me and my homies
She had a girlfriend, her name was Vickie
I pulled her to the side and let her suck my dick
She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina
Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana'
I took her to my house and I told her ""strip""
Baby got freaky - started doing the splits
I said, ""Bee-yotch! Do what you want
Cause this true-blue mack won't even front""
I fucked her with my finger, she tried to cum
Pussy so tight it wouldn't give me none
I'm Too Short, baby, couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get freaky cause I love the funk
My dick is big and her nigga had a little one
I didn't fuck her freaky ass but it was still fun
I know you stop and wonder just what it is
It's the California lifestyle that I live
See I'm from the Crew, Dangerous, Bitch
I get on the mic and spit that freaky shit
I know this girl named Annette
Get her all alone and she'll suck your dick
Hella freaky, won't say no for shit
You and her all alone, nigga, that's your bitch
I know another freak her name's Joanne
I always get the pussy cause I know I can
Finest bitch around, ain't got no man
Every time she cross my mind I go fuck her again
She's like another bitch named Christina
Bitch so dumb, I named her ""misdemeanor""
Cause it had to be a crime to be that dumb
I took her to my house and she let me cum in her mouth
You know I did all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me, I'm gonna call that bitch
And go dig in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screaming I'm gonna fuck the bitch harder

Cause these are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales I tell so well
You don't like my dirty rap you can go to hell
Cause Short Dogg's on the mic telling cocktales

I meet the groupies, hookers like Kathy
Fucking MC's cause she's so nasty
See her backstage trying to throw that ass
She just like the freaks and she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on my vogues then I drop the bitch
My name is Short, my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs
I know a bitch named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass laying next to me
She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie
Angie called me up about 2 weeks later
Talking some shit about ""do me, player""
So I did her just like Tamara
Taking naked pictures with my Polaroid camera
Next they told a bitch named Raquel
Got my skin all under her fingernails
She was digging in my back while I grind the shit
That was way back, now I can't find the bitch
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break the bitch for everything, cause I came to pimp
I'm Too Short, baby, I don't stop macking
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rapping
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be fucking em up like that, bitch!
I know a bitch, her name was Sherry
I had to cut her loose cause she wanted to get married
Pussy so good and I do mean very
Sometimes it's shaved and sometimes it's hairy
I'm Short Dogg, ain't nothing nice
You ever make me mad and I'll fuck your wife
Have fun with your bitch and have her sprung on my dick
I guess I'll pull it out and just cum on your bitch
Like my other little tramp named Erica
Anywhere I want to fuck, that's where I fuck
Cause she's the freakiest bitch in America
And every time I get the pussy, I just tear it up
Cause these are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
You dont like my dirty raps you can go to hell
Cause Short Dog is on mic spittin Cocktales

Since he was young, homeboy won't back down
'Cause real gangsters always hold that frown
Until you lose control, then you sell your soul
To the devil, motherfucker, 'cause you're way too cold
And all the people hide and just run inside

Blow Job Betty,Get In Where You Fit In,1993,"Too $hort baby, I'm so hard
Pimpin' these hoes on the boulevard
But I'm not here to tell ya bout me
I got a little story bout a nasty freak
She's the kind of girl you think about in bed
Blowjob Betty givin' real good head
Bust a left nut, right nut in her jaw
Sperm on her cheeks is all ya saw
She could blow more head than a whale blows water
Blowjob Betty make your dick get harder
She's a one of a kind, a hell of a girl
A trip and a half around the world
Catch her gettin' busy, bitch wouldn't stop
She's the kind of girl that'll make your toes pop
Every time I used to see her, I would know what's up
Blowjob Betty better blow me up
I remember the day when I first met her
Bitch kinda loose so I knew I'd get her
Walked up to her said
""my name is $hort, just what you've been lookin' for""
Pimp is my game, I do it the best
Ho fuck with me, she don't get no rest
Well after that, I G'ed the freak
I used to stop by and fuck about twice a week
And from the very first time I went to her house
Walked in the door and stuck my dick in her mouth
$hort Dog'll get bitches anytime I wanna
Got a big dick and lay it right on her tonsils
Only stick it in about half way back
Cause if I put it all in, it bust straight through her neck
Niggas always sayin' how they fucked that bitch
But I'm the only nigga that the bitch made rich
Like any other tramp she loved to fuck
With any motherfucker got nuts to suck
I spit game to the bitch, just like this
Why you runnin' round suckin' all that dick for no money?
It didn't take long to stay true to the game
And get my pimpin' on
But every once in a while you get a stupid ho
Bitch ain't about money and she'll never know how to get it
Blowjob Betty was dumb
A fiend for a fuck and a mouth full of cum
She made money for a minute but she loved the sex
So I cut the bitch loose like a old school vet
6 months later, I'm still a pimp, I'm still a player
One night at a club, she was puttin' in work
All you had to do was step up to her
She was in the bathroom sayin' one at a time
Wasn't my bitch but she still was fine
So I went in the back room, seen the bitch
Slapped her on the head, said, ""you ready to switch?""
And to the players out there
Instantly, Blowjob Betty started servin' me
Cause the player I am to the day I'm dead
I was sittin' on the sink gettin' some head
It was all so good and much too true
One young freak and a whole damn crew
But then I shot that fatal nut
Must of knocked that bitch on her butt
She couldn't even breathe, she was holdin' her throat
Me and my homies just hit the door
My homeboy said ""$hort don't worry""
But that next day I read this story
A young girl died just last night
She choked on sperm in her windpipe
It was on her face, her neck, and chest
And we're sorry to say there's no suspect
When I saw that my brain clicked
I bust a nut and killed a bitch
It might sound sick, it might be petty
But ya never been sucked by Blowjob Betty!
Beeyatch!

I gotta get a bitch and get my dick sucked
From the weed house straight to the strip club
Gotta get a bitch and get my dick sucked
I pull heat from the heat rub
All I fuck wit is gangsters and strippers
She's a killa and a sweet thing
Set a nigga up, put the money in a G-string
Now throw them G's up
And tell a bitch, get up off your knees, slut
Cause we get rowdy tonight
Them scary motherfuckers know how we like to fight
That's why they leave when we show up
Then all you little bitches see me and hoe up
Square people, don't want me around
We get crunked in the A, we go dumb in the town
They say we like to clown
But we get too stupid on that hyphy sound, what!
How you like me now
All the gangsters and strippers
How you like my style
I fuck wit gangsters and strippers
I know I'm kinda wild
Like the gangsters and strippers
It's bout time you find out
All I fuck wit is gangsters and strippers
I don't blow no mist
I'm a California nigga, all the hoes know this
Yeah, we smokin purple
Pedal to the metal and we goin in circles
All we smell is weed and rubber
If I hit yo baby mama, I'm a motherfucker
Cause she's loving me
Staring at my face, she wanna fuck wit me
I wanna fuck her too
And I always know just what to do
Yeah, baby mama's a stripper
Town business, it won't take long to get her
Cause she's a cute little thick thang
I got her goin dumb on the dick man
I'm insane when I spit game
Then I dump em and flush em like shit stains
How you like me now
All the gangsters and strippers
How you like my style
I fuck wit gangsters and strippers
I know I'm kinda wild
Like the gangsters and strippers
It's bout time you find out
All I fuck wit is gangsters and strippers
You see me at the strip club
Outside, bout to pick a bitch up
Around four A.M
I'm up all night you know I am
And if you fuck wit me, I make one phone call
Call up's and G's relax
Don't tell me what to do, I kick back
And watch all hell break loose
I feel sorry for ya'll
Cause once they start you gotta fight 'em all
You see the front door, you better run
You never got jumped before? It's fun!
When you're doing the jumping
Turn his mothafuckin head into a pumpkin
Sock him in his mouth, knock the nigga out
Then take his girl to the house and dig it out, bitch!
Gotta get a bitch and get my dick sucked
I gotta get a bitch and get my dick sucked
Gotta get a bitch and get my dick sucked
I gotta get a bitch and get my dick sucked
Now how you like me now
I fuck wit gangsters and strippers
How you like my style

Cush cologne - feat. rico tha kidd & dj upgrade,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She keep callin me; she cain't leave me alone
Love the smell of my cush cologne
Yeah she on it, on it
Ridin that thang like a pony, pony

My cush cologne is in the breeze
I smell like weed, I ain't smoked no trees
But I got - a fat sack in my pocket
Do me like the purp' girl, smoke it, suck it!
Swallow it, hold it in
Take all of it, now you smoke it big
It's so big in your neck you wanna blow it out
Turn you on to some shit you don't know about
Used to be a good girl, but you hoein now
Knowin how niggas from The Town could burn you out
Smokin back to back and that's a fact
Like a little groupie she don't know how to act
So I break it down, spit a lot of game to her
I seen her runnin 'round with some lame dues
Turnin out hoes ain't a thang to me
I got her hooked on my game and the weed!


We in the club and they playin my song
Girl I see you over there hittin your drop until that clap on
Ed Hardy hat on, dress shirt with the bag on
I walk past, she said ""Damn daddy that's strong!""
That cush cologne got her hooked
Now she'll do whatever for a little of that cush
That cush? All up in my face like she know me, she phony
She really wanna smoke weed and ride that pony
I boxed the hallway in, now to cush my cologne
I tell her ""Bitch don't bother me when I'm up in the zone
I do my thang on stage girl that's how I get paid
I bust money moves girl while yo' ass renegade!"" Look
(You know you wanna hit this bud)
(We keep that  but she fuck with us)
(She only wanna get hiiiiigh)
(I think that's why)


Cannabis for men, take the buds off the stem
Rip her clothes off, she's smokin hot, weed hotbox with her friends
We puffin on out, dude he 'bout to get backdo'
The bomb had me home dictatin like Castro
She was on me, the tree just an icebreaker
Rolled both blunts, Swisher sweeter than a Life-Savor
Gave her the chills and the thrill now she like danger
Gettin high and fly with a life changer
Ohh! And I love to watch her hit the weed
I ain't gon' like, I take the Philly out and picture me
Got kidnapped and bribed with some weed
I'm a sucker for THC, That Hersh Cream
Pay taxes? We can play Madden
Kick it like Janikowski then run you like McFadden
Take it to the black hole, beat her with a black pole
Watch a sex tape, gettin higher than the Astros


Your bitch is on my dick nigga!
Cause I smell good, smoke good
We from The Town bitch!",https://genius.com/Too-short-cush-cologne-feat-rico-tha-kidd-and-dj-upgrade-lyrics
Rhymes,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"Without a doubt I'm coming back and if you don't know
Call me S-I-R T double O
I like to say these rhymes, I do it all the time
I make my own damn beat now all the money is mine
I carry big fat wads, I treat my girls like gods
Ask 'em ""who do they love?"" and they all say ""Todd""
I'm just an M.C. rapper and nothin' else
I keep rhymin' and I do it by myself
Could you be like me? I rap my nonstop rhymes
You will never hear pause when I say these lines
I go on and on, I'm sir Too Short
Just what you've been lookin' for
Like PCP or cooked cocaine
DJ universe got you sprung in the game
We make money, hear my rap from coast to coast
From host to host, I hear that toast:
""Too Short, love the way you make that hit
Here's to you, keep rhymin' and boy don't quit""
I say this is how it goes when I say my rap
Most times when I rhyme wouldn't be like that
Cause the way I write rhymes you will comprehend
I keep rappin' to the very end
And if you call me fake I'll say so what?
Got you standin' and noddin' like you just shot up
So boy straightin' up I'm still rappin'
Comin' at you fresh. Do you know what happened?
I'm sayin' rhymes messin' with your mind
I didn't want your girl cause she really ain't fine
I took her to a motel couldn't have been the hotel
It costs me 20 dollars but I did it so well
She had to tell your sister, your sister told you
Now the whole damn town calls me playboy too
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they don't stop
I'm lookin' at an empty page about to fill it up
I write only the truth, speak only to you
So if I tell you to say somethin' then you know what to do
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they never stop
I live in California, drive a drop top
Roll by the beach, look at the freaks
Jump in my car, do it every week
DJ's who know call me Mister Short
All you wanna be mothers get no child support
I'm Too Short baby gettin' rich
Get on the mic and then say... Like left to right
Right to left girl stealin' your heart is like petty theft
Like 10 to 9, 3 to 2
I'll always be one up on you
Like nightfall makes the sun go down
CRAZY RACK laid the beat changed your life around
From the sea to the mountains the mountains to the sea
All you're gonna do is wanna rock this beat
It's so rough so tough when I talk this stuff
When I get on the mic I can't get enough
I'm the rapper of the season, fresh and recent
All my raps are smooth undecent
I'm that rapper known place to place
For the hardest rap with the hardest bass
You see I rap all the time, that's the point
When I walk in the place , just jam the joint
Singin' old Too Short's on the microphone
The beat's so fresh can't leave me alone
You see I rap so cool I will not shout
I keep comin' so hard I might knock you out
If you're battlin' Short that's the chance you take
So you better come fresh and don't be fake
All you weak MC's with your weak drum beats
Tellin' all your people you can hang with me
Count 1 to 10 count 10 to 20 and I'll just keep on makin' money
Life is Too Short I don't stop
I'm hooked on money like a junkie on top
I got to make it every day, I won't go broke
Ask me am I rich and I'll say ""no""
I'm your homeboy Too Short back again
Puttin' Oakland on the map my rap will never end
I'd like to send a special thanks to the dangerous crew
For believin' in me when they thought I was through
I got rhymes, I keep 'em comin'
I'm on the mic, I won't stop rappin' till it comes out right
And when it's beatin' I'll just say ""let's roll""
I make another record and buy some gold
I keep rhymin' and I do it by myself
I'm like a one man crew, you see I don't need help
I get the job done so all you fake rappers, MC's, rap masters
Give it up leave that rappin' to me
Realizin' young buck you can't rock that beat
I rap on the mic and you'll believe
Nothin' ain't kickin' like the BIG OLD C
It's just one hard rapper spittin' a rap
Not 3 or 4 sucka's or a couple of saps
Like born to Mack I'll cash a check
Walkin' 'round like a fool livin' up to his rep
I'll tell you life ain't long
What you waitin' for?
Thought you wanted to be like Too Short?",https://genius.com/Too-short-rhymes-lyrics
Just Another Day,Get In Where You Fit In,1993.0,"I woke up one day in Vacaville
Round the corner from the pen, phat house on the hill
All the homies in the pen straight locked down
But I gotta get dressed and hit the Oaktown
I called Randy Austin on the telephone
Early in the morning but he still ain't home
So I called Ant Banks to see what's up
He said meet me at the studio at two o'clock
I got dressed, smoking on some serious dank
Grabbed my keys off the table and a big old bank
I hit Interstate 80 and I'm rolling
Joint's still burning and I'm smoking
I was on my way to San Jose
To the stereo shop that make my music play
Cause one amp shut down and the bass ain't playing
Didn't take long, for Joel and Janks to have me slumping
So I called up Boo--""What's up nigga, what you bout to do?""
He said, ""just kicking back waiting on the fellas
Bout to go eat at Della's""
I said, ""it sure sounds good to me
I can't go though, gotta hit Myrtle Street""
Passed the Acorns on my way, bitch, it's just another day

Every day in the motherfucking Oak-town, just another motherfucking day for Short Dog, you know what I'm saying? Roll up to the studio, lay down some funky beats
Drink some of that Old English, smoke some fat ones, fuck wit my partner

Big Banks came through and started mixing
Sitting in the studio kick back listening
To some funky ass shit from the Dangerous Crew
Debbie D came through, with FM Blue
Shorty B rolled up smoking fat ones
Pee-Wee had a crew in the back room
Goldie had the tramps giving head, breaking off
Rappin' Ron and Diddley-Dog
Twin One and Two is telling stories
Bout beating down niggas for the glory
Had to catch a plane that night and roll out of town
Everybody getting high, trying hard to clown
I had to go shop before its time to leave
I dipped to the mall, flipped me some jeans
Rolled on out like a playa
Hot ass day, bitches everywhere
I'm leaning hard to the left like a big shot
Checking out the hoes seeing who'll get knocked
Cause when you fuck with Short you get fucked quick
I run some drama on your ass and make ya suck dick
Ride through the OZ beaming it slow
Talking that shit how niggas on the four
Drive crazy, trying to tear up shit
It's just another day in Oakland, bitch

Yeah them niggas from East Oakland be driving crazier than a mothafucker man
Niggas over there on 84 beamin niggas always talkin about uhh: ""This how we
Drive on the '4 mayne, y'know."" Doing donuts and shit, running all up on the curb
Breaking up news cars and shit nigga. Really though though, that's some Oakland shit bitch

It was me, Jaque, Beamin and Tilo
Boo-Kicky, Slow Motion and PO
Spud, Ju-Ju, Frog and Big-E
Getting high on Orral Street
Bug, Joe-A, Ce-Ce and Mark
Rolling four deep from Sobrante Park
Howard came through from the B-Town
Motherfuckas getting high, it's going down
It's the same everyday everyday it's the same
But that night we hit the hoop game
Who was playing: Seattle versus Golden State
Hollered at the home boy Gary Payton
After the game, we went to his house
NBA Jams, turned us out
Niggas talking bout slamming bones
Any kinda way to get your gamble on
Bet, all you kept hearing was bet
Dice game on the pool table? fuck that shit
I ain't going outta town broke
I gotta have a bank get some dank to smoke
Think I'm gambling, you must be insane
It started getting late I had to catch that plane
So I cut to the airport
Just another day for Too Short

Yeah I do that kind of shit y'know, it ain't no thing but a chicken wing little bitch. Short Dog's in the motherfucking house, kicking it with QDIII on the LA scene, ain't no thing baby, cause uh, we coming up in the game that's how we do, we getting money, and we go here and there, and we clock the bank you know what I'm sayin?.............Bitch

I was high as fuck on the airplane
Thinking to myself 'bout street game
How a black man'll do you in a minute
Walk around the corner see some shit and get in it
How the police always trying to catch us
Fell asleep and woke up in Houston, Texas
Gangsta ass niggas from the fifth and the third
Take yo ass there nigga, fuck what ya heard
Next night we did a show, in New Orleans
Same gangstas same old scene
Yelling at seventh at ninth ward
I see my homies from the third and the fourth
It was me, Big Dog and the 8-Guard posse
Having fun and you just can't stop me
I did a show in Birmingham, Alabama
Then caught an airplane in Atlanta
I heard about the motherfucking freaknick
Popped that pussy ho, fuck that weak shit
You shoulda seen all the bitches on the street
Niggas from Detroit was deep
All my partners from the O flew up
And they was slanging that danky stuff
Getting high with some brothers from Miami and Cleveland
Kicking back, talking 'bout we ain't leaving, bitch

We ain't going nowhere, we gonna stay here another day y'know, it's just another day, oh you know, guess I'll uhhhh, get through and roll back to the Oak-town
Ridin with the Cadillac Club or something, you know, F-R-O-G, old school, Too Clean in the house biatch, QDIII on the beat, I wanna say what's up to little Darrell, my partner D, what's up D baby, all my partners in the pen: North County, Santa Rita.

Porno Bitch,Still Blowin’,2012.0,"Chorus 4X:
I need a porno bitch (be-beitch) a freaky porno bitch (beitch)
I fucked a lot of strippers
Bring her 'round me motherfucker I'll stick her
I'll fuck your lil' sister
Then fly her out of town nigga what I don't miss her
(Beitch!) You ain't hard as me
I fuck hookers, but they don't be chargin me
What about the tramps and sluts?
I fucked a few, but I can't get enough
Of them educated, sophisticated
Got a good job and other bitches hate it
You know the kind of woman that's hard to get
Know just what to do with a hard dick
I even like 'em young
I keep 'em up all night I'm just havin fun
But I don't need strippers, rippers or a ho
Right now I need a pro
Chorus
I need a porn star
I got a big-ass dick, and I was born hard
I want some professional head
I'm tired of havin sex in the bed
Let's fuck on the kitchen counter
And make a sex tape, yeah bitch I'm down!
I'll fuck you like Mr. Marcus
Get butt naked let's get this started
Drop that dress on the floor
Turn the camera on, and press record
I'm 'bout to make you a star
Boost that ass up on a stool at the bar
Are you willing and able
To ride this dick on a pool table?
Cause after that, it's shower sex
Can you handle another hour of this?
Chorus
I'm talkin 'bout Tera Patrick
Sunny Leone, now that's a bad bitch
AnnMarie, and Puma Swede
I want all them bitches to do me
I'll take Jesse Jane, get her wet and gushy
Alia Love, she'll eat her pussy
Anne T was my favorite bitch
Vanessa Blue with them big lips
I can't forget, Jenna Haze
I want to bust a nut, in her face
I'm comin, but it might take a while
I gotta do a scene with Shyla Stylez
And after that, it's Nikki Benz
All I wanna do, is stick it in
Girladonna, and Charmane Star
I wanna fuck 
Monique Alexander
Bitch!

Ain’t Nothin’ But a Word to Me,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
'Cause she's my ho, she don't belong to a trick
So when you fuck her, and give her all your cash
I get paid, or put my foot in her ass
I won't marry the bitch, and give her half
I get more head, and then I laugh
At that one-bitch-shit, I got a gang of hoes
I get, freak, ass, lick, these balls and toes

Now stupid little bitches get tossed
If they don't realize I'm the motherfucking boss
Come on down and get your ass pinched
And if you talk shit, get your ass lynched
'Cause I'm the B the I the T the C the H
The K the I the L the L the A
Ice Cube, a nigga that's bigger than a nut
'Cause a bitch is a bitch is a ho is a slut

You say how can I call a woman a bitch
It ain't nothing but a word like shit
Ain't no simping in my motherfucking pimping
And all bitches ain't women
You come home and get smooth cussed out
You gotta a bitch with a foul-ass mouth
Scared to check her with a left hook
You'z a bitch in my book, bitch

My nigga Jinx made the mix
So punk-ass motherfucking bitches get the 86
I keep hoes on five
'Cause I'm fucking more pussy than the law allow
With my boy Too $hort
See, he quick to grab a bitch by the throat
And slam her ass, cram her ass with a fat dick
'Cause she's a trick bitch

I like fat bitches, and I like 'em slim
I'll take a fat bitch, and stick my dick right in
Her big fat ass, she'll make me cum again
I'm mack daddy, bitch, fuck a friend
I saw your homegirl, she said what's up with us
I said nothing, fucked her on a tour bus
She got it good too, dicked down on the floor
The bitch was fine, but the pussy ain't good as yours

She a straggler, struggler, straight salami smuggler
Every time I see the bitch, she's looking uglier
And if you got a trick-ass on your left, sitting there with dick on her breath
Last night she sucked my dick, now she's kissing little man
Won't he suck my dick and let's cut out the middle man
And if you haven't heard of me, you's a bitch
It ain't but a word to me

(I'll stop calling ya)(beeitch)
(Too $hort: Man, fuck all these hoes, man, ya know)
(Ice Cube: Yamp ass, bitch ass, tramp ass, slutty ass hoes)
(I'll stop calling ya)(beeitch)

I go hard on a bitch, fuck respect for ya men
I get my way with a bitch, when I act like a pimp
Always carrying bank, but I fooled the bitch
'Cause all she ever got was to drool on my dick
Ice Cube will slap a ho for the fuck of it
Just like me and that's some real shit
Bitch got bold with her loud ass mouth
Tough ass bitch got knocked out
You know a bitch ain't nothing but a word to me
Some of you punks are just scared to see
If you could call that bitch a bitch you would
And if you can't, you probably should
I'm spitting game to you mark ass lames
On how to get a bitch and treat the bitch like shit
You can't buy love, all pimps know that
It's all about the way old Short Dogg macks
Don't hold the bitch hand or walk side by side
Go first class every time you fly
She'll go Greyhound, and just meet you there
I'm just an ice cold hard ass Oakland player
You want to tongue kiss, bitch, it figures
I'll introduce you to my homeboy Richard
Also known by his nickname Dick
Now let's tongue kiss, bitch

I like big butts, so let it be known to the public
I bust a rap or two and the bitches love it
I'm only out for one thang
 so hate me
I ain't the one
, 
so don't try to fade me
I don't wear too much gold 'cause it's tacky
I bust a Raider hat, T-shirt and khakis
See a lot of hoes in freaky clothes every day
So I talk to 'em in any ol' can I way
See a bitch need a nigga to coach 'em
So I grab my dick and smoothly approach 'em
I say 'hi' in a friendly kind of pitch
If they ignore me then I say 'Yo, freak bitch'
Give up the number hottie, we'll have a slumber party
You see I'll fuck you to death and then I'll dump the body
Cause I'm a nigga that's bigger than crew or a gang
And when it comes to bitches I'm out for only one thang
Yo, bitch ain't nothing but a word to me, $hort",https://genius.com/Too-short-aint-nothin-but-a-word-to-me-lyrics

I need a freak, everyday and every night
I need a freak, I really do
I want a freak, one with ass that looks like you

I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak everyday and every night

I need a freak, so I can swerve
I need a super freak, to calm my nerves
Now everyday is the same, I go get me a freak
Take her to my house to we hit the sheets
Got a saltwater fish tank built in the wall
Fat jucuzi tub, sitting in marble
Freaks can't resist, the way it's laid
I spit the game and i got paid
Say Short what you doing with all that stack
Bitch seen all four walls had plaques
She go on and drop them drawls
Don't take to long, she can't stop the law with street player

I need a freak everyday and every night

Me and homie want to fuck with you and your girl
Teach you about the new world
Spit the game like old school perms and curls
Get naked, and do that girl
Keep it right there I got on in the chamber
I aim it at your face and then squeeze the trigger
Can you hang with a freaky ass nigga
She took it all, had a ball
She got nothing but a party y'all
So all you squares and player haters don't sleep
I need a freak
I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, everyday and every night
I need a freak with long long hair

Remember when you seen me out in Detroit?
You were Reedy and a whole bunch of D boys
Surrounded by all that pearl
I know one of them hoes had to be your girl
At the derby in Kentucky
I had rich white women wantin' to fuck me
And I party hard on Mardi Gras
Ten bitches every night, I did it all
I did Ashleys, Keishas, Ericas
And it them was only hoes in America (In America)
I had more in London, a few in France
I didn't want to leave when I flew to Japan
I got bitches for all ethnicities
Still callin', sayin' how they're missin' me
But they know, ain't no change in him
AKA Wilt Chamberlain

19,999 bitches (Bitches)
I fucked 19,999 (Bitches)
I'm on you, Wilt
20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches
If I fuck one more
20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches

Get In Where You Fit In,Get In Where You Fit In,1993.0,"What happened to that other rapper y'all used to fuck with?
Man, we ain't fucking with that fake motherfucker MC Uh, Whatever
That motherfucker name is, man we got a real crew, we got
Motherfuckers over here rapping for real, eating pussy on records and
Shit, that shit ain't what's happening, we got some real shit
Trying to be like $hort motherfucker, you know what I'm saying?
Dangerous Music got some mack shit for your ass, boy
Fuck him up, $hort

Get in where you fit in, fool
You was a mark up at the high school
Now you're hardcore like CB4
Biting, what you wanna be me for?
It's your life, you wish it was a Too $hort rap
But you gots no game, and your bass ain't fat
You need to quit, rapping just ain't your place
So back on the grind and don't catch no case
Bitches, that's what you always be
Like the other young bitches that try to get with me
I run all up in it but this ain't no race
I pull it out and shoot it right in her face
You probably wine her and dine her
And get jealous when you can't find her
You're nothing but a mark
I bet you get your ass kicked hanging at the park, bitch!
You'd better watch your back
Before you get jacked by a nigga with a gat
Cause Life is Too $hort, I'm In the House like that
Shorty the Pimp, was Born to Mack
And I don't stop rapping, one thing I never do
Is stop making this funky-ass shit to ride to
And other rap crews can see
Dangerous Crew got the funky beats
And when I see ya, and act like I don't know ya
I'm like Missouri, cause I can show ya
Why is my shit so funky it stanks?
Pee Wee, Shorty B, and Ant Banks
You outta pocket trying to hang with my crew
You might of just learned, but it ain't nothing new
What happened to your funk, did you lose it?
Or did you get juked by Dangerous Music?
We stole all your money, and all your songs
Done you like a ho and then sent your ass home
One punk came and went
Had to fire the ho, but I'm still a pimp
(MC) Lawrence (The fake gangsta)
Would've never been shit without the Bad-Ass Banksta (The little punk)
Now he's gonna play on out (Like a mark)
Had to put his fat foot in his mouth (Little bitch)
Quick to say ""I'm sorry"" when you're funny
Y'all can have him, cause Dangerous don't want him
He'll tell a lie almost every other minute
I'm like Bennett, I ain't in it
Go on with your reject rap attack
You'll get more from a prize in a Cracker Jack
And since Banks said he can't have no more funk (Hell naw)
Get in where you fit in, punk
It's what life is all about...
Did that get him, did that get it? (Yeah, you got him)
Wait, it's the end? (Bitch-ass nigga)
You like that shit? (Hell yeah) Damn, you like that, nigga!
You a fool (Tore his ass up!) Banks you a fool for that!
(Fuck that nigga) (Goddamn!)
Man, fuck that punk-ass nigga, man trying to fuck with the Dangerous
Crew, nigga, you can't hang with this shit, nigga, we got niggas
Way tighter than you man,you old wanna be me asshole nigga, come with
Some real niggas from East Oakland, nigga

I'm a Bad-N-Fluenz, so keep your fucking kids away from me
Cause the motherfucking turf is the place to be
Where hella niggas get shot at
So you'd better pop back, or your ass getting dropped, black
Cause niggas lay you on your back fast
So you'd better grab a gat and pop a cap in they black ass
And let loose the whole clip
And let these motherfuckers know that you ain't taking no shit
I mean you gotta be a nut, fool
And you can't give a fuck, you can cut nigga, fuck school
Because that shit don't even last long
Get a key from an OG and get your fucking cash on
And if a nigga got some grip, get your gank on
But if a nigga popping lip, get your bank on
Don't ever go out like another sucker
You gotta show everybody that you the baddest motherfucker
Show them niggas you the biggest boss
And ain't no slipping stopping the tripping just popping
A clip and breaking them niggas off
Cause see life ain't nothing but just riches to me
Getting high with my partners and bitches to see
Yep, that's what life is all about
You eating the cunt and she sucking your dick and you
Fucking that bitch and kicking that bitch up out
I ain't a model, and I don't play the fucking role
Don't be shit when you're old, nigga fuck a goal
You wanna be somebody, I tell your ass you can't
You little bad motherfucker, go on and hit the dank
That's how it is in the Oaktown
These motherfuckers didn't know? Well these motherfuckers know now
And don't be jealous and mad we doing shit
Cause I don't give a fuck, I'm from the Bad-N-Fluenz clique

You wanna follow in my footsteps, well put on your gangsta hat
Burn the sack, and don't be ashamed to mack
I'm bout to tell you how a true player has to be
The shit comes naturally, so hoes quit asking me
I never listened and used to cuss in back of the church
?Bracking the Max? is my birth, packing a gat on the turf
Ready to drop any sucker on contact
You can't keep me calm, black, so pass me the bomb sack
And watch me extend with a grin to another place
I live on the edge and the Feds and the brothers space
But ain't no stopping this fool, I'm on a rampage
Breaks out in a damn rage, so don't try to stand, break
Sit in the range, you'll get maimed, I don't fight fair
Strike with a mic, in a psyche is a nightmare
And I'm always using my dick cause I'm slick with a fly bitch
And Rappin' ass Ron is my psychopath sidekick
Two hardhead niggas, yeah we advocate violence
Talking shit to the world cause we don't have to stay silent
Steady searching for a bad plan, thinking like a mad man
Your crew think they tight, but when I come they a sad clan
So fuck it, I'm always causing ruckus
Whoever wanna disagree then grab my dick and suck it
Diddley is always doing shit, distructive and I ruin shit
You stepping, pack your weapon fucking with the Bad-N-Fluenz clique

Fuck it, it's just another nigga dead
I pulled the trigger and I figure lead, that's when the nigga bled
Bloodshed is what I see in the nighttime
Strange and deranged, I ain't in my right mind
I can't relate, I'm stuck in a dream state
A psychopath, and Diddley Dog is my teammate
And see we are closer, than Fred and Barney Rubble
So step to Bad-N-Fluenz and you know you in double trouble
Motherfucker, we the Bad-N-Fluenz clique
Some lunatics, and we known to ruin shit
A terrorist, I ain't never been a role model
Nigga I grab the fucking 40 and down the whole bottle
And I don't even like fucking with no alcohol
But I'll snatch a joint, and get smoked out for y'all
Getting lit, never having a fit
On the avenue, having brew, grabbing my dick
And if your clique talking shit, it's your clique I'm a terrorize
The nine to your spine, now your ass is paralyzed
I'm dangerous, and I ain't even mad yet
I drop with couch and watch you bounce like a bad check
Cause I'm a mack that's from 8900, bitch
Rappin' Ron and Diddley Dog and Bad-N-Fluenz ruling shit

Fool don't understand all the shit that goes on up in this nigga's head
From the hood come if you would but you might end up dead
See these sick-ass Oakland streets done turned me out
Surviving and making cash is what it's about
Some people ask me why commit crimes to earn my scratch
But I'm black and I'm trapped and I can't turn back
I was raised as a cruel kid
Because the streets taught me more than these fake-ass schools did
I tried the education system but I dropped it
So now I'm in the goddamn game and can't stop it
And I'm a motherfucking threat to authority
Make the police sweat when they check this wreckless minority
You want more of me, well come to Oakland, that's where I be at
Selling dope with my folks, come close and see how we act
Hard niggas addicted to dirty money, fast cars, and fine hoes
On the drink every day like winos
And sometimes I be slipping up off the blunt
So I packs a pump for the punks who wanna try for their stunt
Cause I would never tell a ho how I make my green
I cut my cream on the un so I can't be seen
And then I bump up on the block and knock after knock
Watch the cop jock as I create a be a hot spot
Pushing slugs just to make it
I'm in the game and it's real and a nigga can't fake it
I know it's sad what I'm doing
But I don't give a fuck, I'm Ant Diddley Dog and I'm a Bad-N-Fluenz
Nigga you think you got the shit in?
You gotta get in where you fit in, bitch
Motherfucker, you outta pocket, punk-ass bitch
Swoll-ass motherfucker, you can't fuck with the crew, nigga
You need to get in where you fit in
You stupid-ass bitch",https://genius.com/Too-short-get-in-where-you-fit-in-lyrics
We Do This,Cocktails,1995.0,"Hey check this out Short, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah you down here in Oakland, you know what I'm saying?
And I'm all up in Michigan, you know what I'm talking about? I need
To get up on my pimpin', you know what I'm talking 'bout? I need to be
A player nowadays you know what I'm saying? Niggas need to know how
To play these hoes you know what I'm saying? On the strength, why don't you put me up on that pimpin' shit?

I do it like the best of the greatest, not the worst
Like welfare day, can't stop the first of the month
Can't stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good ho niggas sure better keep her
'Cause I'm on the prowl, all the time
Tryin' knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I ain't never, ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines, leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin' what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin' this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Then pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want, I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to
I might pass it
So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch
I'm 'bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch

Like that Short? Uhh, can't take shorts just 'cause your name Short
Matter fact I'ma quit taking shorts man
(Spit a little game to em Breed)

Ahhh why have a nine, when I can have a ten?
If she ain't Lickin' up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend
Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday ho, that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin' if she ain't licking me up
I'm givin' her to Short, 'cause he don't give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin' my house
If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Umm, have you seen my bitch?
I ain't seen her, but if I do she gets dick
That's what I'm givin' her just like that
To the front and back, nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely, feelin' she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost 'cause, yellin' pause when they drop the draws
It's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin' nigga laws
But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality
Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin' but a causality
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin' time
She's just an every day, don't wanna catch her fuckin' mine
Bitch ain't mine, so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this

Short I know you ain't done explaining, you know what I'm saying?
Pimpin' is an all American sport, you know what I'm saying? A lotta
People and got that down pat yet but uh why don't you explain it out for em

You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin' pool
But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
'Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine
And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late
And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad?
Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about
Bitches, hoes and all that shit
She got my number if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin' in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin', I'm gone fuck the ho harder
Just havin' fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick
Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve
And every day in between I will do these things, I don't stop bitch

Hahahaha, that nigga Short, uh uh yeah uh

I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12-inch single
Yeah, so what you bitches wanna do?
Step to me you gots to do my crew, first
When I rehearse I change rearrange
My mentality will bring you to reality
You on me like cologne 'til now
I feel it's time for us to bone
So I look and pimp the background
Look, listen put the bitch on lockdown
Yeah you hangin' out with me tonight
Every things alright, but a nigga wanna fight
Damn, that's a real player hater for ya
Fuck it, I'll be waitin' for ya

I'm droppin' lines like a motherfuckin' pimp at this shit
I'm gettin' hoes out they clothes 'cause I'm good at this shit
They callin' me the pussy jammer 'cause I'm breakin' hoes off
See I'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin' back at no cost
Never slackin', just mackin', money stackin' that's my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk
High off the dank, but I can't front
See I'm never being senile
See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin' it wild but in the meanwhile we the coolest
Sure enough, this how we do this

I'm fingerfuckin' with my diamonds
Now peep a nigga climbin' the charts
Ain't no fear in my heart, I represent it from the start
Indeed, my momma raised me as a G from birth
I be a hustler mothafucka 'til I sees my hearse
No doubt, I bust a shot for all my niggas in jail
All the young black males, that gotta slang yayo
'Cause it's a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin' drugs and high
Conversation with these bitches on my mobile, always in control and never let these bitches know you, 
and even though
I'm gettin' high, a thug nigga gettin' by
Catchin' bitches spittin' lies, I'm gettin' mine
All-day, I puff a blunt and parlay
And sometimes if we party
Getting my dick licked twice, and death to a trick's life
We can pursue this 'til my shit's right
Went from havin' fantasies to havin' hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me
The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case
When them punk police tried to break me
Didn't think the shit was cute, so I got a lawsuit
Made them punk police buy my Coupe
This is how we do this",https://genius.com/Too-short-we-do-this-lyrics
Burn Rubber,Married to the Game,2003.0,"Eastside beotch
Yeah you know about that, real players
The real ones

I burn rubber on you quick as hell
You need some toilet paper, don't shit on yourself
When you see me rollin in luxury
I won't fuck witchu, so don't fuck with me
I'm just ridin, sidin, whippin and dippin
I look at all the young hoes trippin
It's no big deal when little hotties get hot
When niggas get jealous, somebody get shot
You in love? Might make you lose your mind
That's why I run these gray girls, two at a time
With no discretion, to me you're so depressin
Actin like you don't know, my profession
I look at them thighs, and look at them titties
Take your ass straight on out, of Sin City
Wearin all pink just like Hello Kitty
Bringin back all C-notes and no fifties
{*scratched: ""so damn.."" ""..fresh"", ""word""*}

Burnin rubber on these bitches, so fast..
Burn rubber as you smash all fast
Tell it like $hort, no ass, no pass
All you Santa Claus players, be on your way
With a bag full of toys on the back of your sleigh
You hit your girls house, one by one
Climb down the chimney, and give 'em all somethin
You trick, don't come around me frontin
Talkin 'bout how you pimpin givin hoes what they wantin
You worse than a studio gangsta
Behind closed doors, gettin his bootyhole spanked up
You suckers disrespect the game
All these video hoes out there spittin your name
You love it when they make that, ass clap
But she don't give me no cash, I'll pass it back
... I kick her where she stash the crack
In the plastic sack, when she crash the 'llac
Punk bitch!
{*scratched: ""so damn.."" ""..fresh"", ""word""*}

They tryin to give the rap game to some real punks
It's just like when disco, killed the funk
Can't tell me nothin, when I know I'm right
Like a bowlegged bitch with a overbite, that suck it right
Player this pimp don't lie
How many porn stars you know that went to Crenshaw High?
A lot of fuckin for a whole lot of nuttin
You just wannabe noticed so you're out there sluttin
I never really cared about popular fame
It's all about sittin on top of the game
So don't stop 'til your panties drop
Fuck the mayor, the preacher, and a cop
You better tell him what it cost, get his mind on track
Cause he look like he lost
Bring him back, and dig in his pockets quick
Steal his watch, and make sure he got a drop, beotch

Life got his dick sucked. So if you don't know what it's like
To get your dick sucked, well then just dream
H-E-A-D
I need a doctor just for me
To suck my dick, like a vet
To suck my dick until I sweat
I need a bitch, thick as hell
She's gotta suck dick so I can tell
All my homies, what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch
The homeboys laugh, everytime
And then I put her in my rhyme
Talk about a bitch who sucked dick
Man oh man that bitch can lick
She'll have a nigga jumping up
Making a nigga just wanna fuck
Have you heard about baby, man she's tough
You know I have and now she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I loved that blowjob

I love a bitch for a blow job

When it comes to me, game is tough
Have you heard about baby, man she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I loved to get my dick sucked by her
Bitches in Oakland want to be under
When they suck dick like girl wonder
Niggers in Oakland are sick as hell
As soon as they nut they gots to tell
All the homies, what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch
The homeboys laugh everytime
And then I put her in a rhyme
Cause when a bitch sucks me down
I kick on back and think about now
When I sing about rap, all about her
The way she will and put in work
I'm Sir Too Short, in the chair
Bust big nuts like a big 'ol player
And sometimes baby we could fuck
But everytime you know she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I loved to get my dick sucked by that bitch
Me and homeboy roll to the Hyatt
Shit went crazy when they had a riot
I got in the Cutlass, went a few blocks
Saw a bitch and had to stop
Asked her if she needed a ride
The bitch just kept on walking by
So I said baby, could we just talk
I make you see, no need to walk
She never should have stopped, now that time
Cuz now baby, your in my rhyme
I remember you leaving, said I'll see you soon
I remember us going in my room
But I've never seen you, you freaky bitch
I now I tell the world just how you live
Too bad baby, we couldn't fuck
Everytime I see ya I'm a say you suck
The bitch sucked dick
Man that bitch is going to give a vicious blow job
When I drop my drawers, I'll be ready
Blow more head than Blow Job Betty
Suck my dick, and suck it cool
And suck my homie when he come through
Just suck dick, till you see no other
I think my homie, is bringing his brother
All my homies are coming up
Kick back and cap and say she sucks
The bitch sucked dick
That bitch sucked dick (echo)
I love a bitch like that, suck a whole lotta dick
Knows, get a nigga all juiced up when they bust into the bitches mouth
I'm a tell ya
If I wanted, I could rock her
But I'm not fucking no head doctor
Bitches don't know that Too SHort tip
You might get fucked if you don't suck dick
But I'm so freash, I'm so down
I tell that bitch the other way around
Suck my dick and you'll get some
I'll fuck you baby till your cock is numb
I'll bust my nut in her mouth
Smooth get dressed and roll out
I'm Sir Too Short, fresh fresh again
Kicking it tough just like a pimp
I could rap non stop in stereo
I talk about a bitch, I watch her blow
Cause she just can't wait to fuck
So for that one reason you know she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I just love that bitch for that good blowjob
I'm Too S-H-O-R-T
Rap so strong to the disco beat
Talk about bitches who ever licked
Bitch don't lie, you sucked my dick
More then once, more than twice
It was hella times and it all was nice

And you looked up and see me frown
Cause your one bitch I'll never fuck

You fell in love with her though trying to get in them pants
And the next thing ya know your baby momma's a tramp
Don't get mad now nigga want to shove the bitch
Cuz a year ago, you know, you loved the bitch
Now your stomach's upset and your feelings are hurt
She gotcha looking like an old banana peel in the dirt
Bitch, slipped up and hit your ass for a lick
Talking that mother fucking baby shit
You'z a punk ass nigga can't you see
Thatz the difference between niggas like you and me
I got bitches, on my mind
It's been like that for a real long time
I know the way them hoes take your cash
They let you fuck and make you pay up fast
Trick nigga, why you wanna be like that
Let them trifling bitches take your fat ass stack
Couldn't tell them hoes nuthin but the punk in you
Cuz they already know what they want from you
Big bank, Ben Franklin, do the bitch just fine
She'll be taking all of yours and can't fuck with mine
I'm the M to the A to the C and K
All you playa hating niggas shouldn't be that way
There ain't nuthin like pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Ain't nuthin like pimping just don't quit
Mother fuck you damn shit head bitch
Lights, camera, action, cut
Hollywood look out the bitch is coming up
She took acting classes 'bout to be on her way
On a Greyhound bus from home to L.A
She said it wouldn't take long to make it to the top
A few auditions land a job
I was down in L.A., hit the club for a drink
I'm a player ass nigga tell me what do ya think
I walked up to the bitch in my clean ass suit
And I told her, I've been watching you
I peeped you out from the bar
You must be a model or a movie star
She said ""No, but that's my dream
To see my face on the movie screen""
I tell ya nothing but game came out my mouth
She was talking 'bout agents, I was turning her out
I said ""Listen real close to what I'm saying
All you need is me; you don't need no agent""
I'm a pimp ass nigga and the game don't stop
""All you gotta do is fuck a few big shots
Cause if you can't do that, they're going to hold ya back""
She was sucking up the game, down to do all that
She said ""Short baby, I ain't no simp""
But the nigga in the suit ain't nuthin but a pimp
And all them white guys you had sex with
They weren't big shots, they were nothing but tricks
She came to me and said it just won't last
I looked, and I laughed, and I kicked her ass
Cuz all she wanted was the fame
But you can't get shit when you don't have game
Guerilla pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Guerilla pimps just don't quit
I say mother fuck you damn shithead bitch

Pimpology,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Pretty Tony: That nigga wanted the honey, all we wants is the money
Y'know, all bitches are the same, just like my hoes. I keep em' broke. Wake up one morning with some money, they subject to go crazy y'know

I'm going to tell you a story in stereo
About the pimping game, that you should know
But if you don't, it's alright
Cause I'll be spittin' this game to you all damn night
When I was 3 years old
Straight pimp game I was told
My daddy sent me to a pimp school
In this man's world, you can't be no fool
If a pimp is what you wanna be
You're gonna have to learn pimpology
Pimpology: a pimp's profession
Can't be affected by the Great Depression.
So if you want to be giant sized
Come to my school. Get pimpmotized
In your school, what do they teach?
English, math, and history
Pimpin' game, you can learn
And if you do, you will earn
A pimp diploma, just for you
For learning what you're taught when you come to school
Lesson 1, you should know:
Never love a bitch or a ho
Lesson 2 tells you to do only one thing:
Act cool
Lesson 3:
Breaking a bitch. If she's poor, if she's rich
If your game is soft or hard
It shouldn't take long to break the broad
Lesson 4:
Keep your ho. It's the most important thing to know
Cause I pimp or die bitch. I'm like the Mack:
Riding around Oakland in a Cadillac
But on the other hand, if you just can't pimp
And the hoes keep treating you like a simp
I don't know what to say about you boys
You better go to the store and buy some toys
Cause you can't play this game

Pretty Tony: Next time you hear grown folks talking, shut the fuck up, y'hear?

Now you heard my story in stereo
About the pimpin' game, that you should know
But if you don't, it's alright
Cause I'll be spittin' this shit to ya all damn night
It don't stop
I'm Short Dog, ain't nothing nice
I never rap fake when I'm on the mic
I ride around town in a clean ass Benz
Never ever frontin' on my cool ass friends
My zodiac sign is of Taurus the bull
I drink Olde English, and I do get full
If you're wondering why I don't stop my rap
Cause other MC's can't rock like that
My music flows like dominoes
I pimp these hoes, that's how it goes
Bitches on my beeper all day and night
I'm a motherfuckin' player, homeboy, that's right
O-A-K-L-A-N-D:
That's where I reign, top dog MC
Too Short, baby, on the microphone
I work motels. I don't take freaks home
Man, they start trippin' when they think your rich
Met her yesterday, now she's my bitch
It's not hard to believe. But that's how it goes
I'm burning rubber on these hoes like vogues
Check out my style, baby don't stop
If you can't call me Short, just call me Dog
Black is my color, I have no other, nothing else will do
I've got a black car, black bed, black TV
I've even got a silk black suit
Dangerous music, and the Dangerous Crew
Oakland California, and Playboy too
West coast rapping all over the place
Too Short, baby, all in your face
I rap so hard...you can't stop me
My last album sold a million copies
Me and the maestro, laying the beat
DJ scratches from my homeboy Pee
Dangerous music is what you hear
A new LP every year
You know we rolling, can't be faking
We come through and all your girls we're taking
You know we're rolling. Don't do no simpin'
Oaktown players strictly pimpin'
Bitch, my name is Short. Just what you've been looking for
Sending young tenders on a wild goose chase
Up in the hills, trying to find my place
Getting lost, getting tossed, getting found and clowned
Every time you see Short baby, you get down
Cause the raps I make are the raps you like
The way Sir Too Short rocks the mic
It's a one of a kind rapping style
Have the freaks in the crowd, going wild
For when I spit my rhyme, what's my tip?
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich

Goldie: It was $35,000
Slim: $35,000 cash money?
Goldie: No. I get 1. $35,000 plus 1, right?
Slim: The one I gave you?
Goldie: No, I gave you 6 alright. I had 1. Now $35,000 plus 6, right? Now $35,000 plus 1, plus 6 makes 7. $35,000 plus 7, right? Muthafucka, can you buy that?",https://genius.com/Too-short-pimpology-lyrics
I’m A Stop,No Trespassing,2012.0,"I'mma stop putting my thing up in ya bitch if ya don't stop calling me
Every hour on the hour, motherfucker can't ya tell ya bother me
I'm smoking, drinking, making ma pussy, not necessarily yours
So just leave me alone for a minute, I finna fuck with a few of these hores

I met this bitch, her name was Lucy
She's a Twitter stalking, Facebook groupie
She loves dogs so I nicknamed her Poop
One day she wants me and the next day it's Snoop
She keeps posting pics
Cause Lucy, she love to stroke them dicks
She got that ""feel good"" energy
And a whole lot of nasty memories
I never should have did, what I did with the bitch
Cause now, I can't get rid of the bitch
She's throwing up my phone sending texts and e-mails
All about her dreams of having sex with females
Come swapping in a threesome?
But that ain't what I want, that's what she wants
I keep telling her to leave me alone
Bitch won't stop calling ma phone, bitch


I should have never fucked that freaky bitch
Now I be on some geeky shit
She keep calling, and calling
Man that bitch is a stalker
First I want my ass licked, then I need my toes licked
Soon as the bitch think she done she done I come up with some more shit
I can't have a square bitch
No I need a rare bitch
No gag reflex, no ring, no marriage
I'm super, yeah I'm Superman, see me I need a Supergirl
Go super low and give a nigga some super fellatio
And if I'm soft it's her fault
It's her job to get me hard
My dicks the bishop, it help a bitch find God
Church, Keep it rainin' on my hoes
And tailor shit on my back everywhere I go
That paper keep it flowing in
There she go again
Look bitch, you working my last nerves
I have to go to therapy, I can not longer fuck with you
What you and I had was a flash, shawty I've had enough of you


When you looking at her body you gon wanna up get with her because the bitch a banger
Big swag, a socialite, easily clickin' with strangers
Never really know her when you get to meet her cause she was so thick and you thinking she was the bomb first
Ask what she do, she say she do promo for concerts
But she don't wanna listen, gotta be at every party I'm at
Running and rubbing yo buddy all on the rack, why you all over a motherfucker like that?
All these flaws make a nigga pause with the words
Got the draws but now I'm feeling like I'm fucking with two other birds
For the urge, got a ... but I can't get out, so shoot me
Now the bitch all on the internet stalking me, that's what I get for fucking with a groupie
All I could do is smoke a Lucy
.... bitch, how does she know?
But all I know:
Betta be the binnest if you fucking with her, cause she could be a ho
Nah, let me put it in retrospect
Reminiscin' with shocka, go back up time and intercept yo sex
Now what you all in the my window with my two do' fo'?
Mama you get on my nerves, I thought you know I ain't fucking you no' mo'


I know you miss this dick
I know you really miss it miss
You wanna hug it, wanna rub it, wanna kiss it
I know you miss this dick
I know you really miss it miss
You wanna hug it, wanna rub it, wanna kiss it
I know you miss this dick
I know you really miss it miss
You wanna hug it, wanna rub it, wanna kiss it",https://genius.com/Too-short-im-a-stop-lyrics

She hops on top and she take control

Shoutout to the girls that don’t suck dick
And all the good girls that don’t get fucked quick
You can keep your little pussy and your clit
You’re probably full of shit, bitch, you used to be lit
Now you wanna flip the script
It’s on the Internet, bitch, they said you used to strip
Get your grip, I ain’t gon’ trip

I wanna bang on ‘em like the Crips
You said eat your pussy if a nigga wanna hit? (Bitch)

I know it's my car bitch, you ain't trippin
It's your favorite color, on a lovely day
You let me reach right over, and rub on your leg
I'm sayin all kind of shit, to make you smile
Put your seatbeat on, cause I be drivin wild
You think I'm like them other niggas, I just wanna fuck
But I like to get money and get my dick sucked

And I can see through you bitch youse a gold digger
Tellin me stories, about the richest man
But I'm Too $hort baby, the bitch's pimp
I come a long way from young and done the certified player
I get what I want, and I'mma holler at you later
If you ain't got game you might think I'm a trick
Don't play yourself girl you won't get no dick
I take you right back home so you can be witcha man
I know you sucker motherfuckers won't understand
See me with a bitch and say I floss too hard
These hoes ain't trippin on me, they wanna fuck my car
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car
She could care less about a real man
All she wants is a man with the meal plan
Pick her up in the Benz and hope she get to eat
Every day is Halloween ho, trick or treat
I throw your ass in the trunk with a bag of rats
Drop you off at Kaiser like they did in The Mack
I know you're broke, fantasizing like Mariah
Get a grip on my bumper, rub your clit on my tire
You can ride on top or wrap your legs around the frame
But if you get in this car you gonna respect this game
And I'm knowin that, I hope you know it too
Only real pimps know what I'm goin through
It's a daily mission, controllin these bitches
Uphold the pimpin, never start sympin
Got the cleanest drop Caddy for your eyes to see
So c'mon bitch and take a ride with me
Now I'm about big blocks, drop tops
White guts ending with much knock
Got loot but dough ain't even trippin on it
Got keys, to three hundred Z's, knowin these bitches
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car
I gave you a ride for some head cause my dick was soft
But if you ain't widdit I'mma drop you off
I got hoes all around me all day and night
And yo little pussy's just way too tight
For a big black dick like mine to slide in
I take my motherfuckin time and ride it
Cause ain't no punk bitches where I'm from
They like to suck niggas dicks, and make us cum
So get butt-naked let me slap that ass
Play with them titties while I tap that ass
Slam your face in the pillow, and arch that back
Have you lovin this dick like it's made of crack
Cocaine, and you know that costs
Can't fuck for free you got to pay the boss
Hundred dollar bills bitch
I break your ass and won't feel shit
Cause pimpin, pimpin, that's my game
I got it from the O where it always rains
Pimp game, now it's time to roll
And take my hoes down to the ho stroll
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car
You ain't slammin doors like me cause I'm the coldest mack
From a brand new Benz to my old school 'llac
You ain't never gon stop my pimpin style
It's like two plus two, can you figure it out?
You say, what fo', I say that's right
You know the answer nigga pimpin for life
What's a trick to a ho, some dope to a fiend
What's a bag of weed if the shit ain't green
You say the game is forever, well so am I
You only got two choices bitch, ho or die
Now speak up, you better say somethin
Before I turn your ass back into a pumpkin
Cause ain't no motherfuckin fairy tales
Only Freaky Tales, and I tell em so well bitch
Now get your ass in the car
Don't play me too close I won't pimp you too hard
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar

No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car

Punk Bitch,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Write a little save-a-ho speech all these fake-ass hoes...
Fake punk-ass bitches...
Do you know what I mean, Vern?
Fuckin'em up like that, man...
$hort Dog's in the house, bitch!
She's a punk-ass bitch, ho, tramp and a slut
Took her to the hotel just to fuck
Last night she licked all on my balls
Pussy got wet like Niagara-falls
Dropped my drawls and bitch said: ""Shit!""
Skinny mothafucka with a fat-ass dick
It's like a T-P-treatment, thangs so foul
From the tip of my head to the crack of my ass
She got busy so I called to the crew
You bitches know what to do
Hoes try to front like they ain't no tramps
Try to get that pussy and she say you can't
Me and my partners we got that game
Check a square-ass bitch and make her throw that thang
You wine and dine that nasty freak
Dropped her off and got a kiss on cheek
You never even know how she ran in the house
Jumped on the phone and started to burnin' me out
She kept beepin' so I made the call
Bitch on the phone jackin' off
Sounded like she was havin' fun
Playin' with her pearl tongue
I said: ""Bitch, I'm on my way!""
I givit to you, homeboy, play by play
She had on polkadots with miniskirt
Jumped in the car straight went to work
I must to bust two nuts back to back
Never seen a bitch work head like that
She had me jumpin' out of my seat
Workin' her jaws to the beat
She was a good dicksucker, I can't lie
Sucked so good I thought I'd die
Bitch blew me up and blew me down
All the way back to the Oakland-town
Baby started to singin': ""I love you!""
Tellin' me things she wanted to do
If I needed some money come to her
Everythin' I want is everythin' I'm worth
And you know what I said? I told the bitch
I said: ""Bitch, I'm rich!""
Fuck these hoes, man...
I ain't trippin'...I'm like hell...
Long-hair suckers...
I know you're fine, bitch
But you got no cash you need to get a job
But your lazy-ass try to juice me up
I ain't no punk
I put you in the rap with some serious funk
I wouldn't buy you a car, no diamonds and shit
All the time talkin' about your fake-ass gifts
George bought you a ring, John bought you a chain
Bitch, I'm buyin' you an ounce of this game
You better take it and shut the fuck up
Stop runnin' your mouth like a sucka
Cause you's a punk bitch
It shows a mile away
Everythin' you say and everythin' you do
Makes you a punk bitch, no good, no doubt
All I gotta do is stick a dick in your mouth
Wanna give up the pussy, bitch, I pass
You're too slim, I like your mama's ass
Pops came home, came up to show
Family in the backroom, I'm fuckin'em both
Now I'm the stepdaddy and the son in law
You call me Too $hort they call me too raw
I creep by one room in to the next
Nothin' goin' on but some serious sex
Some of these hoes might think I'm played
Bald-head bitch need some dookie braids
Cause that nappy-hair don't even hit
What's cookin' in the kitchen
On the back of your neck
Like you burned the rice and wanna front on me
You could never fuck with $hort, baby
I'm from the O-A-K-L-A-N-D
I slap you in the face with reality
These punk-ass hoes out there is sick
Happy walkin' around with a trippy dick
So beautiful fine young thang
To get that cock was just like a dream
But now three days later ask Kool Moe
You feel burnin' sensation down below
You're a true blue victim of a punk-ass bitch
Thought she was a square and she gave you the shit
So for all you hoes that live like this
All the homies in the house say: ""punk-ass bitch!""",https://genius.com/Too-short-punk-bitch-lyrics
2 Bitches,You Nasty,2000,"Pimp niggas don't pay a dime ppppppppppppooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppp
I'm fucking two bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and I write a rhyme
I call it ""Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find""

I took two bitches to a hotel
I told em both ""you know I won't tell""
Bitch, curiosity killed the cat
You gotta lick the clit while I hit it from the back
Don't be stingy girl, lick my balls too
You was talkin big shit when I called you
You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you ""look around, who you wanna fuck?""
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you, and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
Now it's time to fuck


When we got to my room she started actin nervous
Sat down and said ""lets order room service""
I said ""bitch, what are ya smokin?
A big fat dick coming from East Oakland""
I stuck it in her mouth, she started moanin
I said ""hang up, get off my telephone, bitch""
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town, started freaking them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fuck 'em for awhile then I kick back and watch
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck, I'm a player
I been doin this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm paying hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad cause you can't afford it


Them bitches kissed twenty minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, 'lil momma on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent twenty more minutes licking each other's breasts
Two titty sucking hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin on a fat one, layin in the cut
After seeing this shit, I ain't wanna fuck
I wanna see how long they can keep goin
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was getting my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fucking them sluts 'til the sun came up
Nut in both their mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog baby, this shit ain't really nuthin to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fucking your freak, nigga

Sing it, pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin two bitches at the same time
Fucking two bitches at the same time
Let 'em know pimp niggas don't pay a dime, bitch
Hit the studio and write a rhyme
These tramps ain't hard to find nigga

Girl (Cocaine),Don’t Stop Rappin’,UnKnown,"Girl, Girl, Girl
That's your life
Girl
Smoking that glass pipe

I come from the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
'Cause a basehead never sees the light
Two fat raps to the head last night
Cocaine Cocaine, is that your rap?
Every day and night it's coming back
C-O-C-A-I-N-E
The rich man's high is what it used to be
But things looking different in '85
Cocaine, cocaine is that your high?
Since age thirteen, what have I seen?
A lotta baseheads, straight coke fiends
Snorting, puffing, that's the life
But it's all over when you hit that pipe
Big coke dealers on the knock
All smoked out with no more rocks
Baseheads buy, coke from him
But he smokes more than all of them
The big coke man, ain't too cool
He smokes more than all you fools
He's got a lotta dope, but not a lotta bank
A brand new car with an empty tank
Pretty white smoke all in his chest
And a '84 Benz, repossessed

Girl, that's your life (Don't do it)
Girl smoking that glass pipe (Don't do it)

Fresh young tender, only fifteen
Walking on a strip, just wanna be seen
Never touched coke a day in her life
But now that girl's gotta have her pipe
'Cause she met a man, his name was Jock
Do it to her a good and he smoked a rock
Put it in a joint all crunched up
And now every day she takes a puff


I know you know what coke can do
Come into your life and take over you
Now you're kicking back thinking 'bout your dream
But it never comes true 'cause you're just a coke fiend
You asked your woman 'What's the prob?'
She said 'It's you 'cause you don't do your job'
Used to make good love from the start
But now the coke did damage to your private parts


Your mind is gone, your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Inhale, exhale, you don't care
Coke smoke only, no fresh air
You can't even talk, you don't wanna listen
You and your buddy on a cocaine mission
Three days straight, where's your mind?
It's gone out of town and your brain is fried
Just smoke and choke until you're broke
Just smoke that coke until you croak
And it would be, I can't lie
No good loss if you should die
'Cause your life is wrecked, your girl was checked
She chose on me and I was set
I took her home to make my move
But she wanted to base, she's just like you


You saved your money for a year-and-a-half
You're so damn stupid, you make me laugh
Bought a car co-signed by Daddy
A 1980 Fleetwood Caddy
You drove that car every place
Until that day when you first based
Look at it now, the real big wheeler
Sold that Caddy to a big coke dealer


When you base coke, until you're broke
Where I come from, we call you smoked
S-M-O-K-E-D
To smoke more coke is all you need
You say coke is it, it's all that counts
It's got more ounce to the bounce
It put your life in a state of shock
Got you singing to yourself ""I'm the king of rock""


Rocks made you, and now you simp
Seven hookers and one down pimp
If you never based, in the first place
There's no way you could pimp today
'Cause it got you sprung, and you said 'Look
I gotta have money 'cause I am hooked'
None of your girls would ever quit
'Cause you used game to get a hit
You're the best basehead to ever live
You always take and you never give
You got your girls hooked too
And that is why right now you're through
They took your house, car and gold
And you got life with no parole
Smooth locked down, without a doubt
You killed two hookers when they smoked you out


You say don't knock it, until you try it
It cost too much, I'd never buy it
So I won't try it, and you should knock it
You always have coke in your pocket
Wherever you go, in this world
It's not just you, it's you and that girl
You love Snow White, she's your life
Smoking that coke in a glass pipe


You needed some money and your girl came through
Now you're gonna smoke for a hour or two
But that's not you, that's what you thought
Fake base rocks is what you bought
From some young brother, on some street
One sick basehead just got beat
Got his rocks and rushed them home
Put it on the pipe and they just phoned
One sick basehead lost all hope
Thought he bought coke and just bought soap
Got his gun and who got shot
Some young punk at the base rock spot
Standing out there, all alone
One basehead, his mind was gone
He had to shoot 'cause someone got
One basehead with a fake base rock


It's the C-O-C-A-I-N-E
The rich man's high is what it used to be
But things looking different in '85
Cocaine, cocaine, the whole world's high
Wherever I go, in any town, you know cocaine is all around
Right now today, in '85
You better stop smoking while you're still alive

Girl, that's your life
Girl, smoking that glass pipe
That's your life
Smoke that glass pipe
That's your life
Just smoke that glass pipe

Old School,You Nasty,2000,"Old school.. I'm from the old school
Old school.. I'm from the old school
I came in the door as the story goes
Looked around the room all I seen was hoes
It's like a pussy supermarket; let's go shoppin
Packed like sardines, clubs straight poppin
Fuck the V.I.P. section
I'm bout to hit the pharmacy, and get my head connected
Get me some protection
Walk around and see who I wanna have sex with
The usual - a nice high-yellow cutie
Or maybe tonight, I might find a black beauty
With a big ol' booty, no doubt
We'll have a few drinks and then roll out
I can't do the ""Jungle Fever""
Cause it's too many black hoes here that might see ya
If I peep a white broad with some ass and lips
Fine as hell - I'mma have to ask the bitch some'in
Cause I might end up fuckin
I don't care what you say, I don't owe you hoes nothin
I fuck tall bitches, even fuck small bitches
Too bad I can't fuck all you bitches
It don't take players like me too long
To get bitches like you to let me take you home
I got the game from Oakland, California
I'm Short Dawg, I hope your momma warned ya
Bout the old school.. do the old school
I'm from the old school.. do the old school
I'm always hustlin, always workin hard
If you tryin to get the money I'mma do my part
On the weekends, we like to celebrate
Cash checks ride away can't wait
Fuck crime - I'm bustin Too $hort rhymes
Unless it's bout millions I ain't tryin to do time
It's like everyday is Saturday
So many bitches let me have my way
You can analyze it, all you want
But I was knockin bad hoes with no teeth in the front
When I had no money and drove my momma's car
I had bad-ass bitches look like superstars
It's the game, old as it may be
It makes fine-ass hoes call me baby
I look down and think, this that fuckin shit
Seein this beautiful bitch, she just suckin my dick
Too many times in a player's wife
We always have to hear what you squares feel like
Fuck that; do what you gotta do
I see you creepin through the hood buyin prostitutes
I know I'm fuckin hoes, and gettin high
You wanna criticize me but you livin a lie
With yo' suit and tie, and yo' love for hoes
You ain't shit motherfucker and Short Dawg knows
I'm from the old school.. do the old school
Do the old school.. I'm from the old school
Don't cross the game they'll take yo' life
Respect the game and you can play all night
If you snitchin, don't get caught slippin
If you blood'n or crip'n, other niggas set-trippin
Watch yo' back, it don't take a brainiac
We got a lot of homocidal maniacs in the streets
Sometimes life is terrible
Y'all say goodbye, niggas say be careful
Back in the day they woulda killed yo' ass
For a reason, they might even keep you breathin
Fuck your whole world up, you can't get down
Broke livin on the streets and you can't skip town
But ain't no slow deaths in the triple-oh
If you fuckin up then you get to go
Somebody gon' hold you down
So you can't get up off that cold ground
Lights flashin, and you keep passin out
You know you fucked up with your bad-ass mouth
Once upon a time they woulda knocked you out
Maybe back in ninety-nine, but not in 2000
Anybody wanna do it like the old school?
Hella niggas at the park with no shootin
Sunday afternoon, at the park
Niggas leanin hella hard goin by in the car
Do the old school.. do the old school
I'm from the old school.. do the old school
Old school.. do the old school
I'm from the old school..
Yeah old school baby, BEOTCH!",https://genius.com/Too-short-old-school-lyrics
Call Me,Booty Call (Music From the Motion Picture) ,1997.0,"When you need some one to talk to
Someone to fuck you, call me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Just call me, I'll give you what you need

My plane touches down at eleven forty-five
I'm coming through, want you, bout to show you why
I got the game from the pimps and players
You gonna feel me, baby when I get there
I'm a give you what you want so I could get what I need
We could get hella freaky while we smoke some weed
We don't need champagne, fuck the gin and juice
These nigga's know what $hort Dawg and Lil' Kim can do
Imagination is a understatement
Anything you can think of we could make it
Big money hit records, watch us get reckless
We butt-naked, we never sexless
And when I get there, you know it's time to fuck
Cause all night long ain't long enough
To come up, it's just us
You wanna know something it's a big dick tight pussy thang
Make us both cum


Everybody know the Queen getting down and dirty
Drive you crazy like a 730, it ain't a secret
Rumors they could keep it
You know there's only one ghetto Queen with a guillotine
Real bitch that carry gats by the spleen, na mean
Some bitch is on the other line, answer that
If it's a booty call, cancel that
You want pure satisfaction, I'mma handle that
All I need is a candle and a porno channel
Lubricate the top, now I'm starting to sweat
Peel my Gucci sheets back so they don't get wet, now check it
Adjust your phone volume, Lil' Kim is shore ta bring the nuts out ya
Imagine me sucking blood out ya
Like a hickey, I love the phone quickie
I slip myself a mickey, now that's the proper set off
You could reach out and touch me MCI style
Kim and $hort fucking Cali Bedstuy style
Tell me what you want, I'll tell you what I need
You could fuck me til I bleed, oh $hort I'm bout to OG


You say it's cool to fuck baby, just open up

Well since you showed up, what's the hold up

The blunts ain't rolled up, let's mix sex with the weed smell

Then ride me nigga like you do them V-12's
I'll be your SLK and you can drop my top

And I'll be all up in the cock from midnight to six o'clock
The way you suck dick you off the heez-ay

Get off your kneez-ay, they say you are what you eat baby

This ain't no 69 it's more like a 138
Everytime we have sex it's like watching dirty tapes
You're my personal, private porno star
You wanna see us fuck, buy the tape at the corner store
Queen Bee getting stung by Too $heezee
I'm smoking indo, buzzing with the breezee
I'll teach you all about the nigga's from the O-A-K
We take the money and the pussy cause we sho' don't play
And I like it",https://genius.com/Too-short-call-me-lyrics
Broke Bitch,Get Off the Stage,2007,"Whassup baby?
Damn like that? Can't even speak?
I ain't tryin to fuck, just tryin to holla, say whassup
Let me ask you somethin baby
Is that a wig or a weave?
What you see is what you get
If you don't like it, fuck you bitch
You look good, you hot as shit
But you broke as hell and ain't got no whip
I ain't yo' type, I don't care
Get a light-skinned nigga with long hair
I spoke, you act like you mad at a dude
I don't give a fuck 'bout your bad attitude
It's in me - I'm laced with game
You get a signed autograph with a face to blame
Tear it up later when you hate my guts
Right now, I wanna make you taste my nuts
You hella fine, but I don't wanna keep in touch
All I wanted was to sleep with a slut
I wanna fuck you bitch cause you got the look
A top notch, but you ain't too hot to be shook

BROKE BITCH~! You can't fuck with me
You can't afford me
BROKE BITCH~! You can't even afford a happy meal from McDonald's
BROKE BITCH~! Five dollars worth of gas
Where you goin, 'cross the street?
BROKE BITCH~!
You just wanna marry a million dollar ballplayer
BROKE BITCH~!

You wanna get you a nigga in the NFL
A basketball player, tall as hell
You might get lucky, marry the champ
But when you walk by they say there's a tramp
Your stock is low, you don't know what happened
Yo' baby daddy is low budget rappin
You wanna do it big, spoil the kid
But you're still at the club out hoein an' shit
You tryin to hit a lick - no doubt
You want diamonds, all you get is dick in your mouth
Bitch, you need to stop and think
You act like a dick is a slot machine
Are you serious? You can't be thinkin clear
It's quicksand bitch you'll sink in here
You wanna be rich better stop that shit
You never hit the jackpot

BROKE BITCH~! Yeah we tryin to get top notchers
Nobody want your busted ass
BROKE BITCH~! Quit buyin all them knockoff purses and clothes bitch
BROKE BITCH~! Always starin at the ground
You need to hold your head up
BROKE BITCH~! If you had some money you wouldn't be wearin them
Raggedy-ass shoes
BROKE BITCH~!

There's too many women can't stop a player
I see one I like, I'ma stop and stare
I don't need plans, I'ma take the chance
I don't even have to ask the bitch to dance
I'm a natural, I don't need luck to win
I'm the kind of nigga that'll fuck your friend
And you won't know nothin, every time I see her
On the low we fuckin, I know them buttons
And I hit 'em, most of the time I get 'em
I got a million lines and I spit 'em
When I wanna fuck, who do I like to call
I throw a little party and invite 'em all
They never argue and fight with a brother
And I like when they like each other
I told Polow I'm never gettin married
I don't give a fuck if you was fuckin Sherri!",https://genius.com/Too-short-broke-bitch-lyrics
Money in the Ghetto,Get In Where You Fit In,1994.0,"In the ghetto, you think life is hard
Food stamps and to' up cars
Wall to wall dirty orange carpet
Sittin in a bucket, hopin you can start it
And ride around to the liquor store
Can't get a job get drunk some more
You betta stop trippin on dem stereotypes
Cause in the ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin like Marvin, won't see no roach
When ya chill wit the rich folks in the hood
You're sittin on leather watchin big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin, and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Savin money, and workin hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
Ya only got one life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face, but don't know his name
You know he got the sack mayn
And he's sittin on a fat bank
Seven cars at his house in the driveway
Benz so clean don't roll it just fly away
Cause folks got money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (There's money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

Money in the ghetto ain't nothin new
It's been like that, way before you
Was even born, get up from the down stroke
Chocolate City for the black folks
Say it loud in ya hot pants
Man child in the promised land
I take you back to Iceberg Slim
And all the players that came before him
If you a everyday hustler, get your money
Cause what they do to black man ain't funny
All the time tryin to put us the pen
You get paroled and then they send you again
All the homies in the hood gettin paid
You might have left but the money stayed
In the ghetto, it ain't all about drugs
Gettin paid doin all kinds of stuff
Only rule on the streets is don't get caught
Unless your hustle ain't breakin the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We sittin on 'em fat in the hood
I'm ridin on some gold ones
Smokin dank and it's potent
Ask them fools, cause they know
There's money in the ghetto
Chorus One

I got money baby, just tell me the price
Cause Short Dawg ain't nuttin nice
I always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin
Spend fo', get an ounce of dank then
Rich nigga get high relaxin
If I bust a Ben Frank' get some Andrew Jacksons
Five twenties for a hundred dollar bill
You know the math, let's make a deal
On the one dollar bill if you look on the front
You find the face of George Washington
Make money baby, that's all I do
That's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the two
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the five
And Hamilton, my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the ten
These are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The American dream for the average minority
Make your money, get some weed and a forty
I'm on the Eastside livin' like a king
Kick back watchin fifty-inch screens
Bounce to the Westside, hit the studio
And spend my money in the ghetto

Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (They got money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

Nowadays if you can't say a rap, or play sports
You might just come up short
And they always say the same things
Don't be a gangster or a dopefiend
Get your high school diploma, go to college
Get a degree and start makin' dollars
Only one thing wrong, and it's a Trip
Inner city schools don't teach us shit
Got us stuck on stupid, Straight S.O.S
Can't get nothin, but they payin the rest
Of them fools
All Around the world in the other countries
They should be spendin that money right here
In the state of California
You graduate and can't spell ""diploma""
Dip to the hood and get rich
Slangin rocks to a smoked-out bitch
No school'll come close to that
A few transaction make my pockets fat
I make a lot of money and it ain't no lie
I'll probably ball 'til the day I die
And if I didn't, so what?
I bet you I'd still come up
Cause there's a whole lot of money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

Straight up bitch, save a bitch

When I leave bitch tell 'em all about a player
Go on bitch, c'mon bitch
Run home bitch, get front on bitch
That's right bitch, fuck off bitch
You get off bitch when you suck all them dicks
Get cut off bitch when I come home bitch
Shit ain't right? Get the fuck on bitch
Speak up bitch, say what bitch
Wanna pull me down, I'mma stay up bitch
So what bitch, do what you wanna do
A nigga like me don't want nothin' with you
I want a bitch, a real ass bitch
You can feel that bitch when she kill that grip
Hundred dollar bills bitch, I'mma still get a grip
And I won't feel shit when I get a new bitch

Bitch fell in love but she won't stop cheatin'
Real dumb with low self esteem
Fuck a nigga she just met and won't be able to see him
Later on when she wanna get fucked some more
I said ""Bitch, why you such a stupid ho?""
You lil' bitch, you never could fuck with this
And every bitch that don't like it, she can suck my dick
20 years later, still settin' it off
Still talkin' bad 'bout them pregnant dogs
They ask me ""Short Dog, why you talk so bad?""
Bitch disrespect me, get off in her ass
I'm pullin' ho cards (time to learn a lesson real quick)
Ask me, ""What's the definition of a bitch?""
A real bitch - she gon' know she one
Suck the dick, drink the nut, and say she owe me one
Damn bitch, you that bitch, can you do that bitch?
Move back bitch, say who that bitch... I don't know you ho
I don't sniff cocaine, I don't want no blow
Bitch you a dummie - bitch, junkie
Bitch, funky bitch, punkass bitch
Jump out bitch, get the fuck out bitch, get cussed out bitch
Cause a bitch is known to get on my nerves
And a bitch don't really know when I'm on the swerve
I'm like ""Bitch, miss me"", ""Bitch don't kiss me""
""Bitch, just lick me bitch""
You's a bitch, knew it when I heard the beat
Bitch ain't nothin' but a word to me

Dope Fiend Beat,Born to Mack,1987.0,"Bitch!
Funky fresh from Oakland, California...
Dangerous Music and it don't stop to the beat, baby...
Bitches on my mind
I can't hold back, now's the time
All you loud-mouth bitches talk too much
And you dick teasing bitches never fuck
I seen a long-hair bitch, working extensions
Her hair ain't really but two inches
All you bald-head hoes in the Oakland world
Running 'round town with Jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald-head and say, ""Go to hell!""
But you's a snake, you's a worm
You bald-head bitch, you need a perm
So much game when the homies tough
I make a bitch blow who never sucks
It really ain't a lie, but I just met her
Now I'm saying, ""Bitch, suck better!""
Fuck you, stupid ho, tell me just what you know
I came to the party and turned it out
You said, ""Ooh, he's got a dirty mouth!""
But, bitch, I kept talking shit
Mother fuck you, damn shit-head bitch
I want a blowjob and I'm not kidding
Work it in your mouth till your head starts spinning
I'm that nigga you'll answer to
If I say, ""Bitch, jump!"", that's what you'll do
I'm a fast talking con man blowing your mind
Breaking you and your cousin at the same time
With my dirty rap coming out my mouth
And you know damn well what I'm talking about
I'm the Too $hort, baby, way too cold
So mother fuck you, bitch, goddamn ass ho
The dope fiend beat...
For all you junkies to just rock...
H-E-A-D, I need a doctor just for me
To suck my dick like a vet
To give me head until I sweat
She's gotta suck dick
So I can tell all my homies just what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch to the beat
Of Too $hort, I said my name is Too $hort and it don't stop
I love you bitches for the blowjobs
I just laugh over and over
When the bitch drinks sperm like it's a soda
I straight start aiming, woops I missed
Get back bitch, we'll never kiss
I say she looks so good and she's so thick
But, man oh man, that bitch can lick
If I want it I could rock her
But I can't fuck no-head doctor
Bitches don't know that Too $hort's tip
You might get G'd if you don't suck dick
But I'm so fresh, I'm so down
I tell you bitches the other way around
If you do me first, well I'll do you
So the game jumps off when the bitch is through
Soon as I come all in her mouth
I smooth get dressed and roll out
I'm Too $hort, baby, fresh fresh again
One MC, one bitch broken
I tell you, baby, playing just like that
I'm the best of the greatest of the ice cold rap
And, bitch, you're just a bitch
You work fast food and you think you're rich
You see, my game don't stop when it's on the one
I love to see you when you work that tongue
Getting real busy in the back of the car
Rolling down the Skyline Boulevard
I said, ""Bitch, what are you smoking?""
A big fat dick in the big East Oakland
I see my homie, he needs to quit
He was walking down the street with a big fat bitch
Maybe I'm wrong he might collect
Every two weeks that welfare check
Oakland, California, is the city of snakes
Pimps, pussies, players and fakes
The big Oaktown, the city of liars
Fresh Star Wires and Vogue tires
A strip, bitches, nasty freaks
My raps, homeboy, with tremendous beats...
She's a bitch to the dope fiend beat...
All you junkies just ride...
Bitches on my mind
I can't hold back, now's the time
Bust a left nut, right nut, in her jaw
Opened my eye, guess what I saw
Bitches on my mind
Grabbed the microphone then I started to rhyme
What would life be if it wasn't Too $hort
It'd be nothing but rappers from the old New York
But that's not likely and there's no doubt
Bitches like me cause I'm turning it out
I'm here, there, everywhere
Sporting fat rope, babies, I'm a mother fucking player
Recognize game when it's in your face
As you dip to the beat when you feel the bass
Crank it up loud, would be doing fine
Pose like a pimp and check my rhyme
Some young tender doesn't like this beat
But a bitch ain't nothing but a word to me
I can check her, wreck her, or just get paid
Cut to the house and freak my maid
You see, you can't speak English but we don't talk
Call her Lucy and she's juicy, makes your eye balls walk
We never hesitate to make good love
She clean up my house and then clean me up
So check it out, all you bitches
I tell a story 'bout rags to riches
So check it out, freak nasty
I know you're fine but you look like Lassie
Bitch, not a long ago I used to hang at the mall
Top floor, baby, all the freaks I called
And if they didn't want to come. well that ain't shit
I just drop a few lines and then call her a bitch...
Bitch!",https://genius.com/Too-short-dope-fiend-beat-lyrics
Rap Like Me,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Rap like me, you'll go straight to the top
Keep doing what you're doing and you're sure to get dropped
Like a trick, nothing's even up my sleeve
A million albums sold and it's hard to believe
Well it's true homeboy, it's not a lie
I used to sell tapes on Sunnyside
I used to catch the 40 bus around the way
Me and Fred Benz, slanging tapes
All these things, that we did
Grab the microphone and start screaming ""Bitch!""
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
You make hit records and you still can't rap
I said it before, I'll say it again
You don't believe me, ask your fans
When I walked into Cali, the place was packed
Sir Too $hort ""Don't stop that rap""
I keep rapping my rhymes, all the time
You got no rhymes, so you listen to mine
I'm not starting a fight, just telling it right
The best damn rapper who ever grabbed the mic
His name is Too $hort, now shut your mouth
In '81 I was rocking the house
I'm a hustler, baby, coming up
I hustle every day and I don't sell drugs
I don't run no gangs, don't shoot no dice
Gave the same damn speech to the Oakland vice
But if you keep pushing, just like you
When they see me on the strip, coming through
I break it down so vicious it'll break your back
With the beat so loud playing Too $hort raps
That's it, I'm set
No need to talk that bullshit
I need a, Oaktown, big time sound
Just enough beat to get on down
So, you other rappers listen to mine
You wouldn't catch Short Dog rapping nursery rhymes
Call my rap trash, jam the junk
Put a sticker on the cover: ""X-Rated Funk""
It's just me, you say I won't go far
But I won't stop rapping cause I rap so hard
From here to New York, back to California
I bumped your girlfriend, don't say I didn't warn ya
All this time you said she's your ho
You really shouldn't give baby all that dough
She gave it all to me cause I fuck so good
I practice on the girls in my neighborhood
Cause when I'm freaky I rap, I spit a rap to a freak
I rarely ever think about a sucker MC
I go platinum, it's just like slapping 'em, bitch
Short Dog in the house, starting some shit
MC's rock and MC's roll
But the albums they make never go gold
When I was young, I knew I'd be one of the best
Every time I made a song it came out so fresh
I was the king of the Oaktown, spitting my game
10 years later, ain't nothing changed
Still the Boss of the Bay, and I know what they say
They call me ""Godfather"" and they call you ""Gay""
Bitch! It's 1990
Your girlfriend's out there trying to find me
She heard about me, I fucked her best friend
I guess she wants to see if I can do it again
You want to be like me, so damn bad
The impossible dream all you MC's had
If you could rap like me, you wouldn't have the dream
Start rapping quit flapping like a chicken wing
If could rap like me, they say you're so great
But when they talk about you, they say you're so fake
And as the days go by, you can't forget
The way I make you feel like shit
MC's like you, I've seen 'em before
You keep on saying ""Fuck Too $hort""
But I'm a better MC than you
And ain't a damn thing you can do, but bitch
On the TV screen, in the magazines
When they interview you, you just make up things
You're on an ego trip and you're fronting like you're down
You're not the first real rapper from the Oakland town
You're just a new jack, and you can't even rap
You wanna trip? Trip on that
I'm like MC Lyte, checking hoes tonight
If you're not a real rapper, get off the mic
Cause with a fake MC, a song's never complete
You'd better learn to rap like me

""Thought you want to be like Too $hort""
""Thought you want to be like Too $hort""

Whenever I rap, you call it noise
I'm tearing up shit up like the Acorn Boys
On 10th street, I got a big freak
Until you learn to speak, realize you're weak
Cause it's the Oaktown, and they all get down
To the rhythm of the Too $hort funky sound
It goes boom, baseline's on ya
Dangerous Crew from Oakland, California
Bitch don't front cause Short Dog is hard
If you answer my rap, I tear your ass apart
Just like this, it lasts forever
You make a song and I make one better
You say I cuss, I say you're fake
Your eyes pop open like paper plates
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
I make hit records with the vicious raps
I said it before, I'll say it again
The boy ain't nothing but one of my fans
Like silicon titties, can you feel 'em?
How can a fake rapper fuck with a real one?
Shit, I'm that rapping man
I like you like the Klu Klux Klan
Motherfucker want to front on me?
My posse got a real MC, Too $hort
And it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
Cause I'm Too $hort baby on the microphone
And I'm macking, bitch

""Thought you want to be like Too $hort""
""Thought you want to be like Too $hort""
""Thought you want to be like Too $hort""
""Thought you want to be like Too $hort""

Now back to the subject, my boy MC
Whatever you say, you can't rap like me
Rappers like me make real hits
Rappers like you talk bullshit
I told my boys there's a new Funky Drummer in town
You're trying to be like James Brown
If I couldn't be me, who would I be?
I damn sure wouldn't be a sucker MC
Cause I'm not like you, my game is true
I pimped these hoes and I pimped you, too
Cause I'm boss, and boss makes the rules
You disobey and you be a fool (Now listen)
One, remember how it all began
Don't guess, the answer is ""Oakland""
Two, you'd better learn to rap like me
Or you like to be a fake MC
Three, never talk down on a player
I wouldn't care if you was Fred Astaire
Last but not least, number four:
Don't ever fuck with Too $hort, bitch

In the Trunk,Shorty the Pimp,1992.0,"It's on
Where they at, where they at, where they at
I sold tapes every day me and Freddy B
Been famous since 1983
Give me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed
A rap all about you called the special request
Oakland, you know I go way back
To Cougnuts, fast Stangs, and Cadillacs
When homeboys put Vogues on any car
With 6 by 9's smoking burners
Everybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat
Whole town fucked around and started smoking D
Every rap I ever made was about this town
I made 7 whole albums with no James Brown
And even though I love his music, I just can't stand
The way they used it all up and didn't pay the man
And after 2 platinum albums, you call me weak
Cause I don't sell records in the East
Now what's funky, I say pussy on an old ho
I guess y'all fools don't know
Why some good rappers can't sell no tapes
It's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake
You wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box
While the young bitches ride on your jock
You can't do it like this homey, so just pass it
And stop kissing them white folks' asses
It's like you smoked a whole damn key
You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat
I'm from the old school, I love P-Funk
But now rap music is all that they want
So when I'm in my car, I play Clinton
And when I'm on the stage I start pimping
And when I hear your shit, I push eject
Then I throw it out the window with the rejects
And when the hard core rappers go soft
I like to watch when they ass fall off
Cause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC
And any other rappers ever talk about me
I don't stop rapping, that's all they can say
And how I dogg bitches, every day
But if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak
You be phony like a side show freak
Some rappers try to come off positive
Where I'm from that just ain't how it is
They say rap music is here to stay
But the sucka MC's don't think that way
It took 8 long years before I got my break
So I wonder why rappers make fake ass tapes
You won't get paid like I did, so give up punk
And while you're in the studio, I'm in the trunk
You got no choice, so don't flip that coin
This ain't the military, so you punks can't join
It ain't pop, it's called underground rap
From Oakland California and the shit sounds phat
I'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I used to be broke, but now we all used to be
Got no game for a bitch, all the game is for me
And these bitches, can't say shit to me
They could never could fuck with Short baby
I'm not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style
Don't dress hip hop and dance real wild
But I do sell records like a motherfucker
Even though you might I'm just another sucka
I find the beat and then never switch
Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch
You want rent money, I got pimp money
One thing's for sure, I won't give it to a ho
I throw a bitch in the God damn trunk
And start slamming that Oakland funk
Short Dogg's in the house, once again
Trying to fade the platinum, with Shorty the Pimp
And when I do, I'm going straight to the bank
Withdraw some money and buy some dank
You can't relate to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I grew up on the funk called P
But these motherfuckers growing up on me
And if I ego trip, and my head is fucked
I take my ass back, to where I grew up
And get real boy, it's never too late
Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape
I'm in the trunk...
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block",https://genius.com/Too-short-in-the-trunk-lyrics
I Ain’t Trippin,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"I was told not long ago
""Too $hort don't stop that rap!'
Now every time I grab the mic
I rock it just like that
8 years ago when I started my rap
I used to sell tapes everywhere
It was me and my homeboy Freddy B, y'all
Kickin' it like big players
Everybody loved my raps like hundred dollar bills
I rocked house parties on 98th
Even rocked in the 6-9 'ville
Might find me on the mic at ""Hot Lips"" house
Or at the East Bay Dragons' Spot
All the 8-5 boys with their hands in the air
Screaming ""Too $hort just don't stop!'
Like Arroyo Park, like Plymouth Rock
Birch Street and Sunnyside
Like Sobrante Park and Brookfield
East Oakland, yeah, that's right
5 years ago I continued to rock
And if you haven't yet heard my name
It was all in the papers, on the evening news
I was stone cold in the game
Around that time a friend of mine, my homeboy Lionel B
Hooked me up like this, y'all, on the stage just rockin' the beat
Some say I have a dirty mind
Sometimes that might be true
But these are just some dirty times
I ain't trippin' on you...
I ain't trippin', keep on talkin'
You think I'm smokin' that pipe
I got money, homeboy
I even got some of your future wifes
Well, my story goes like this, man
I smooth went out on wax
Singin' Girl, That's Your Life'
Female Funk' and Shortrapp'
Silky D worked the beat kicked me down cold cash
I was ridin' the bus one day
Next day I was on the gas
Everybody loved Too $hort
Rollin' down the strip
Then one day just like that
Homeboy jumped on my tip
You started spreadin' rumors, man
And said you saw me rappin' in jail
No, I never came down to the flat lands
I was chillin' with the homies on the hill
I ain't trippin' but the word went out
Sir Too $hort was through
Can't really say where it all began
So I'm blamin' it all on you
Everybody used to say 'Too $hort don't stop that rap!'
Now every time you see my face
You say I'm smokin' crack
Oakland, Cal-i-for-ni-a, I heard it all before
I'm makin' big bank now, rockin' the crowd
I ain't trippin' no more...
Now I'm back on top again
I still don't stop that rap
Every time I grab the mic
My bankroll's gettin' fat
Freaky Tales took care of that
You know I'm comin' up
'Cause every time you see my face
I'm rollin' oh so tough
When I made the cut...the-the-the Freaky Tales
I started picturin' this
I named my album, ""Born To Mack""
With the cleanest drop Biarritz
Everything was kickin' in
Me and Ran kept cashin' checks
Next thing I know there you go
Guess who's on my tip?
You said I just got out of jail
Jumped right back on that pipe
Your sister's boyfriend told you, man
I'm smokin' every night
Then you came to my show
And stood there so damn bold
You said, ""Too $hort, man, you smoking""
And I'm standin' there draped in gold
I ain't trippin' no more
Really ain't worth my time
So to squash it all I kicked on back
And wrote you all a rhyme
Benzes roll, Beamers jet
And Caddies keep on dippin'
You keep on talkin' all that crap
I ain't trippin'...",https://genius.com/Too-short-i-aint-trippin-lyrics
City of Dope,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"City of dope, I call it Oak
Can't be broke selling coke
Fat ropes, shattered hopes
Fresh cars and all that dope
Baseheads keep the trade alive
Nobody knows 'bout a 9 to 5
Everybody's just tryna survive
You need a gun, can't use those knives
You got a bullet? Well just pull it
And if you trip, get pistol-whipped
By a psychomaniac sick in his head
Wanna be a gangster and now he's dead
His brother took over, ain't no sweat
Bought a new drop-top white Corvette
Now he's buying keys, making G's
And all the girls say ""Won't you please take me""
In the city of dope

See I'm hard as hell, no ghetto tale
You play a gun, but the game is real
You wanna stop my money, how?
You keep smoking, I'm selling out
It's called the city of dope, might be your town
Get a piece of the rock, turn your life around
So cool, don't even trip
You got the sack, get on the tip
A resident in the city of dope
And every day I'm selling coke
I'm never broke, I don't smoke
I sold a rock and made you have a stroke
Pay me cold cash you know, I won't need Bruno
I'll hit you with my gat and then I won't come back
Like my peanut butter top with the candy paint
All the high school tenders drop down and faint
In the city of dope

Life in a coke town, heard it before
Think it's all been said, but there's so much more
It's like midnight, slanging rocks
Task force just hit the block
Time to make a move, the spot got hot
You chase a cop, homeboy why not?
She lit the match and light the crack
Ain't giving no bitches no kind of slack
Or if you're playing the game, then you're thinking the same
Goddamn that rock cocaine
I see a lot of my friends gone off that pipe
And every night smoke coke that's white
So when you get up, man, there you go
You and that pipe just dogging the hoes
In the city of dope, and the story goes
Want to be like free, breaking millions of loaves
In the city of dope where the color is gold
On your neck, and your fingers, and your brand new Rolls
Enough said, but my rap won't end
It's on a one way trip to San Quentin
Like you my friend, ain't nothing new
You want to grind that boat 'til it's way past two
You say it's not easy, but you're so hard
Sporting gold tone Z's, not credit cards
Got clout turn 'em out, you got bitches
You say you're not fake, but I'm telling you this is
The city of dope, might be your world
Get a beeper homeboy and just sell that girl
I'm from the town called the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
So go on, live your life of crime
The beat'll keep beating while I say my rhyme
In the city of dope

Smoking weed, rolling 'em fat
You wonder where the boy learned to act like that
He was raised in the ghetto and felt the need
To roll a fat joint and smoke that weed
But the tale goes on and years went by
Another drug came and the boy got high
Ever since that day, he just wasn't the same
Where I come from we call it ""rock cocaine""
Where you come from, you might call it ""crack""
But wherever he went, you see he never came back
I tried to tell the motherfucker, but he don't know
I say to coke, ""Pimp that ho""
I don't live in a mansion but I drive a Benz
Cut to the turf and collect my ends
Say ""Look here freak, kick me down
I don't have time to talk right now""
Got to go to my next ho
And get kicked down a little more
Left right left, down the street
Getting paid freak by freak
There you see me, there you don't
You wonder will I or won't
Is it yes? Is it no?
But does it really matter you freaky ho?

Oakland california is the city of snakes
Pimps, pussies, players and fakes
Loud mouth bitches who talk too much
Dick teasin bitches who never fuck
Sucka ass nigga fake as hell
A man or a bitch I really can't tell
Some of you niggas need to quit
Show and tell nigga you ain't shit
Sayin I got this and I got that
But when it comes to you I got no rap
Cause what I see is good for me
And what I don't know just let it be
Bitches gamin' workin' extensions
Her hair ain't really but two inches
Bald head girls in the Oakland world
Short afros and jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald head and say go to hell
But your a snake your a worm
Bald head bitch you need a perm
Oakland california is the city of liars
Fresh barbed wires with vouge tires
Niggas tellin' stories twenty minutes long
And everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I don't wanna know
All I want is stereo rock
Homeboys kick it gettin keyed
Sold that mark some fake weed
Told that nigga here you go
A big fat sack and you know it's premo
A 20-dollar bill went to your hand
You rushed that money to the coke man
To the coke bottle was the next stop
But you broke the bottle and can't smoke rock
Bass rocks bass rocks thats your daddy
You better off smokin' on a powdered cabby
Have a white christmas everyday
Cause cocaine cabby is a too short way
Thats Too S-H-O-R-T
Smoke more coke than Richard P
Have more money than Michael Jackson
Oakland, can I get some action?
Hey young tender in the 501's
I love to see when you work your tongue
Suckin my dick in the back of the car
Rollin down Skyline boulavard
I said beeeeeeeyach
What are you smoking?
A big fat dick in the big East Oakland
I see my homie, he needs to quit
Holdin' hands with a bitch who looks like shit
Maybe I'm wrong by what I say
Maybe that nigga is gettin paid
Maybe that nigga ain't bein used
Gettin fucked without collectin' dues
That's how I work all the time
I'm Too Short baby got a fresh new rhyme
For Oakland, California, that's the place
Homies got drugs all in yo face
When the OPD cruise down again
Niggas goin' half off dubes and tens
On any corner anywhere
Buy your drugs from a Oakland player
Niggas sell squat callin it top
Cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
Crime went down murder went up
And some of these turfs are tryin to get tuff
Who's the leader of the hour
Anybody livin' if they push power
M-16, 357
Sendin these niggas to hell, not heaven
So much death in the Oakland streets
Your nothin but a target, sellin weed
You know I'm rappin the honest truth
Niggas roll up shootin' guns at you
Threatening your life and calling you fake
Till you take your drugs to another state
And sometimes man it's a pity
Cause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city
Niggas who take do you know yourself
You must be the nigga with all the wealth
Maybe one day you can own this town
If everybody fucked and you are down
That's how you see it I do too
But I break bitches and you break crews
Oakland, California is gettin tough
Niggas got schemes for coming up
Niggas got ways to make big bank
Hittin' these streets like an army tank
I'm Too S-H-O-R-T
Spitin more game than you'll ever speak
(music for 10 seconds)
I got mo bitches wantin me
Cause I'm the best dam rapper from the Oakland streets
I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Oakland, California won't leave it alone
Cause I'm on this mic rapping that game
Knockin off tapes like I'm selling cocaine
Fucking these freaks indefinitely
I never stop fucking you Oakland freaks
High school bitches really like
The way Sir Too Short can rock the mic
Oakland, California that's the place
Freak freak bitch got a lot of ways
She got big fat titties size 38
Imm'a fuck that bitch but I can't wait
The young girl makes my body boil
When I fuck that bitch imm'a drill for oil
Imm'a put cocaine all over my dick
And tell that bitch it's time to lick
East Oakland that's where I live
The city of the freak freak freaky bitch
I spent the night with her she ain't mine
I fuck that bitch so many times
And that right there I could never fake
I thought my goddamn dick would break
Fucking too much makes you hurt
But I never stuck a bitch from puttin' in work
All you bitches can suck me dry
Suckin my dick for the rest of your lives
Ok baby here we are
Were just two young freaks in the back of the car
You are one who's the other
It's Sir Too Short that rappin' ass brotha
Everytime I talk to you
Whatcha wanna know is it still cool
And everytime what do I state
Your still my bitch that's everyday
All you bitches cause I'm a hall
And you baby girl my freaky doll
I'm too short baby now I'm smokin'
Another big cabby and I'm in East Oakland
Not the west not the north
It's the eastside baby I'm Sir Too Short
I can spit a rap and i'll create
A sucker MC everyday
Niggas from Oakland, young and old
Runnin' round here keep off that dope
Singin my rap at the skating rink
Sucker MC, do you know what I think?
You wanna be me so damn bad
You wish that you could make my raps
When I say ""Short"", you say your name
Tellin your homies you rappin' game
But I sell tapes and niggas know
You singin my rap in stereo
Some of you niggas ain't really shit
And Tony G. is just a bitch
Why does Tony rap like me
Cause he ain't no pass high ?
Just sleep to the world on what I do
Grab a mic front you
Tony G., you just can't have it
Nothin' but a little light-skinned old faggot
Tryin to rap on the mic
But Too Short baby is what they like",https://genius.com/Too-short-oakland-california-lyrics
All My Bitches Are Gone,Get In Where You Fit In,1993,"Too $hort:
I used to have a lot of bitches
Straight down for me
Doin' anything I said, even ho on the street
But I'm a dog and I dog my broads
Guerrilla pimpin', drivin' four door cars
Ain't got no kids but them bitches love daddy
They had to share me or them bitches couldn't have me
Cause I'm a Mack with a capital M
Call me $hort Dog baby, put the P in the Pimp
I keep my foot in your ass and wouldn't give a fuck
Get out her pocket, bitch you gettin' beat up
You see me hangin' with them niggas like jock
And every single five mile, bitches gettin' popped
Well now I got a rep and they say I'm wrong
I beat my broad ass and she moved back home
Came in one night, I was buzzin'
Bitch tried to front me for fuckin' her cousin
She started yellin', man, the bitch got raw
I took one step back and went straight to her jaw
I gives a fuck that the bitch left
Cause all she ever got was some good dick
And it really ain't shit to find another bitch
Cause I'm a cool motherfucker and I'm hella rich
(Yeah) Ant Banks in the house and you know he knows
Grab the mic nigga, fuck these hoes
Ant Banks:
Yeah, I'm thinkin' back 'fore a nigga just came up
Playin' games with the bitches
Thought a nigga might change but
I was tight thinkin' everything's all right
Doin' the same shit to a different bitch every night
Just dickin'em down like a gigolo
So you gotta peep game from a nigga though
I'm too young to get sprung so don't trip, tell'em
(Ain't no love, bitch)
So let's speak about a freak named Connie
Fucked the bitch tough, backstage at the Omni
I can't forget Constance, the bitch is so dumb
Quick to lick my nuts, suck my dick, and just hum
And these are just some hoes
That a nigga like tossed up, kinda crossed up
Turned out and lost but I ain't trippin'
They all got tramped
Used and abused till they all just vamped
And left a nigga stuck with no kind of get back
Now I even get shook by the hoodrats
Cause they know what the fuck they gon' get
Took for they cash and a mouth full of dick, huh
And I hate I gotta be that way
Goin' vicious on these bitches
Just made'em all leave today
But I know it won't last long
They sayin' fuck Ant Banks
Now all my bitches is gone
Too $hort:
All my bitches are gone, them bitches bounced
I had a gang of'em, now they can't be found
They ain't fuckin' with $hort Dog
Cause I'm from Oakland
You fuck with us bitch, somethin' gettin' broken
Your leg, arm, jaw, nose, pick a part
Oakland motherfuckers'll break your heart
Until you recognize game in your face
You's a punk ass bitch, ain't never been no place
I can't hold back, now's the time
To leave your stank fake broke ass bitches behind
And move on like a player
I'm knockin' ghetto hoes and even squares
Secretaries, nurses, and police women
I'm flyin' first class, nigga, fuckin' flight attendents
$hort Dog ain't nothin' but a dog, beeyatch
(Ain't nothin' new nigga, come again)
All my bitches are gone, them bitches cut
But I really don't give a fuck
I always knew I didn't need that ho
I got the game from the motherfuckin' E-S-O
And you can tell when I hit the place
All them star-struck bitches jump in my face
And get shot to the curb like I'm the mob
Unless they givin' niggas blowjobs
Ant Banks:
Yeah, and when a bitch wanna flirt
I put in work, treat'em all like dirt
And watch them get they feelin's hurt
Cause I'm a mack, ho, listen to this rap, ho
And you will know not to fuck around
You'll get slapped, ho
For tryin' to fuck up the Ant Banks program
Steady saltin' with your stanky ass toe jams
You're mad cause I wouldn't spend no time
I'm with the homies, makin' cash
Pullin' bitches and writin' rhymes
I'm just doin' what I got to do
I'm not fuckin' with you
Because your funky ass cock is through
So now I gotta get some new hoes
Some old school bitches
That's still ridin' trues and vogues
I want a freak with the gangsta look
That Ant Banks can hook
And the bitch better know how to cook
Cause I'm a nigga that'll eat some shit up
Macaroni, steak, collard greens, or whatever the fuck
Yeah $hort, you know how we do'em
Treat bitches like red lights and run right through'em
I got my mack on strong and my dick on long
So fuck it, all my bitches can stay gone

Mine too

You know what I'm sayin'?
Too $hort:

Money On the Floor,No Trespassing,2012.0,"I said hey lil momma, what’s the deal
Talk to me girl I’ma keep it real
I’ve been on you since you walked through the door
Now drop it low like there's money on the floor
Like there's money on the floor oh
Now drop it low like there's Money on the floor oh
Yeah, now drop it low like it’s money on the floor oh
Pick it up girl, pick it up girl
Drop it low like there's money on the floor oh
Pick it up girl, pick it up, girl
Drop it low like it’s money on the floor

All that sexy dancing, the hair and the dress is so romantic
It’s so sexual, wiggle that body girl let it go
It’s got me intoxicated
Like drugs, it’s got me faded
The visual is amazing
3-D digital entertainment
The women are beautiful here
And they come from everywhere
From all over the world
Come here, you see the most beautiful girls
They make it clap, throw that back
Bend over and show that crack
That booty is so damn fat
How you make it go like that


She a flirt, she look like pet milk come out when she squirt
She don’t believe in wearing panties under her skirt
No bra under her shirt
I like the way she twerk
This ya one right here baby this your motivation
Make your cheeks applaud like a standing ovation
Got my dick hard like incarceration
Let me buy you a drink, intostication hello uuaah
Ain't nothing square about this hustler here man
Give a chick a Chinese name
One gone Play head games
But you want more, want more
Get it real within your rear, it's smacking yo mind
Baby girl they call me Earl
I rap and I rhyme but I used to sell that swirl
That white, white, white candycane and Mother of Pearl
Its right, right, right biiitch!



I need to penetrate her
Hook it up like a generator
And make electricity
With that booty, she don't miss the beat
I don’t wanna kiss the freak
That ass is just a magical mystery
I can’t take that shit
Put her on top, she'll break that dick

Shopaholic, Soho, she got a badass shape, like Coco
She young but her body full of figure
You oughtta see her momma they could pass for sisters, Uh oh
For some strange reason I gotta thing
There's something about a broad and some white jeans
Make her feeling through her pants when she back it up
Thicker than the Reese's peanut butter cup biiitch",https://genius.com/Too-short-money-on-the-floor-lyrics
Hoes,Shorty the Pimp,1992.0,"You see some people like to play the dating game
Meet a new freak and ask ""What's your name?""
Wine and dine and waste all that time
Spending money on a ho 'cause you think she's fine
Holding hands at the movies, waiting months to fuck
Played like a sucker, you should know what's up
Getting dogged by a snotty, fake, broke-ass ho
Listen to a real dog, 'cause I know
You get a pretty yellow bitch with that long-ass hair
Fine motherfucker trying to get with a player
Can't fuck worth shit, old stiff-ass bitch
Tried to get some head and she just kissed my dick
I need a bitch with a beeper, a full time tramp
She can't suck dick like she's licking a stamp
But she can lick it all around, or swallow it whole
Deep throat this big dick and act real bold
You go to sleep, she'll straight rob your ass
'Cause hoes like to steal and take all your cash
And when hoes go to jail, pimps make bail
Take 'em to the stroll and let the pussy sell
'Cause to a trick, they're just quick nuts
But to a grandmother, they're like big sluts
And if you're $hort Dog, they look like bank rolls
If I ever go broke I'll just break hoes
'Cause hoes were made to be broken
It happens every day in Oakland
I need a bitch, that's one thing I know
Put my money where my mouth is and break them hoes
Two or four, they like to run in pairs
Hit small towns and sell pussy everywhere
I ain't giving no bitches, no kind of slack
'Cause Oakland California is where they made 
The Mack
Prostitution is the oldest profession
Kick back young partner, learn your lesson
Pimp 'til you die, as long as you know
Pimps ain't nothing but hoes
Getting paid, for everything you say
If a ho wanna fuck you, she gots to pay
Keep the bitch broke and control the world
Cause when hoes get rich, they call 'em ""call girls""
Now ain't nothing like a neighborhood trampy slut
Take a ho to a spot and let her lick these nuts
Get a square bitch, you gotta lie to kick it
But with a nasty bitch, she'll just lick it and lick it
I had a square bitch, man, she looked way too cool
She said she loved me, but is that true?
She asked me could she be my lady
Wanted so much to have my baby
So what bitch? I popped your cherry
Hell fucking no I don't wanna get married
'Cause can't no bitch hound me
Talking that shit about a family
I wants no champagne, I drink gin and juice
Bring a bag of ice and watch a ho get loose
Spread the word, we're getting tossed tonight
And please don't trip on the cellulite
I got a fat bitch, sucking on my dick
Every day, homie, it's the same old shit
Don't look stupid, ho, drop them goddamn drawers
Get your ass in the bed and let's fuck like dogs
On the very first night, we fucked
I got the pussy, I got sucked
I couldn't wait, she asked me why
I let the answer shoot straight in her eye, bitch
Hoes are like cum freaks, they suck you dry
They do what you say, and don't ask why
Who said that ho ain't old enough?
If she could bleed, then she could fuck
Call me ""Dirty Dog"" but your cot stank
Motherfuckers think pimps ain't making bank
But the, pimp game just don't stop
You gotta be down to reach the top
I tell all my homies ""Play these hoes""
Don't eat the pussy and pay these hoes
'Cause some of these hoes get tore up smoking
Bitches like that you find all through Oakland
Miniskirts and no panties on
When it's time to fuck, it don't take too long
And it's mandatory for hoes to simp
Catch other hoes and bring 'em to pimps
So take this game and keep it for life
Never make a ho into a housewife
Just get a good bitch, a workaholic like Holly
Bitch so bold, she'll take a piss in the alley
And make big bank, it's like the pussy is dope
They keep coming back until the tricks go broke
But if that ho jumps off the track
Another young bitch will bring them tricks right back",https://genius.com/Too-short-hoes-lyrics
That’s Why,Gettin’ It (Album Number Ten),1996.0,"Yeah, we gettin' real on this album y'all
You know I'm hearin' all these rumors out here bout
They ran $hort Dogg up outta East Oakland
Nigga moved to Atlanta, ain't got no mo' love in the town
I got much love in Oakland y'all, you know what I'm sayin'?
I been doin' this shit for years
So I'm a tell it to you just like it happened.... BITCH

I don't stop rappin
Ever since the very first day
I grabbed the microphone, made a funky ass tape
I had sixteen hoes
Suckin ten toes
Game from the ""O""
An any real pimp knows
The only love hoes get is what they paid fo
Gimme my scratch
What the fuck I'm a stay fo?
I gotta make moves bitch
Stack some G's
From the ho stroll
To my fax machine
I got money comin in from everywhere
From New York
To L.A.,
To the mutha fuckin Bay
It's true
I'm the man G
I'm underground 106 can't ban me
All on the air sayin they don't fuck wit me no mo
I go back wit rap like K-P-O-O
From the very first time I grabbed the mic
Niggas smokin burner
Ready to fight
I don't promote violence
I'm from Oakland where the real kick it
You might get killed nigga
Or make a mill ticket
Move down south cuz the town is wild
Now the radio jocks wanna clown my style
I raised too many rappers you support
Ask 'em who they grew up on.... TOO $HORT
Fuck all that black ball shit it won't last
KMEL y'all can kiss my ass

That's why the town got rid 'o $hort
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort

It all started back when C & H
Went to TB tryin to playa hate
I flipped a brand new Lexus '93
Joda Balls called me up said ya lyin to me
He said I heard you an Ran got the cash an split it
If I don't get my cut
You mutha fuckaz gonna get it
It was thirteen G's all mine
Didn't give Ted & Rand one dime
Now listen real close cuz it might be
Hard to follow
Chris told Ted it was fifty thousand dollaz
Shit sound petty
An it is
But that's how it goes when you in show biz
Niggas fallin out
Should be makin millions
Instead of studios
We seein lawyers in buildings
Then we stop speakin
Shit got funky
I don't give a fuck
Mutha fucka get my money
I ain't never been a ho you can't pimp me
I do all the work while you pimp me
I tried to buy him out
But right about then
They let the lions out
Niggas start eatin that shit up
You shoulda never listened
I'm always on this money makin mission
Sold a car an a truck in Oakland fo that Lex
Jock loaned me five an I was rollin that bitch

Don't believe everything you hear nigga

I went to the freak-nik
Shit turned me out
Came back fo jack the rapper
Bought me a house
That was August '93 time to dip
I hade warrants in the town an I was hot as shit
Everytime I got stopped
Nigga went to jail
Treat me bad cuz I was hangin wit criminals
I wanted to buy me a house in the Oakland hills
Nice lil sumpthin fo a half a mill
That's was right around the time Chris hooked Dru Down
The Luniz came through an them tricks got clowned
Rappin Ron tore 'em up on the freestyle tip
An niggas ain't ran nobody outta shit
Then they put it on the town
Shit got real
When you was in the fourth grade I had a record deal
You got one hit record now you ballin
You make one fake album you'll be fallin
An that shit don't apply to me
Present or past
You can meet me at the mall an get my autograph
Or you can flash back
If you can do all that
Me Fred Benz
An Freddy Craps
Smokin burner upstairs in hot lips house
It's been fifteen years an I ain't played out
They playin Too $hort steppin on a Chevy pedal
Back in the days KMEL played heavy metal

That's why the town got rid 'o $hort
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort

Niggas shootin at the studio late at night
Seen a Cherokee started shootin at Spice
At the E-40 picnic out in the park
Niggas gather round fo some shit to start
They had bullets wit my name
But we never got to me
See me sucka mutha fucka
Shootin at the street
It was me
Boo, Howard, an Jock
A full clip
One in the chamber an it blockin T.B.,
Still tryin to be my pimp
I could lose my life
Or give my money to him
I'd rather die before you use me
I tried to buy him out
The nigga sued me

And that's where it stands right now y'all
For the mutha fuckaz that don't know

Gotta Get Some Lovin’,Get In Where You Fit In,1993,"Gotta get some lovin' (repeated 8 times)

Gotta get me some pussy
Bitch
What's really goin' on?
Yeah, Short Dog's in the house
Funky fresh, bitch

I saw you walking down the street had to stop
Turn up the radio, drop the top
Say ya look so good, you're so fine
I'll take ya to my house, we'll spend some time
I know you feel me, you need to find me
And give me head while I'm doin' about 90
Bitch, believe it or not, I'm 'bout to come up
What's up with the Cop?
I'll get you in my car, let you work that tongue
Drivin' to my house, we'll have some fun
But this ain't no Too Short freaky tale
'Cause right now I'm goin' through a dry spell
Stopped fuckin' with the hoes, just ride and look
Dip to the house to get the porno books
Thinkin' to myself I gotta knock a bitch
I gotta get some pussy, man fuck this shit

Gotta get some lovin' (repeated 8 times)

Bounced to the house all by myself
Can't get no pussy and I'm mad as hell
'Cause magazines can't even do the trick
I guess I have to watch me a porno flick
Popped in the movie, they start fuckin'
He was lickin', she was suckin'
I watched them ol' nasty freaks
Wishin' that shit might happen to me
I got a beep and got juiced up hommie
Looked at my pager and it said ""Tone Only""
I need a bitch that wanna give me some
Loves givin' head just to make me cum
Freak nasty all on my dick
Just like the ho in the porno flick
I went to bed without fuckin' a bitch
I gotta get some pussy man fuck this shit

Gotta get some lovin' (repeated 8 times)

I need a bitch, so I can get me some
She'll lick on these nuts and then make me cum
Get real freaky, had her pussy wet
Ease on in like an Oakland vet
Lay your ass down by the fireplace
Stick my dick in your mouth, let you have a taste
Of this skinny motherfucker with a big ol' dick
I'll let you ride it right after you lick it
See I come from the city of dope
From the mouth to the pussy and back down your throat
I gotta get some, I keep thinkin' of sex
I wonder who'll call my beeper next
I keep callin' hoes, ain't no one home
And like a punk motherfucker I'm all alone
So I told myself, I'm knockin' a bitch
I gotta get some pussy man fuck this shit

Gotta get some lovin' (repeated 8 times)
Where it's at

Back on the streets and it's on again
Bumped a little freak named Sonja San
She jumped in the car and we started to ride
Just graduated from Oakland High
18 years, thick as hell
She look kinda young, but my dick can't tell
Ride through the town with my sunroof open
Thinkin' about the pussy, man, just hopin'
Later on, some Hennessay and Tangeray
Will have her ass so high, I get to fuck today
I hit a corner, and seen her Pops
She waved to him, smiled and told her ""Stop""
I pulled over, looked at her father
He took one look and said, ""You can't mess with partner""
I had to leave without my young bitch
Can't get no pussy man fuck this shit

Gotta get some lovin' (repeated 8 times)",https://genius.com/Too-short-gotta-get-some-lovin-lyrics

Click my pistol and in his fuckin throat I shoved it
Give me your money and take that palve' off nigga
Fuck Tommy 'Figga, I'm off that doe and liquor
See I be dwellin' in the eastside of San Pedro Park
I smoke a camel, the lupsia done have me sparked
This lil' broad said I'm livin' in my last days
My mother love me, she say she hate my bad ways
But still she blame it on herself for doin what she done
It wasn't fun, she moved us in the ghetto slums
So what you think about myself cause I'm a grown man
A bad man, survival is whatever you can
You think you know it, flossin but I know you's a bitch
Cause I be watchin, tryin' to get my rob on this shit
See niggas underestimate the city that I claim
Where I am niggas sayin what the fuck is gangbang
Hard livin', mothafucka, represent your turf, your side of town
You know thats where the fuck I'm found
Knees dirty, hands dirty, smokin on a tree
Gamblin my drug money, hell yeah tee-da-lee

Of hurtin ass shit that I faced the last time
My last dime, goes on food I'm in the mood for a stick-up
To pick up lil' somethin on a get up
You hit up, blessed by the way I protest
Your world, gettin it all of my chest
Yes the struggle grab me, hatin better have me
Drama from my Momma, disowned by my Daddy
What should I do, tuck my head and throw them rolos
If anybody know about the trouble I bet Joe knows
And raw livin it remind me
Of the shit that I wanna put behind me
I'm stayin high for days cause what I'm doin it pays
They don't hate me really, they hate my bad ways
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
They hate my bad ways (real bad ass ways)

You leavin messages, on her answering machine
I'm in the bed, listenin, laughin, ticklin, giglin, kickin it

You was hugged up with her when I met her
She gave me that look like please make it better
I told her with my eyes, meet me over there
Instantly, she was the victim of a player
I be spittin this game like Iceberg Slim
What about your man, she said ""Fuck him""
Let's roll, so we jumped in the Benz
Left you at the bar, talkin to your friends
$hort Dog came through with the satisfaction
Now you runnin round like a fatal attraction
Cause I been in the pussy for the last few days
Don't take it personal, it's just my bad ass ways
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)

Female Players,What’s My Favorite Word?,2002.0," Only fuck with these silly-ass boys for fun
 Get 'em all alone, and a thug is hung
Screamin aiyy-yah, aiyy-yah
 Only fuck with these silly-ass boys for fun
 Get 'em all alone, and a thug is hung
Screamin aiyy-yah, aiyy-yah

I like them wild girls, the way they throw that
When the music ghetto, and she don't hold back
I wanna see her wiggle, when I stick it in her
Call me the champ, cause my dick's the winner
Bitch! It's internationally known
I picture in my mind, you look nasty in thongs
You probably do it just like you dance (player)
You bout to bust out your pants
You got.. too much ass in your jeans
Throw it my way, I'm not passin a thing
Are you a pleaser, or a teaser?
R&B diva or a skeezer?
To me, it's the same difference
I do my thang in the game, pimpin'
Don't worry bout me, cause I'mma do mine (damn)
Damn this bitch is too fine
 + woman
 Only fuck with these silly-ass boys for fun
 I like female players
 Get 'em all alone, and a thug is hung
Screamin aiyy-yah, aiyy-yah
 Only fuck with these silly-ass boys for fun
 I don't like them squares
 Get 'em all alone, and a thug is hung
Screamin aiyy-yah, aiyy-yah

Yeah she got dough, she get her hustle on
You can't buy that girl out, fool what you want?
She get her own table, buy her own bottles
Look in her purse, she got long dollars
Now you wonder why she hangin with me
You curious how my game could be
Playin broads ain't a thang to me
It must be a sign up but you can't see (player)
It's right there in your face
Throw the peace sign up all the players in the place
Look around, it's time to go to work
I'm tryin to flirt with little momma in the shortest skirt
I think she with it, but I don't wanna just hit it
I wanna get explicit
And if she kiss it, it's bound to get good
Tomorrow mornin I'll be cruisin round the bitch hood
 w/ minor variations

All my female players, gather around
It's a roller coaster baby you at Magic Mountain
Six Flags on a holiday
You wanna ride again girl you ain't gotta wait
You never have to stand in line for the ride
Just take a few hits cause I'm tryin to get you high
I can't tell you to loosen up
But I can say I love the way you move your butt
Let's make it happen, you wanna go home with me?
So I don't wake up in the mornin all lonely?
We can't compromise, I won't promise you lies
But I will make you feel it 'til the sun rise
And if you wanna know what it's like
Ask all the top notches in the club tonight
They'll tell ya, I ain't tryin to find a wife
But if you fuck with Short Dawg you'll have the time of your life
 w/ minor variations
 I like female players",https://genius.com/Too-short-female-players-lyrics
Something to Ride To,Shorty the Pimp,1992.0,"Ahhhhhh shit - now let me warm it up
I got the gin and juice and I'ma pourin' my cup
To get smooth in the mood that I'm in
So lets start riding till this motherfucker ends
And hit the main strip, where the hoes be hanging
Spitting some game and trying to throw that thang
On any young nigga with some ends
A mobile phone and a drop top benz
Take it from me, see, cause I know what it's about
Kick a big fat dick in a bitch's mouth
And keep riding, high siding, but don't front
Nigga serve that shit, don't be no punk
And while the niggas keep jocking, I be scoping
All the fine ass freaks of Oakland
That's where I reside, and where I always will be
The city of killers, dope dealers and still we
Chill like players, and act like pimps
Mack all hoes and slap all simps
The big badass, I'm from the Dangerous Crew
I just hang with the gang like it's the thang to do
Now motherfuckers can't face the facts that I'm doing this
Rapping and producing and they can't even ruin this
See everybody knows the Banksta, the big dick gangsta
Who's fucking with dank and clocking the bank
And I'm a get mine in the 9 O's
I mean the money, the fame, and the and the big thick fine hoes
I'm pulling up right beside you
Bumping this funky ass shit to ride to

Now here's some shit for you to ride to punk
Fifteen's slammin hard in my god damn trunk
From tenth ave, to a hundred and fifth
Young players ride the foothill strip
They ride Chevys, Cougars, Blazers, Vettes
Five 60 Benzos with Ferrari kits
They love fine ass bitches, rolex watch
Top let down on the coke white drop
I love my high schools cuties, muscle bound booties
Pools a hoes so you know I had to do my duties
I got to have it like a rabbit, fuck her like a champ
I tell you nigga I'm a pro with these high school tramps
They say young minds, make good times
See I'm a player so let me give an O 9
Alicia, Tina, Marie, and Evette
She wanna ride punk bitch you can ride my dick
Now Shawnetta, Shawnda, an Rida too
Now here's a shot to the whole slug crew
Talk bad punk bitch but it's always Pooh
Kiss my ass and spend your cash, on this shit to ride to

Push in my deck, put in the key and start the engine
Cause I ain't joking, tired of smoking donuts while I'm spinning
A tight high performance engine with the duals and cams
Fuck a spare tire in my trunk, it's boom, that slams
Cause I'm a young brotha like to burn rubber yo, get in and out of lanes
I pump that ride in your bumper so ya change
Then I take a pit stop, exterior/interior whipped up
They wax me, then they buff me, niggas don't love me now I'm tip-top
Now I'm coming fresh from the detail shop
Going to the Lee-Nail spots, looking for the female cop
I feel the bass and woofer kick my chest like a heartbeat
Went to the curb, when I saw the ass of a dark freak
So I pulled up slamming $hort Dawg
I said ""Hey"", she said (*snort*), I said, ""Damn a fuckin warthog!""
So I smashed out doing 90
Covered her ass up with the smoke I left behind me
The medley steadily flowed in my ears like oxygen
Too $hort, the Pooh, and the Banks, got the hoes on our jocks again
Fucking with the hooties, with booties, and big titties
That's potent, but all I got is cheese for a rodent
Got a ticket doing 60 in a school crossing
Picking up my young cock for some cool tossing
Defamation of character, racially slandering
But all I'm ever guilty of is pimping and pandering
So please let me go officer
Because I could be at home in my bed tossing her
I make like Al, tune, crank the vol-ume, and dash
Hit the freeway cause I can't play when I got some ass
Respect a player and an O G that's what they told me
Mhisani nickname Goldy, spittin' shit to ride to

Now I come from the mother fucking eastside
So shut the fuck up bitch and just ride
I'm Short Dogg, ho you can't front me
Since my very first album I was funky
Bitches start seeing them dollar signs
Even though I wouldn't give a broke bitch one dime
It's kind of funny, they want money from a pimp
Bitch, you couldn't get 50 cents
I take a gap from your ass and then I owe you the rest
I know the game ho, and I'm a vet
Playing broads ain't based on love
You want my money, I wanna fuck
And after we do all that, I talk about you in my next rap
Beyotch!! Kiss my pimping ass
Cause all the time I didn't have this cash
Wouldn't call, wouldn't give me your number
I couldn't see ya like Stevie Wonder
I made a hit record, now I got money
You wanna play $hort Dogg for a dummy
But I come from the mother fucking eastside
You suck my dick so I let the fake bitch ride
Dangerous music is on the mike
And like Banks always say, ""This shit is tight""

Now thats some shit I ride
Pop that in the K-5 and go, buuuut
I got my partner Ant Banks sittin on something real phat
I got my partner Short, sittin on the hood of a Cadillac
I got eveybody rolling
I got Kool-Aid, he ain't spilling and he ain't trippin
I got Ol' T B with his big 'ol fat ass, I got everybody
I got ?, but he ain't got no skin on his dick cause he fuck too much
I got ah, I got Ol' Dirty Arm but that my partna though
Cause he's super clean, super side, super everything
I got Footy and Jerry, he trying to dred, but that ain't what's happening
I got a, shit who else I got, I got I got Face, Pooh, that's my partna
He'll look through a broad his face so big
I got ah, I got Pow Pow, he looking like Linus; he kind of filthy
But that's my partna though, I ain't going to talk bad
I ain't going to talk bad
No I ain't going to rank out
Oh Kitty Wing, that's my partna Peppermint Patty
I ain't going to talk about him
I ain't going to talk about Huh
Cause he might beat me up send the block out on me
I don't want the block to through on me
Oh Too Clean (*barking sounds*)
We got ah, we got Hist Dancers (what about Chris Hicks baby?)
Chris Hicks that's my that my Steven Seagal, he living lavish
Oh else we got, who else we got in the crew that you want me to rank on
The Tin Man Mo, that's Pah prince of Darkness, that's my dark partna
My counter, that's my darkside
Who else we got, who else we got
We got foothill, oh I didn't get Clim, his teeth glow in the dark",https://genius.com/Too-short-something-to-ride-to-lyrics
Buy You Some,Gettin’ It (Album Number Ten),1995.0,"Whoo! Ah ah ah, (yeah, yeah) ayahh, ahh ahh ahh
And you don't stop, ahh ahh, word is bond, word is bond
Now introducing the sound from the ghetto
E Double and Too $hort, what the fuck you thought?
I come with the ruckus, It's My Thing when I swing
I'm Born to Mack, always strapped, with the black gat
Who out there I swear boy wanna get touched
Roll up, and catch a slug to the chest, so DUCK
I talk the talk, walk the walk, now nigga
Five hundred S drivin with hand on trigger
Crazy Lestat, check my track record
Everything I touch is gold since eighteen years old
So what that mean? I roll the blunt
And puff the indo smoke in it, I trip in a minute
Crazy holy doctor holdin me cuz I be rockin B
Sewin up like Monopoly, nobody's stoppin me
Dig it, Funkdafied like Brat, how's that?
I stick and move on tracks while I smoke a twenty sack
Who said the E can't rock? That's bullshit
Suck my dick and get a big fat lick of my balls
You wanna brawl? Punk I thought not
You might get beat down and stomped like Sasquatch
Your girl, like Keith Sweat, I wanna fuck her
Psych, I already stuck her
I got rhymes to make your whole head swell up
Here's an icepack homeboy shut the hell up
I rock the mic with Too $hort, y'all niggas know what's happenin
Everything he touch goes platinum
Eyeeaaaah!

I made a half a million in a week
And every nigga on the street got a tape playin me
You can't believe it? Erick Sermon, rollin with $hort
Rolled from California all the way to New York
In big Benzes, G-50 up
Now we trying to squash all that East/West stuff
We spent years in the studio makin funky tracks
Signed a bunch of niggas with some tight ass raps
It's like Father Dom, it's like Keith Murray
Makin millionaires but it ain't no hurry
Cuz we all in it for the long run
I won't leave the studio until a song's done
And ain't nuthin really hard about gettin my cash
A big phat house with a million stash
You other niggas got this rap game distorted
Givin DATs to the label, straight gettin shorted
Claim you're gettin paid, but I can't tell
You keep rappin in my ear got me mad as hell
You talk a good game but I don't believe in you
Be smokin lotta blunts but I got more weed than you
I guess I see you on the charts in the meanwhile
Another face in the crowd plus some freestyle
Wishin you could be in the light
Promoters pay me ten G's just to breathe on the mic
Bitch! $hort Dawg puttin it down with the E Double

Shhhhh!
You remind me of my phat gold chain
Some of y'all are just small change
Be a boss with true true game (yeah, yeah)
Dig this y'all, my Music is Dangerous
Atomic Dog, coming through the smog with $hort Dawg
Ahhh! Quick with the trig Jack be nimble
I shoot like G Mob goes liftin through my window
Chik chik pow! How you like me now?
The man in the mirror it don't get no clearer
$hort Dawg, the E Double, and Breed we roll thick
Like girls in C.A.U. with the good power-U
Owww! Money is the key to fame
So I can live it up with the girls on Soul Train
The impact, major league dough like Dave Justice
Yo Breed, $hort Dawg, show em how we bust this

Like some true pioneers, don't forget it
Put the money on the table, let's split it
We got enough G's here to make us both happy
Tell them fans we ain't runnin no coke factory
It's $hort Dawg the real pimp of the century
Girls get wet every time somebody mention me
I was known for my mackin back in eighty-four
I want it all, that's what I keep stackin for
Have things that a rapper never dreamed of havin
And I can tell them how to get it just keep rappin
Life's a battle, headed for the new sun
So many ways to get paid, you got ta choose one

Now some of the ways to get paid out is runnin your mouth
That street life will keep me tight, I'm talkin bout
Gettin green, dolla dolla bills y'all
That's on the real, somethin you can feel y'all
Many claim to have game but you can get that on sale
But ain't nuthin they sellin to you but Arbor and Gail
I mean Sprinkle Me homey cuz I'm bout dollars and cents
And if you ain't haulin dollars well you ain't holler
In FlintI'd rather dip dip dive, so-socialize
Get loot from the Great Lakes, West to Eastside
You tramp, trick, HACH I spit
Undergrade if you ain't gettin paid like this

The hours of the ATL paves my name
Spittin Mr. Macker izzer are you still in the game
See I gets paid by the movement of the cut
I've been summoned by the cancer, to testify and bless
It's that, big mack, like scripture is a phat Kodeje?
So hide your ho from me
Southern am-bassador, knockin at your door
Leadin a click that's true, checkin knowin all fifty-two
See, all you tricks, best behave
It's that Southern nigga mack from the city of the Brave
I got the platinum caul, yes yes y'all
So plant me with the green and them hoes and we can big ball
Yeah, now we rollin four deep
Double dosin, relaxin, and maxin to $hort and these beats
E Double, $hort Dawg, Kool Ace
In the place, and be all but bring you straight horror

Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches,Can’t Stay Away,1999.0,"A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lot of butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's OK if she's got cash

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feeling shabby
Got juiced up with a big fat Cabby
Cuz every morning you know I have
A big fat Cabby and a nice hot bath
Just soakin, smokin, Sir Too Short
Thinkin about the day before
Thirty minutes after I woke out
I pulled a freak and took her to the house
She was Eleve Young, with alotta butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy, I wouldn't pass
A light-skinned freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin away
I wanna do the same thing again today
I want bitches, bitches, and more bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The day my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself I must need glasses
Where's them bitches with the big round asses
Me and my group just wanna be tough
Freak two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I seen a bitch
But that ain't nuthin but a cat
None of them bitch didn't have no ass
Wait on the bus, some was walkin
Me and my homie just started talkin
I said, oh, she looks good
He said that ass is flat as wood
I said what about Vicky in the black
He said, Short, she's all that

The Invasion was on...

Every single day of the week
For every nigga living there's a freak
If you've got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cuz bitches all over wanna get worked
I just need one with alotta turf
Me and my homie, rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie, I hate to say
All the bitches with booties stayed home today
And he said Short, what now?
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-Town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind


We hit the B-Town like Oakland players
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tits so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
I capped on her like a motherfuckin fool
I said be-atch, I know I'm cappin
Where's your ass, baby what happened
She turned around and capped on me
She said, fuck you nigga, where's your teeth
I damn near fell jumpin out the car
But I slapped that bitch, and slapped her hard
My homie said Short we gots to cut
But I was kickin that bitch and her big flat butt
I kicked her ass, got in the ride
Looked at the bitch and said bye bye

The invasion was on..

We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said baby, baby, baby come here
Yea you baby with your long long hair
Baby came over from across the street
She was standin on the corner just talking to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
Cuz I didn't even notice that big flat ass
Shit, and I was ready to go
We was rollin back to the O
I told that bitch I changed my mind
She looked at me and she said why?
I said I'm Sir Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and yo flat booty
Flat ain't the date superstar
I could see if you was white, but your black as tar


In the Berkeley temp, what did we find?
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day, I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Damn, I must be dreamin
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Wake me up 'fore I start screaming
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
What's this world comin to?
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Where's your ass, what happened to you?

She in love with the fella, I don't blame her though

Tell your nigga I'm your brother, we can play the role (Play the role)
I fuck with her 'cause baby was down to play along (Huh)
I fuck with her 'cause baby gave me that mainey throat
Getting suction in the load, didn't take me long
Uber on the way, I couldn't take her home
She ain't wanna leave, you don't make her moan
Free the beast, unc taught me how to break a ho
I was twelve, riding shotgun taking notes
So we gon' get it going like we 'posed to do ('Posed to do)
Need to execute in every car rollin' through (Uh)
If you a queen on this team, gotta show and prove
30K a month, bitch, you know the rules

And all my warriors just scoring with me, shoutout to Murph, no Lee
You sucka boys shoulda played on grief
Bless the bitch, the ho preyed on me, I spent a safe on my fleece
Her man gone, she wanna call me and creep
Narcolepsy, she gon' suck me to sleep, bust all in her teeth
Neffy a Chief but I don't smoke on Keef
Offense, so I threw her on D and then she threw it on me
I'm on fire like Pepsi did Michael
Can I hit your rear bumper without you calling up Geico?
Pussy so good I might fuck her on her cycle
Psych, bitch, I'm playing, I would never have a wife, ho
I gave her dick then took it back, she deprived
I'm the type of boss nigga that change lives

Everybody know I love the señoritas
I can't get enough, my chica bonita
'Cause she's always wet and she stay horny
I fell asleep, woke up, she was laying on me
Had my dick in her mouth, she was playing on me
Looked me in my eye and said, ""Say you want me""
I don't wanna be your man, I don't care if you're pretty
I'ma fly you to the Bay and have sex in the city
At The W, or maybe The Clift
Can't say you my wife, but you can say you my bitch

Can’t Take Her,The Sex Tape Playlist,2018.0,"Short Dog…

I’m just tryna find me a winner
Take her somewhere and put nine up in her
I gots no time for beginners
I put her on top and then I spin her
She got that good head on her shoulders
Arch that back when I tell her roll over
And if I fuck her real good, she let me cream in her mouth
My dick ain’t in her pussy, why she screamin’ so loud?
She just a cum freak, she can’t wait ‘til I bust
The bitch loves real niggas like us (What she like?)
She likes girls and boys, she like playing with toys
She like licking and sucking, and when she first started fuckin’
She ain’t have to learn nothin’, she’s a sexpert
Give a dick or a pussy and she gon’ make it squirt
And if you make her scream loud, she’ll say “Daddy, fuck me harder”
You better not stop her once you get started
Getting sloppy head, dick soakin’ wet
She uses both hands when she wanna stroke the dick
That’s a whole lotta muthafuckin’ spit, bitch
If you did this for a living, you would get rich
She ain’t tryna hear that shit, nigga, she ain’t playin’
She ain’t tryna fuck a trick like you if you ain’t payin’
She just tryna light that weed, and pour me a drink
You wanna fuck, you better tell her what you think
BITCH!

Fly nigga with a ride or die bitch
Close-knit, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her
Dope pussy, dope dick, dope mix
Gotta stir it up, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her

They call me Short Dog, I’m famous, mayne
For three decades, I’ve been spittin’ game
Where your bitch at—you tryna find her?
I been having broads in the A before Desiigner
I keep a new whip, my shit is too clean
Still pimpin’ on a bitch, same routine
Same ol’ Todd, same blue jeans
Getting money out a bitch ‘cause I move mean
I got a hundred bands from a bitch
I ain’t gotta sell records to be rich
I got a whole lotta ice on my wrists
That bitch could leave, nigga, I don’t give a shit
‘Cause I got another bitch in Miami Beach
A real freak, she flies back and forth every week
She works at KOD, and AOD
It’s all on a bitch, you know it’s AOB
I met this bitch, her name was Bitch
She was Dubai and her daddy was rich
She said whatever I want, she would buy
I told the bitch I want a red Lamborghini that flies
All these hoes in my life
And I ain’t ever once tried to make one my wife
I just break ‘em out and stick to the paper route
It’s pimpin’ on a bitch—what’s all this hate about?

I’m just a fly nigga with a ride or die bitch
Close-knit, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her
Dope pussy, dope dick, dope mix
Gotta stir it up, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her

Dope pussy, dope dick, dope mix
Stir it up, bad bitch won’t quit

Never Talk Down,Gettin’ It (Album Number Ten),1996.0,"You see you never talk down on a playa, I'll spray ya
Then break it down to your knee, you best to say a prayer
This funk been a part of my life ever since the startin' gate
Remember me and my nigga $hort Dog way back in '88?
Broke them bitches down with some sexual healing
And man the town ain't been the same since 
""Don't Fight the Feelin'""
But now your new booty, stayed off in this game on a accident
Copied another niggas style
Punk don't let this rap shit get you broke off
Cause see it's potent like that ain't right
Find a maiden name for yourself, but don't believe the hype
Fool, who you think opened the door for your producer?
If it wasn't for the Dog and them hogg's you wouldn't have a future
And let me add that I could never be scared of ya
Rappin' 4', born and raised off in that Bay Area
Stickin' to that ass like a hot bowl of grits
Hits on top of hits, who you think started this shit?

Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' with this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga

It's goin' down right now, California mackin' at its best
Somethin' for my niggas on the grind from the West
Cali is my home but its just like yours
Niggas love to get money while they fuck they whores
Hit all the parties, and do the same old shit
Bitches gettin' broke cause the game don't quit
I had a flashback, it was the Oakland Raiders at the 
Coliseum
We ain't nothin' but players - diamonds glistenin', hoes whistlin'
Bitches know my name cause it's a natural thang
I had to bend a corner, really didn't wanna - punk you's a goner
Heard you was on a - stick up mission, triple-beam in the kitchen
Never shot nobody but I'm damn sure itchin' to blast you
Cause in your dream you shot me
Then you woke up and found out you can't stop me

You see you never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

If buckin' a motherfucker on the mic be a crime
Best believe the police got a APB out on mine
Because I gots more disguises than that fool Inspector Gadget
I'm not a witch, but crystal ball let me have it, ahh
I seen playa hatin' way back from the gate
Now everybody wanna be a P-L-A-Y-A
Why lie to yourself and play the role as a 
simp
?
Knowin' damn well your bitch bought 
""Shorty the Pimp""
Because they smile in your face
And all the while them motherfuckers wanna take your place

That's right 4', we from the old school
Been doin' shows, been comin' tight in studios
Songs on the radio, interviews, and laughs
Up at the mall signin' autographs
And ain't nothin' gon' change in '96
Cause this pimp gotta mack all the finest bitches
And get paid from the game
So they never talk down on a playa's name

You never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

4-Tay, Short Dog, and Breed like this, check me out now
Never that, run it back, sayin' Breed is hatin' you
Takin' you to another level nigga makin' you
And got plenty hoes in the back screamin' ""okay!""
Breed fuckin' 'round with 4-Tay
Ice like T out to get payed
$hort Dog bringin' hoes to the pimpery
I - be faded off this Tanqueray daily
Niggas wanna play me but plenty of bitches pay me
Over all I balls more and none test
I keep a gun and I put two off in a niggas chest
And see coincide within the same heartbeat
That's right, now give a motherfucker five feet
Further imformation, I get into meditation
I oughta have yo' ass shakin', I conclude my calculation is -

Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut

Cos on this date we just fuckin till it's late
I ain't Romeo, Prince Charming or a knight in shining armour
I'm only out to fuck a bitch, fuck tryin to charm her
I treat a fine ass bitch like dirt
No money in her purse, a fuck is all it's worth
Lookin hella good in the club like a ho
Bitch, you need to go find a nigga to buy some mo' drinks
At the bar, fill you up with Long Islands
While I be all in your face tryin to fuck smilin
Cos Short Dawg'll never cater to you hoes
And if you ain't fuckin I say ""Later"" to you hoes
So if you bitches gotta plot
You better get gonna get shot fuckin with Short Dawg
Bitches keep comin up $hort
Fuckin with Too $hort, Too $hort
(Bitch!)
REPEAT
Bitches be like rabbits wantin' diamonds and carats
See my car, see my house, and they think I'ma share it
I ain't never been a mark bitch, you too bossy
Wanna drive my car closed-up, that's when you lost me
I tell a bitch real quick, I ain't no Tootsie Roll
All you good fo' is some head and some pussy, ho!
And if the pussy and the head tight, we fuckin' twice
Cos Short Dawg ain't nuttin nice
Bitch jumped in the car, asks me where we goin?
I'm Shorty the Pimp bitch, you goin hoin'
Fucked in the car with my pants and my jacket on
Raised up out the pussy, now I'm in the traffic
Now pussy still wet, got my dick in her hand
Lickin all around it, rollin through the flat lands
Stickin' to my script, never pussy-whipped
Seein' niggas with them bitches I done tossed and pimped
I use to break hoes for Scrilla when I was down now
I'm makin bank rolls for real-a and rockin town bitches
Livin large for a night, turn back into pumpkins
When I'm through fuckin', bitches leavin' with nothin'
Bitches keep comin up $hort
Fuckin with Too $hort, Too $hort
(Bitch!)
Too-Too $hort, Too $hort(Hoes can't fuck with me)
(Bitch!)Too $hort
Now break it down to the beat one time!
Ol' School. Tell ya lil' somethin about Shorty
I'm the East Oakland player, lovers are mooshy
I fuck a different ho a day and leave rubbers in pussy
Bitches keep lookin for some Too $hort nut
Squeezin on a rubber tryin ta pull it off and make it bust
Bitch might lose her mind if I raw-dick her
Get pregnant, move her in and make Ma and Pa richer
No more player, no Shorty the Pimp
I get paid, give her the check and get forty percent
All the homies talkin bad, head down, walkin sad
Got the broad livin with me, baby sayin ""Dad!""
Sex played out and ol'Shorty's bored, getting fat!
Then my bitch turn into a rat
I could try to mack again but the bitches won't want me
'Cause I'm all washed up, broke, fat and funky
Short Dawg is through, people call me Todd Shaw
All the rappers who was fake on the mic, got raw
Ugly hoes playin hard-to-get, sold all my cars
Now I ride the bus and shit
I had a '94 Lexus, Rolexes
I sold it all, now I can't afford breakfast
I lost everything I worked to be
Never thought I'd be a trick, payin hoes to serve me
Shit! Snap back came out of my dream
Shit can really happen if you know what I mean?
But fuck a wife biatch, stay away
Don't wanna own a pussy, keep the babies on lay-away
Bitch thought I raw dicked, said it was mine
She didn't know I fucked her with a dildo the whole time
Star-struck bitch seein dollar signs, she think the wad is fine
Playin games so I taught her mine
Tryin to play a player, got caught in a trap
Learnt a lesson from the game that I taught in my rap
Bitches keep comin up $hort
Fuckin with Too $hort, Too $hort

It must be a challenge
Tryna keep your balance
With an ass like that
Yeah it's fat, okay
Okay it's a challenge
Tryna keep my balance
I be walking with them racks
Yeah them stacks",https://genius.com/Too-short-balance-lyrics
Don’t Shoot,The Pimp Tape,2018.0,"The world don't love us and the hood be hating
Destroy the minds of the kids we raising
Babies having and killing babies
The cops patrol daily when they made me
This lil nigga drive Mercedes, huh
They wanna take my fingerprint even though my license be straight
They think it's fake, my name regis-straight
They want me riled up and catch a case
Said I resisted to a heavyweight
And said I attacked 'em when I get shattered face
Bruh I'm just tryna feed my daughter eggs
Working late at 12 hour rate
Nigga gotta escape
I'm shakin' this place, no matter how many damn L's I take
Or F's I get, we strive for excellence
The cops supposed to protect the streets, but who protecting us from them?
My pen got me above the rim
Black creative mind jumping out the gym
Life flashed cause your Dayton don't spin
Hands up, 'fore they take one out again

Hey now, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot
Too drunk, don't shoot
Headshot, don't shoot

You don't really know about the people
You don't even know what make the pain go away
No, you don't really understand the peaceful
You can't even figure how to see folk
Can you even feel what we say?

You motherfuckers want some
Everywhere I go they banging
Where you from? What you claimin'?
Bitch ass nigga, you wish you could
Throw your set up in the air and bang your hood
You from the ghetto, they don't know you on my turf
Bang right now, get your bitch ass murked
In the club turning up, better not throw it up
Gang politics bout to get you fucked up
Always twistin' up your fingers
Lil homie right behind you, he a real gang banger
No tattoo tears but he a hitter
You just a tough motherfucker on Twitter
Don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga
You throwin' signs up, he got his hand on the trigger
You on your phone 'bout to lose your life to a shooter
Get killed for some shit that you typed on a computer, bitch!

Just me and my sister, no one sitting next to us (Next)
I was dropping music but I couldn't catch a buzz
Used to do it cause I need it now I do it just because
This is my director's cut, Tarantino (Woah)
I need you to point me to the plug, Al Pacino (Hey)
I don't trust you suckers with your hobbies, that ain't me, though (That ain't me, though)
Bunch of undercovers, y'all some Bobby Valentino
This that East Coast, this that heat though, this that kilo
This that Migos, Bad and Boujee shit, that freak show
This that peep hole, I see through y'all, this that repo
Take your bitch and play some Keno
I'm a hero, Captain Save-A-Hoe in Speedos
I speed through y'all, this that speed boat, I found Nemo
Hope if they shoot me they ready to kill
They doing life and they ready to squeal

Little Girls,Born to Mack,1987.0,"Little girls of the world, you're all so sprung
15, 16 and all so young
I thought about you just last night
Grabbed my pen then I started to write
A rap that'll cap like a true blue rap
Not a washed-up almost MC sap
Little girls so fresh and I know you are
Wanna take a little ride in my new car
I see you more than baby, it's more like hell
You screw a little girl and end up in jail
Even though she seems she's 19
You're looking at her body an it's breaking your jeans
Well you know she's not, so don't play dumb
Little girls walking 'round trying to give me some
But I tell them like this, I'm the player $hort
Playing freaks like you is just a sport
Coming way too real and I can never be funny
Niggas like me just want your money
Give it up, 'cause I'm no lost cause
Little girl recognize Too $hort's the boss
When they turn 16, we all find out
What little girls like that are all about
So you girls out there that fit my rhyme
You'd better think twice before you jump on mine
Little girl's so thick, you might think she's grown
But if you knew when she was born, you might leave her alone
She's trouble homeboy, with a big fat ""T""
Little girls like that make old men peek
Then a brother like me might break my neck
Looking back saying ""Ooooh!"" 'bout to get in a wreck
'Cause she's always flirting, might give me a look
Like I put her in the oven and she started to cook
But when I put her on the spot, she could not hang
With my so rough, so tough Playboy game
I only said two words, something like ""Get busy""
Her head started hurting and she got real dizzy
Growing up too fast, all you little girls
Letting brothers like me cold crush your world
Should've listen to your momma when she told you so
But you went and got G'd now you want some more
They ain't paying me money, talking 'bout love
And the other girl's who I'm thinking of
Can you understand, I'm just a man
I want to come in this world and cold take command
So just step on back, while I walk on by
I might look you down, and I might say ""Hi""
And if you come up choosing, I just might laugh
Say ""Little girl check me out in about two and a half... years""

I took a little girl to a drive-in show
Jumped in the back and heard ""No, no, no""
She was only 16 but the girl was ripe
36-24 and a 35
I was wasting time spitting lines
Thinking 'bout going home cold getting mine
Baby said, ""Stop it."" I said, ""Drop it.""
I tried everything but I could not cop it
I was going to the store about a month ago
Met another girl, just loved my show
We talked for a while and it was all about
Having big fun later on in her house
She said her pops was gone but her mother was there
And everything was cool 'cause she don't care
So I gave her a ride, kissed her goodbye
I said I'd be back and we all know why
Went to find my thrill up on that hill
I was coming right back with the power drill
I had fun for a while but it wasn't enough
When it all got good, her pops showed up
He must have walked in the room and said ""Young punk""
'Cause when he walked in the room, he smelled the funk
Then he tried to mash, but I don't play
'Cause I was out of that window and on my way
Little girl

Every night you call and say ""Come by""
You tell me things changed and I know you lie
I came by last week, you said drive on up
And your pops came out talking all that stuff
Next night we made a date for 9 o'clock
And I always wondered why you walked the block
I saw you waiting on the corner when I made the turn
I didn't really think about it 'cause I wasn't concerned
I said, ""You look so good, but you always do""
I was rushing to the house for the old one-twos
But the ones ain't cool, and the twos don't work
Every time I tried, you kept saying it hurts
And then it all came out under all your tears
Seems you only been alive for 15 years
You could've fooled me baby with your lying scheme
Said you worked in the mall and just turned 18
When it came down to it, I couldn't go through it
It's all so sad 'cause you wanted to do it
Little girl, you want to have some fun
You'd better wait a few years 'cause you're much too young
Stop playing games, you might find a guy
Who will like you for yourself, not for all your lies
So I put it like this, and I don't play
If I see your young ass, I'm not going your way

You don't wanna leave cause you love the hoes
Somethin' ain't right, you doin' bad tonight
You'll be all alone if you don't have a wife
Cause these ladies ain't feelin' you
They don't wanna know what you can really do
They just wanna make you disappear
Get the fuck up out a bitches ear
Take that shit back over there
Go away, she don't wanna know you player
What you gotta say, just like this
Loud as you can, say ""Fuck that bitch""
Five minutes ago, you was thinkin' would she
Roll out with you, and give you some pussy
I don't think that's goin' down
But you don't wanna go home now

Get up out my face
You better get up out my face
Get up out my face
You need to get up out my face

You came to my house with a maxi pad
Bitch you goin' home in a taxi cab
No more limos, run the meter
We might need stitches, this one's a bleeder
Grab yo' shit girl, it's time to go
You look good, but you ain't my kind of ho
Another time on another day
We could hook up, make love and play
It really can't happen no other way
Girl do you hear what a brotha say?
Don't leave anything in my room
I got another freak, she'll be here soon
She might not be, as wild you
It's 4 AM and right now she'll do
She's not a super freak, and she's not a ho

We did what we did so let's do what we do
We had fun, but now I'm through with you
I gotta run, I'll call you in a few days
I'll be back, to get some more cooch-ay
Cause you do it, better than most
At this rate, we'll probably never be close
But that's okay, cause that's not the mission
You could cheat on your man if you got permission
I'll give it to ya, I'll beat it so well
When we finished, we gotta leave the hotel
That's all... I'm the #1 Player
You can call, or I'll see you somewhere
As long as we make this happen again
Yo' fine ass sittin' back in the Benz
Cause yours is the best, I must confess
But right now, it's time to get dressed

I couldn't trust you as far as you can sit and piss
Look bitch, I know you got bank
You're actin rude, and your attitude is stank bitch
But that shit won't work with me

When this dumb pretty bitch turned my radio off
Had a nigga, so pissed off
So I laid right back and let her eat my dick off
Yeah bitch, I'm talkin to you
Stop actin high sadity bitch, chill be cool


You got money in your purse girl
Shake that ass, make it work girl
Tryin to shake it 'til it hurt girl

When they walk past me, I do 'em like this
Grab that ass, let her feel on my dick

You ain't never too cute to get slapped
Shit gon' change when you get with a mack
You can't hold back when you fuck with me
Don't let me find out that you're just a tease
Don't let me find out you won't suck my balls

Every big film needs a supporting cast
She knows she ain't the one but she supportin' that
Room service, bottles, I'mma order that
She got a bomb ass pearl, but it's more than that
She knows what it is and she plays a role
Every girl's not built for it, it takes a toll
She hops on top and she take control
This between us, she won't tell a soul
Our secret, how we keep it
Not everybody business, who I sleep with
Poppin' Dom P, I ain't drinking cheap shit
Me and Too $hort, every bar, gotta bleep it
Album 25 is the pimp tape
That's the OG, how long did this take?
He said ""It's an Oakland thang""
Then he sparked another one,  ""smoke it mane""

It's an Oakland thang
All the side bitches
Let me see you, put them hands up
And all the main bitches
If you know you a main bitch, where you at?
All the main bitches, make some noise
Ayy yo G, why she think I'm too nice?
When every other day I meet a new wife
I ain't got no main, they all side pieces
You can bring all the sand you want to my beaches
It's all god, this a party over here
She suck my dick and I let it in her hair
Cuz I really want to fuck, with her friend over there
Put my dick away and holla like player
I never have on bitch I need two, I don't cum quick
When I bust, I still might not stop
I don't take pills, I just fuck a lot
I'm in her head tryna fuck it up
Bitch gimme all your money then suck it up
And don't worry bout her, she'll turn next
Everything we do is rated XXX

Well I found out her favorite drug is cocaine
And I get it by the q, have the whole thing
She want to bump, I get it up, get it up
Little bit of coke turn this bitch into a slut
And that's my bitch- I mean side bitch
And I can't fuck her raw because I might slip
It's a trick how she keep it going
And her man don't know that I left the spot
Seem like everybody fucking on the same bitch
But my hoe knows her role, and she knows that I'm famous
No, she don't say shit
And every time we go out I have her pay for it
If she spend time she better spend some money
I just give white snow to a 
And her boyfriend a dummy, got him mad as hell
Cuz I got his bitch leaving another voicemail

Oakland, California, West Coast life
You either play the game or you smoke the pipe
I became a rapper at the age 14
No gold ropes, no diamond rings
But look at me now, 10 years later
Ask any MC if I rap greater
See I'm known in Fresno, even the big O
From San Diego to Sacramento
They'll tell you yes, wherever you go
And I bet my life won't one say no
Ain't nothing like a Too $hort fan
I ain't tripping, you can play it again
Don't fight the feeling, life is me
I rock shows in Nashville, Tennessee
It wasn't ""Hee Haw,"" so don't laugh
At the good ol' boys getting autographs
In Cinncinatti, I know you heard
I got fined for the ""Cusswords""
It's true, baby, so so unique
Might slap your man, or just thump your freak
I come to your town, I'm not under
I want your name and your telephone number
You think I'm faking, but I'll call
We only got one night to do it all
I know baby it's such a pity
Tomorrow night, we hit another city
Cold macking in the game is all we do
Me and the boys called ""The Dangerous Crew""
I used to be local til I signed with Jive
Too $hort then went nationwide
I went to Georgia with the Too $hort sound
I went down like Bobby Brown
I said a rap and they took me to jail
Pulled out my bank, and made bail
This is my story, it could not wait
It all started out in the Golden State
California, where I was born and raised
I used to play the drum in my younger days
I just hit that beat any way I can
Smooth high-stepping in the marching band
I turned in my drum and I started to rap
Now beats I make, make my bank so fat
It's Too $hort, on the mic tonight
Pennsylvania, can you see the light?
From Chicago, to Indiana
From Mississippi, to Alabama
Louisiana, even Texas
Females, call me sexist
But don't they love it, you know me
Freak nasty in a room trying to blow me
Like engine, engine, number nine
Homies run a train, standing in line
If that train jumps off the track
Then my brother you will catch the clap
From Colorado, to Arizona
All the way back home to California
In Chattanooga, they know the tip
Short Dog in the house, I'm that flip
Getting clip, or playing pool
I can't help it I'm so damn cool
Call me ""Dog"" or leave me alone
I'm riding in a Cadillac Fleetwood Chrome
With Too Clean, behind the wheel
I'm riding shotgun, rapping for real
Total boss in the back, give me superside
They like to roll 'em fat cause you know we ride
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rapping
Now you know, nothing but the Dog in me
You make love to me and I still act stingy
Oh should I pay you? You must be tripping
I didn't buy you and I sure ain't renting
I said ""I love you"" cause you gave me head
I didn't love you when we got out the bed
If I could love you, you know I would
But what you giving, ain't all that good
A little southern hospitality
You'd better try to get away from me
I love money, and I just can't fake it
I go to Magic City and the girls dance naked
I'm somewhat of a hero by the way I rap
But I'm living like an Oaktown mack
I'm in the house y'all, I'm like ?peeser? y'all
Rat heads get nothing but cheese, y'all
Or get slapped, put up your dukes
I kick you in your ass with my Nike boots
Some rappers try to be just like Too $hort
Can hang with the Dog, you'd better stay on the porch
In Minnesota, Virginia Beach
Wisconsin, I got freaks
Atlanta, Little Rock
Louisville, it don't stop
Kansas City, Missouri
I rock the house in East St. Louis
Detroit, it's like Oakland
It's a black thing, and I'm a black man
To all my brothers in the U.S.A
Too $hort baby don't even play
Woofers in the trunk, blasting the beat
I cross the bridge and hit 3rd Street
Years ago, I rocked that joint
I say what's up to my homies from Hunter's Point
We go a long way back, it's always been like that
In the days that Short Dog was so young at the rap
I'm in the house!

Way Too Real,Get In Where You Fit In,1993,"Way too real, Short Dog is just way too real
It's the T Double, some call me $hort
I'm in the house once again from the East to the North
You know the west is the best coast
We got the best beats, we bump the best hoes
Living life way too fast
Start snitching and you might not last
It used to be about old pimps and macks
But now we got the young bucks trying to jack
It's a stick up, put your hands up before you get bucked
Got you for your watch, your link, and your green stuff
Everybody wants to be the man
And when you are, you go straight to the pen
Get rich quick schemes off dope fiends
I know you know what I mean
Making big money, living stoned to the bone
Oakland, California is where we roam
Hitting this corner, that corner, everywhere
Bumping fly young tenders with the real long hair
Sassy nasty, young-ass freaks
Wanna ride in my car and feel the beat
We hit the motel, the head was swell
Baby had back like a big ol' whale
She told all her friends I did her, too
She got dogged like Scooby Doo
Cause in the land of macks we don't play that
You wanna run your mouth, you get pimp-slapped
And you ask me just how I feel
Short Dog's living way too real
I'm living way too real, bitch
Short Dog in the house
Can't help but live real, you know what I mean?
Tell you some shit, though
Been in the game for about 10 years or more
Talking about shit you never did before
You know my macking is cracking, all of the time
24-7 spitting playboy rhymes
I got a serious grind and it sure ain't fake
You slang D, well I'm a slang a gang of tapes
Something funky fresh for you to ride to, fool
Bending corners in the old school
I seen my homie Father Dom and he said ""What's up?""
Riding in a Supersport drunk as fuck
And when you see us, the clique is called ""The Dangerous Crew""
We wouldn't change it for you, cause the game is true
Some say that the Dog can't rap
But my bank account will prove that
I make G's, so you can see these nuts, ho
Or get played like dominoes
I used to fuck a bitch from San Jose
Baby liked to freak all kind of ways
She said I was the best, couldn't settle for less
Had my name ""Short Dog"" tattooed on her chest
After three months I called it quits
She tried to pop that pregnant shit
But like a mack, I suprised her
Dropped her ass off at Kaiser
Never would I let her put a baby on me
I ain't the one, I'm Step Daddy
I had to let her know just how I feel
I'm living way too real
""Bitch!"" ""Don't ever fuck with Too $hort"" (scratched 4x)
]From city to city, valley to valley
Never seen another state on hit like Cali-
Forn-I-A, where the hustlers play
What you wouldn't expect happens everyday
It's the Wild Wild West I'm speaking about
Where Clint Eastwood would get socked in the mouth
Cause ain't nobody tripping on ranks or stripes
If you live the life, you gotta pay the price
So many youngsters die over punk shit
Small talk, a lotta dumb shit
And only God knows when you punch the clock
Thought he was bulletproof and got shot
It's either heaven or hell, him or me
Locked in a cell or out on the street
Every day on the ave another brother is killed
For living way too real

Well I'm chilling and I'm willing like a villian I be killing
Coke is it but tonight I got the feeling
Cause it's about time for a real mack to step up
Pimping ain't a thing so I swing on these heifers
Never ever feeling no remorse, of couse
If you try to play me out, I'm a punch you in your mouth
And Rin Tin then I'll watch his chin just splatter
Caught him with an uppercut, there goes his bladder
My rhymes are fatter cause I said so
I'm gonna recollect a neck, mic wreck check a ho
I'm making more dough than the average Joe Schmoe
If she's fronting on the pussy then the ho got to go
Out the back door, don't want to see you no more
You ain't Deep Throat, so what you come here for?
Cause in the nine-tre ain't no lagging or dragging
Bring your ass over, get prepared for the stabbing
Ain't no doubt that's how I feel

When I was 16 used to fuck hoodrats, it's not a big thing
A few years later did some major upgrading
See a top-notch, I say ""Hey, what's up baby""
(16 Hoes) Can't find your lost whore?
She's probably with $hort, playin' at the golf course
Another ego, a hole-in-one
The game ain't boring, my hoes are fun
I got (16 Hoes) all nicknamed Bitch
Make Daddy happy, y'all get that dick
Since they're everywhere, you figure I'll stop
Couldn't be a better player than me

She was a betty I done knew back in the day
Little scary lil' bitch from around the way
Plus she sucked and fucked all day
With a little bit of Alize (Alize..Alize..)

I put it down for these young hoes
Get the pussy like I'm married
And send her home with the cock swoll, did her pops know?
Little girl that he tryna protect was in the crib doin porno

Fo' sho' baby, I know these hoes
Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself ""Would she?""
I get deep in her mind and her pussy

Who dat? She was the world's greatest, dick sucker
Play the note with the tongue while, finger fuck her
I hit it in the back of the donk, in the back of the Benz
Got my dick in her ass, front of one of her friends

Face down, ass up -- bitch be still whikle I bust this nut
I rock hard while I'm in these guts
Wipe my dick and then that's enough

She wanna kiss me after she done lick me
Slap the drunk, you know the ho got Tinesi

Daz, this punk bitch wanna get with me
Cuz the ho lookin for a P-I-M-P

You know the ho don't know no better
I would rough ride ya ass, but the magnum's better
I know a lot of niggas done paid ya bitch
Remember one thing, I got a major bitch

Pull up on the stroll, in the fo' door Caddy
Slapped the bitch, she hollered ""No, no daddy!""
I got the cash, if she don't that's her ass
So quick, so fast

I love gettin my head blown
I love gettin my nuts rubbed
I love gettin my dick licked
I love gettin my nuts sucked
I love gettin my pussy ate
I love when niggas see me masterbate
I love it when you nut all in my face
I love it baby, but I can't stand the taste

I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin all my life, big player for real

I said ""Come on girl, you know how it's 'sposed to be""
It's makin me nut, but feel our fantasy
Come on come on baby, won't you get the best of me
I SMELL PUSSY!!

Get T double D on the double stack
And one dose of the dick, she be doublin back
See me, I've been known to shit on hoes
Cuff her cold, straight spit on hoes

I been known to step on a bitch
Put a thumb in your ass, while I slap your clit
But ain't no way that I'mma lick yo' shit
Tell 'em what she is Short Dog (Be-itch!)


I love, gettin my thug on
On dirty joints, in the school zone
Everything I cop, I put dubs on

That's the trademark
Short Dog in the house
And it don't stop to the beat baby
Verse 1:
Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
Cause I taught her well, she got game for a trick
It ain't hard to tell she belongs to me
I pimped her 15 years in this industry
Now her pussy so big I don't want no mo'
But she still down wit me cuz I raised that ho
Found a bitch in East Oakland broke silly and young
Don't let her fool ya playa, she ain't really dumb
Don't be a sucka and give an old ho new life
She got so much game ya wanna make her your wife
]From California all the way to Miami
I pimped that bitch and now the hoes can't stand me
Cuz when I put my bitch on the streets
Niggas rush to the store cuz they love the beats
We gettin' all the money, we cashin' all the checks
I ain't no fake pimp nigga you can take my bitch
*DJ scratching ""Now take my bitch"" *
Verse 2:
Now do ya think I get mad when you sport my bitch around town
Never that, cause my bitch is so down
I could send her to Hawaii or out to Nevada
It really don't matta, my pockets get fatta
Used to go to Las Vegas in the early-eighties snortin' Coke
Tryin to turn the ladies on to $hort
It was my destiny to pimp these hoes
(Beyotch) Whole crowd screamin loud at my shows
I've been to every last city with the Dangerous Crew
And everywhere I went the bitch came through
Makin' money like a real good whore
Tell 'em whos your pimp bitch, ""Too $hort""
On a ten week run back in eighty-nine
I flipped a brand new Benz, the bitch was so fine
If you want that ho, you can have that bitch
She won't complain about shit

Verse 3:
Now take my bitch, the kind of bitch all pimps want
But if you slip and ya pockets get small ya get done
You got to stay up, fuck tryin to come up
Get your mind off the pussy, always tryin to run up
Cause these bitches like mine, love to work
Get down in the dirt, get money on the turf
Slang that ass for daddy bitch
It's time to get the old caddy whip
One more time, new paint and interior
New rims, new top and a new be-yotch
Thats how you say it right
But $hort Dog say ""Beyotch!!"" you better make me rich
And thats how it goes, gotta cover every angle
So if ya takin my bitch ain't no need to tangle

So I already know what the hoe gon' say
I need to lock her down, and wife her up
But I don't wanna marry her, I just like to fuck
When your mother was a young thang, I knew her
Even back then, I ain't wanna do her
And now, I don't fuck cougars

Hard on the Boulevard,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Sunshine, convertable tops
You call 'em rags, we call 'em drops
You ride black walls, we ride Vogues
You got a girlfriend, we pimp hoes
You say I'm fake, I say you're smoking
I'm just a mack named $hort from Oakland
Just like a tag team wrestling tip
With a nasty bitch, then the homie switch
Bitch, ain't getting nothing but a lesson taught
If your pimping ain't strong, it's not my fault
Hoes start choosing, wouldn't give 'em a break
I pull out my old white Too $hort tape
I'm playing ""Dope Fiend Beat"" and the shit still hits
Trying to stick my dick all in them lips
She said ""No, I never did it before""
Well you ain't the bitch I'm looking for
Cause she's rich and thick and chocolate
Wouldn't hesitate to lick my dick
All my parters say ""$hort what's up?""
See me with a bitch with a big-ass butt
I don't answer, I start laughing
Nothing going on but the Oaktown macking
Laying it right, all damn night
Hoes getting sprung like they smoking the pipe
El Dorado, Mazeratti
Nothing but freaks with fine bodies
I love to roll my Mercedes Benz
I'm nothing but a player like all my friends
So when you call me fake, be for real
The call me Short Dog cause I'm hard as hell
Hope your girlfriend's name ain't Linelle
I screwed her last night in a cheap motel
Like I told my crew, when the toss up's chill
Humping like a Chevy rolling down Foothill
Get off the pipe fool, stop cracking
Be like Short Dog and start macking
T double O S-H-O-R-T
I go solo, can't nobody fuck with me
I'll just kick back counting my bank
No cokes smoking, just potent dank
Funky fresh on the microphone
When you spin that wax, it's not the same ol' song
Round and round it goes, where it stops no one knows
You see me at the clubs catching all the hoes
I don't drink vodka, I do drink gin
I like to get a blowjob from your girlfriend
Cause I'm macking, baby, you know that's right
I'm from the Oaktown, straight Eastside
I got all my game from East Oakland streets
Now motherfuck you damn shit-haired freaks
I go on and on as I sing my song
If you're tender and young, I fuck you all night long
I'm not a no-good punk, I didn't make you flunk
I didn't tell the whole world your pussy stunk
I cut you slack in my rap, I could've macked your mother
But Life is Too $hort so I kept it undercover
I'm so damn hard, on the boulevard
Hoes ain't tripping on me, they wanna fuck my car
Freak nasty don't trip, to me it ain't shit
You can suck my dick with some fat ho lips
Riding in a Caddy with the top let down
California sunshine, cruising the town
On the boulevard, maybe drop my top
If you're feeling hot, don't even stop
Cause it feels so good, I'm oh so sprung
They way you work that tongue, it just makes me cum
I told all my homies, all about
The way I bust big nuts, in your mouth
On the boulevard, we're riding oh so real
Not Skyline, I'm talking about Foothill
And when it ended, you know what happened
I'm so hard I just can't stop macking
I know I gotta stop sooner, but I'll stop later
They call me Short Dog, I'm nothing but a player
I know what she's thinking, ""I'm falling in love""
But there's another freak I'm thinking of
She's got long long hair, she's not like you though
She'll do whatever I say, she'll even be my ho
Cause I don't wanna get married, I'd rather freak Mary
Make good love and I do mean very
Wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) Tight-ass jeans to pose in
I used to ride the strip trying to catch the hoes
They wasn't choosing, nope not these hoes
They wanted big time Vettes, riding brand new Vouges
So like I said before, I ain't tripping
Told myself it's time to stop bullshitting
Did the gangster walk, did it like this
Walked up to a girl and I called her a bitch
I said ""My name is $hort, I don't play games
I only play young bitches, now what's your name?""
She said ""I wouldn't tell you in all my life
You're just a little thug, you're not my type""
I said ""I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk""
East Oaktown is where I'm from
You see wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) Mad cause I told the truth
I'm calling you one and you can call me, too
Call me Too $hort, call me ""Too Cent""
But you wouldn't get a dime out of this pimp
So just give it up baby and I'll run right through ya
Maybe just maybe I'll come back to ya
Like Too Clean, I'm riding Cadillac
I hit the strip, turn around, and come right back
See I'm a big mack, and every bitch in sight

It’s Your Life,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"It's your life, don't be stupid though...
(Your funk is the best. Take-take my body and give it the mind)

'Cause when you waste it..

Nowwwwwwwwwwww I come from, the Oakland town
Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down
Young brothers my age makin dollars so long
Drive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone
See his diamonds and gold, call him Big Bank Bob
Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job
This is not a song I made about crack
It's all about losin' what you can't get back
Cause the name of the game is to control yo' life
And all the things you do you must do them right
It's not my life, it's on you baby
What's really goin on is that cash money
How you make it, it doesn't matter to me
Work at McDonald's or just slang them ki's
Or you can be like me and go straight legit
Drive a brand new Benz and they can't say shit


Partners in your face, ain't even your friend
Probably have to blast him if you see him again
And if you don't blast him you'll get shot in the head
Seven days later you'll be buried and dead
I can't be like that, the only thing you fear
Homeboy you can't see it but you know it's there
It's called tomorrow, whatcha gonna do with that
Cut school, sell a few dopefiends crack?
It's not a one-way street, it's more like a dead-end
So if you take it, you better turn back my friend
I know a lot of young brothers don't think things through
They really don't know what they wanna do
When you lag, you lose, you start payin your dues
You can't kick back and let your bankroll stack
You'll be stuck on stupid, for smokin a friend
Ten years from now you'll still be in the pen


I got my eighteens pumpin, ridin the five
People lookin at me like I stole the ride
Am I a gangster, player, makin them G's
Cocaine dealer with the Z's and V's
Can't tell em nothin, so I say, ""Whassup?""
They get mad, I don't give a fuck
I keep ridin, sidin, whippin and dippin
Look at all my homeboys trippin
They'll knock you out, one punch like the champ
Goin to jail is like summer camp
We shake hands one day, kill each other the next
And if you don't like it it's just like that
Cause I come from, the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
But since I have the chance, I'll say in the rhyme:
We have to stop the killin sometime (soon)",https://genius.com/Too-short-its-your-life-lyrics

In my face trying to rap like me

It’s Alright,Dangerous Ground (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),UnKnown,"Too Short:
I love things about you (it's alright) you got it going on
I'm not in love and this is not a love song, but you've been down for so long
You should never be wrong, I know it's all my fault
My mind been gone, I'm always on the chase
Lipstick on my face, when I get home
You gotta get on my case, cause I've been fuckin' up
Coming home smelling like her, I can't fuck it up
Call your mama tell her how it hurts, tell her
I'm a dog, but don't say that's all
I came in first place at the players ball, and now I got my skrill on
My new grill on, put you through some shit girl
But I know you're real strong, you say I never find a real one like you
But I never take the time to feel like you, I put the game down
The way it's suppose to be, don't be a punk ass bitch, just get open with me
Too Short talking:
Cause I'm a real player. A-yo Pimp C I don't think they feel us
Pimp C:
It's a very thin line between love and hate
And it's a very thin line between a fuck and a date
Girl you know when I was hollering at you
I want to hit, I ain't got time to get caught with one girl and lose my grip
I'm screaming ""Steady pimp"" you steady trying a change me
Running that game your mama taught you, bitch that shit don't faze me
Say bitch I'm Pimp C, I shall be seen again
But all that shit your cousin told, bitch blowin' in the wind
Just cause I pimp my pen, you think you moving in
Like I'm a trick I'm a let you have half of everything I spend
You talking week rent, I'm trying to whip a Benz
Flipping the club with pimps like Too Short, freakin' new lady friends
Talking bout your sister saw me with a brand new bitch at the club
Coming at me with high school shit, bitch you must be in love
Space Age, new faze, I done payed the price
Ho you ain't bout to wreck my stable, she said I'm shift
But bitch that's alright
Pimp C talking:
You can keep your funky ass pussy, you know what I'm saying? Straight up
What's up Short?
Too Short:
Shit go back to pimpology man. These ho know it's alright though and if
They don't Bun will let them know
Bun B:
Baby you're hangin' on a rope, it's getting crucial like dope
I can't cope, I guess the situation has lost all hope
Cause you've obviously flipped your lid, but what's done is did
I'm putting youup for sale for the highest bid
Or an ass from kid shit, you got me twist-ed
Little Bun won't be another statist-ic, this love affair went ballist-ic
Puttin' them messy ass hoes up in my mix like Bisquick
And thinkin' you gonna leave Big Bun juiced like mystic
Nigga believe me shit's thick, loves lost
Nothing's gained but confusion about the pain
You losing about the same, you can't tame, a wild animal
Feeding lettece to a cannibal, make a grown man wear goranibals
And I can't handle, bullshit that's unnessessary
You can't handle being with a G, I guess it's scary
It's the very thing that put us together seperated us
Player hated us, and things will never be the way it was
I hate to say it cause, but find another shoulder to cry on
Stop gettin' your lie on, baby it's alright
Too Short talking:
I wanna dedicate this song to my bitch, quit tripping and bring your ass
Home, baby I love you, al long as you got my money
Pimp C talking:
You know what I'm saying? It's 199 rich, know what I'm sayin', Strictly pimpin', you know what I'm talking about, I'm trying to see some papers
Some dead ones
Bun B talking:
Some real shit going on, you know what I'm saying? This is Big Bun and I'm
Out with my nigga Short and my nigga Pimp C. You know how players is with
Bitches on your dick

Lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
Lick it right there, suck it real good)

I know you like it when I cum in your mouth
You like it in the car, you like it on the couch
You like to lay me on my back, and spit on my nuts
Suck it up like a slut, and then you wanna fuck
You make me feel like I'll never know a better friend
I hope you never stop, I hope it never ends
I must be tastin', somethin' like your favorite flavor
Can you do it again? You said maybe later
Baby wait a little while, you said your jaws was hurtin'
So I turned out the lights and closed all the curtains
But when you closed your eyes I put my balls on your cheek
Cause I'm wide awake and can't fall asleep
Now lick it

Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're suckin' my dick
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
Lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
Lick it right there, suck it real good)

Yeah I'm one of those rappers, I reap the benefits
I'll fuck a Too $hort fan, a cute freaky lil' bitch
I used to go to L.A. and get sucked by Super Head
When you was just a kid gettin' sent straight to bed
You used to get ya ass whooped when ya listened to $hort
But now she's all grown up with my dick in her throat
The way you take it out, then you stick in your mouth
I bet you won a gold medal at the Dick Olympics now
I just spit the pimpin', I like the thick women
I like the slim goodies and the real big women
But I just love the way you lickin', it's original
I feel like a pimp-player-mack-daddy-gigolo
Damn

Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're suckin' my dick
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
Lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls

Remember Tina? Tina, the sperm cleaner?
I had a good time last time I seen her
Blowjob Betty, Deepthroat Dana
You're always so ready, I'm cummin' on your cranium
Right now, this is just wonderful
I can't tell, it's like you havin' more fun than $hort
It's better than - two bitches at the same time
Or even ten dime-pieces, standin' in line
Takin' turns, while they suck on each others clits
Want a nigga with some game to nut on her upper lip
Massagin' her tongue, while I tickle her tonsils
It's no doubt though, I get big in your mouth ho

Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better

Short But Funky,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Life is too short but now it's kind of funky
I make the beats for me and my homies
Newspaper reporters and others always ask me
Why I'm X-rated and I rap so nasty
When I was a teen I did nothin' else
But pick up a pen and express myself
The things I wrote were obsene and kind of dirty
But mama always said the truth couldn't hurt me
She also said that it would set me free
I guess she was R-I-G-H-T on the nail
'Cause now I'm out making my mail
It all started out from a freaky tale
If that's what sells then I'm a stick with it
Short Dog ain't changing, so forget it
You can sell out if you want to, homie
But I'ma stay short but funky

Funky, funky
Funky
Funky, funky
Funky

Don't stop, just call it verse two
It's Short Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew
Not your average everyday fake rap on the micro'
I might say something that your mother don't like so
Don't play it loud if she's around to see
But you can play this 'cause it's rated PG
When I'm rated X I'm just having my fun
I bring a smile to each and every one
But there's a serious side in everything I say
Life is too short for you to wait 'til the next day
Just straighten up your life and you can start right here
Drop the cocaine and the bottles of beer
People always say it ain't right to preach
But take my advice, get wise and reach for the sky
So you can live like a king, homie
And I'ma stay short but funky

Funky, funky

You never catch me on the mic rappin' a dance tune
I like it kind of mellow with the sound of the bass boom
The style is mine, I've been doing it for ten
You might say it's simple, but I'm making my ends
See I don't trip on a punk 'cause I jack him
Too $hort plus the 
cuss words
 equals platinum
What would I look like dancing on a stage?
I wave my hand and do it like the old days
But some dumb fool want to take it out of hand
With 50 million dancers and a big old band
That ain't me, I'm from the old school
Play the instrumental, get the mic and I'm cool
'Cause I'm an Oaktown mack and it's like that, so
It all comes out in my records and my stage show
In my category I'm the one and only
And I'ma stay short but funky (

Pimp the Ho,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"Pimp the ho
Pimp that ho

It's like a Too $hort raps been around a while
I rocked to the beat and got my own style
I'm from the O city, and I said it before
I was born to mack,
 call me Playboy $hort
You wanna get freaky? Look at the time
We could do the nasty, but it's almost nine
My show starts at ten, I gots to go
Like the mack said, homie, pimp the ho
Check it out everybody, if you got two ears
Turn your radio up, Short Dog is here
If the bass ain't kickin', pick up the phone
Dial 911, tell 'em, ""Turn it on""
Bumped a cute young tender in a tight red dress
She had a soft booty, and a real big chest
She said, ""I love you"", said it again
At the motel freaked her and her friends
Like a Too $hort rap, and everybody knows
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp the hoes
Ain't no need in playin' games, none at all
Fakin' like a giant when you're just too small
No need to rush, take your time
To adjust to the changes in my rhyme
To you rappers - tonight's your night
You all jump straight up on your mic
Screamin' ""I'm the best"", but let me see
I make a lotta money, could that be me?
He said, ""Hell no, I'm the king of the rap""
Looked me in my eye and said, ""Deal with that""
I said, ""Hold on, buddy, don't talk that junk
You drank two 40s, now you must be drunk""
He said, ""Let's battle"", I said ""Go""
Like the Mack said, homie, I pimped the ho
All hail the king, go straight to hell
If your girlfriend's freakin' on a freaky tale
Better play your rap and take mine off
Before the bitch gets wet and you're still soft
No need to rush, take your time
To adjust to the changes in my rhyme
I was on the turf, cold chillin' out
When a sucker MC got hit in the mouth
Tryin' to find out if he can hang with me
The boy got hooked on the Dope Fiend Beat
I said, ""Bitch, what are you smokin'?""
It ain't funny, cool, I ain't jokin'
You never should've said I was fakin' the place
You wouldn't've got socked straight in your face
I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Now the sucker MCs just leave me alone
They might suck on yours, but they can't get mine
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp all the time
I'm not talkin' 'bout hookers in mini-skirts
When you pimp like me, put your mind to work
It's like 24 hoes, better known as tracks
When I grab that mic I spit these raps
I start workin' the hoes, and it just don't stop
It's goin' on till the panties drop
I'm Sir Too $hort, like I said
Bitch can't leave, don't give me head
Had a fresh young tender, won't say her name
It's the same old story, ran the same old game
She could blow more head than a whale blows water
The girl won't stop once she gets started
Like the freak you married, I had to get with her
Ain't no doubt, Short Dog would get her
I'm a cold player, I can't lie
They call me Playboy $hort, and I told you why
I'm a mack, so get back
I put my tape in the deck in my Cadillac
And as my rhyme goes on definitely
I speak each word loud as can be
I'm the ""T"" double ""O"", and like I said
If your girlfriend's freakin', I accept all head
Scream out the combination, and I open the lock
Plug in the mic jack, and then rock that cock
Back to back like the Oakland Raiders
In and out like your crossfaders
Makin' people dance all over the floor
Lovin' that rapper named Sir Too $hort
You got my bank, little girl, no time to act silly
I'm dynamite, baby, and my name ain't Willy
Cold as hell, hard to stop
I spit these raps and rock your block
Hit the city talkin' 'bout, it's goin' on
And the next thing you know, the whole nation's gone
It's Too $hort on the mic
And I'm spittin' mo' raps than any rapper you like
So all you suckers  rappers, you hate my beat
All I gotta say is don't fuck with me
My game is tight, my bank is made
You can hate big $hort, but I still get paid
Say, ""I can't"", I say, ""You can""
Show respect, little boy, when you deal with a man
I saw you laughin' when you came in the place
Punk, I start laughin' when I spit in your face
See I know how you feel, I should be shot at dawn
But I'm a true MC, I keep rockin' on
I won't say I'm best, won't declare I'm bad
I'm just a rappin' muthafucka with a hard-ass rap
Too $hort cold comin' up
Say a rap, homeboy, get the mic out your butt
Be a man if you can, 'cause it might get worse
You'll be walking 'round town with a wig and a purse
No tellin' what's next, I don't know
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp the ho

I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
Anything you want
Or anything you need
I got my eye on you
And I'm into you
I'll give you all my dough
You just pimp that ho

I'm never draggin' when I'm rhymin', 'cause I make a lotta money
I jump into my car, drop it if it's sunny
Doggin' the freaks, and all that shit
Long haired hoes with real big tits
I'm a eastside player oh yes, I am
Grab the microphone and start makin' grands
I take a freak to her room, not a hotel trick
I cold chill out at the Motel Six
I'll ride  and I can't be found
I'm the hardest muthafucka rappin' from this town
My name is Sir Too $hort, and if you say, ""So what?""
I look you in your eye, and wouldn't give a fuck
I live a California lifestyle, ain't no trip
8 years on the mic, and ain't faked it yet
So when you see me on stage, I won't blow you a kiss
I put my finger in the air and tell you just like this
Say bitch

Top Down,Cocktails,1995.0,"How freaky can you get to a long fat dick?
Hella freaky like I said to a song that hit
I'm the dirty rapper Too Short, the triple X
Run up in the pussy, rub the nipple next
Bitch, which is worse, my bark or my bite?
You heard about me and now I'm fucking you from dark to the light
You must of thought I got nicer, talking about Heiser
I'm an old dogg and old dogg's get wiser
Caught up in the game, got ya thinking while your doing this
You never did this, sucking on a big dick
What bitch? You better check the size, and recognize
When I'm between your thighs
Shit, I get hard from the sound of a kick drum
Riding down the strip with your diamonds and ??
Shiny bald head catching sun rays
Smashing down the strip going backwards down runways
Four eighteens with the zues and the Zapco
Sounding like I'm riding out a concert at a rap show
Hit a back street and put the top up
Stopped at the light see some hoes watch 'em jock us
I'm so roll with my electric top
Hit a button, ain't gotta get out, fuck with nuthin
Let the top just fold up and lay down
Slamming hard passing by the schools and the playgrounds
Everybody knows when Short's in town
Cause I keep the beats thumping hella hard with my top down
Drop the top
Just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
Nine albums out, ain't changed my talk
A thousands hoes walked on I'm still a dogg
Ain't changed nuthing but the ho that I'm fucking
Still riding through the hood all the homies say ""What's up?""
Give me my props cause I always rock
And I still gets cock when the fine hoes jock
Still smoking Indo getting burned out
Still got the orange juice bottle full of gin 'bout to turn out
A show, a ho smashed back to the O
Put them bitches on my beeper then pull some mo'
Cause I bump more hoes than acne
I guess you bitch can't learn that you just can't mack me
I'm off of Gin and Juice, don't even introduce
If you ain't fucking back up cause I'm finna choose
I want some pussy that could make me write a Freaky Tale
Drawls back, bootie cracks, bitch in a hotel
Just to say you got some Too Short dick
You wanna show some evidence, don't swallow don't spit
Cause I bust more nuts than a squirrel
And my dick been in pussies all around the world
If you had a picture of it and you asked the bitch
""What's this?"" I bet you say, ""Too Short dick""
I still taunt the fine hoes and get shot down
I say ""bitch,"" slam the beat, smash off with my top down
Just riding with my top down
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We rode the AC transit bus
Selling joints for a dollar, smoking angel dust
On the way to a house party, a maybe delux
Slanging Too Short tapes, making some bucks
Looking out the window at the Mustang and Falcon crew
Asking myself ""How can you?""
Roll like the Giants down the foothill strip
With beats thumping top down bumping a bitch
Shit I had to have drop, didn't care if I had a Volkswagon
Pick up the beat, had a hoes flaging
Siding with the top down, lit like a lamp
Blowing out the amp, trying to bump a tramp
Most niggers couldn't afford to have a drop top
So they got they shit cut at the chop shop
Couldn't tell niggers nuthin way back then
A lot of niggers died or they went to the pen
Couldn't even see the homie Short Bubble
Bank get fat and my whole account double
When I walk in a club bitches say ""Ooh God
Is that you Todd?""
Me and my homies just hoo-ride
And take advantage of a life we never had
Fuck eating cheese sandwiches, broke, living bad
I'ma do it for my homies that's there in lock down
Ride with my beats slamming top down
Drop the top
Just drop the top
I got my top down
Drop the top
Just drop the top
I'm just rolling with my top down
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top

Pull Them Panties Down,Get Off the Stage,2007,"Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down

You made a lot of money since you hit the stage
Swingin' on the pole so many different ways
Got hit with a butt cheek and smacked ya back
You're a dancer but you shoulda been a acrobat
I don't even know if it's bald or bushy
I see them titties out girl but I ain't saw no pussy
What we gotta do to see you get butt naked
And shake it, how much you tryin' to make bitch?
You could do it easily, is this how you gon' do me?
You're teasin' me, pulled 'em halfway down your booty
You need to let them panties meet them ankles
Show 'em you a bad bitch, fuck these stank hoes
You know I go hard all night
I'm famous, I've been a star all my life
You need to take them draws off
Do it girl, take it all off

Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down

Take that g-string off, take everything off
Why you still wearin' clothes, girl you must be lost
Let that monkey out, go 'head do your thang
Take them panties off, and let that pussy hang
If we was at my house, I don't play that
I'd get you undressed, I'd make you stay wet
I'd burn a lot of rubber, all in your walls
When you fuck with me bitch you gotta drop yo' draws

Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down

Broke nigga what you doin' here?
You ain't even bought nothin' new this year
It's some people in here that don't like you
They lookin' at you mean, right now they wanna fight you
You know you can't win, hangin' with your scary ass friends
Flossin' at the club but you never had a Benz
Now these bitches wanna hurt you
They say you act gay, you probably wear skirts too
That's what they say, they callin' you a faggot
It might be a problem, you better call some back-up
Fuck a credit card, can't go to Western Union
Use the ATM, or just keep it movin'
Ain't nobody chasin' you, not if you ain't runnin'
But if you in this club man you gotta spend some money
He don't wanna buy a dance but he can't stop lookin'
Nigga ducked and he ran out the club and he shook him, beotch!

Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down",https://genius.com/Too-short-pull-them-panties-down-lyrics

See I hit the studio ten years ago

I'm on my tenth album bitch and I still ain't died
Wouldn't change for nuthin, gettin paid to kick it
You could rap your whole life and wouldn't make a mealticket
Nigga don't stop rappin let the hoes keep hoin'
As long as I'm alive I'mma keep on rollin
Can't do nuthin for a bitch while she bleed
You can put that on a fat bag of weed
And get high, nigga fuck these hoes
I'll be singin nasty rhymes even when I'm old
Cause I don't stop rappin, bank keep stackin
Wherever theres hoes best believe I'm mackin
All you emcees tryin to take my place
Yellin ""Beyotch!!"" just to hear the people say
Hook
Verse 2:
I talk bad about a bitch, it ain't that hard
Never got the big head still the same old Todd

My crew is thick, and we dangerous

*Female speaking indeterminately*
Don't get me wrong bitch
Verse 3:
See I got a gang of homies that I put on deck

So bitch don't ask me how
Too $hort fucked it up came back again ho
Smokin them big fat sacks of indo
I make a new album every year
My speakers so loud I can barely hear
I got a bad bitch, with some big ol' breasts
I like to play with them titties, lay my dick on her chest
And start strokin, thats how it should be
I'm bustin' nuts everywhere but in her pussy
And if sometimes things don't go my way

Call Me Daddy,You Nasty,2000,"Yeah baby you know whassup
Tryin to get this money girl
I'ma take you out to Las Vegas, put you to work
Show you how to get this real money, youknowhatI'msayin?
Chorus: {singers} repeat 2X
I can't wait til next Friday (next Friday)
That's when a brother gets paid (gets paid)
I've got plenty to drink, plenty to smoke
That's what I'm out here hustlin fo'

We all need to be strong, for the ones we love
Cain't hesitate to help the next man up
Pass the game like it's a hot potato
Gotta do it now and not later
You wanna say somethin, preach it
If you know somethin, teach it
Cause it makes no sense to keep it to yourself
That's how you felt
Well you might feel better if you spread yo' wealth
Let it trickle down.. cause yo' crumbs
Might be just enough for me to get some
I'm tryin to come up, you know I'm comin
But it's hard for a black man without a good woman
If you find one it might be your last chance
You ain't never gon' hold down a black man
You need to choose me, get this money you can have me
Ride in my Caddy, and call me daddy
Chorus

You've got yo' momma, you know how that is
A good mother's gon' do anything for her kids
But you never kenw your father, he never bothered
Your last boyfriend used to grab you by the collar
For nothin, wasn't even tryin to get money
Fine woman like you, I don't find the shit funny
You need management, not an amateur pimp
Who don't know what to do, when the money ain't cool
I'm a hustler, I always eat good
Fat house in the hood, new shoe on my foot
Things ain't been the same since he put you out
Somethin you ain't never felt good about
Let's get this money, that's what I want you for
Don't make me wait too long, cause life is too short
She said gladly, and then she had me
Jumped in my Caddy, and called me daddy
Chorus

You tryin to convince yo'self it's the right thing
Once upon a time you had nice dreams
Now you don't sleep good, whatchu thinkin of?
Nobody cain't tell you how to get that love
It's right here, I know you understand me
I'll be your daddy, I'll be your whole family
No stress, never have to worry bout a thing
The best resteraunts, furs and diamond rings
All paid for by the suckers and lames
All you need is me in this motherfuckin game
To the top, that's where we goin
Where the good green don't stop growin
Don't ever turn on me
Give me everything you earn for me
Be together forever, never lonely
Smoke my last weed, a big fattie
Ride in my Caddy, and call me daddy

Let's keep it funky and live, just like the bassline
My girl will lick your clit, the bitch is on this shit
Close your eyes you'll swear you're fuckin' in a porno flick
The way you want my dick, you got my thing hard

And I heard all about you, little nymfo
Pussy like Niagara Falls, they say you love it all
So when I nut, suck my dick, bitch, and rub my balls
Cause I'm nasty too you'd better ask it's true
It's a one time shot, I'm just passin' through
Don't be shy, don't be stingy, don't be holdin' back
And don't get hooked on the dick, like you're smokin' crack
Just keep doin' what you doin', don't change a thing

You know I want some of that pussy girl, why you frontin'?
You can rub on my nuts, while your friends ain't watchin'

I'm the vagina finder, the cunt collecting king
I'm 'bout to get a platinum penis ring
Your second guess is bitches, and yes or no
You're down with shit, just move around let's go
Damn..you still here, ain't nobody lookin' for ya?
Do you have a home or an appartment or ya
Trying to stay here with the crew

Where ya girlfriends? Where ya car at? What's the damn deal?
Girl you got to leave here for real
I hope you wasn't plannin' to get your stack on
Get up bitch put your panties back on

Got me horny, I wanna have sex wit'chu
And do all them things, we never ever get to do
We already talked about it, you said you wit it

Wanna hit it from the back, let them big titties sag
Bitch hella thick, lotta junk in her trunk
When you start don't stop cause I just wanna cum
And then fuck you again, bust a nut on your chin
Get my dick back hard and run up in your friend
We can all get together on the late night
A whole lotta fuckin and suckin, 'til it's daylight
I'm $hort Dawg, you better hand me that cat
You so sexy when you up there dancin like that


Did you think I wouldn't be in here spankin that cat
Tryin to put her motherfuckin ankles on her neck
I made her lick it, suck it, swallow it, she asked me
How it get so damn hard again, I'm nasty
But I'm not a freak
I just say a lot of rhymes to a lot of beats
It comes easily, I'm a pimp in these streets
I'ma keep makin money in this industry
So when she bends her knees, I'll be standin up
Gettin head for 30 minutes, bitch can I fuck?
I know I came in your mouth I can't trust you slut
That's why I'm 'bout to raise up, when I bust a nut
Wipe your face with a napkin from KFC
I give a fuck what happened, bitch c'est la vie

You should be happy, I left some DNA in your mouth
 You wanna do what muh'fucker, you wanna fuck?
I wanna do it

 If you got that money you can get in this real quick

 But I don't fuck with broke-ass niggas
So what'chu wanna do?

 Motherfucker you cain't get in this shit!
That ain't fly... I wanna do it
 Nigga you better have yo' cash first, ass last

Hell nah bitch you can't get over on me

You runnin game on me, I gotta go
Bitch slick talkers might talk you out of your shit
But not mine, I keep ridin clean
I don't need you BITCH you need a lot of things
All I need is mo' money, and some choosin hoes
What I look like buyin bitches new shoes and clothes
Everythang on a bitch that's how it used to go
Back when them old school niggas rode trues and vogues
I'll be talkin this pimp shit daily
Bitch you can't play me, what'chu do for me lately?
I know what it is, don't wanna hear about sex
It's two different things with a player and a trick
She can hold out her hand... and I won't pay her shit
I just say bee-itch!

I come through like the first of the month
Ain't nothing but a holiday
When I fuck my way
I'm her worst nightmare, her wettest dream
We always do that freaky thing
And when I'm coming to her house
I know just what she's all about
Don't waste no time, get in it
Keep on humping til my head starts spinning
Whoop that ass like a world champ
Break the chairs and knock down the lamp
In my birthday suit, dripping wet
No I ain't tripping how freaky it get
Feeling that sweat on my eyebrow
Nothing can't stop me but nature now
Fucking your bitch like them pros do
Something you can't get close to
Born to Mack in my drop-top Caddy
Just call me ""Step Daddy"" (Repeat 3x)
How many mothers in the house tonight, ladies?
How many daddies take care of them babies?
They got to learn to take care of their own
Getting girls pregnant and leaving 'em alone
Fine little bitches, way too young
Met Short Dog and then gave him some
So why you keep talking about the PG&E?
When all she ever wanted was a man like me
To come through, and do that thang
Step Daddy in the house, and I got game
So lock your back doors, check your hoes
Suck on the pussy and lick them toes
Step Daddy coming through like a porno flick
Freak the bitch, now she loves my dick
She let me bust big nuts all in her mouth
And S.D. turned the bitch out
Just call me ""Step Daddy"" (Repeat 4x)
Gold-digging bitches in the City of Dope
Got it going on like a daytime soap
She's so freaky, she'll make you shout
One on the way and got two at the house
Three different daddies, and all is well
As long as them brothers keep making mail
And it's cool, when I come through
Play step daddy for a minute or two
And then fuck her, that's how it's done
It's not my daughter and it's not my son
So what if your kids start tearing shit up
I really don't give a fuck
I never get mad about the shit they break
When I'm around, we eat steak
I let the motherfuckers act bad
Buy 'em toys when they're crying and sad
Could you be 'em? Your baby's momma
Turns me on in her freaky pajamas
I come through and make the whole house happy
Just call me ""Step Daddy"" (Repeat 3x)
Get freaky, and do it wild
On the floor, doggy style
I get rugburns, on my knees
While your bitch be crying ""Please
Don't stop"" So I don't
I fuck her like I know you won't
Pull out my dick and make her lose hope
Stick it back in and make her take some notes
If that's your bitch, homeboy you'd better keep her
Cause she won't stay off my beeper
You can't fuck her and I appreciate it
Even though I know you hate it
I keep getting that good shit
S.D. wanna fuck your bitch
Come through and make the ho so happy
Just call me ""Step Daddy"" (Repeat 2x)",https://genius.com/Too-short-step-daddy-lyrics

I used to get straight A's, read my books in Catholic school
Now I find myself in the men's bathroom
With a top-notch, goin wild in the stall
She ain't even trippin cuz shes havin a ball
I used to play with my toys in the back yard
But now I just walk around and act hard
Alot of women like to be called a bitch
I'll break it down so you understand all of it
I always thought I was an educator
I might not love her, but I never hate her
Shes the kind of girl to make your toes pop
Keep ya wide open, never need nose drops
Now yall wanna get mad at me
For talkin about another young, nasty freak
Its life, its not a major catastrophe
You ain't a ho cuz you givin up the ass for free, you nasty
I know why yall mad at me, I ain't break your heart girl (you nasty)
Man, these bitches trippin (you nasty)
Verse 2:
Too many tight lil dresses with no panties on
Too many females tryin to take a man home
Where your mommy and your daddy at?
Just because a player got a cadillac
You wanna lay in the back, with your face in his lap
All you gotta do is taste that
You get to ride, get used all the time

Adapt to my surroundings, look around

More Freaky Tales,Can’t Stay Away,1999,"BEYOTCH!
Short Dog's in the house, once again with this pimp shit

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah

I met this girl in Atlanta
She let a nigga fuck but I still can't stand her
The pussy wasn't good I said ""What's up bitch?
I'm tired of fuckin' can you suck dick?""
She said ""No"", but she had another friend
So I switched like a real pimp
Laying on my back with my dick in her mouth
I said ""Beyotch!  What you talkin' 'bout?""
She mumbled something, I don't know what she said
Smoking on a joint gettin' some bomb-ass head
Bitch said her name was Theresa
All on my dick like cheese on pizza
In the A-T-L where the grass is greener
I fucked Nina, Melina, Sabrina and Tina
When I first moved out there, I met Holly
Five-foot one with a bad ass body
Freaky little bitch she was a Gemini
She used to stand up and say ""Shoot it in my eye!""
I met another girl went to Spellman College
Every day after school I acquired the knowledge
I took her to my house so I could get some
I fucked her real good and made the bitch cum
She was hella limber, said her name was Amber
She wouldn't stop screaming, that's all I remember
I had another freak, her name was Wendy
When I first met the bitch she said ""Please don't pimp me!""
I did it anyway
I'm coming straight from Oakland, C-A
Ain't no other way, like my girl Shante
She lives in Atlanta, but she comes from the Bay
Let me hit that hometown pussy on the strimp
Look out for a nigga, treat me like a pimp
You know I can't forget about the strippers
Cinderella with the glass slipper
Top down in the Benz ain't spendin' no ends
Fat bag of Indo, bring all your friends
It's like Lotto, you get a quick pick
Bitches said they heard I had a big dick
So I showed it to 'em, only took one second
Dick rock hard, bitches gettin' nekked

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah

I know another bitch, her name is Terri
I lied to the bitch ""It's about time I get married""
I couldn't see me pimpin' her
So I fucked her next door neighbor, Jennifer
She had two roommates, Cindy and Amy
Terri caught me creepin' and said ""Nigga don't play me!""
But them hoes liked to freak
I used to send 'em new niggas every other week
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!
I spent the night with Monique in between the sheets
It was her, her girlfriend April and me
I do it on the regular, two at a time
Call it what you want I be a fool wit' mine
Like them Texas niggas, I never would change
Like my niggas up in Cleveland spit the good game
These hoes recognize when I come in the door
I ain't trickin' bitch, so what you want me for?
Like Natalie, swearin' up and down I had to be the one
Bitch lets have some fun
I fucked her, you thought I didn't
Short Dog's in the house and I keep on pimpin'
So then I fucked the twins, Sharon and Karen
Went straight for the panties, but they wasn't wearin' 'em
Don't ask me who I fucked first, it ain't my fault
In the end, I still got the same results

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah

Hell yeah, I never would forget Charlene
We was layin real close like two sardines
Talkin', laughin', kissin' and shit
Next thing I know she started kissin' my dick
You know the rest, before she left I paged Mia
I told her ""I got a new freak over here""
She rushed over, I left and when I came back
Them hoes was lickin' cats
They call me ""Short"" when I'm pimpin', ""Dog"" when I'm mackin'
Gotta get the money, that's all that's happenin'
She wants to be my love slave, I need some bug spray
To keep these hoes away
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna get fucked say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Beyotch!
And it don't stop
Old school Short Dog
Still spittin' it
Still gettin' it
Gettin' that money

I Know You Love Her,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo
Was on your mind?
Can't stop thinkin about that tramp
All day, dreamin about havin sex with da bieatchhhhh
Quit cho girlfriend for a slut
I know you love dat tramp
Verse 1: Too $hort
You know it shows
Da way you love her
Da way you touch her
You wanna fuck her all da time
Was on your mind
Can't shake da thought
You feel like she's your soulmate
Can't wait to walk down da aisle wit da tramp
It's true love cause she's da only one your thinkin of
You don't care about da dick she suck
You gonna miss her
Ask no questions
Just turn kiss her
She's everything you looking for, in a woman
Wake up early in da mornin
And give you sumpthin
That's more pleasure than material wealth
You can't feel that good all by yourself
Let alone the last bitch you had was kinda frigid
Couldn't get on top and she didn't lick dick
Well now you got a bitch that's like to lick your ass
Take you out to dinner and she give you some cash
There's only one flaw
You know she ain't faithful
You still tryin to stick to the tramp like a staple
I ain't mad at you
I fucked befo'
You done slipped up and got you a real good ho
I know god damn well, it's you life
Why you tryin to turn a ho into a house wife
She's just a cum freak (oooooooooooooooo)
Let you shoot it on her face (oooooooooooooooooo)
Do it on da first day (oooooooooooooooooooo)
She's gotta have dat taste
I know you love her
Chorus
I know you love her ( I know you love her)
But she's a tramp bitch ( She's a tramp bieatch)
I know you love her ( I know you love her)
But she's a tramp bitch (Tramp bitch, tramp bitch)
Verse 2: Slink Capone
Well she can suck my dick
And it break jaw
Had em ho's
Love it when I nut in there face
Cause they say it taste like ?????
Take off da draws
Let da homies hit
Ain't no future in ya front
Cause youze a freak and you won't admit it
Sittin in da passanger seat
Lookin pretty
Your attuitude is shitty
But all I wanna do is kill a kitty
Oh, you wanna free ride?
Bitch get your ass out
You can keep on walkin til you get to hot and pass out
When we was at you mama's house your hand was on my leg
Makin my dick rise up
Now I'm ready to fuck
But you insist on makin a nigga wish for it
Takin shit for it
But girl I ain't goin to spend a brick for it
One thing you gotta doooooo
To be a G like meeeee
Be down to make them bitches catch that RTD
Bitches be fakin
Suckin dick or videotapin
When they hear about the money you makin they yellin way
But you can fuck, fight and hitchhike
I know you love her (I know you love her)
Too Short
That's right
Ain't givin no bitches no kind of slack
(Because she's a tramp bieatchh)
Verse 3: Too Short
You know it ain't nothin wrong
Whats goin on
As long as you ain't mad when she don't come home
Cause baby ain't frontin
And that's how it is
You gotta get use to sharin your bitch
If you had another girl, you knew she wouldn't care
But ain't tryin to be no ice cold playa
Sayin stupid shit, like take me car
She hit the next nigga house and go make him hard
Fuck him real good cause she's gotta have it
Men can't resist her cause shes a bad bitch
Fell in love wit her, your not da first
Face in her thighs
Can't stop the thirst
She could be worse
Get back wit your first
Her pussy's so dead you could ride it in a hearse
Only missionary style
You can't get wild
She's the kind of woman that could have your child
But there ain't no turnin around
Your posted like a lamp
Nigga fucked around and fell in love wit a tramp
Face lit like a bug, everytime you see her
She takin off her clothes and you can't wait to eat her
So good, you wanna stay wit da freak
If you could you would fuck her every day of da week
I know you love her (ooooooooooooooooo)
But you can't stay naked (oooooooooooooo)
Gotta keep this kinda shit in the right perspective
Chorus
Verse 4: Slink Capone
Uh, don't act like you don't want to lick me
Pretendin youze da bomb
Me and da homies had you gone off a 40 ounce of mickeys and a bag of
Dirtweed
That's all I got
To make da situation hot
It got graphic in traffic
Had to back on up
I had to pull up to your bumber
And gun the, nut on your back and your neck
And now you got a hairy bone and a link
Compilament of ?????? Slink
Don't trip, next time you wanna see safe sex
I had da shit taped up on the VHS
I taped all da hoes, all my bitches
And then watch em later on da 52 inches
Baller style cause we livin in da killa Cali kingdom
Big heat, big dick and big nuts is all I bringin
Next time I want to see you I'll pop another 23
I'll be watchin you but you can't see me
Bitch
I know you love her

Mack Attack,Born to Mack,1988.0,"It's a mack attack, coming from way back
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about Playboy Too
I'm $hort Dog, ain't nothing nice
I drink g-juice and wouldn't cut it with ice
From the Eastside baby, Oakland town
Can't understand why I'm so down?
I'm not a whitewall, I'm a Vogue
Like a Zenith wire wheel I roll
Got a fresh new beat, made you get freaky
It was everything you wanted cause I can't be weak
Yeah baby that's it, do the split
Freak nasty all on my tip
I took it to my DJ fresh on wax
Put it on the turntable, I got taps
It started burning up, wires smoking
Had to be the sound coming straight from Oakland
$hort Dog, it's a mack attack
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
One young tender lost all hope
Slapped her in the face with my donkey rope
Another young sucker tried to front my staff
Saw it on his face when they broke him in half
It was the Dangerous Crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about Playboy Too
When I say my rhymes, I'm never fake
When you start my beat, that's when I break
On you, and it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
Cause I'm Too $hort baby on the microphone and I'm macking
Hit it
I'm not a wannabe pimp, I never simp
Since I started walking I had this limp
It was a cool type walk, just like me
The Too S-H-O-R-T
I might be young, but I spit this game
I start it with P, and it ends the same
If your brain is lame, remember the name
When it's Too $hort baby, ain't nothing plain
Dangerous Music on the microphone
Makes you wanna break your hip bone
Might break your leg, or maybe your back
Grooving to hard to my mack attack
It's really not easy, you know it's hard
Sort of just like my gangster car
You know what I mean, Vern? It's like funny
I mack legit and make all the money
See my capital T on my diamond ring
We hook up the beat and love to swing
So while you're out there grooving back and forth
I want you to scream out ""Sir Too $hort"" (Sir Too $hort!)
Don't stop that rap (Don't stop that rap!)
And it's just like that
Get busy girls, while I rap
I make big money, that ain't no crap
When I grab that mic, and spit my rhyme
I gotta have an 8 or 909 (BEAT)
So I can rock you all night long, (SHE'S)
On my tip, she love my song, (HE)
Tried to do it but did it wrong, (FREAKS)
Want to get my all alone
But I'm macking
Hit it
I finally got a chance to grab my pen
And make another rhyme so I can make more ends
It's a rush production, not the beat
I rushed it out the studio and hit the streets
Now I'm rocking one more time
Young girls love my Too $hort rhyme
But that big fat girl better let that go
Before I point right at her say, (""Ho!"")
I'm riding drop-top Caddy, I don't dip fake
I step on the gas then I hit the brake
Do it again as I catch the beat
You're feeling that bass all down the street
Jumped out the car on 9-0
I was wearing all white Capezio
Had my 501's, five donkey ropes
Couldn't be saved by John the Pope
The M-A-C and K, from Oakland, Californ-I-A
I'm Too $hort baby, no I don't play
I'm macking
Freak nasty, I like your dance
You know it looks good in those pants
So damn good, I had to glance
Now I'm macking
See this gold? I bought it all
Now every night you young freaks call
You see my car? It's my best friend
So if you touch, you'll meet your end
Time will tell, just keep it cool
Don't play that game, don't be no fool
I'll burn rubber all down your block
You know what I want so keep the door unlocked
I'm coming in baby, don't waste no time
It's a mack attack, and now you're mine
Dangerous Music is what it seems
The reason this floor just met those jeans
I was running the game all in your ear
You're talking bout love to a stone cold player
Girl look good, wanna have that sex
Took another look and wanted to break that neck
It's a mack attack, coming from way back
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, and I know it's true
The only thing you'll say about Playboy Too
Is I'm macking",https://genius.com/Too-short-mack-attack-lyrics
Sample The Funk,Cocktails,1995.0,"Sup?
Short Dogg back in the house beeyatch!
And it don't stop to the beat
Ain't no thang but a chicken wing
We gonna do it like this one mo' time

Straight from Oakland, California I'm back again
Short Dogg's on the mic 'bout to mack and pimp
We got flavor at the Dangerous Crew camp
Save ya money, can't use dem food stamps
Other crews like to sample and mix
But our crew, we just play that shit
Live, drums, bass, keys
Niggas don't like it, you can get these
Stuck in the back of your throat
Fuckin with a pimp named Sir Too $hort
We coulda sampled the Luke but we didn't
I'd rather treat ya like a ho and start pimpin
When will you other brothers realise?
Can't fuck with my crew better feel your eyes
Cos you must be blind if you can't see
And I'mma say this shit quite frankly
I give a fuck when freestylers step up
I don't do it, tell you 'bout it on the next cut
Cos right now we gotta feel the flow
And make sure we keep it real slow
Just like the motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
We gettin funky like it's 1972
Still puffin on them zags, dressed like pimps
And ask The Ohio Players once again
Can we sample the funk?
Y'know we don't wanna wear it out
We just wanna lil' piece, y'knowhati'msayin?
We ain't goin loopy, we're goin freaky
We gonna funk it track for track
Dangerous Crew style
Ant Banks let me flip this one more time
Ya ready?

All you brand new rappers got a new flow
You ain't samplin James Brown no mo'
Probably try to sample Cameo
Parliament-Funkadelic, you scandalous ho
You stole it, Ossie Brothers, Bark Kays
Barry White, Isaac Hayes
Have you heard the term 'Sample Clearance'?
Start the nigga who wrote it, would never hear it
Now we're suin' your ass for sure
Got'cha spendin' all ya money cos you need a lawyer
You got problems and ya need ta solve em
Ya shouldn't of sampled wouldn't of had dem problems
If you'd have played your own shit
You wouldn't be broke, you woulda made ya long grip, bitch
But that's irrelevant now, my friend
Cos they done wiped you clean like Ant Banks' Benz
Sittin on some three-piece AMG's
Better find you a sample, you ain't playin these
Kinda beats, so funky make your fingers pop
If you can't find a sample you ain't got
Not one damn thing for a nigga to ride to
But I been gettin funky since I was in high school
Growin up in that Bootsy's rubber band
In '76, seen a mothership land
Nothin but funk all in your face
I like to slow it way down in ass and bass
Cos that's how we be layin tracks
Just flip the funky rhyme and start sayin raps
Get funky with Ant Banks, PeeWee, Shorty B
Father D, Dope D, Tony T
The motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
And that's the drop from the dime, we'll change the groove
Just to sample the funk
Beeyatch!
That's right, PeeWee friggin the keyboards
Tony T on the drums, Shorty B on the bass
Ant Banks on the mixing boards, Short Dogg on the vocals

Right now you know the story of Too $hort baby
First started rappin' in 1980
I got more game than Monopoly
Now I'm makin' money there ain't nobody stoppin' me
Used to be local 'till I signed with Jive, man
Used to like to sample now I'm rollin' with live band
Now that I finally did this shit
I'm makin' one more album and then I quit
And only one thing could make me say I'm not
And that's one million dollars on the spot
Upfront cash, money, no compromise
No schemes, no scandals, don't front and lie
Just pay the man in full
Thirty years old, torch the bull
Ain't givin' shit up but the funk
Let these record companies know what the fuck I want
Cos they been fuckin' black folks right from the start
When you sign that line tear your ass apart
For every one you get they gettin' five
Niggas gettin' paid but it don't seem right
I know where I came from and know where I'm at
And my last two albums don't sound real bad
I'm Too $hort baby, I ain't no punk
I'm just askin' 'Can I sample the funk?'
So can we sample the funk?
Bitch!
Outro:
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm talkin' to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins
My nigga Suga Foot and Diamond from the Ohio Players
I'm talkin' to James Brown
We know where the funk came from
Johnny 'Guitar' Watson
To all y'all niggas, y'all can sample all you want
Here we go loopty-loo
Cos the Dangerous Crew goin' to get funky like this
Flip it!",https://genius.com/Too-short-sample-the-funk-lyrics
Talkin’ Shit,Chase the Cat,2001.0,"That's all I do is talk shit, no doubt
Yeah I got my nigga B-Legit in the house
Bad Ass Anthony Banks, doin ""Big Thangs""
$hort Dog, always representin, always talkin shit, big shit
(That's what we do)

It's been about 15 long years, macking, profiling
Working up in the booth off some top shelf Long Islands
The big Bad Ass in this motherfucker, see y'all niggas know the half
Still representing the O, homey the East side, nigga 100th Ave
Unfuckwittable, see all we bust is rhymes and nuts
Oh yeah you'd probably be fucking with them
But nigga you'd never be fucking with us
Me, $hort Dog and B-Legit; see first of all homey we the shit
And all that other nonsense you other niggas pop is irrelevant

I rock the shit that's hot but got the ice to cool it down
In the town when I screw around nonbelievers laying down
Still activated but low, I'm seldom seen
With light green and other things that glow, man whattup dog?
(?), take no marine time peace
Then I mack a straight dime piece
Have her name on everything that a nigga lease, a savage
I keeps the deeds pink slips and cabbage, silly rabbit

Bitch what you thought?
Dis a once a month funky cock-bleeding bitch, you gets NOTHING, yeah!

You know I kept talking shit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch!
Fuck you, you stupid ho

So mother fuck you bitch God damn asshole

I talk big shit, big spit
I do it on the microphone and get rich
Bitch I'm so God damn mother fucking cool
See me and you drool like you're nothing but a fool
Riding down the strip with B-Legit and Big Ant
Drinking big gin, smoking big plants
My nigga big Bad Ass and B-Lah do it big
Drink the whole bottle bitch and give you a swig
But don't take it personal, that's just how we kick it
Pull out a big dick quick and make you lick it
And after you finish, make sure you do my nigga
Swallow all the cum bitch, and then you get a swigga
Something that'll quench your mother fucking thirst, head first
Talk about your ass in a verse
What's worse, if I put your name in a rap
Or get all in your face while I snap, bitch?
Oh you hoes better watch what you doing
Cause niggas around here, we talk bad about bitches, for real

You know I kept talking shit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch!
So much game, when a homie's tough
I make a bitch blow who never sucked
You know I kept talking shit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch!
So check it out, freak nasty
You think you're fine but you look like Lassie beitch!

I bust a bad bitch daily afternoons
Stop by hair saloons, and make the sad bitch pay me
180, in the middle lane, I pop bottles
Expensive models, do their damn thang
Claim they got a little game, it ain't strange
To live tucked away, with no sidewalks, so bitch stay the fuck away
And you can go play, with your momma or something
Far as drama or something you punk nutting

We got top notches, so holler when you see 'em
We keep our hoes on display at the pimp museum
We sport fly-ass suits, ain't gotta rent no tux
We mack bitches everyday, they yelling Pimps'R'Us
Now we frequently heard but seldom seen
Always making these hoes fulfill our dreams
We keep bitches on they toes, you know they need it
And niggas be still spit this old shit cause we O.G.'d it

Yeah man, big shit, that's what we talking
Putting hoes in headlocks nigga

You know I kept talking shit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch!

Get back bitch we'll never kiss
You know I kept talking shit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch!

My señorita, early in the mornin', that's when I need ya
Next to me, makin' love, it's too good, I can't say enough
About the way you wake me up, it's the first time every day we fuck
The best place on earth, anywhere I am when I'm next to her
So much fun the way you make me laugh
And you get on the dance floor and shake that ass


That's what I love, she got that Spanish blood
I know y'all feelin' me though, Mexican or Filipino
Puerto Rican salsa dancin', in Miami they all speak Spanish
I talk that body language, come here girl, tell me what you sayin'
I heard that, you got a lot curves in the back
And you know how to shake that crack
Make it rain and take that stack
'Cause I know it's you, trickin' that 1942
Don Julio, take a shot, bend over and make it hot


Baddest bitch in the club, we tryna get fucked up
If you see her, point at her, these other girls don't matter
She's badder, no complaints, think she hatin', no she ain't
There ain't no competition, her on top, that's my position
When I'm inside it, I'm excited
Put her on top and let her ride it

You ain't white bitch, must be them razor bumps
Stop shavin that cat girl
You might need to get it waxed girl
I saw enough of you the other day, you need to go the other way
Everything looks good on the ho but her face
Turn back around girl
Before you drop it to the ground girl
I wanna see you down on all 4's, what you got on drawers for
That's daytime shit, hit the club when the mall close
And drop them panties girl
Your pussy feelin better now ain't it girl
Hear the crash from the cymbal when your ass start to tremble
Wanna ride with a pimp, blowin hash out the window
Better make my night happy
Or it's gon' be some problems like Lil' Scrappy

Naw baby wasn't doin it right
C'mere lil' mama see what you look like

Can I see how you shake it girl?
You gotta turn a nigga on when you dancin to the song
I wanna get you all alone in the mansion in a thong
Lemme see that pussy ho

Ain't no way we goin to sleep, not befo' we see the sun

Let me see you bend over girl

Nobody Does It Better,Life Is... Too $hort,UnKnown,"Funky fresh on the microphone
Too $hort
Too $hort

See, I'm fresh like always, I'm comin' at you
And you know I won't stop till I'm through
So get on it, now is the time
Too $hort baby's gonna spit that rhyme at you
'Cause I'm jammin', so check me
I play the music, even made the beat
'Cause I'm the most rappin', most rhymin'
Rollin' in a drop-top straight high-sidin' on you, boy
I'm poppin' the most
I come from Oakland, don't play me close
'Cause I'm a player, love to play this game
I get funky out here, pumpin' the name
Too $hort, the one and only, I just rock it
Fat bankrolls in my pocket
Call me the dirty rapper, I'll say, ""Sure""
But I'm a young black entrepreneur
I'm an MC, right? I own a company too
Programmed the drums and made the groove
So when you look in my face you see a wealthy man
I hope it's not hard for you to understand
I'm the businessman, it's not the same
I'm treated like a dope dealer runnin' the game
And you wonder why I can't get no peace
I'm makin' more than the chief of police
I'm
Too $hort

Now that I've established one fact
I came here to rap
You got a choice to make about me
Can I get busy, are my raps too weak?
Boy, you're too grown, don't say I'm borin'
Just because you know I come from California
Where many rappers get no respect
I'm at home in a tape deck
I get played and played until it's all played out
Sucker MCs come to my house
They want a contract, get signed up
But like toys they need a good wind-up
Then the other suckers, sayin' no names
Rap on the mic and use New York slang
Even though we don't talk like that out here
The point I'm tryna make comes out so clear
You want paper or plastic, Visa or cash?
You wanna burn rubber, homie, step on the gas
Now nip, dip, roll the strip
Gonna take your mind on a serious trip
Like always I made the beat funky
I keep your head bouncin' like a dope fiend junkie
I got to say it before I break
I never rap fake
'Cause I'm
Too $hort

See, I'm fresh like always, no sweat
It's time to jump back in the mix and get on it
Now is the time
Too $hort baby's gonna spit that rhyme
I sell records every day
And still I gets no radio play
I got homies, they love my beat
So you hear me all over the streets
I take pride in the bass, I make it deep
The kinda tape you'll always keep
So if you lose it, you're not my mama's son
It ain't free, go and buy another one
Like a costume party on Halloween
MCs pop up on the scene
So you made a record, I saw your poster
I'm still harder than you, boy, look closer
Won't say who's best, I just tell you the truth
You're not makin' money, so it couldn't be you
So if that leaves me, Too $hort baby
I keep it in tune like do-re-mi
With a strict rap tempo, bassline simple
Take that, it's a Too $hort rap
It's on you, boy, I'm poppin' the most
I come from Oakland, don't play me close
'Cause I'm
Too $hort

I'll tell you nobody  does it better than Too $hort
I take a limousine to the airport
Fly first class, never ever last
'Cause a brother like me, I pay cash
Twinkle, twinkle, star in the night
Don't look now, but I'm shinin' bright
I know you wanna hear my triple x
Foul language, girls and sex
Well, I'm gonna tell you 'bout livin' the life
Stayin' in school and not smokin' the pipe
It's hard to be a rich man, don't you know?
When you drop out of school and start smokin' dope
It goes D-U-M-B
You're lookin' for some D?
Then start tweakin', it's goin' on
You don't like it? Well, play another song
I got rhymes, you wanna hear?
I sing 'em every day of the year
You try to get it, you think you got it?
I hope you like it, 'cause you sure can't stop it
This rap is so funky fresh

Let's bring that game back!
 Like game one thru five?
 Yeah nigga, just like we use to do it!
 Well check this out
Game! Is the shit
Like what? A rat-haired bitch
Verse 1: Old School Freddy B
I was sittin at my home, all alone
Thinkin 'bout bitches I use to bone
Tight young bitches, I can't deny
Rat-haired bitches, I can't lie
The bitch had body is all I know
Only 18 but looked twenty-fo'
Her name was Bitch, class of '92
Skyline High and the shit was cool
Took her to my house, Moms was gone
Turned off the light, unplugged the phone
The bitch said ""Fred, I hearda you
Anything you want, I will do""
I dropped my drawers, dick all swoll
She couldn't believe the position was pole
In and out, out and in
I used the bitch like a ATM
G'd the bitch like the one and only
Bust two nuts and called her phony
She couldn't believe what I said
The next thing you know she was on my head
Suckin the dick like it's suppose to be done
Rat-haired bitch make me cum
Freddy B that's the name
Rat-haired bitches, I got game
 Cos Game
 That's the shit
 Like what? (Like what?)
 A nasty bitch
Verse 2: Short Dawg
I like to fuck a nasty bitch
Witta big fat ass and shit
First lay, dick gettin sucked
Bitch don't give a fuck
Cos real players run that game
When I fuck that bitch she won't be the same
Cos when Short Dawg run up in it
Fuck a bitch for about 30 minutes
Real player-like, straight to the point
Bust a nut while I'm smokin a joint
Stop fuckin, still smokin
Lay my dick on her lips, say ""Open!""
Ain't nuttin like a nasty bitch
Acting all fast and shit
Bitch just love to flirt
When I see her at the club, I'll be puttin in work
Feelin on her ass at the bar
Let's get a room, girl it ain't too far
On the way, y'know what happened?
She sucked my dick while I was rappin
I just couldn't resist
I couldn't hold back, I said ""BEEYATCH!""
 Game!
 All I do is stack
 Like what?
 A motherfuckin mack!
Verse 3: Old School Freddy B
My Copue DeVille is all white
Yes bitch, it's hella tight
Crush blue velvet, gameless game
White on white wit tha gold thangs
Bounce tp the spot, check my crap
Wash, wax, straight on fat
The bass on heat everytime I ride
A long haired bitch on the passenger side
Mackin on the cellular phone
I can't be stopped, 50 G's strong
Fred Benz, Freddy B
Oaktown, a bitch don't sleep
A motherfuckin mack that's what I am
Taxin a bitch like Uncle Sam
She pays the tax, Fred Benz' the pimp
16 G's put the bitch in
No ordinary game, just give it and take
East Oakland can't be fake
I slapped the bitch, the money was short
Macked on the bitch and now she knows
Fred Benz baby, the game is fat
Ask these bitches, I'm a mack
 Game!
 Is like ridin vogues
 Like what?
 Breakin hoes
Verse 4: Short Dawg
Breakin hoes day and night
They call me Shorty The Pimp, my game is tight
I never do give hoes slack
I'm like Fred Benz, I'mma mack
So bitch break yourself
I'm an Oaktown nigga, I'll take your wealth
Cos that's what I was raised to do
Break these bitches, get payed fool
Y'know Short Dawg ain't afraid and hurt
Any bitch I get, you can't take her
Cos the game is fool-proof
Bet'cha momma say I'm tellin ya true
So won't you pay the man
Hundred dollar bills all in my hand
While I break you bitches
Tell a story 'bout ridin with bitches
'Bout these pimp ass niggas from The O
We know just what to do with a ho
Take her where the tricks get laid
Where the hoes get paid
You need a pimp, bitch give me a call
I drop the top in my El Dawg
 Cos Game
 It's the shit
 Like what?
 Like a bitch
Outro
 Ai, Short Dawg?

Ain’t No Bitches,Can’t Stay Away,1999.0,"Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop

I'm the super player, I got women everwhere
I know you love a square, I don't care
I still get it, anytime I want to
Call her at the house, I think she said ""come through""
I'm coming, everytime I see her
That's what I'm doing, I can't believe ya
When ya tell me, shes all yours
Cause when I have her on the floor, down on all fours
She said its mine, and that's for sure
If you come around when I'm near, you gotta go
Cause you don't nothing bout this ballers work
When we was players coming up we knocked all the girls
And now I just go out and take my pick
If you gotta enough game you can take my bitch
I won't hate you, try to clown, I'll put you down
Cause I got women all over this town

Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop

You couldn't be a betta player then me, you ain't got enough game
You couldn't take her from me, you ain't even have a chance
Not with me in the picture
You even got the last dance to see what it could gets you
Nothing, broken hearted and lonely
Cause when its over, shes going home with me
Five foot nine short hair big booty
Looking like the leading lady starring in a movie
Fly crib, mercedes benz
She loves niggas like me and my shady friends
And when we hang out, dont count the champagne bottles
Thinking I'm drunk, I don't play game lotto
I put the game down from the start
And you ain't nothing but a dumb ass mark
She started teasing when she saw the red carpet
What did you say nigga ""Get ya ass in the car bitch""

Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop

Hoochies, cheerleaders, groupies, beer drinkers
High class stuck up hoes, that getting real freaky
Laywers, nurses, police women, teachers
If she's a top notch, I keep her
Tall ass models, skinny and shit, big tities, short and thick
All complexions, different nationalities
Pimp game from from east Oakland, out to Cali
Keep 'em teenage to middle age, is she paid
Cuz if she ain't, what can she make
If I see a bad bitch I ain't fin away
I'm gonna holla at her, I can't discriminate
It's not about the sex, not all the time
Cause I'm trying to get in her mind
Like when ya stand and just stare at the ocean
I help ya manage your emotions, bitch

Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop

Ain't no bitches like my bitches, I know ya think ya gotta lotta hoes nigga
And ya probably do, but there's one fact that'll always be true
You couldn't be a betta player than me nigga
Life is, life is too short, so keep trying nigga keep trying

Player of the century, player of the mothafucking millenium

The Dangerous Crew,Get In Where You Fit In,1993,"Tell 'em what we do in here, Dangerous...

Get some drums from a break and then break yo' ass
You want beats from the crew? We'll take yo' cash
5 G's for a muthafuckin' song
And if you can't pay it, keep movin' on
I'm into somethin' that your fake ass never can handle
With your SP-12 and your raggedy samples
Better stick with the James Brown and pay him
'Cause the JD 800 ain't even playin'
Unless Pee Wee hit them keys
Ant Banks on the beats, now we makin' G's
$horty B got the bass and we sellin' it
Shit kinda fat like a muthafuckin' elephant
Sample that shit if you want
You better try to sample this dangerous funk
'Cause ain't nobody trippin' on your fake ass tape
Should've got some beats from my nigga Ant Banks
But Banks ain't thinkin' 'about no weak shit
Now you're goin' out like MC Bitch
And ain't nothin' worth killin' like a sucker
Why you wanna make fake beats, muthafucker
Should've came real like the Oakland city
Beat your ass to death with a S950
It's not a James Brown loop, it's not Parliament
But you can smell it 'cause the sho' got a funky scent
It's called The Dangerous Crew, make you feel stupid
Play a thousand records and you still can't loop it
'Cause it's not to be found, but if you do
Nothin' you could try make you sound like the crew

Yeah man
Just another gangsta kickin' the player pimp shit for nine trey

When you're with The Dangerous Crew
Bitches wanna hang with you
Think about the thing in you
She can suck a thing or two
Niggas in other gangs wanna hang with you
Know your slang, made a few fools wanna slang
Would you tell them bitches they sang
Or would you lie to get that thing 'cause they gameless
Them aimless, niggas get extinguished
But they're just muthafuckers
Got bitches duckin' suckers
When we come to town, mayn
We rollin' fat with dank, ain't fuckin' with that brown thing
The $horty B and $hort, we goin' international
Fuck the local fashion show
Niggas can't be broke
Mhisani for the money fuck a bitch until she dizzy
And me and the biggity-biggity-Banks is gettin' perkin' off Alizé
Big Bob's down with the crew ready to do
Any muthafucker steppin' to
F.M. Blue and Randy Austin
You're lost when
You thought that you can hang with this
Niggas, this is dangerous

I'm committin' a 187 so give me the clip and let me pow
I'm down with The Dangerous Crew, so nigga, whatcha wanna do
The alias East Bay Gangsta, you can catch me peelin' caps
Known for killin' every muthafucker dead in my raps, nigga
So give me the clip and let me pow one
'Cause everybody dyin' on this next fuckin' album
Dumpin' 'em up in ditches, kill the snitches
Sell a Glock to a gee for these player hatin' bitches
Gets my smob on, gets my mob on
And niggas be talkin' the shit, but yo' I'm quick to get my rob on
'Cause peelin' your cap will put my dick on swoll
Muthafuck you bitch, goddamn asshole

It's the Big Badass back on that ass, so it's on G
I'm kickin' the funky shit for the gangstas only
Straight dangerous, we cold mack the most (yeah bitch!)
And we do that coast to coast
Now all the macks in the house, just grab your dick
And tell em funky cock hoes to have a lick
Fuckin' with the gin and juice, dick hard as a rock
Hoes block to block, so what's up with the cock?
I gotta get it goin' on 'til I reach my peak
With a late night freak everyday of the week
Ant Banks, the hoes keep yellin' my name
But I ain't trippin' 'cause a nigga got all the game
From the streets of Oakland, the city of dope
And I'm hopin' that the hoes keep the pussy hole open
To a nigga like me 'cause the pussy is free
Never pay to play 'cause it's plain to see
That the big dick gangsta's in the house
And The Dangerous Crew's gonna turn it out
So everybody out there that's talkin' shit
I'ma wash my name out your mouth with my dick
'Cause it's a dangerous thing and I thought you knew
Boy, you can't fuck with the crew

Clinch your booty cheek, shut your eyes and grit your teeth
Goldy's 'bout to explode, I put your shit to sleep
I'm like the wick on a stick of dynamite
Light me up when I find a mic
And watch me flow real tight, while you flowin' - kinda tight
Goldy bitches comin' tighter than some virgin pussy
If I ever get loose and start stankin' please douche me
The Dangerous Crew ain't no strangers to
What these fingers do, hang his crew
A cold dead nigga changes blue
The skull and crossbones
Bitches get tossed on, niggas get flossed on
Take your mic and bury it like it's a lost bone
If you was a pussy you'd get fucked
If you was a dick you'd get circumsized
You better back the fuck up or I hurt them eyes
Fuck with Goldy you be hoe in'
With your shirt above your stomach in a bow tie
Unbuttoned with your nipples showin'
D to the A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S is the true test
In Oakland makin' the funk, so won't you stick to what you do best
Keep a dick in your ass and keep your 9 to 5
And don't be runnin' and rappin' about you signed to Jive
And I don't give a fuck if it angers you
Fuck you warthogs, I'm down the $hort Dog and The Dangerous Crew

Well a pimp is a pimp and Bun is comin to get'cha
And if 6 is 9 then I'm 30 thousand dollars richer
Hit your bitch when she ain't wit'cha, Pryor pussy like Richard
Wide open make her forget ya then nut on your picture
Lit your world up like the 4th of July, nobody knew why
Not too fly maybe fo' fly, servin dick to make your hoe cry
My nigga you know I chew ya like a barracuda
Who and what you thought you could do to non-hesitatin game shooters
Blew your spot up, when I left nobody got up
If they did they got shot up left for dead in the parking lot, what?
Nigga you got nuts, put your money where yo' mouth is
I doubt this motherfucker even know what the South is
All about, startin the clock, ring the bell or somethin
Cause they stuntin, steady frontin, not cuttin, talkin 'bout nuttin

Now I'm set to attack, crackin yo' back, just call me Jack cause I'ma rip

Roll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers
Politic with them Willies, the real shot callers

Now he comin 'round here, what he lookin fo'?
He'll never get her back, she chose another mack
His other hoes are whack and that's nothin but a fact

A candy sweet dipper, playin with cock and suckin on nipples
Every day my game get thicker, gettin good head from champagne sippers
Rapper to bird flipper, man a motherfuckin ripper

Murder Mob and the Pack bumpin loud on the speakers
From the A to the Bay, Newport to new graves

You gotta keep tryin, just don't give up
Can't get on your feet cause you just won't get up
You dream about havin nice things but you don't have a plan
How you gon' get it, from your Uncle Sam?
Your welfare check can't buy a house and a Benz
What'chu wanna be, a mouse or a man?
You need a hustle, somethin that'll make some cash
Don't step on the gas, you're goin way too fast
In your new sports car, you're dreamin again!
Snap out of it - I know you're fiendin to win
You need to start from the beginnin, get a paper and pen
What'chu like to do, what's your favorite thing?
There's gotta be somethin you can do wit'cha life
Sell things that a whole bunch of people will buy
Make a lot of profits, make bank deposits
Wanna live like this, here's a shoe, how's it fit?

How you gon' ball if you got no hustle
How you gon' pimp if you got no game (YEAH!)
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right cause you so damn lame (YEAH!)

How you gon' pimp if you got no game (YEAH!)
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right cause you so damn lame (YEAH!)

Niggas wanna play with they life but won't play with they kids
They'll ball for these hoes but won't invest shit
Go to church and pray to blue eyes, church is for them pew thighs
Supersized by fries, I pimp a lot of bitches
But I'd rather save yo' lives
I'm from a place where they hung black folks
Where a bird can be whipped from some raw AND dope
Now you broke cause you smoke and you don't got a job
Man get up off yo' ass and do just like Todd~!
Sell yo' shit up out the trunk
Stop hatin other niggas you can get what you want
You can get what you need without makin others bleed
I'm the master of the P-U-S-S-E
Oops I meant Y, others gotta die
Just to help sorry-ass lames get by
Now you'll let a bird die if you saw a bush
But you're pussy in the hood nigga, come get douched
Yeah nigga!


When you finally start makin some dough
You gotta work a lot harder, way more than befo'
It ain't hard to get in, but it's hard to stay
When you start pimpin it's all night all day
Non-stop, gettin it, then you start kickin it
Out with some hoes, later on you'll be stickin it
Move forward and continue to do what men do
Gettin money cause it's in you

Or maybe bein a man ain't in you, you BITCH
You can sell out your own just so you can get rich
No soul, no vibe, but you sportin a cross
Man the truth is you're tired and your spirit is lost!
I've been baptized in dirt, pull your panties up nigga
Rather shoot ya in your mind instead of blowin out your liver

Get your diploma go to college get a nine-to-five
Every year, you're makin 30 G's a pop
Workin see, and you're tied to the white man's jock
Movin out of the ghetto cause it troubles you
Makin payments on a B-M-W
I know you never would settle for the minimum snaps
Have to live in the ghetto where the blacks be at
And send your kids to a school that don't really teach
I give a fuck about a motherfuckin college degree, beeotch!
You think I wanna get cha?
Take you to the motel, and straight raw dick ya?
You must be crazy, smokin that chronic

How To Be a Player,The Pimp Tape,2018.0,"Ayy
I don't know what the fuck you niggas thought
Y'all niggas hollerin' that ""pimpin'"" 'cause it sound good
Nigga, back when I was 17, I fuck with my re-up, nigga, I get it out a bitch partna

Man I can show you how to pimp (I really could)
Betcha you won't comprehend it (Uh uh)
Ain't no pimpin' in your heart, so your heart won't be in it
That's my bitch, she might spread her legs for ya
But I bet your bottom dollar she won't have no bread for ya
Serve 'em Cocktail, yeah, just like my nigga $hort Dog ($hort Dog)
So need a dollar from my bitch? I bet you short, dog
A jack-of-all-trades (Uh-huh), mack of all sort
You throw 'em one, man, I throw that ho a fork
'Cause she done, and well at that
For you to have her sellin' that like crack
Back in my day, on highways and byways
Been up 'bout four, five days
Get a bank roll out the stank ho
Then the Chevy burn rubber sideways
Bitch, if I say (I say), you a flea, can pull a tree
Go hook your lil' ass up with your temper, don't be arguin' me
Nigga think they pimpin' 'cause they bitch'll let 'em borrow a hundred dollars
Shorty, shit, I need a quarter mil' tomorrow

I'll show you how to be a player, swimmin' in these women
Like a motherfucker (Like a motherfucker)
Sippin' on that Slurricane (Whoa)
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em, like a motherfucker (I don't chase 'em baby)
All these bitches know my name
I'm a player in the morning, player in the evening (Player)
Blowin' O.G. I know you see it
Ain't got time for all the games, I'm hustlin' every season
(Ain't got time, ain't got time, ain't got)

So you wanna be a player, like Playboy $hort
I done taught more players than a coach on the court
It started many years ago before I started to rap
This player lifestyle, I was born for that
See one thing about me, I love to spit that game
Control her brain, make my ho keep payin'
It was never about the fame, I want the fortune
We ain't splittin' shit, bitch, I want the whole portion
Hoes do what I say, I ain't gotta force 'em
Get a brand new Ferrari, 800 horses
Pimps taught me how to send 'em, before a nigga bend 'em
You'll never get a dime if you rush and stick it in her
So don't sneeze and don't cough, tell her ""Break yours off""
Go hard on these hoes, pimp, you can't be soft
We in the V.I.P. blazin' tree
Any nigga that's a hater wasn't raised by me

I'll show you how to be a player, swimmin' in these women
Like a motherfucker (Like a motherfucker)
Sippin' on that Slurricane (Whoa)
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em, like a motherfucker (I don't chase 'em baby)
All these bitches know my name
I'm a player in the morning, player in the evening (Player)
Blowin' O.G. I know you see it
Ain't got time for all the games, I'm hustlin' every season
(Ain't got time, ain't got time, ain't got)

I'll hypnotize a bitch mind, like a Hindu do a cobra
In my pimp cup I got wine with my lobster from Nova Scotia
These suckas be killin' me, got my name in they teeth
Be all in their fillings, just like some teeth
One thing I don't like is a liar and people stealin' (Stealin')
All I think about is survival and makin' millions (Survival and makin' millions)

I come from nothin' now I'm somethin' (Now I'm somethin')
You might wanna wrap your hands around your woman (Around your woman)
Game 201, never trust a bitch (Never trust a bitch)
Pussy got you sprung, now you give her chips
Game 202, never lighten up (Never lighten up)
Go hard on the bitch and keep a pistol on the tuck

Baby hella thick, ass full grown (Full grown)
I'ma slide up in it, how you want girl (How you want, girl)
'Bout to slide up in it, what you want?

But she can get it too and lil' baby at the door, yeah
I'ma slide up in it, how you want it (How you want, girl)

She’s A Bitch,"Raw, Uncut and X-Rated",1986,"You know what i think?
She's just a bitch
Motherfucking  can't tell me nothing in the world
She's just a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch...
She's a bitch, bitch, bitch...
She's a bitch
Wherever i go, it's the same case
Same old thing all over the place
Freak freak bitches, i can't forget
And all i give 'em is no respect
Figure this out while i say
Too Short baby will play by play
Four homeboys on a corner
A bitch walks by and one jumps on her
Walking with the bitch for about three blocks
 turn to grind a 
No matter how the game goes with the rap
She's a bitch and 
Man, that bitch ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Homeboy, homeboy, is the bitch the tip?
Wherever i go, it's the same case
Same old thing all over the place
Niggas on the bus on the Oakland town
Trying to catch bitches 'cause they are down
Looking out the window, trying to peek
Fine young bitches walking down the street
See a woman about twenty-five
Thick as fuck with the 
Some motherfucker all by himself
Said ""She's a bitch, but she's fine as hell""
Wherever i go, that's what i see
Any female is a bitch to me
She's a bitch, that's what i say
99 times, every day
She's a bitch, that's the name of this rap
Listen, homeboy, Too Short got caps
Homeboys roll, tos and fros
Going everywhere just pimping hoes
Hitting the strip with a fine girl
Don't know nobody, you're on the world
The next day, the caps come through
Your homie say ""fool, is that girl with you?""
Homeboy, homeboy, you're so damn down
You say ""That was my bitch from the Berkeley town""
She's a bitch, all females are
She's a bitch, man that's hard
The next dumb bitch who hears my rap
Gonna grab a pen and bite her cap
Talkin' about me like i'm a punk
But all that shit will sound like junk
Fake ass broad wanna rap about me
You're a bitch and the homies agree
Bitch, i'm talking to you
You's my bitch ad you know it's true
Bitch, you hear me speaking?
Now Too Short is really tweaking
You're a bitch in stereo
You're a bitch and the homeboys know
Cool down, girls, it ain't that bad
I only say bitch when i'm rapping or mad
If you know me, you are up
I won't call you a bitch till my dick gets sucked
'84 is now gone
See me singing a brand new song
Talking about bitches, that's my style
I'll keep doing that for a long while
I'm T-O-O- S-H-O-R-T
All females are bitches to me
""Fuck Too Short"", that's what she said
Two days later she gave me head
She's a bitch, she's a bitch, bitch bitch bitch make me rich
Too Short, i fuck your mind
Too Short, baby, spit your rhyme
If i mack , i rap a party
And see a bitch with a lot of body
I tell my homie i'm moving fast



Let's go outside, without the noise
And talk real dirty like girls and boys
And if you don't suck Too Short
You ain't the bitch i'm looking for
So much game when the homies tough
I make a bitch blow who never sucks
It really ain't a lie, but I just met her
Now I'm saying, ""Bitch, suck better!""
Slapping that bitch, roughing her up
I got her  and she can't get fucked
Soon as i'm through and bust my nut
One minute later, i kick her butt
Too Short, baby, i'm no sucker
Literally, i'm a motherfucker
And bitch, you're just a bitch
You work fast food and think you're rich
Too Short, baby, got playboy songs
Homeboys just sing along
Say she's a bitch, she's a bitch, bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
She's a bitch, bitch, i'm rich
Too Short, baby, i can handle her
Disrespectful with no manners
Bitches don't care, not no more
Bitches lay up with Sir Too Short
All of them say, back to back
""You're talking about me when you sing your rap""
Wherever i go, that's the case
Freak freak bitches all over the place
She's a bitch, you can't forget
And all you give 'er is no respect
She's a bitch, remember that
She's a bitch, that's a Too Short rap
Rollin' , you see a freak
Stopped your car in the middle of the street
You so damn down, you know you hard
You say ""come on, bitch, get in the car
What's wrong with you? are you lazy?
'Cause you're just standing there looking crazy""
She don't move and you start to yell
You call her a bitch and 
Burnt up rubber all over Oakland
Two base rock cabbies, that's what you're smoking
You big old nigga, so damn rich
And all you're saying is she's a bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch bitch
All you're saying is she's a bitch
Gonna sing a rap about a freak
Fucking a different nigga every day of the week
She's so nasty, she's so fast
All you gotta do is grab that ass
You game ain't even gotta be tough
To take her home for a nice quick fuck
I'm telling you people, she's a freak
The bitch even fucks when she starts to bleed
Five days straight, what's the tip?
Some nigga limping with a burnt dick
One day baby came out of class
Some old nigga grabbed her ass
The nigga was happy, so damn cool
That old ass nigga couldn't be in school
Baby didn't care, she's still with it
She fucked that nigga, didn't know he was a pimp
Game goes on in the big Oakland
One down pimp, one bitch 
Look
So much death on the Oakland streets
Everyody fucking with OPD
Slanging cocaine, knocking it off
Killed some nigga and never got caught
Running from the police, every day
You can't make no money no other way
Just kinking back, getting high
Your homie got killed and you don't know why
A bitch , that ain't true
'Cause you lay down and she fucks you
So much game in a Too Short rap
Her money was short and the bitch got slapped
So much game on the microphone
Her money was long and i went to the 
Bitch, i'm that man
It ain't that hard to understand
I can front myself with this beat
I bet you hear it and you still love me
'Cause you're my bitch, my freaky broad
You sucked my dick 'cause game is hard
Talking on the phone, Too Short said
""Tell me, young girl, do you suck head?""
You said no, but wouldn't you know?
My big fat cabbies made you blow
Two days old, what do you know
Freaky little bitch, she's now my ho
Two days ago, i didn't know she exists
But now baby is my bitch
Too Short, baby, and his women
I heard my homie say ""Man i'm ""
I fuck bitches every week
And i ain't never caught VD
But if i do, i swear to God
I'mma kill that bitch or my name ain't Todd
And you know that's right
She's a bitch, she's a bitch, bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
I'm Too Short, baby, what do i say? she's a bitch, every day
One, two, three, here i go
Fuck a bitch and fuck a ho
I'm that nigga on top of life
Smoking on cabbies, don't smoke no pipe
Eighteen years i have lived
And i still love a young bitch
Fourteen, fifteen, all the way up
If she can bleed, then she can fuck
Homeboys, do you agree?
Statutory rape ain't shit to me
I'm Sir Too Short on the microphone
Got  young freaks all alone
And if my rap makes me rich
I'll still say she's a bitch
Bitch bitch bitch bitch
Too Short said that
You think you're down, but you ain't hard
See a girl, say ""Hi, sweetheart""
The young girl stops, you started to spit it
""How you doing, baby, do you have a minute?""
She said ""No, i never would
I have a man and he treats me good""
You're a mark, you ain't tough
You called her a bitch when you couldn't get sucked
You coulda got sucked in your room
But you said ""Bitch, way too soon""
I'mma tell you, mark, they way it works
You's a bitch, just like her
Wherever i go, that's the case
Same old thing all over the place
Freak freak bitches, i can't forget
And all i give 'em is no respect

Too Short baby done the play by play
'Cause the wait it be, 'cause the way i see
All females are bitches to me

Playboy Short,Don’t Stop Rappin’,UnKnown,"Well, I'm Too $hort baby, hear what I say
I never do work but I always play
‘Cause the game is life and I play the game
So you never talk down on a player's name
When I grab my mic, I'm the one man crew
Talking ‘bout me, wouldn't think about you
When you heard Too $hort came to town
You never would've thought I'd be looking down
On who? On you ‘cause I'm so big
Me and my money is all I dig
I don’t eat ice cream or cherry pie
If you know what I mean, I’m just getting by
Like Too $hort baby, on the scene
Back seat riding in a limousine
Telling that freak all about me
The creator of greater, sucker MC's
Chillin’ out by the bay, singing my rap
No MC could rock like that
Now I say it like fans say
No MC could rock my way
When I rap it's always great
Wouldn't care if it was live or on a tape
It's me, $hort, the one and only
Spitting that rap to all my homies
You know about you, I know I'm a star
When I rap too good I might take it too far
Had a whole damn party going wild
‘Cause I don't stop rappin’, that's my style
It’s Too $hort baby, rocking that party
Got women like leather all over my body
Like two plus two, can I freak four?
You don't know? Shit, I'm Playboy $hort
They call me ""Playboy $hort"" and I tell you why
I pull women every time I’m on the mic
I’m just playing the field, looking to find
A nice young woman I can say is mine
Not a no-good broad who likes to rock
And a rapper named $hort where the bitches grind
It’s like seeing your town, your whole world
Put in my rap all over your girl
She was checked to the max, ‘cause I don’t play
And I was only in town for just one day
Too $hort baby, on the go
To all young ladies, I know you know
I’m gonna take you home with me right now
Just maybe, baby, will show me how
But I tell you, too, so don’t ask me
I lay her down and freak nasty
Said I made her happy, she’ll never be sad
And I kept talking ‘bout what I had
My car, rings, money and things
The clothes I own and the records I sing
Couldn’t do nothing but talk about me
Her worst nightmare, her only dream
Too $hort baby known everywhere
Had a lifelong dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was every day, just make that pay
Five years later, still young in the game
And you never talk down on a player's name
‘Cause I'm big time, I’m not the fool
I'm rich and famous and way too cool
Too $hort baby, I’m so cold
Rich young brother with a lot of gold
Too $hort baby is the name I use
A ’85 Benz is what I cruise
Clean from the start, I thought I was it
I was Cadillac slick in the dust I kick
But a Cad’ ain’t me like a drop-top Benz
Talk about me but the boy’s got ends
Money everywhere, all over the floor
At the bank I'm known as ""Mr. $hort""
When I rap this rap that I sing
My mind keeps saying I’m everything
So I write this book in my head
Writing raps all day, even in bed
I’m the best MC you never met
The funk rap master made to fit
Just her, that perfect ten
Telling me how she needs a friend
Her man would never treat her right
She got rocked and socked all through the night
But I was Mr. Cool, like I always am
Started rapping that yap I rap to fans
Just talking about my fame and rep
The Lone Ranger, the stranger here to hurt
Young women like you with your big round butt
Blind girls driving down the street called ""Love""
Chasing that man, who really can't stand
Seeing your face so now you ran
And you don't realize what you'll soon see
The way making love is supposed to be
With a player known as Playboy Too
Rock a mic and a freak and you'll both be through
Players play women who like to get played
People like you just trying to get laid
But I like money, and I get paid
I do my duty and I say ""Good day""
I’m not a gigolo ‘cause I’m way too deep
I’m a one night stand for a nasty freak
Didn’t wanna make love, I’m not that fast
What the hell, she’s a freak, she even asked
We could go to my room, and bake from scratch
You and the champ in a wrestling match
Just work me all around that ring
One on one, you and your dream
Pin me down and I might sing
Just love Too $hort, I'm everything
So cool, my name is ""Too""
Call it how you want but I won't call you
Ring my phone and you might see
Ringing my phone just won't get me
‘Cause I'm hard to find, but I get mine
If I was looking for you, I wouldn't be in line
I'd be right on time in the right place
Sir Too $hort all in your face
Talking ‘bout mine and what I want
Tell a girl strip down, it’s time to bump
‘Cause when it’s time to hump, I won’t be no chump
I’ll be singing my rap called “Female Funk”
Big time, oh yes, I am
The true MC, rapping man
I’m on my way to the top
So much rappin’ I’ll never stop
And all that fame you might claim
Couldn’t stand up by my rap name
You might be good, I don’t care
I’ve been rapping like this for five long years
No rapper I heard should have these words
It’s Too $hort baby, you should refer
To when the question asks “Who’s the king of the rap?”
‘Cause I don’t stop rapping like some of you saps
You got sucker MC’s with your record deals
Most raps on wax just couldn’t be real
But I found out soon enough
The word said rap was cleanin’ up
Big bankrolls keep comin’ through
But most MC’s just couldn’t be true
‘Cause the tracks ain’t it, dreamin’ ‘bout hits
But you’ll find out Too $hort don’t quit
When I grab my mic, I’m the one man crew
Talkin’ ‘bout me, wouldn’t think about you
When you heard Too $hort came to town
You never would’ve thought I’d be looking down
On who? On you ‘cause I’m so big
Me and my money is all I dig
Wouldn’t eat ice cream or cherry pie
If you know what I mean, I’m just getting by
‘Cause I’m Too $hort baby, on the scene
Back set riding in a limousine
Telling that freak all about me

No Love From Oakland,Shorty the Pimp,1992.0,"Ain't no love in Oakland, bitch
Niggas always talkin bout 'I love you'
But ain't no love, bitch

Now it's a shame, I can't be saved by John the Pope
I gotta be a pimp or sellin dope
Cause in this town, it's goin on
And brothers doin that can't live too long
So what's my option, do it or not
Break a ho, sell a ki, just don't get caught
Cause if I do, I'm goin to jail
On a one-way ticket to a prison cell
So why commit the crime? Don't ask me
Went to school everyday, and I still can't read
I count money like a champ, now ask me
Why everyday does the task force jack me
The story's been told one million times
About a boy growin up to a life of crime
I heard it before, you heard it too
But now, homeboy, it's just me and you
You see, people try to call us filthy trash
Even though we live better and make mo' cash
Than they do, I'm not a no-good thug
Standin on the corner sellin drugs
And just remember, this ain't multiple choice
Without a college degree you only got your voice
You gotta talk for yours, or get nothin at all
This ain't the NBA, I ain't havin a ball
Every day is a trip, but I ain't trippin
Watch my back and don't start slippin
Money won't talk, but it looks right back
Everytime I dip into my stack
I'm buyin cars, jewelries, and mobile phones
Things I couldn't get with a high school diploma
It's alright, cause I just help myself
You should know, cause I can't do nothin else
And you better watch out for the day
When you lock me up and throw that key away
Cause I'll be back on parole
Ain't changed nothing, cause I'm ready to roll
I go to school now, but just to front
Still servin dopefiends what they want
Count 5 to 10, 10 to 20
And I just keep on makin money
I hope you don't think my story's amazin
I tell it to a kid in the ghetto, it won't faze him
So many blackmen die for drugs
I think back on the way life was
Before rock cocaine started runnin thangs
And drive-by shootings was a normal thang
Before brothers bought Benzes, used to drive Mustangs
12 years later, and I'm still in the game
All my life all I wanted was a few hoes
If I was pimpin or slingin at the liquor sto'
Ain't nothin but street life, fuck that school
All the squares up there ain't even cool
Plus my partners at the house sell coke all day
Hit the mall like players, spendin fat-ass bank
Junior high wasn't shit but a place to fight
Muthafuckas wasn't learnin how to read and write
I'm just walkin down the street all alone
High as hell, my mind is gone
I'm thinkin bout some brand-new shit and I'm broke
I know I be a fiend if I smoke that coke
But if I go back to school and get educated
Be a old-ass man before I graduated
So what should I do, I can't even cope
I guess I'll get a sack and start slingin dope
I went to my homie, said, ""Give me the sack""
He disappeared quick, and he came right back
He said, ""You owe me a g, I give you a week
You fuck up my money, don't cop no plead
Cause in the Oak ain't no love, $hort""
I knew right then I couldn't sell that coke
When I was young, it was hard to tell
If I grow up and be rich as hell
See, I was cool I knew all the shit
Big bank on my finger tips
But I never had a big bank, not back then
I kicked back and watched all my friends
Make big money, right in my face
And if you ever crossed them, they be on your case
You go under, six feet underground
You gets no love from the Oaktown

I drive my top everyday like a movie star
Drive around all night in old towed up cars
And if you stop me, ain't no tellin what you find in my trunk
Gotta live like this, cause I ain't no punk
So break down the dank and roll up that shit
Light the muthafucka, take a fat-ass hit
My fingers all sticky from the residue
Don't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Cause life is only give and take
In the town where the strong control the fake
The wild wild west, that's the place
Suckers take a bite, and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
Mack these hoes every chance I get
Like a drop SL, three times black
I'm a pimp, a player and I been known to mack
I'm a muthafucka, I broke your heart
She gave it all to me, and I tore it apart
Talked about love right to the end
But I broke your heart and, bitch, I do it again
So young and tender, also fine
Tryin to get Short Dog all the time
I take what I want, you can keep the rest
You gets no love from East Oakland, bitch
That's the place I call home
Where the Oakland City players roam
Game don't stop, listen to me
Everybody fuckin with the O.P.D
Slingin cocaine, knockin it off
Killed some nigga, and he never got caught
High-speed chases everyday
Can't make no money no other way
A bitch yelled ""raid!"", that ain't true
Cause you laid down, and she fucked you
Two days ago I didn't know she existed
But now baby is just one of my bitches
I don't care what you say
Cause I catch bitches and straight get pay
You don't care what I'm sayin
Punk-ass square ain't got no game
Hoes love me, cause I'm a player
They think maybe I just might fuck em later
I keep mackin though, I don't work for free
To be a true ho you gotta pay me
I spend endless days and endless nights
Plottin this shit to keep my money right
I build stages in my mind, and it's all an act
All I'm tryin to do is keep my pockets fat
With this pimp game, and these funky beats
Now here's a little story from the Oakland streets
You see, Tania had a boyfriend, his name was Jack
Always had the bitches on their backs
Jack told Tania, ""I love you so""
But Jack's a mack, he's got several hoes
One day she beeped him to say what's up
He didn't call back, cause she was only out to fuck
She beeped Mike, cause she got mad
She knew about the bitches her boyfriend had
Mike called back, and he was on his way
He just got the pussy yesterday
You see, Mike ain't trippin on his girlfriend
Fine little bitch, I think her name is Lynn
Mike paid the bills always in cash
And if she ever got raw, he just beat that ass
It goes on y'all, so don't even trip
You gets no love from East Oakland, bitch
Got sprung, even though it's not legal
A young black man livin like rich people
I got this game from a hard-ass place
It's on the map, right there in your face
I see my people, all filled with joy
Next day they're killin homeboys
Can't say shit if you sho' can't shoot
Cause muthafuckas will smoke them boots
You gets no love from Oakland, bitch
You better try to make me rich",https://genius.com/Too-short-no-love-from-oakland-lyrics

U Stank,Chase the Cat,2001.0,"The luscious bitch, she is true
But it's not nice to fool Mother Nature
The proud mother of God, like all hoes
Is jealous of her own shadow
Who is this young big tawny bitch who wish to be queen for a day?
Who would sacrifice the great grandsons and daughters of her jealous mother?
By suckin their brain until their ability to think was amuptated?
By pimpin their instincts until they were fat, horny and strung out?
And her right to be kept queen of the universe
Who is this bitch?

Spit the game in her ear tell her, get on the ave

Young girl lookin brand new, told me what her man do
Fake-ass nigga, she can't stand you

I Ain’t Nothin But a Dog,Shorty the Pimp,1992.0,"I've been a dog ever since I was young
I saw 
The Mack
 and got oh so sprung
I couldn't help it, I had to be just like that
With a stable of hoes and my pockets fat
But don't trip, I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I be a player for life
Forget about a wife
She just ain't my type
Cause I mack each ho and get richer
And if it ain't like that then I forget ya
I know you're just a freak, ho
You're so nasty
That's why you're staring
When you walk right pass me
Bitch, now you're looking back
All dogs must chase the cat
So here I come, I just wanna fuck you and cut
Treat you like trampy slut
So much game when a homies' tough
Meet a bitch like you and smooth come up
I have your fake-ass closing out bank accounts
Spitting straight pimp game from the Oakland-town
It's been done before and bitch, I do it again
Break your mama, your sister and all your friends
$hort dog's on the microphone
And I won't stop macking till my bank is long
So try to break me if you wanna
From me you get nothing but drama
If you're a rich bitch, I got a new twist
And if you're with it, bitch
Then we can do this
Put me on the payroll
Kick me down bankroll
Buy me a Benz and keep my tank full
'Cause other than that, I don't want no broad
$hort Dog ain't nothing but a dog
I got all my game from East Oakland streets
So mother fuck you damn shit-head freaks
Couldn't pay me enough to treat you right
'Cause $hort Dog ain't nothing nice
Like a sucker mother fucker let his bitch be boss
Tell him how much she wants
And, ""Let me use your car""
I'm from Oakland, bitch
And you can check my rap
And out here fake bitches get slapped
Let a bitch get bold with me
I start acting like Goldy
Tell me who's in the house now?
Shorty The Pimp
And I'm the last mother fucker
That will pay your rent
I ain't blind, I know you're fine as fuck
But you a tramp, bitch
You ain't mine what's up?
Try to give me some pussy but I want some head
And I already know everything you did
They say you fuck like old-ass tired bitch
But the word is out you suck some good ass dick
And I don't want nothing if I can't get it all
You should know
'Cause I ain't nothing but a dog, bitch
$hort dog ain't nothing but a dog
Bitch, fuck with me she got to do it all
Most brothers try to take freaks out
I get a room and stick my dick in her mouth
They spend money on a movie and some dinner
But $hort Dog will go straight up in her
I give bitches no respect
The way I run my game they understand this shit
You couldn't be like me cause you'll just buy her things
Used to be perfume but now it's diamond rings
I remember when I fucked your prom date
You bought her dress and everything
But she just couldn't wait
For the prom to end so she can call me up
It was our very first date
And it was cool to fuck
Now I be doing this shit all the time
I got bitches on my mind
Can't change in 1992
Cause I still gotta find some new
Sweet, black whatchamacallit? I won't say it
But if it's laying in my bed, I'm a fade it
$hort dog ain't nothing but a dog
Use to clown the hoes at the Eastmont Mall
I was acting like a pimp when I was 7
Started sucking up game at 11
And at the age of a young 14
I started knocking young hoes on the scene
Couldn't give a fuck less about a bitch
Thinking like that $hort Dog got rich
Now I'm making ends and you think I'm weak
Cause I'm always down at ? freaks
Tell me who's the man
And who's the mouse, bitch?
I'm Audi-five to my dog house",https://genius.com/Too-short-i-aint-nothin-but-a-dog-lyrics
Thangs Change,Cocktails,1995.0,"Simpty is for them simp ass niggas
Talkin lot, shit, I straight dump and stomp niggas
Whenver talklin shit, I straight rip 'em
And niggas know I come equip when I whip them

You say how can I make these dirty raps
Number one albums, back to back
If it was 1950, do you think I sell, no
They probably throw me straight to jail
I tell you life just ain't what it used to be
Between you and me, exclusively
Everybody's changed, were losing our minds
The government won't help, cause they refuse to find
A solution to the problems of the inner streets
Its a shame what our kids are beginning to be
Pregnant teenagers, young gun slangers
There ain't no love, there ain't nothin but anger
We don't go to church and can't pray in school
Listen real close to what I'm sayin fools
I know kids who went to school together
Now they all grown up, tryin to kill each other
Shootouts in the playground is where it goes down
But back in the day, we rode the merry-go-round
And some little kid might shoot me tonight
And I always used to wonder what the future be like
Cuss words on the tv and radio
You wanna see sex, turn it on HBO
Late at night, you see women freak women
Sex sales, that's why I keep pimpin
I grew up in the 70s', somethin like Crooklyn
But I was in Cali not Brooklyn
I could tell the whole world was going crazy
But it really didn't happen til the 80s'
With freebasin and smokin crack
A lotta people learned not to joke with that
Streets flooded, with homeless folks
Whole families, lives gone up in smoke
We're all related to a crackhead
Sometimes I wake up in the mornin and wanna go back to bed
Layin there thinkin bout things
About the way life change
How women used to like to wear decent clothes
Now they curse like men and dress like hoes
You supposed to be a virgin til you marry
But teenage girls find it normal to carry a baby
Babies havin babies
Rappers like me always disrespect ladies
Wonder why its like that, well so do I
But I just turn my back and then I go get high
Cause I get paid real good to talk bad about a bitch
And you bought it, so don't get mad I got rich
Ask your grandparents, is life the same
Man thangs change
Chorus
There used to be a time when old folks were respected
Kids talkin back was never accepted
Get spanked and your mouth got washed out with soap
But kids nowadays will curse out old folks
Then you tell me I need to be a role model
And get these babies off the 40 ounce bottles
But I'm not the one who made alcohol legal
Liquor stores on every corner that's why we go
Buy 40 ounces and go get drunk
Don't respect our kids, like no good punks
And then they grow up to be hardcore criminals
Shoot 'em up, slang dope always pimpin hoes
I know its those that don't believe what I'm sayin on the mic right
So Baby D won't you tell them what its like

Its kinda hard comin up as a youngster
Gotta deal with the roof that I'm under
Even though my moms got it hard
My daddy passed away, now I'm stuck without a father
But times have changed bro
I never ever seen Santa Claus comin through the ghetto
But you know what I always see
I always see the white man want a black man bank G
And I don't even get in trouble for it
And I don't see nothin forward
Always tryin to beat the black man to death
Punk police tryin hide behind your badge
Always tryin arrest somebody
All we gotta do is beat him with the billyclub
Here I come, I comin with my gun
I'm shootin in the head police now what

I tell you life is too short for it to be like that
We gotta be leaders, can't follow the pack
With all them fiends in the streets smokin crack
What you give life is what it gives you back
Cause money in the ghetto ain't nothin new
But when you get the money gotta know what to do
Buy you a business or buy you a house
Just so the police can't wipe you out
I heard it in the streets, they say you the man
So try to help your brothers and lend a helpin hand
Now what we gone do

We came to stack dem bodies, killin anybody's like John Gotti
I said we came to dem some bodies, killin anybody's like John Gotti
Now run up and get done up and slap black
I'm hittin blackjack like the casino when I mack slack
You wanna play like Al Pacino with this
Type of style with the lyricist, it's funkabis
Kiss sativa and the biscuits I drop
Motherfuckers know I come down and show me ??
I don't really care
From the front or the rear
Word to your mother I'm bout to smother and smear
Its that master all I intelligent
Chain that I swing from the others is irrelevant
For you motherfucker to step to the m-i-c
I'm down with Shorty, Ant Banks and Mally G
Its Malik and I freak it's obsolete
My technique motherfucker know I flow over beats
Like water, slaughter dick in yo daughter
And my nuts up in her jaws when she suckin on my balls
Yiggy y'all niggas best to ask somebody
Cause I'm shootin motherfuckers down with the shotty
Its that motherfuckin master blaster
Its, its the motherfuckin ghetto bastard",https://genius.com/Too-short-thangs-change-lyrics
Short Side,"Raw, Uncut and X-Rated",1986,"Short Side!
Too Short, you know ain't nothing but a side buster

Well it's true, homeboy, I can't lie
I got a brand new rap and I call it Short Side
You just don't know, you're so near
Guess what, baby boy, you get to hear
Short Side, burning rubber on a bitch
And give her toilet paper so when she shits
In her drawers, in the street
When she sees me rolling, luxury
When she wants so much to take a ride
That right there is Short Side
Having more bitches wanting me
For only one thing: head surgery
If you can't understand that pimping tip
It's freaky lizard lips all on my dick
If i talk too strong, don't kick back
Short Side emotion, here's the Rap
Too Short, I hear her call my name
Because she's so so sprung on the Too Short game
I don't even know what you wanna tell me
 you wanna freak
You can only suck dick 'cause you're much too fast
And on that pussy i got to pass
So, what you gonna do, what do you know?
Do you wanna take a ride so you can blow
If you don't that's on, Too Short's gone
I bet another young freak will come along
They think I get down 'cause I'm so damn rich
Never left a party without a bitch
I just work' em, drop 'em and they all find out
All i get down is dick in her mouth
No two times have been the same
But another bitch's fucked by the Too Short game
Raise up, homie, can't you forget it?
You gonna get fucked if you try to sweat it
She was a young tender, I couldn't resist her
Punk, i didn't know that was your sister
But all that shit is beside the point
'Cause all i did was smoke a joint
It knock me out, without a roll
Your sister sucked me like indo smoke
Nigga, that's game, you should know
Don't tell me your bitches don't ever blow
Because if they don't, listen to me:
You're a T-R-I-C-K, baby
I can understand if she refused
But you got to ask and she'll suck you
'Cause all the homies know the tip
Freaky lizard lips all on my dick
Bitches are starting to recognize
Niggas don't like them open thighs
The cap is: a nigga don't even know her
And the bitches don't care, she'll still bend over
She suckin' my dick, and in her mind
It's a popsicle in the summertime
She's sucking it good, like a winner
She's going to drop on top and stick it in her
I slapped that bitch and said ""Get down, ho""
""My nut ain't came, now suck some more""
Up and down I see her work
I throw my arms to the back and call her dirt
Said ""I'll beat your ass with a billy club""
""If you don't keep sucking and make me nut""
Ho, you better listen to this:
You're sucking dinner, so suck it, bitch
I like a bitch who can suck dick
She's gotta blow more head, blow more head than Blowjob Betty, oh yeah (echoes)
Blowjob Betty (echoes)
Gotta blow more head than Blow Job Betty
Lick my balls 'til my dick gets harder
Blow more head than a well blows water
Telling a little story on the microphone:
Biatch, you can't fuck with me!
I got my dick sucked by Blow Job Betty
Don't you know what that means?
Well, i'll tell you the story of Blow Job Betty
When it came to sucking, she was ready
Since Betty was young, she seen the shit
Everynight she sucked her daddy's dick
At first she hated it, 
Then she started to make it fun
After a while, she found a way
To pretend daddy's dick was her birthday cake
All sweet and nothing sour
Suckin' on her daddy in the midnight hour
She was eighteen when I met her
She was in the bathroom, she was putting in work
My dick got hard, and I was ready
She was sucking my homie like a baby on a titty
When his nut came, I stepped up
Pulled out my dick for that bitch to suck
She licked my dick up and down
My balls were bouncing on the ground
But then I shot a fatal nut
It knocked that bitch on her butt
She couldn't even breathe, she was holding her throat
Me and my homie just hit the door
My homeboy said ""Short, don't worry""
But then next day i read this story:
""A young girl died, just last night
She choked on sperm in her windpipe
It was on her face, her neck and chest
And we're sorry to say, there's no suspects""
When i thought that, my brain clicked:
I bust a nut and killed a bitch
And don't tell me: ""Short, that's petty""

You got to go out there
And handle your buisiness (get my money)
Handle yours, playas play on (bitch)
Nigga that's pimp shit (bitches gonna pay me)
What you say? (Oh these hoes gon' pay me)
Nothin but the hog in me (nothin but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (born to mack)
Nothin but the hog in me (that's what I said)
Verse 1: Too $hort
I was born to mack and at a young age
I knew I'd be a real pimp someday
So I practiced my walk, I studied the game
I never been a sucker but I was still lame
Some things never change but my game elevated
When it comes to pimpin hoes I been truly educated
Cause I'm so slick, I make hoes turn tricks
Players University, class of '86
And I'm hard on a bitch, go ask my first ho
I was 17 then and now I'm 34
I'mma still be a pimp till the day I die
On every street corner, and every high rise
I got the best women that money can buy
When I talk about the game, I never lie
Ask me why that little girl made her momma cry
You wanna know I'll tell you why, nigga
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga that's pimp shit (get that money main)
Nothin but the hog in me (nothin but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (that's right)
Nothin but the hog in me
(get that money bitch, get that money bitch)
Verse 2: Too $hort
She got lost and turned out at a young age
I knew she'd be a real ho someday
When she was 10, she was freaky back then
She would let the little boys rub on her pants
She liked sittin on a grown mans lap
When she was 14, she let em fuck her from the back
For some scratch, she let em hit
Pull up her skirt, and lick on her clit
Lil fine ass bitch, with some big ol' tits
Made her first pimp rich with that good shit
But at the age of 26 she's an old ho
She don't really look that good no mo'
But she could make a trick cum in a minute
Anything you want you can get it
Anything you pay for, she'll earn
Give her some money, she'll take your sperm, nigga
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga that's pimp shit (get your money girl, get that money girl)
Nothin but the hog in me (nothin but the dog in me bitch)
Niggas that's pimp shit (pimp shit, yea, fa sho)
Nothin but the hog in me
(Oh you know pimpin is the oldest profession)
Verse 3: Too $hort
He used to give the girls his lunch money when he was young
For a kiss on the cheek, he thought it was fun
I knew he'd be a real trick one day
Letting girls ride his bike, let her win when they play
He was soft, and females made him weak
When you got no game, the only way to make her freak
Is to pay em, and that's what he grew up and did
He won't lie, ask him what he do for a bitch
Spend cash, just to get some ass
He tried to marry a ho, but the shit didn't last
He broke the golden rule, I hope he never tried
His own wife, own house, and he still had to die
That's fucked up, but that's the life of a trick
Be a sucker for a bitch and she'll suck your dick
I know he loves her, I don't doubt him
She pulled out his money, said ""I love things about him""
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga that's pimp shit (pimp shit)

Oaktown still in the house, but I suppose its
Time for some more shit
So yo peep the flow bitch and I'll be
The motherfuckin host with the most dick
So now you know it ain't a damn thang changed up
Stayin true to the streets since we came up

Much bass now the name is just Dangerous
So here we go, its time for some new shit
From 94 to 95 we can do this
So nigga just love this with no playa hation
Cause we gets respect all over the nation
Still in this to win this so you can pretend this
Beat this like my dick in yo mouth, until I'm finished
The shit goes on and on and on
But when you gets no promotion That ass is gone
In the studio all day puttin in work
Hoes didn't give a fuck and man that shit hurts
Used and abused no pain no gain
Sure them hoes tried to play us, but we still in the game

Still in the game, after all these years
Been bumpin so long I can hardly hear
Still got the same flow that I used to have
You can clown if you want, but don't do it too fast
Cause I'm gone slow it way down, than shoot your ass
And send you wanna be pimps, back to class
Cause Ant Banks been making these beats too long
You trying to get with these funky songs
But the formulas patented, we ain't havin it
Game is all we spit Keep on mackin bitch You can't make it hard
Can't tell a motherfucker how to play this part
Call me Short Dawg baby of the Dangerous Crew
Talkin on the Mobil Ant Banks came through
Ridin in a brand new Benz

No shit bitch, stupid hoe
You spent your last 10 years in the studio

Still in the game, still gettin paid
You know we got all the hoes
More hoes than Swiss cheese nigga
Ant Banks you wanna hoe, you wanna bitch?

Well can I get a bitch (bitch)

But check this, some niggas don't give it up
Never be givin us props, see we don't stop cause we don't give a fuck
We gets paid, so tell me what a nigga know

Damn, we never ballin out of control

Young nigga in the fifth grade, stealin cigarettes
At ten years old, he was a real vet
Sellin gold weed, makin money like a star
Wasn't old enough to drive, but he still bought a car
Ten years later, he was sellin coke
Fuck with the nigga he was killin folks
Had to do a couple of niggas or he would've caught the crome
Hopped on the plane, straight got gone
3 years on the run, still in the game
Bounce back to the town ain't nothin change
Caught a murder beef, but the shit was weak
Charges got dropped in less than two weeks
Nigga went through alot, but his bnk is fat
Tried to catch him up with them wiretaps
But that snitch thean told
Its simple and plain
You can clown all you want, but we still in the game

I must confess, you got the best
Hook
Verse 3:
I keep a gang of hoes on my team at all times
Let a nigga know that the pussy's all mine
Hit it on the regular, you know I'm good for that
Top notch bitches, even fuck them hood rats
Take her to the mansion, take off the pants then
Kidnap the pussy and hold it for ransom
But none of them bitches can fuck like you
Hit me on my beeper you know I'm comin through
Just like that, always was and always will be
I'll get ya wet, and then you gonna feel me
Way up in ya, not far from Virginia
Stick it in your mouth on the way down south
So when you get home and smell the cum on your breath
Go in the bathroom and play with yourself
Your pussy's the best, I must confess
Whenever your horny I got a ""S"" on my chest

New Bitch,The Sex Tape Playlist,2018.0,"[Intro: Too $hort + 
Female
]
Wake yo’ muthafuckin’ ass up, let’s have a discussion right the fuck now
Why you tryna question me, bitch?
Don’t ask me why I’m questioning you, nigga
I’m still sleep, shut the fuck up
Nah nah, nigga, I’ve been waiting for 5 hours, 15 minutes, 23 seconds and
Counting
What, bitch?
Get yo’ ass up

I woke up this morning on some new shit
I rolled over like, “I need a new bitch”
I sent a mass text out like “I’m cool”
I done with you hoes, I swear I’m through
So don’t text me, and don’t call me
Don’t hit me with a pocket dial saying “My fault”
Erase my number, and my e-mail
And that’s all you need to know, no details
And don’t be on Instagram in my DM’s
Talkin’ ‘bout how you pregnant, you my BM
I used a Magnum every time, bitch, stop that
Lying like that’ll get you popped at
And when you see me in the club, don’t act like we still fuckin’
Just hit me with that “What’s up?” or don’t say nothin’
Why I’m leaving? You really wanna know what the truth is?
I’m tired of you, girl, I need a new bitch

I need a new bitch
Lose my number
I need a new bitch

Why you blowin’ me up like a mad bitch?
See my number in her phone under “Daddy Dick”
Don’t be mad at me ‘cause I had to, bitch
OG player, I used to drive a Cadillac
But I spent $160,000 on this sports car
Got her in the front seat, she called me Short Dog
I said, “Call me by my real name, Big Dick Dad”
Now there’s bitch ass niggas in her phone getting mad
Don’t ask me, ask her
Can’t afford therapy, go see your pastor
Don’t call or text me, now or next week
She’s always with me, and it’s always sexy
Three decades of game, still pimpin’ hoes
You need to let that shit go—what you trippin’ fo’?
Ain’t no pearl like new pearl
I said bring yo’ ass here—what it do, girl?
She’s so exotic, and exclusive
I just might make her my new bitch

I need a new bitch
Lose my number
I need a new bitch
You better lose my number
I need a new bitch
I need a new one, a new bitch—BITCH!",https://genius.com/Too-short-new-bitch-lyrics
Don’t Fight the Intro,Get In Where You Fit In,1993,"Say, ho...
Yeah, you...
Can I ask you a question?
Can you get in where you fit in, bitch?

Get mad if you want, I won't front

So roll you raps over they're all out-dated
Too $hort, baby, comin' straight X-rated

You heard seven get ready for eight
That's right, bitch

Don't believe me?
Start countin' while I name them
""Don't Stop Rappin'""
Girl, that's your life
Talkin' about smokin' that glass-pipe
""Players"" was the weakest
And that's the realler
But I still came hard on coke-dealers
""Raw, Uncut and X-Rated"", ""Born to Mack""
""Life Is...Too $hort"" is when I first went platinum
""$hort Dog's in the House"" came next
And ""$horty the Pimp"" makes seven, bitch...

And it don't stop to the beat, baby...
Get in where you fit in, bitch!
That's right, album number eight
Five nation wide, two gold, two platinums
And you got to break me off something for this one, bitch
Ant Banks on the motherfucking mixing board
Pee-Wee on the keyboards
Shorty B on the bass and lead guitar
And I'm in the sound booth, bitch
And we don't stop
And you know that shit (Yeah)

We up here at Dangerous Music Studios
Just got through making Mhisani a funky-ass album called
""Goldy in the Land Of Funk"", his shit will out in a minute
My boy Father Time just hooked up with Dangerous Music
On that funky, sloppy, hip-hop tip
Ant Bank's sitting on something fat, if you already didn't know
And if you ain't got Banks' tape, you need to get the motherfucker
'Cause the shit is on hit, bitch
Yea, straight from motherfucking East Oakland
We got Rappin' Ron from 89th Avenue
And his partner Ant Diddley Dog from 9-8
And those motherfuckers gonna come out with the
Bad Influence tip straight from Oakland, bitch
Then we gonna knock the patch out your ass
On the fade tip with my nigga FM Blue from Tre Eight
Davey D is his boy and they gonna tear shit up too
Dangerous Crew nigga, yeah
And it don't stop

Short: Hey, Banks. Is we gonna get funky on this album or what?
Ant Banks: Yeah, you know that, but we ain't gotta brag on it
That's right and if these niggas think we some
Fake ass, rap ass motherfuckers or something
You best do you homework, nigga

Got a gang of motherfuckers ready to funk with you niggas
If you want it like that, but you know
It ain't even got be all that though, because ah

Blow Job Betty (original),"Raw, Uncut and X-Rated",1986.0,"Man, i rap so much
I started to record over
Because i got so much raps ain't no record can hold it
And that's so true about Too Short
Bitch must've told me, she said ""Too Short, i love you""
Ain't that a bitch? she said ""I love you""
You know what i said?
I couldn't even start rapping. i said:

Bitch, who are you?
You said you love me, but is that true?
You asked me could you by my lady
You wanted so much to have my babies
So what, bitch? i bust your cherry?
Hell fucking no, i don't wanna get married
'Cause can't no bitch hound me
Talking some shit about a family
I'm a player, and she's my whore
I'm Sir Too Short and i'm a 
The last thing i need is a wife
Imma keep that title for my whole life
But if i would, what'd happen to be
Too Short, baby, what would you see
If i had a son, say i had a son
He'd be rocking cocaine by age one
It's true, homeboy, it's not a cap
I'mma tell this shit on the Short Side rap
'Bout the ladies, the women, the girls and freaks
I got a rap for them, so listen to me
I've been trying to say this all through my rhymes
I'm gonna say that shit just one more time:
Niggas ain't fucking, we're getting rich
But that don't mean you can't suck dick
Too Short ain't shit i made up
But you sucked my dick and you never got fucked
You say i'm not the real McCoy
But you sucked my dick and my homeboy's
You're a pro at sucking head
You licked my balls where it feels best
You sucked my dick better than right
And that right there is Short Side
The pimp tip, could never quit
I heard a freak say: ""that's the shit
He took the cake,  fucked a break
Too Short, baby sure ain't fake""
That's right, young freak, i'm your commander
When it comes to Short 
'Cause a nigga ain't lame, step back bitch
Unless you're trying to make me rich
You told your friends i wanted you
You dumb sprung freak, that's just not true
You came to me and you had to ask
Am i Too Short who sings the rap?
When i replied: ""yes i am""
We were walking down the street, holding hands
Then Too Short spit a 
And the next thing you know, we was all 
Someone had to ask my why do i call this rap ""Short Side""
Why, 'cause someone said to me ""Too Short, side on that freak""
If you drop the ""Too"", what's the tip?

Anything Is Possible,You Nasty,2000,"Album number 12
Short Dogg still in the house
I ain't going back into retirement
Life is......
Anything is possible try hard
It ain't logical fuck an obstical bitch
How can I make twelve albums
All them gold and platinums
And I am still clowin
It ain't hard
I used to be a broke nigga
Dreamin about brodes and smoking bigger
Dedicated to the rap game
Too $hort I know you know that name
2000 makes me a 20 year veterian
Still making money and I don't stop rapping
Thats my motto even if you niggas hit the lotto
You never could win not until I go
I know you squares can't hang with me
What you talking about you can't spit this game like me
Some of y'all suckers need to fall in love
And stay there and quit trying to be a player
Fuck around and fuck your life up
Or a tramp ass bitch with a nice butt
You should of went to collage
Got your degree and a job stop trying to be like me
It's too hard cause you don't even know this streets
And me I mack this hoes with need
See and you all you do is smoke that weed
She broke your heart and got you on your knees
But me I know how to treat a bitch
Fuck all that nice ass sweethard shit
Suck my dick now thats foreplay
Now I am about to fuck you on the floor in the doorway
Treat you like a ho okay? you like that
Leave when I am finished and say I'll be right back
Bitch! you already knew what it was
Whats a dogg like me going to do with your love
I drive it down the street tied to my bumper
I don't care how find she is
I am trying to dump her
I already fucked her
You need to get on bitch and find you a sucker
Get married divorced and get half
Maybe you should reason with her before she gets mad
Or maybe my nigga you should slap that bitch
If not then you need to snatch that bitch
By the throught and let her know this is how it goes
Say whats on your mind, now she knows
Some of y'all ladies need to check your man
For acting like a bitch every time he gets a chance
Backslap him tell him shut up and stop crying
And stop all that wineing
Bitch ass nigga you need to buy yourself some business
And quit askin all them motherfucking questions
Ain't no slaves around here
Ain't nobody gettin payed around here
It's all true about this hoes and me
You ain't got no game you don't know what she needs
Lame than a motherfucker about this mack shit
Still letting bitchs monipulate your actions
When you going learn how to wear the pants
Try and give this real player rythem a chance
It's all about the money and feeding your family
If I am macking hoes and you can't stand me
Keep my name out your ????? mouth
You hate a player and I find out
I might fuck your bitch little sister or your momma
More than one time just to add to the drama
Give you something to talk about
Life long trick learn your mouth
Cause I don't stop macking and I am always rapping
I fucked your little sister but I was just praticing
Short little bitch I picked her up
Diggin this big ass dick in her gut
I let her walk the funny
Whats wrong $hort Dogg last night got his fuck on
And you was trying to hate me I got cha
I fucked your little sister nigga anything is possible

 Yea...
 Whatch'all gonna do?
 And we ridin
 Short Dawg!

What's on yo' mind ho?  That nigga Too $hort
Got you playin witcho' pussy fo' twenty-fo'
In the mo'nin, why I won't call you back
Got another little freak all on my lap
She's been tellin me things that I wanna hear
So I hit you on another day, another year maybe
I still wanna see you baby
I know I told a few lies, you wanna be my lady
I let you ride with a player in my new truck
Take you straight to my house, you can do me up
And back down again, get around your friends
Let 'em know, e'ry nigga from the town's a pimp
My daddy was a player, my grandpa too
Now what the fuck else am I supposed to do?
Put my finger on the pussy, rub the nipple next
Short Dawg's in the house with the triple X
I'm a hooker's dream, a hoe's delight
They prove it, with bankrolls every night
You like to kiss her, she like to drink sperm
Get you high, smokin that pink sherm
I don't have sex with her, she just give me head
Like the ex-President, I don't need a bed
Let it drip down your cheek, get all on your dress
Rinse the evidence or rub it all on your tits
I don't care - cause I'm cold as ice
I don't feel nothin for you, think you know I'm nice
That's what you heard about Todd when I'm gettin hoes
Leave a trail of broken hearts when I let 'em go
It's not my fault, cause they be all in the club
Believin what I say, bitches fallin in love
When all I really wanted was a little sex
Turn your ass out with my triple X

It's Short Dawg, he came to play the game
So whatch'all wanna do?  He'll make you say his name (Short Dawg)
It's Short Dawg, he came to play the game
So whatch'all wanna do?  He'll make you say his name (Short Dawg!)

Now what you bouts to do, little prostitute
I see that sucka in ya ear but I gots to shoot
Some real game your way, what I came to say
Is what I did yesterday it ain't gon' change today
And if I cain't knock you I bet I get her
Cause I'm a hard workin pimp, I'm not a quitter
These hatin lames, don't even realize
Short Dawg's dirty rhymes make them fantasize
I don't dream about pussy cause I get too much
Can't believe that nasty slut didn't let you fuck
But maybe you ain't ready for the skills she got
Non-stop, hit the cot, the bitch still be hot
She's workin tonight, she'll stick to the script
My life is so tight, when hoes flip you tricks
Put a sponge on her pussy and she'll still be wet
Another bitch turned out by my triple X
It's nothin new - I've ran up in a few
Hit the party had the hardest G's cuffin them too
Cause I'm a mack, the whole world knows that
I'm in the house, you better hold your hoes back
Fuck $hort - that's what the bitches thinkin
Put my hand up her dress and her clit was stinkin
I gotta pass!  Pussy smell like ass
So I jumped in my Benz and gave it hella gas
I can't believe you nasty girls tryin to get some
Sit on my shit and give my dick the runs
Like the East coast homies they don't slip son
Too many women in the world, you bound to get one
That slick bitch, dressed her up and played the road
But all my niggas out in Texas say the bitch is throwed
She snort coke, rollin on them triple stacks

Survivin’ the Game,Gettin’ It (Album Number Ten),1996.0,"Yeah Short Dawg in the house
Survivin the game man, it ain't easy when
You out here for uh ten years hanging with the cut-throats
Back stabbers, playa haters y'know what I'm sayin?
But I'm a bitch killa always was, and always will be
If you ain't in the right state of mind don't play with me
Cause they ain't never ended slavery
You fuckin with my freedom, let's keep it real fool
Don't underestimate niggas who'll kill you
Cause everything changed, and everybody got a strap
Don't wanna be attacked keep it on your lap
I'm smobbing in my drop, smiling like Priest
Superfly top down speeding through the streets
Killas on the prowl,and jacking is how
They get paid pull out a gat and break your ass down
Nigga show no fear, but you scared as hell
And your partner riding with you is prepared to tell
But you don't know it yet, you havin hella fun
And when the shit hit the fan and you on the run
You better pray if they catch your homeboy first
Cause if they put him under pressure, he bound to burst
Into a long conversation bout everything you did
No more tusslin, time to do a bid
In the brand new jail that they built for you
Where the smallest little thing you get killed over
(survivin the game)
Ain't to bailin out, you mad as hell
Instead of sending you to school, they pay keep you in jail
That cost way more, when you do time
When you creep through the hood and kill your own kind
They building county jails, and penitentiaries
They gettin ready for the motherfucking 21st century
Computers taking over
, money's obsolete
Now they buying all the houses in the ghetto streets
They way we live now, we can't last long
Cause everyday niggas gettin they blast on
Funerals and court dates, plea bargain for your life
You'll be out in twelve years, once a month see your wife
Now how that sound?
You killed the black man, now they got you locked down
They let you learn a trade, working years for pennies
And that shit you building, was making white man plenty
Got the game fucked up, and you'll never be rich
It's all about respect and they treat you like a bitch
(survivin the game)
I was born with the skills of a black man
To survive in the streets and keep stackin
I'm thirty years old, and far from done
I don't care what you think, I ain't forgot where I'm from
East Oakland / and that's where I learned
Everything I know, and when I got my turn
I never came fake on a microphone
I always let em know that the town is home
I wasn't born in Oakland, I was born a mack
Stay true to the game, always stating the facts
Bitch you can't stop my mack attack
I know you love this shit, when I rap like that
You never would get me to change my style
I spent 20 million dollars on a brand new house
I got bills to pay, no time to be fake
Eating top rump don't fuck with steak
Don't be jealous of me, cause it's well known
I could slip in a minute after hella songs
Make one fake album and I'm through
I be a broke ass nigga like you
So I just try to stay focused and do my job
Turn that shit up loud and watch a bitch head bob
Cause I'm the Too S-H-O-R-T
I take a square ass bitch and turn her into a freak
(survivin the game)
Now growing old in the streets ain't no easy task
Losing homeboys every time the season pass
Gettin phone calls, another soldier dead
Sittin in the car got four in the head
Rush to his mama house the shit is real
Trying to find out why a nigga got killed
I'm about to hurt somebody, give a fuck who
Cause you already know what you need to do
Kill another black man that's what you figure
Just what we need, another dead nigga
Got your guns you don't want none
You stupid motherfucker where they come from
From the white man, get em like fast food
With an attitude to make a nigga blast you
You little violent motherfucker don't play with me
Cause they ain't never ended slavery fuckin with my freedom

She ain't doing shit for a nigga that's broke
But if the money's right, she'll drop and do the splits
She can make a dick disappear like magic
All you gotta do is tell her that you wanna trick
They gon' talk down 'cause she dancing on the pole
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
You could tell she 'bout money when she walk through the door
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'

Closed mouths don't get fed, you better ask for somethin'
God ain't give you all that ass for nothin'

She could walk down the street and cause accidents
She got ass like a half a horse
Make a married man wanna file divorce
I heard she wore a tight dress to the church Sunday
And had the preacher trying to spend all that church money

She ain't doing shit for a nigga that's broke

Probably paid for that ass, is it real as it look?
I just wanna see if it feel like it looks
Spend some money on her, appreciation
She gon' bring her friend with her, initiation
I'ma get some head from 'em, meditation
Then give 'em that dope dick, medication

She ain't doing shit for a nigga that's broke

She been working in the club every day for a year
You need to go back home if you can't get no cash
She give your dirty ass a lapdance and catch a rash
She a hustler, I can't say the same for you
Get a peek at the pussy is what you came to do
You full of shit, keep saying you don't her to dance
You can't be here if you don't come with no bands

Let's go! The fuck up outta here

When I take off I peel out hard
I drive like a maniac
Keep the radio loud, and way in the back
These two hookers - feel the woofers
Don't worry, the cops won't book her
And you ain't gotta tip her
She's a call girl, she ain't no stripper
.. She's a dime

Everyday it's on
When the sun goes down 'til the break of dawn
And when it's 'bout to start
Put the car in park
But don't pull to the side
Go dumb right next to your ride
It's more than a dance, it's a movement
You can tell cause the town be movin
You wanna know if it's worth it right

We so hard when we swervin cars
We serve them hogs when we work them broads
So many pimps we'll turn ya mother

Thick traffic, I'm on the morning news
Fast women, liquor and music
Wearin out tires, quicker than shoes bitch
Fast cars and the best of smoke
Pass that weed I don't mess with coke
.. But I fuck with Hope
She works for the service so I won't go broke
Now watch me serve it
The cops see me swervin
I did two donuts
That's when the OPD rolled up
But I ain't no joke

Until I fuckin grow them old man whiskers, I'ma
Stay on the block like Rocky, I'm papi
Throwin batteries in the sock and rock aqui
Noreaga plus I got my Famous Player card
Himalaya, who the mayor, bitches St. Bernard - shit
Stuck in love, since you got doo-doo
Until I met Good Game and Pimp JuJu
Taught me how to sell mooshu, in a Azuzu
Go hard, thinkin you hard, I'm Monster Cody-ium
At the Hip-Hop Summit, catch 'em at the podium
But yo, you know how that go, gotta make the papes so

Petey Pab', Short Dawg in a low-ride
'Bout to take a trip up to the Eastside
Whattup Nore?  Give your boy half on a ho pie
I love to rock the crowd
Take my shirt off, let my chest bounce around
Got missin for a minute but I'm back now
Time to give some of these sissies here the hush mouth
You've been waitin and anticipatin oh-so-long
Starvin like Marvin for a Petey song
Tired of Carolina bein stepped on, stepped over
Next time, I'mma get the award
Or I'mma beat the nigga ass who won
I ain't gon' wait for the camera to cut
I'ma light him up
Dem jab, right cross, dem uppercut

I'm doin donuts at the light, I ain't got no sense
I drive crazy, cause they can't stop no pimp
On my way to nowhere, drivin hella fast
And everytime I see a cop, I give it hella gas
I swerved doin 40 in a curve
But I whiffed them other suckers still smokin on my herb
Man I got this, now I'm doin 60 on a backstreet
Knowin this hound wants to lick me
She won't give up, I keep goin
You wonder how these old-ass hoes keep hoein
It's the game; that's what I put in these women
From the beginnin to the endin
That's why these old-ass pimps keep pimpin
And these broke-ass hoes be limpin

Domestic Violence,Chase the Cat,2001.0,"It be her friends nigga that's who
It be your bitch friends nigga they be..
Nigga they be all up in your mix nigga
I don't even, ay nigga she don't love you nigga
She just used to you nigga, oh boy!
 + (E-40)
I can't tell but I need to know just how you feel
I can't hold it inside I've got my pride so tell me what's the deal
(What's the deal?)
Is it love, or just could it be, that you're used to me?
(She used to you nigga!)
It's been some time but you're still on my mind
So baby talk to me

You took her she went from the
Ghetto streets, to executive streets electronic beeps
Two-way pagers, Palm 7's, M-11's
Illegal weapons, mesmerized by the dope game
Smith & Wesson's, never went back for seconds
Sprung.. SPRUNG?
Not on yo' dick dick (but what) but on yo' tongue tongue
Jealous (jealous) overprotective (protective)
E'ry chance you get, you slack bruh

Domestic violence, she got you whylin
Do yo' thang, I don't understand how you get mad
Cause you fuck around to beat her ass
And she don't wanna be around you
Now you miss her lil' funky ass breath in the mornin
Call her up, tell her how you want it
To be in love you gotta pay yo' dues
The bitch got you singin the blues, nigga

I can't tell but I need to know just how you feel
I can't hold it inside I've got my pride so tell me what's the deal
Is it love, or just could it be, that you're used to me?
It's been some time but you're still on my mind, so baby talk to me

Domestic violence, that's what they call it
You don't smoke weed and you ain't a alcoholic
Ain't nothin wrong, with bein in love
But you act like a fool when you see her in the club
It's like me and my money, ""Can't Stay Away""
Together, twenty-fo' hours a day
Real love - but can you tell if it's real?
Bitch you better tell me how you feel!

L-U-V, luv (LUV!) Backwards that spells EVIL (evil)
Connivin, triflin ass people (people)
Uhh - kinda soda(?)
Wifebeater tanktop, restrainin order
All up in her kitchen (in her kitchen)
But have you noticed how she fuck different (different)
It ain't the crevice that you wanna shank
It's me - 'Fat Bank Take Little Bank', BEO-EO-ITCH! .. SHEEEAT!


I was in the jun-gle, Marin City
Get some butt she set me up and never let me fuck!
It's about approximately 20 minutes past the hour
I'm in the Eddie Bauer

It's so comfortable, we can't fuck around no mo'
You makin deals, you need to clown that ho
But you forgive her, can't live with her
Can't live without her - but you doubt her

Love (LOVE!) Sometimes spells catastrophe
Elizabeth, Marcia, Daphne
He wanted mo' sex (mo' sex!)
The bitch stole his Rolex (Rolex)

You know why?  The bitch shouldn'ta been trusted
Do you wanna love her, do you wanna fuck the bitch
Makes no difference, handle yo' business
If it ain't love, then what the fuck is this?",https://genius.com/Too-short-domestic-violence-lyrics
Paystyle,Cocktails,1995.0,"Aww hell nah nigga
We ain't doin no freestyles
Don't even know how to do that shit
*chuckling*
Yeah whatevah
Check it out man, check this one out
I been rappin for half my life
I'm twenty-eight now sayin pass the mic
If you eighteen or nineteen speak up fool
I was born on the mic before you went to school
Talkin bout pimp shit, you know whassup
I wonder if you mom'll let you play that stuff
Now you're flowin like your name is water
But I'm ten years older and my game is harder
I'm not tryin to say you're out there dissin
I'm just tryin to say lil nigga listen
Before you grab the mic and act wild
Bitin on the next nigga's mackin style
And it's all from head, passin round the mic
Never even care who you sounded like
Sound like Snoop Dogg, then you switched to Treach
Bit the Pharcyde then A Tribe Called Quest
And you gots no respect for me, is that right?
Well jump your ass on the train witcha backpack tight
And keep rappin, I'm floatin past all the stops
In a clean ass Benz I have all the props
Fuck credit from a rapper can you match my Visa
I heard your girlfriend was a real dick pleaser
And a Too $hort fan, faithfully
When I came to your town she couldn't wait to see me
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
Let me tell you somethin bout a nigga named Short
Rappers always talk about the way I can't flow
But let me hit the mall with the same MC's
I be signin autographs, spend a gang of G's
While you walkin round broke, nobody knows ya
Lookin like you smoked a whole sack of doja
Outside in the parking lot in front of the cars
Standin in a circle with some wannabe stars
Freestylin, but you ain't original
You just shootin everything and you pimpin hoes
And to think you could hang with me
I never would spit this game for free
I'm the T-double-O, S-H, O-R-T
I rock all stages and any parties
Any my style is gettin bank
Gettin head, gettin hella dank
I drop my top when it's hot and sunny
So how you talk shit when you ain't havin no money
I set trends in the rap game bitch
And gives a fuck when other rappers talk shit
I know you motherfuckers, heard me rap
So hard, I put your momma in my dirty rap
No shit, the old bitch sucked a damn good dick
Put them legs up high she couldn't handle it
I'm not a no good punk, I coulda macked your mother
But Life is Too $hort, so I kept it undercover
Now you're all grown up, with your partners rappin
But old Short Dawg'll your ass what happened
To a fake MC, who tried to get with me
I ended his career, instantly
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
Now let's compare the lifestyles, of me and you
You're phony and I'm all about bein true
You drive a bucket, that you bought for a G
I ride around snuffin them fo'-eighteens
In the back of a motherfuckin big ass truck
Jump two rows back and get my dick sucked
Benzos, Lexus, Rolex and Caddy
Fine lil bitches havin sex with Daddy
I ain't givin no bitch, no kind of slack
You got one girl then treat the ho like a mack
What's yours is hers, she don't trip
Sucker ass nigga need to check that bitch
But you're so weak, and it shows in your rap
I'm out here, gettin hoes livin fat
While you at home, gettin sweated by your mamma
I bought my mother a house in Atlanta
And you can't stand it, so whaddayou say
Too $hort can't rap, no fuckin way
But here I am, workin in the studio
And your album ain't out because you're movin slow
By the time you make one I'll be on ten
Hit the studio nigga, and do it again
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
Now ask New York, can Too $hort flow
Ask Detroit, they'll let them niggas know
Then ask Philly, can I rap
South side of Chicago, who's the mack?
I never ever tripped on the shit that you spit about me
Everytime I perform, I make a lot of G's
Cause I'm paid for this motherfuckin rap shit
Eatin good like a motherfuckin fat bitch
Every single day at the house what's wrong wichu
Eatin fast food if you only knew
I understand though, cause I been there befo'
Eat any damn thing and got nowhere to go
Daydreams, about bein great
It all started back when I was sellin tapes
In eighty-two eighty-three eighty-fo' on up
Waitin still waitin just to blow on up
And when it happened, I still had to wait
I didn't get paid til eighty-eight
I made nine albums in nine years
I'm a true blue West coast pioneer
Dr. Dre, Ice-T, and all the rest
All that money we makin don't fault the West
Cause we ain't the ones who created rap
But when we made the shit, we made it fat
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin

Dont ya know, Dont ya know
Its Cali-O, Its Cali-O, Yeah
This hit ain't no joke, This here ain't no joke
Dont ya know, Sweet Cali-O

Its that Orangutan lookin' like a Crayola
Nothin' but the sunshine, Soon as the day's over
Roll'em up, In the town, We get down
On the green and the purple, Never on the brown
Cause when ya hit the O its the real dope, From Humbolt
Have ya flyin' real stupid like Dumbo
They love it when it comes from California
You'll never be an +Outkast+ with that +Stankonia+

Smell the aroma, Smells so lovely
Man thats potent, What ya'll smokin man?, Orange Ruffie
Where ya from, You from the Yay, Im from the Valley J
Man ya'll some fools, You California dudes do not play
I though you thoughtamajig, I though I told you my nagga
Game colder than a six pack of soda my nagga
Northren Cali, 23's on my Denali
Gettin rowdy in the Scrillacon Valley
Hoe

This hit ain't no joke, Oh joke
Dont ya know, Dont ya know
Its Cali-O, Its Cali-O, Yeah
This hit ain't no joke, This here ain't no joke

Dont ya know, Yeah
Love it when I twist it, Dont ya know

The Valley Joe

Know it when you smell it, Hit it, Enhale the blow
Got zips from Cali-O, Niggas call it the dro
When I'm in for a show first hit up the store
Four boxes to the neck, Alcohol to follow
Get it on fa sho, Every zone I go
Tip toe to the door, Room 3-0-4
Put that town down-lo, Its that Town endo
Guarenteed, No seeds, In your town we'll blow

Now homie tell me what that yay like
Livin that Bay Life
We put it up in the air, From sundown to daylight
And the girls they be lovin' it, Cause it freeze on em
That Cali-O sensation lets us squeeze up in em
Its a whole 'notha mind state, A way of livin
That playalistic feelin' gives you the vibes of a villian
Help ya focus, And I was gone when I wrote this
Just trippin on that Cali-O, Its known to be the dopest


Its been 10 years since I moved from Oakland
I traveled everywhere but theres nobody smokin
Like the Bay and LA, From San Diego up Seattle's way
Ain't no shake like a rattlesnake, That Budwiser make ya get smart
You say you went to San Francisco and left your heart
But dont leave that orange sunshine on the coast
I know that you think the green and the purple is the most
Out in Cali you get choices
One hit will have you hearin angel's voices
Make you wanna fly, And catch the next plane to the West
So you can fill your brain with the best
Now Mary Jane was a small town girl
But Cali-O, She's been all around the world
She'll make the coldest player go broke
You dont hear me though, That Cali-O ain't no joke",https://genius.com/Too-short-cali-o-lyrics
Back Back,Pimpin’ Incorporated,UnKnown,"We got a new dance (ay let's see it)
It's called the Back Back (let's see it)
Let's do it baby
Back Back (back back) Back Back (back back)
Back Back (back back) Back Back (back back)
When I walked in the door first thing I saw
Was you drinkin at the bar, doin it all
Dancin like I never seen it done before
You don't need a dance partner on the floor
You just bounce that ass like it's goin out of style
Love the way the music sound, goin hella wild
Another time, another zone
It's like yo' ass got a mind of it's own
It keeps sayin I don't wanna be alone
We need to swap numbers, I'll call you later on
And since I made your favorite song
It's alright tonight, don't do a player wrong
Your booty goes on and on
You could stand still and it won't be long
Before it moves, I love the way your panties shake
I heard your booty got banned in twenty states
 + (Too $hort)
BACK BACK! (Girl you 'bout to hurt somebody)
BACK BACK! (On the dance floor workin the party)
(That Lil' Jon beat got her freakin again)
(That's how her momma used to dance on that Seagram's gin)
BACK BACK! (That booty cain't stop)
BACK BACK! (Can you make it drop?)
(They been shakin like that since the 80's)
(Man they ain't never gon' stop, are you crazy?)

Even when you sit in a chair, you still keep bouncin
Put it right here and I will be pouncin
Watch how I slide on up
I might need a saddle, to ride that butt
Girl you think it's wide enough?
Can I plug it in the wall, and light it up?
Does it come with an instruction manual?
Can I twist yo' knobs while I touch yo' handles?
Can I see you do it booty butt-naked?
Back Back, girl you too wild you gon' break it
Damn! I thought it was mine
But my dick belongs to you since you started to grind
I see why they call it a crime
A woman like you is hard to find
The way you twerk that junky, make it funky
Cain't take this from me girl shake that monkey!
 w/ minor variations

Damn baby, how you move like that?
Is it the music or the way that I do my rap?
I wanna sick my dog, on yo' cat
Cause I love the way you do the Back Back
Just bounce that ass 'til you cain't no mo'
'Til your cheeks start to sag and you can't go low
When your arthritis kicks in at 44
Keep shakin that ass like a ho
20 years from now she'll still get down
And booty shakin music'll still be around
It's a family tradition, cain't let it die
You saw that ass shake, that's how he met his wife
I'm up all night, me and my whole crew
Don't hate cause it's late when I roll through
In the middle of the night, tryin to get in your mind
I'ma wiggle in tight and I'ma hit from behind
So Back Back! - Whoa, did you see that mayne?
Girl stop playin don't change a thang
Watchin you dance I almost came
The way you shakin that ass is insane
I, cain't believe my eyes
I can see from the rear what's between your thighs
Took two steps back and realized
Yo' ass is a real prize

Back Back!
Let me slap that ass, let me slap that ass
Back Back!  yo' ass
Shorty move that shit, ass hit like this
Ass so quick make that booty wanna split",https://genius.com/Too-short-back-back-lyrics
Don’t Ever Give Up,Chase the Cat,2001.0,"Yeah you know, we always tryin to get this money, that's what we do
It ain't easy.. but I'm tellin you, it ain't hard either
All you gotta do is keep hustlin man, don't ever give up
I don't care what it is, handle yo' biz
Forget about the woulda, coulda, and if I did's
Cause that's just the past, you know it never lasts
And you know how time flies by so fast
Look at rap music, they said it was a fad
But now it's takin over, and I'm so glad
Cause I never stopped rappin, but that's what I do
If you quit yo' thang, you might never find the truth
I had choices in life, I coulda did somethin else
I did what I wanted to, I did it for myself
Now whatcha gon' do with yo' life
People try to tell you what to do, it's yo' life
You better make the most of it, live to the fullest
Think positive and don't dwell on the BULLSHIT
I can't tell you no better
If you thinkin 'bout quittin, don't ever

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up, you just cain't!

Comin up is hard, givin up is easy
You always get the game from your homey Too Sheezy
I keep it so real, never spit it false
I hope you make it big and if you ever fall off
Remember these words, it's only what you make it
Anything is possible you want it better take it
I ain't talkin 'bout stealin, felonies'll ruin it
Stupid all I'm talkin 'bout is takin opportunities
Doors open up and when you get another chance
Either hold up the wall, or get out there and dance
It's on you, do what you wanna do
You know why everybody always punkin you
Talkin shit they know you're bluffin, won't do nothin
Sittin on the shelf like Stove Top Stuffin
I know you had enough and want to call it quits
Believe me, this ain't it


Isn't hard to see, use your eyes
It's time to tell the truth, cause we through witcha lies
Utilize all your steppin stones, gotta be prepared
Sittin 'round dreamin how you bout to be a player
The years and the time fly, you ain't even workin
Went by overnight you went from 18 to 30
Nothin goin on, never set a goal
Dreams can't come true, and now you gettin old
You start to represent, everything you hate
But don't give up, cause it's never too late
All you need is a plan, a purpose and a model
And quit livin life like you 'bout to hit the lotto
Get rich on your own, buy a new home
Keep your real friends, leave them haters alone
I see you when you get there, rollin to the bank
I know you cain't let go, I know you cain't
 (minus first ""don't"")

Nah we can't give up, gotta keep hustlin for life baby

Do you want me the same way I want you?
I like you so much baby but I won't touch
Until you say it's time to leave here and go fuck
You do it so right I could never say it's wrong
I like the way you act when they play your favorite song
You scream out loud, start dancin' hella wild
Girl right now I wanna pull your panties down
Fuck you real good down low on the flo'
Fuck you on the stage like we puttin' on a show
Fuck you in the stall in the men's bathroom
Outside in the car, we can do that too
I'll drive you to the house, dick sucked gettin' head
Play with your pussy then fuck you in the bed
After all that fuckin' I'ma fall asleep in it
Wake up in the mornin' and fuck you in the kitchen

Girl I like it when you do it like that
I like the way you shake and you bounce that back
I like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat
I'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack
I like it when them cheeks jump up and down
I like it when you drop and make it touch the ground
You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that

I know you with your man, other niggas gon' stare
I don't really care, I'm a motherfuckin' player

Got a dance so cold, I swear it be snowin'
Even though it's hella hot in here, everybody sweatin' you
Half wanna dance, other half wanna get with you
Every time a nigga walk by and say hello
Starin' at your booty 'cause it moves like jello
Now I'm really feelin' like you need my service
Jealous boyfriend, I can see him gettin' nervous
You don't even notice 'cause you doin' your thang
Shouldn't have came here with him, you knew he couldn't hang
I love the view, but that just ain't enough
I can hear it beepin' like you backin' up a truck
You need a special permit to operate that ass
I'ma hit it right girl and make it last

You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that

It's on once again, come and roll with a pimp
I ain't mad at ya girl, get your money, go and strip
Extra shots of Patr-n just in case you wanna sip
Smokin' grapes, pay security so they won't trip
The way you're dancin', how ya move your body so swift
Ass big enough to hold a glass with no coaster
Seen a little bit of cash now you're movin' closer
If you wanna we can leave from here and go somewhere
(That's right) It ain't nothin 'cause I'm into that
I'm tryin' to see if me, you and your girlfriend can interact
Treat 'em like drinks, if they ain't right then I send 'em back
Gotta be jazzy, can't have the shoes without the bag (Dolla)

I wanna send a special shoutout
To all the females with the matchin' bags, purses, shoes
All the accessories... I like that shit

Hey,No Trespassing,2012.0,"Hey

If you ain't busy later on, I'mma play a new song
You could sing along, and if you say it's too long
I'mma put the tip in -- it won't go too deep
I'm sure it's everything you always hoped it would be
Last year, the time wasn't right for us
But now, I can't fight the lust
I wanna be all alone with you
So we can do everything the song says to

Walk up and kiss my shoulder
Whisper something sweet in my ear
Tell me, boy, that I need to know
Promise I never bore ya
Got that special place for ya
Can you be the reason I grow

Got a stress-free zone when you wanna come see me
Got a honeycomb hideout -- wanna come meet me?
Cause I feel you tingling in my bones
Cause I love when your number go across my phone

Take a little sip, have a little smoke
Listen to the music and take it real slow
Ain't no rush, we waited this long
For the moment, the right day to get it on
I see it in your eyes, you're surprised
Never would have thought I would be this size
I'm in between your thighs, now you realize
This is what we doing for the rest of our lives

Me and my dude used to fight about it
All night I knew something wasn't right about it
That's why you can't settle in with anybody
So now I'm cool
Didn't call, trying to keep a low on the drama
Unfinished business, so I know I'm glad I found ya
Plus I'm a big girl and I wanna show what I can do


What's up, baby? I wanna fuck with you
I wanna hold you close and touch you too
Back then, we ain't have much to do
But things change, and now we stuck like glue
Used to love him, now you don't trust that dude
You with me every day, so it must be true
It's the game -- can't be real without it
If you choose it, tell me how you feel about it

I want you in my zone now, baby come see me
On my way to the hideout
Won't you please hold me close
Take everything but my business just to fuck with you",https://genius.com/Too-short-hey-lyrics
Go $hort Dog,The Pimp Tape,2018.0,"15 million, SoundScan
Let me think back, how it began
It was Ice Cube, me and Eazy-E
Produced Kid Rock and took him on tour with me (Yeah, yeah)
I worked with B.I.G., worked with 2Pac
With me and Pimp C, pimpin' don't stop (It's pimpin')
Ask Jay-Z, ask T.I.P
Ask-ask Scarface, Bushwick or Willie D (Geto Boys)
I worked with all them niggas, I moved down south
Lil Jon and Jazze Pha know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Me and JD, that's Jermaine Dupri
In the studio with 8Ball and MJG
My nigga MC Breed, I fuck with you
Real niggas nationwide around the country, dude
A lot of underground shit that never came out
You mothafuckas know what my name's about

Benzes, Maserati
I done had every kind of big body
On ""Rapper's Ball,"" I was talkin' twenties
That was '97, you wasn't even in your twenties (Youngsta)
I've been ballin', been a real pimp
Same year I did ""Call Me"" with Lil Kim
Custom swimming pools, with my name in 'em
Why? I'm always swimmin' in your main women

Go $hort Dog, give 'em what they want

I had a million dollar deal before you heard of one
75 Girls, bitch, I was havin' fun

Bad mouth mothafucka, like to rap when I cuss
Sellin' tapes (Cassette tapes), sayin', ""Fuck you, bitch""
Goddamn, asshole, mothafucka, I'm rich (Uh)
They said I'd never make it like that
But 30 years later bitch, I'm still havin' scratch (Gettin' money)
Ex-wives, mommas too (Your momma)
Little sisters, aunties, they all got screwed (Yeah, I fucked 'em)
I fucked 'em all, and didn't give a fuck

What She Gonna Do?,Married to the Game,2003.0,"It's just a little mo' game (ye-yeah ye-yeah)
You might need to learn some (make me say ohh)
Listen and learn (Yeahh-yeahhhhh)

She's all about that get rich
Treat a nigga like the lotto, he's a quick pick
... it's nothin to a boss bitch
What happened to his cash flow?  He lost it
She don't give a fuck about none of you guys
She make you look so bad, I bet you want a disguise
I knew the day and time would come
When she went out in the world and had to find her one
He sponsors all her daily, activities
I'm not her pimp, she don't pay me or give me fees
I just laced her with the game, so she could shake those lames
And try to take her change, I told her make yo' name
And turn the tables on 'em, I call her DJ Break-a-Trick
Cause all your money she'll be takin it
Put her on the pedestal, your queen on the throne
And she's still gon' bring the money home

(Make me say ohh) What she gon' do?
(Ye-yeah ye-yeah) What she gon' do?
(Make me say ohh) What she gon' do?
Players better ask a bitch - bitch whatchu gon' do?
(I'll be the one to come runnin - be the one to come runnin)
(Ohh, home to you.. home to you)
(You're givin me - loooooooooooove, with a nigga like you)
(It's no need to play around, ohhhhhhh)
(You're more than just big pimpin)
(You're blowin my mind with the love that you're givin)
(That's what you'll hear me say, boy every dayyyyyyyy)

I knew she had potential, to be a real player
Get paid up the ass by a millionaire
She ain't tradin sex, like these broke hoes
Her shit is worldwide, these bitches loco
She took the show on the road, for the fun and the thrills
Now it's nothin but hundred dollar bills
She got a lot of G's, spend 'em how you please
All you broke-ass hoes, get up off yo' knees
Don't go to Ho College if you want some mo' knowledge
Cause bitches graduate and end up with fo' dollars
You can be a hustler, and never be a baller
He tried to bread her up whenever he would call her
But the bitch was too dumb, to ask for a thang
I try to teach 'em when they young, so they don't pass on the game
And when you get your thang on
Remember where you got your game and where you came from


It's obvious, we don't come from the same world
But you still fell in love with the game girl
Now you're, dedicated since you elevated
And you, you never hated, just celebrated
You can't play with the game, you gotta go get it
It's fire - stop drop and then roll with it
Let a baller finance your brand new car
And if he can't do more, you better kick him out the door pimpin
Tell him how you like diamond rings
So fine, that's why he wanna buy you things
Now you spendin and shoppin, like you playin a sport
Cause you listened to the game that you got from Uncle $hort
I'm proud of you - what you grown to be
Don't tell him nothin - you always belong to me
You can travel the world and get your stack on
Just don't be broke when you come back home

Players are the real, it's time to go
If you don't understand I'll let you know
Players are the people who just can't stand
Having one woman and just one man
Players are the ones who always see
Players are the ones that you always meet
Couldn't fall in love, even if you tried
Couldn't be devoted unless you lied
It's the players in the world to the west you play
Fresh young tenders every day
Breaking hearts every time your love is real
Players say love just ain't the deal
But the old and wise couldn't tell you why
Players just don't live happy lives
So all you fake wanna be's I hope you hear

Parties all going and players come
Sometimes in 3's sometimes in 2's
Fresh ball point pens, ready to use
It all makes sense, maybe it doesn't
Players just always use that lutten
Give it up everyday when the players play
Just don't act snoty when the players say
What's your name and number let me get my pen
Do you have any sisters too and that's to Kim
Cuz I rap to Kim, and that's the truth
And right now I gotta go rap for you

Your life is at best when you lose control
Taking love from the way you know you told
You could love so much, just give you time
Your nothing but a player don't say your mine
Cause the way I love, is not your type
Trying to get everything you can for life
Too bad you don't know what I think you should

Your a player, baby, the real McCoy

Now you wanna tell me, I'm the one
And all I wanna do is just have some fun

Don’t Act Like That,Married to the Game,2003.0,"Why you wanna treat me


I was raised to cope with life
Make my own choices and hope I'm right
It's uphill all the way for me
I ain't goin' down or slowin' down don't play me G
I'm not the child of a millionaire born to be rich
Don't have a trust for the lust for one I get a bitch
So quick and all the stuff we have
Make her jealous girlfriends lust for cash
But fuck 'em cuz while we on a whole different level
They still be sleepin' on the floor in the ghetto
And when they realize how you came up
Them hoes can't say nothin' cuz the game is rough

{Why you wanna treat me like that?}
Cuz you don't know how to act when you're dealin' with a mack
{Why you gotta be like that?}
I ain't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{Just want you to love me back}
I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that you should've stuck a knife in my back

Now bitch I don't slang no crack
I can't go back to rappin' in my cango hat
You wanna put a little game on that?
How lame is that?
You fuckin' with the same ol' rats
We all have ups and downs
You're stuck with frowns and don't make a fuckin' sound
But let a nigga hit the lotto
Pop some bottles and tell everybody you got 'em
Now I done been on both sides of the mountain
For the bottom to the top and back down again
And all the way I give a ho a fit
Not to wear it but to ??? little lonely bitch
You cryin' like a baby need a pacifier
You (pass a fly?) watchin' life pass you by
You couldn't make it to the top in an elevator
You think I want a sorry bitch?
Never player


You're like a little baby with a shitty butt
You city sluts they say you can't get it up
And then they say you're way too hyper
Game is lighter need someone to change your diaper
But don't stop just give it all you got
Till you're hot even if you slang dope and get caught
It's like goin' platnium and gettin' dropped
You don't get no money you get props
But you're not cuz you're really just dreamin'
I'm leavin'
I keep these fake hoes steamin'
They screamin'
She better face those demons
It's fuck season
Don't waste my evenin'
I believe him when he said the end was near
It's in the air a whole lot of pimps in here
I can't (com)pare cuz I've been mackin' twenty four years
But since you wanna go there bitch I really don't care

{Why you wanna treat me like that?}
Bitch don't know how to act when she's dealin' with a mack
{Why you gotta be like that?}
I can't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{Just want you to love me back}
Bitch I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that bitch stuck a knife in my back

It's like that
That's why I treat you like that
{Don't act like that}
Bitch x2
{Why you wanna act like that?}
(Get) the fuck on
{Baby please don't act like that}
{Oh no}
Better learn the rules of the game

It’s All Good,Get In Where You Fit In,1993,"""Man, this bitch blowing my beeper up""

Ready to put a hole up in one of these bitches, man
Sup? Guess you wondered where I was at
When you beeped me last night and I didn't call back
Supposed to be there, meet you at the house at 9
You made a candlelight dinner just to wine and dine
And I didn't even show up
You beeped me 20 million times, made my beeper blow up
Thought you shot me to the left cause I'm a D-O-G
But you called so I guess it's still cool for me
To get freaky, you know I got that git back
I come right when I hit that
And if you tell me right now it's cool today
As soon as I'm through I be on my way

Do I look like the type of lady
That'll talk to a brother that's shady, hell no
But you can wine and dine me
Spend a little time with me, it's all good
Cause I love the way you take me
Ooh boy you shake me, when we lay down
Got my head spinning around

I need a woman that's down for me
Always on my side, not my enemy
We could be gangsters, lovers, parents, or friends
But whatever we do, do it straight to the end
We'll make love like professionals
You and me baby, fuck the rest of them hoes
You know how much we like being together
Seems like every second, it's getting wetter
So good I wish it'd last forever
Cause it would never get no better than this
I know you feel the same
Moaning so loud all the neighbors complained
And all the people tried to tell you I was phony
Talking all that junk and don't even know me
Last night I was chilling at the club
Chilling with my potnas when your friends rolled up
Flirting with your nigga behind your back
They called you on the phone and told you where I was at
Your girlfriends trying to run your world
You'd better stop listening to them other girls

Never cared about those other girls
It's something about the way you rock my world
Even though you make me cry
I still wait alone for you at night, but it's all good

I couldn't come home last night cause I was out making money
But I'll come home tonight if you want me
Cause you sure looking good today
I take you to your house and let you have it your way

Oooh boy, ohhhh, it's all good, it's all good to me, baby

I just keep on fucking you all night long
Me and you baby got it going on
You ain't tripping every time you see me
You get loose and you get so freaky
I never meant to break your heart
You gave it all to me and I tore it apart
Talked about love right to the end
But I'm a tell you like it is, I'll never do it again
I'm from East Oakland, I'm an ice-cold player
Born to Mack and got women everywhere
I got one up in E.P.A
And two down in South Central L.A
One in Frisco, and one in Berkeley
Got a few Southern girls just to work me
Is that what you wanted to hear?
That your man is the player of the year?
I need a woman that's down for me
Always on my side, not my enemy
We could be gangsters, lovers, parents, or friends
But whatever we do, do it straight to the end
I said the very same thing in the beginning
We played the game but it's in the 9th inning
You'd better wake up and smell the dank
It really don't seem to be what you think, beyotch
I'm all about getting my bank
You be the car and I'll fill your tank
Cause nothing don't come for free
Unless your ass don't want to be with me, beyotch

Boy, have you been listening?
I can't let you go since I know what I'm missing
And can you fell it in my touch
That I want you so much, and it's all good
It's all good, baby
I'm trying to tell you boy, that it's good
It's all good, it's all good, baby baby baby
Ohhh, like that baby, like that
It's all good, it's all good
It's all good, it's all good",https://genius.com/Too-short-its-all-good-lyrics

Give up the pussy, give up the head
Drop yo panties and rub your clit
Do the splits, rub your tits

So give it up to me straggla
Fuck the cheese and bragger
Before I knock her out, beat her down and drag her
Cause niggas be takin the pussy
Just give it up to me bitch
Don't fight it
The last bitch that tried it, don't fight it
I'm just like a bloodhound
You lick my balls and give me a rub down
You want me to eat your pussy, but you stank bitch
Go scrub down
I get up inside the pussy, spend my day in it
Lay in it, play in it
Wake up and go to sleep and still stay in it
Imagine my dick's the basketball
Yo pussy is the basket
I'm a dunk, smell the room it stunk bitch
Cause you gave up the funk


Now as I slde on this track, I won't be dissin no bitches

So bare witness as I spit this
Shit that give you the mumps, cause it bumps so tremendously
And niggas be knowin they flowin up tigh as they pretend to be

Some niggas front, but I can't
I'm sippin tough on the drink
And makin barrels of bank
Yeah, so niggas save that punk shit
I'm comin with that funk shit
See that's how I was raised and my real niggas want this
So nut up or keep walkin
And shut the fuck up when grown folks is talkin nigga
Before you get your back broke
Now what you wanna fuck with a Oakland city mack for?
The place you can trip on
Where the niggas be mackin, stealin, killin and pimpin to get they crip on
And take it to the next phase
We goin city to city, leavin hoes in a daze
That's why they call me bad ass
Cause I be puttin boogers on bitches and fartin loud with my fat ass
But yo, I gets paid for that
And its a fact I was strictly just made to mack
So what the fuck you know about me
A loked out, funky ass pimpin OG
Fool, you can open your eyes but you can't see
I just gave up the funk, now I'm O-U-T",https://genius.com/Too-short-giving-up-the-funk-lyrics
Paula & Janet,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"Bitch! That's a trademark
I was at my house not doing anything
Half past ten I heard the phone ring
When I picked it up, I said ""Hello?""
The bitch spoke up and said ""What's up ho?""
I said, ""Bitch, if you're fine it's my dick""
Enough playing, who the fuck is this?
She said ""Janet"" I said ""Oh""
Met the bitch last week at my show
I told her ""Call me"" and I gave her my card
She talked dirty and my dick got hard
That night I fucked the bitch three times straight
Next night we made another date
I gave a concert and she came backstage
Fuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid
But that pussy squeezed tighter than a vice grip
Fucked around and met this other bitch
Right out the back I told her ""Bitch let's go""
Took the bitch to my limo even though
Her friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh
She told her friend they fuck the best
Rushed the bitch to the back seat
She pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me
She said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out
Took my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth
She kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it
The limo door opened, it was Janet
She jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit
I kicked back and let 'em have this dick
I told the driver ""Take me straight home""
Then called my partner on the car phone
I said ""I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch""
Come to my house and don't even trip
He came over and we served the hoes
Fucked the bitches like gigalos
Paula and Janet will make you wet in your pants
But to me, they're just two more tramps
With some good ass motherfucking pussy, no shit
Short Dog's in the motherfucking house and I ain't even tripping, bitch",https://genius.com/Too-short-paula-and-janet-lyrics
Tell the Feds,Def Jam’s Rush Hour Soundtrack ,UnKnown,"Intro:
And it don't stop to the beat, baby
Funky Fresh on the microphone
One time for your mind, beeyatch (Beeyatch)
Short Dogg's in the motherfuckin house
Doin what we always do, a stack
(Gettin money) Gettin money (Gettin money)
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Fuck a secret indictment, all I do is write shit)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(You got the wrong rappers, nigga you better tell em!!)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Tell em Short, tell em!!!)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(OOOOOHHHHH!!!!!)
Verse One:
You broke the law, and you got caught
Got a good lawyer, case is bein fought
Life is full of choices, make em at the crossroads
If you had five, you already lost four
Straight apprehended, handcuffed and can't stand it
Don't wanna go to jail but you was caught redhanded
A felony, strike number two
Federal Agents like, ""What you wanna do?""
Make a choice, so you start to think back
Short Dogg was a nigga that always rapped
Half my life ago, didn't sell no dope
I sold dope fiend music for your stereo
Sittin at the crossroads in '84
I knew hella motherfuckers that was slangin coke
Use to tell my homeboys, front me a sack
Postin me at the dopehouse dumpin the crack
My niggas wouldn't do it, I love em for that
Cos now I still rap and get paid to gat
Since '87, that's how the shit comes
We made two hundred thousand in six months
Sellin tapes not cakes, cheques kept comin
Fuck buyin *?boats?*, niggas makin hundreds
Legit, you think I'm stupid, bitch
I bought a studio so I can do this shit
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(You got it twisted, Bridget
Why pressin charges when I'm depressin hard and shit)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Run tell em, tell em Short, tell em)
Verse Two:
I used to sell weed in high school, smoked the profit
I never sold *?company due?*, I can't knock it
Cos the inner city public school system is fucked
Go to class all day, you ain't gettin enough
So at 3:15 it's time to put in work
Buy you some dope and go hit the turf
Ain't no scholarship, no rap contract
But a nigga get paid sellin hop and crack
I got lucky, it's not a get-rich scheme
I've been sellin rap tapes since I was 15
I told the Oakland police, too many times
I make a lot of money doin pimp rhymes
I never sell drugs to jeopardise my freedom
You never could make me realise I need em
I went from hundreds, to hundreds to thousands, to millions
I know what police want, I feel em
I'm always ballin right there in the hype
Instantly, dope dealer stereotype
But shit is serious, I know I never sold drugs
So why these motherfuckers tryin ta roll me up?
And smoke me, why? No one knows
The only thing I did wrong was fuck all ya hoes
I don't smoke coke blunts and sho' don't sell em
Call the FBI, somebody please tell em
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(All you motherfuckers is lookin at us rock jewelery and shit
That's all you are)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Somebody better tell em we got receipts)
Verse Three:
Rap is brand new, not long ago
Made a billion dollars last year round the globe
Now all the little kids can't let it go
To the new millenium with a brand new flow
Too $hort baby straight from the O
If you're like me, you're tryin ta make some doe
Roll to the spot and try ta break a ho
Pimp her real hard and then take it slow
When I rap to a bitch, I'm a pro
I spit this game like never befo'
Grab the microphone and always rock the show
Then I grab me a freak, tell her ""Keep it on the low""
If I take her to my house she won't say no
I burn rubber with the bitch in my fo'-fifty-fo'
California niggas drop the top and roll
Stare up at the mountains, won't see no snow
I go coast to coast smokin indo
If my bitch actin up, I fuck her friend so
Don't investigate me for sellin dope
If you see me rollin clean thru the ghetto
I'm probably on my way to the studio
Probably playin somethin loud on the stereo
Short Dogg, don't forget the funk motto:
'Free your mind and your ass will follow'
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(We're up y'all in this motherfuckin holdin tank for hidin snitch ass
Niggas)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Nigga, I was promoted a tour of Kentucky nigga, and D.C.)
Outro: Slink Capone
Pop this shit, be outta state, niggas is hella fake
Moms ain't mess with the motherfuckin phone
My girl, she's fuckin up, god damn!
Nigga you better stop all that motherfuckin snitchin
Tell them motherfuckers we ain't runnin no motherfuckin coke factory
Tell em, tell em!! TELL EM!!!
YOU BETTER TELL EM!!!!

(The Mekanix)

What you know about The Delinquents?
Oakland niggas hella wild, what you think, bitch?
I'm from the East but the West is hard
I'll leave The Town and come fuck with the rest of y'all
'Cause anywhere I touch down in the Bay
We really pimpin', nigga, we don't play
In North Richmond or East Palo Alto
Go to Berkeley or out to the Valley-Joe
I hit the scene, everybody be watchin'
Four 15's, my speakers be knockin'
I'm gettin' all the bitches, I got hoes galore
I know you got bitches, but I got more
If the bitch got game, I don't care
All these out of town niggas want a bitch from here
He fell in love with my old prostitute
The game is cold, and she was too hot for you
When I fuck, I treat 'em all like sluts
I got her legs on my shoulders, I'm all in her guts
I keep a top notch, I'm never alone
If I'm not with a bitch, I'm on the microphone
In the lab, rappin' on a Rick Rock beat
Or maybe Ant Banks, or E-A-Ski
It's The Mekanix, so you can't hate
Hella bass, it's the old Too $hort tape
I got bitches, you only got that one
Her little boy? No, he's not your son
He calls you daddy, but can't you see?
That little nigga looks just like me
I don't take her to dinner, we don't see no movies
We don't drink no wine, we don't be in jacuzzis
Ain't no cupcakin', fuck that square shit
Ain't no innocent nights, I'm a player, bitch
I want them hundred dollar bills, you know I do
Don't ask like this the first time I pimped on you
Bitch, I smashed a long time ago
I like to turn out bitches then I rhyme some more
You like all my songs, you love my beats
That's all you wanna do, is ho for me
Be my number one bitch, my main thang
But I can never have one, that's that lame game
Fuck Rated R, bitch, I'm triple X
And fuck you, too, I don't stress no sex
Don't try to fall in love in my house
If we was married, I'd pimp my spouse
I'm never gon' change my ways
Keep thinkin' that shit, that's just how I was raised
I ain't no thief, I won't steal your bitch
I got the gift, I'm just like Philthy Rich
You can't say shit, the bitch chose
Hopped out the Chevy and jumped in the Rolls
She from the Bay, are you insane?
She loves pimps, the bitch got too much game
They said, ""$hort, you get her hooked
You gave her that heroin dick and then shook""
I was too rude, so she got a new dude
You wanna marry her? Then you a fool
'Cause I got her dickmatized in a deep trance
Butt ass naked in a freaky stance
When I'm around, everything goes down
If she was yours, the bitch is my ho now
The only way she's yours is if her name is Sharon
'Cause all that lovin' and carin'
It ain't gon' make her faithful only to you
She's your main one but her favorite number is two

You don't know nothin' about this Town shit, bitch
You don't know nothin' about Mistah F.A.B., bitch

But yall can't be talkin bad about broads, man, you know?
Yall in here talkin bout ""suckin this"" and ""suckin that""
Aww shit, here come B pullin up in his 600 blowin big weed, yall be cool man
Verse 1: B-Legit/Too $hort
B-Legit:
I blaze blunts all day get keyed all night
Be the one to take flight if the smoke ain't right
I'm tight, nicknamed Ike for the drama
It's baby and her mama, naked in a sauna
Down with the gang cuz them flows be hard
Blue mink, Short, and my St. Brenard
Super bad man all around Hoo-J
Tell me what the fuck happened to the groupies
Too $hort:
What happened to the groupies, I thought they was comin through
To do everything we want em to
Supposed to be all good when they get here
Break niggas off, bitch we real playas
Baby in the red said ""It's coo'""
She gonna give me some pussy, and some head too
I ain't trippin though, these bitches takin too long
I'm bout to call some other hoes on the phone
B-Legit:
Tell em I'm a hog nigga, need a triple-X bitch down to stick
Turn tricks switched the dick
Theres hips outside and I'm fo' sho' dat
And the finest ho she know where mo' at
Gotta show that, nigga tuck my jewels
Can't be slippin with a bitch, niggas know that shit
Hit me at the room when the hoes come
It be at 301 we callin for some
Too $hort:
Where they at B-Legit where they at? (where they at)
Let these bitches know theres some real playas back
Told her meet me in room 510 on the mattress
If you do it right then I'll be back bitch
Another showdown, in yo' town
Let everybody know you my ho now
I'm feelin way too cool off the gin and juice
I'm bout to fuck my bitch and her friend too (and her friend too)
Captain Save-A-Ho:
Damn, see man yall niggas is trippin man
Niggas this '98 yall actin like its still '88
Short cussin, and all this bullshit
Check this out--see baby and them leavin see?
Baby come here, c'mon, baby don't even trip, just kick it for a lil while
You know what I'm sayin? I'll take you to Sizzler to go eat after awhile
I'll make em stop trippin, don't even trip baby its all good
Verse 2: Too $hort/B-Legit
Too $hort:
I'm feelin good, everything hooked up right
Before its all over I'mma be in som'n tight
Looked down at my hip to check my pager
Tryin to find me a bitch, fresh off the stage
Nigga ain't hungry, fuck the after party
Told a cute groupie ""Bitch meet me in the lobby""
You know how we do it, told her bring all her friends
Next weekend we gonna do it all again
B-Legit:
I said it out my mouth on the mic real loud
We at the Holiday-Inn, room 510
Bring all the bitches even if they dikes
We hyped, hoes eatin pussy tonight
Seen her in my mug, peepin my game
Lookin like she could take dick in the brain
We all champagne and Cali green
I need a bitch like that on a pimp team
Too $hort:
It's after midnight, can't find the right women
Can't be slippin while you're late night pimpin
Way too many niggas got stuck like that
Waited too late then fucked a rat
Wake up in the mornin, mad as hell
With the wrong bitch in the wrong hotel
Shoulda gave up when you first struck out
Now you tryna get the fuck out
B-Legit:
Man I was drunk when I went out, blow when I woke up
Didn't get to fuck cuz these hoes is ducks
Niggas like me need the head lay on
From bad ass bitches who prefer red bones
Rock microphones, later count G's
Could always spot a rat chasin niggas with cheese
Please, put it on freeze, it don't suit me
What happened to the muthafuckin groupies? (muthafuckin groupies)
Captain Save-A-Ho:
What happened? nigga they all left, thats what happened
Yall muthafuckas gonna be sittin around all night talkin to each other
Oh thats cool, yall got some muthafuckin Playboy magazines
So I guess thats why yall ain't trippin, check this out man
Yall niggas gotta understand one thing man
Bitches don't love to be talked to like that, yall gotta break down
Be cool with a bitch, ya know what I'm sayin?
Show her some caring and shit, understand me?
Verse 3: B-Legit/Too $hort
B-Legit
I remember when the shit first began
I used to fuck the dog shit out my biggest fans
Four in the mornin we hit the waffle spot
Then its back to the telly for some more cock
Shit was non-stop, don't choose too fast
Theres a gang of more bitches with way more ass
Up and down the hall with the bad-ass body
Groupies lookin for the after party
Too $hort:
I used to be wild as fuck, get my dick sucked
On the back of the tour bus with two or three sluts
Check into my suite, order somethin to eat
Knockin at my door, its another lil freak
Right up the hall on the same flo'
You could stand in line and run a train on the ho
Top-notch or rat, skinny or fat
B-Legit, where all the groupies at? (groupies at)
B-Legit:
In the room with the tricks gettin big faces
But they really wanna know how the dick tastes
I used to get fucked, fall asleep, wake up
Kick the bitch out and bump a freak
But nowadays, you gotta watch your route
Niggas savin hoes need to cut that out
So what they talkin bout, they shoulda been done came
I think they scared of a nigga with this real game
Too $hort:
What happened to the groupies, don't point your finger
They're all backstage chasin R&B singers
At the other concert, on the other side of town
I seen a few hoes but they wasn't down
Where the groupies at, I'mma ask yall later
Probably out tryna fuck basketball players
Silly hoes, rappers got mansions
But we ain't tryna get into these tramp bitches
Captain Save-A-Ho:
Yall niggas is trippin man
Yall need to sit down and re-evaluate your morals man
Yall niggas gettin too old for this shit
Yall gonna be sittin around in the club
Tryna figure out who goin home with ya old ass
You need to find ya a good woman, snatch her up, get her a BMW
She got kids, only do what you do, tell her ""I got you""",https://genius.com/Too-short-what-happened-to-the-groupies-lyrics
Partytime,Born to Mack,1987.0,"Party time
It's party time
Without a doubt I'm coming back and I would do it again
You can take away my beat and don't touch my pen
My name is Short that's so fake because I rap so long
Other rappers hear pop I put funk in this song
Young tender on the floor wiggle it all
Homeboy keeps telling her to give him a call
He's been on her since ten and it's almost two
Walking through the party with his dick on the roof
Tryin' to catch a little freak in the mini skirt
She was dancing real nasty all the boys like her
You can handle like a dog but you won't get game
You'll only get dog fake number and name
She's a mother to be and you better believe
You'll be looking at her mean next time you meet
Young tender won't care, she's still fine
Here you come again with your playboy lines
You don't stop
The party start jumping five hours ago
The mix don't stop till it's way past four
At three A.M I hit the scene
Buck-toothed freaks drop at three-fifteen
Pull out with one ditch the other
I jumped in my ride and I burnt rubber
Party time
Get busy
Too Short
She's the one, love those legs
Danced two records but it seems like days
Baby so fine I keep telling myself
I want the young tender under my love spell
She could be all mine, nothing more or less
Life with a smile never, ever depressed
I give her ever lasting love around the clock
Baby doll it's you and me so just rock
Breakdown
All you superficial rappers will cease to exist
If I come into a party hitting raps like this
Though I make you feel weak when you want to be strong
Your soft so buddy as I state in my song
According to the scriptures in the book of rhymes
Biting on a line is considered a crime
Unintelligent? Yes!
Never fresh!
RUN DMC tattooed in your chest
I'll tell you one time and one time only
You might be fresh if you weren't so phony
The ability to rap is a gift from God
And your biting what your writing and it won't be bought
At the spur of a moment I will bust a rap
Simultaneously jamming with the beat in the back
Party time!
Get busy
Party time
Party time so get busy
Shake it, bake it, make it, break it
Work that body girl just don't fake it
I'm the kinda brother for a girl like you
I can see in your eyes that you know it's true
I'm the mack and the ? from the big Oak Town
Laying track by track that vicious sound
All you sucker MC's hating my face
Even though there's not a rapper who could take my place
You better hook
Look
Or just get took
I know what you're about, see I read you like a book
Desperate dreams are on your mind
With a 10 foot mic you couldn't touch my rhyme
I'm impeccable rapping
Don't stop capping
Front one time and you'll see what happens

Get busy
So fresh to the sound
I get down
I'm so fresh from the Oakland town",https://genius.com/Too-short-partytime-lyrics

Some of that '93 old school shit, ho
Well I'm Too $hort baby, hear what I say
I never do work but I always play
Cause the game is life and I play the game
So you never talk down on a player's name
When I grab my mic I'm the one man crew
Talking bout me, wouldn't think about you
When you heard Too $hort came to town
You never would've thought I'd be looking down
On who? On you cause I'm so big
Me and my money is all I dig
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, we ain't no punk
We take 24 tracks, drop the funk on your ass
Beating like a dope fiend
Back seat riding in a limosine
Telling that freak all about me
The creater of greater, sucker MC's
Chilling out in the Oaktown singing a rap
No MC could rock like that
Now I say it like bitches say
No MC could rock my way
When I rap it's always great
Wouldn't care if it was like or on a tape
It's me, $hort, the one and only
Spitting that rap to all my homies
You know about you, you know I'm a star
When I rap too good I might take it too far
Had the whole damn crowd going wild
Cause I don't stop rapping, that's my style
Too $hort baby from East Oakland
I got more hoes than I can count on my hand
You got women? Well I got more
You don't know? Shit, I'm Playboy $hort
They call me ""Playboy $hort"" known everywhere
Had a life long dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was every day, just make that page
Still playing the same, still young at the game
Never talk down on a player's name
Cause I'm big time, paid all my dues
I'm rich and famous and way too cool
People can't fuck with the way I'm rhyming
They say it's too slow but it bought these diamonds
Too $hort baby is the name I use
A '93 Lexus is what I cruise
Clean from the start, I thought I was it
I was Cadillac Slick in the dust I kick
But the Caddy got parked cause I'm riding new
Eastside bitch, so I'm siding, fool
Money everywhere, all over the floor
At the bank I'm known as ""Mr. $hort""
At the house I be chilling, getting some head
Writing raps all day, even in bed
And them groupie-ass bitches love this shit
The funk rap master, made to fit
Just her, I'm all in them guts
Homeboy can't fuck so I hooked it up
But young women like you with your big round butts
Blind girls driving down the street called ""Love""
Chasing that man, who really can't stand
Seeing your face so now you ran
And you don't realize what you'll soon see
The way making love is supposed to be
With a player known as Playboy Too
Rock a mic and a freak and you'll both be through
Players play women who like to get played
Bitched like you just trying to get laid
But I like money, and I get paid
I do my duty and say ""Good day""
I didn't want to make love, I'm not that fast
What the hell, she's a freak, she even asked
So let's go to my room, after the show
Treat me like a pimp, and pay me ho
You can suck my dick and I might sing
Just love Too $hort, I'm everything
So cool, my name is ""Too""
Call it how you want but I won't call you
Ring my phone and you might see
Ringing my phone just won't get me
Cause I'm hard to find, and I get mine
And if I was looking for you, I wouldn't be in line
I'd be right on time in the right place
Too $hort baby all in your face
Talking bout mine and what I want
Fucking MC's with the Dangerous funk
I'm on my way, to the top
So much rapping I'll never stop
And all that fame, you might claim
Couldn't stand up by my rap name
You might be good, I don't care
I've been rapping like this 13 long years
I got more respect then you'll ever get
Cause I don't stop rapping and you know that shit
Sucker MC's with your record deal
Most tapes out now couldn't be real
Cause your tracks ain't shit, dreaming bout hits
But you'll find out Too $hort don't quit
When I grab my mic I'm the one man crew
Talking bout me, wouldn't think about you
When you heard Too $hort came to town
You never would've thought I'd be looking down... (fades out)",https://genius.com/Too-short-playboy-short-get-in-where-you-fit-in-lyrics

Montana, $hort what's happenin’?
Dolla $ign, woah, woah, oh yeah

That ain't my girlfriend, that's my old bitch
And I can have her any time I want, she love this dick
Oh nigga, you mad, yeah nigga, you pissed
I know she’s stayin' with you, but that's our bitch, woah
Nigga, that's my bitch, nigga, that's my bitch
No matter how much you hate, she's still on my dick
Nigga, I can still hit if I call that bitch
I know I got you mad as fuck, but pimp, don't trip, that's still my bitch

I seen the homie last night on some fly shit
Had the nerve to introduce me to my bitch
His main bitch is my side bitch
She stayed cool, actin’ like the shy chick
I played it cool too, you know I didn’t say nothin'
’Cause not a lot of people know that me and her be fuckin'
She sent a text, talkin' 'bout, ""I see you player""
I see you too, hangin’ out with a square
But that's the type I like
Spend the night but she's not my wife
I fuck her good but I'm not her man
To tell the truth, I just hit it when I can

That ain't my girlfriend, that's my old bitch
And I can have her any time I want, she love this dick
Oh nigga, you mad, yeah nigga, you pissed
I know she's stayin' with you, but that's our bitch, woah

You's a lame and you know that, pussy throwback
If I want it, she won't go back and you know that
Thinkin' that you own that, picture that, Kodak
You cuffin' that, low jack, we smokin' that, more yeah
She want use the money you ain't talkin' 'bout none
Show me your bad bitch, I'll show you nigga, tired of fuckin'
300 the drop, 3 bottles Cîroc
3 models to pop, presidental, Barack
Leanin' in the sport, pimpin' is a sport
Pullin' up with $hort, you niggas money short
Oh that's your hoe? Nigga, that's my hoe too
Heard she used to fuck with Ty, yeah Jeremih too

Nigga, that's my bitch, nigga, that's my bitch
No matter how much you hate, she's still on my dick
Nigga, I can still hit if I call that bitch
I know I got you mad as fuck, but pimp, don't trip, that's still my bitch

See my bitches is bad, so I know it's no problem
Know when he ain't around, prolly when she gon' call me
I know she come to play, she chase me state to state
Swear these niggas be jealous, that's why females trade
She hit me on the phone, say she be home alone
Off Hennessy and Patron, tweetin' 'bout my cologne
I be in New York, fuckin' her to Too $hort
Hit that pussy so good, said she need new pork
Got me drillin' 'cause I'm diggin' on ya
Right now I'm down to pop, gonna lay the pipin' down down
All we do is fuck and smoke and you down
You know it ain't no discussion, that ain't my girlfriend

Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Yo you don't even got what I be givin'
The truth is you can never hit the spots that I be hittin'
I know she love when I be on top and I be in it
Even when we finish you should hear the props that I be gettin'
I pull up and hit it out front and then I dip when I'm done
Even if ya'll were married I still get hit what I want
Every time that  she near me I'm still gon' get what I want
Break up your happy family and tell you look what I've done
I've gotten dirty now, she gotten flirtier now
She wrote her name on my dick, I putting words in her mouth
When Joyner Lucas in town there's lots to worry about
I mean that's my bitch if you ain't heard in a while

That ain't my girlfriend
Nigga, that's my bitch, nigga, that's my bitch
No matter how much you hate, she's still on my dick
Nigga, I can still hit if I call that bitch

A lemme hear you say beotch! Say beotch!
Say bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch..
Your daddy said come back baby, find your life
It was wrong before but this time it's right
It's been way too long, you've been gone from home
You wasn't ready when you left to be grown on your own
Now deep down inside you're his little girl
Gotta swallow his pride cause you're his little girl
Wouldn't be so bad, if you only stripped
But you don't do dancin just lonely tricks
Now you're hooked - ain't no love
You in this game, it's just like drugs
Your family wrote you off cause you fucked that up
You way out of town and you stuck
Now you're on your own, you've been disowned
Since you left your hometown all your friends are gone
It's girls like you that truly make us
You're lost in the world so I moved you to Vegas

Before you met me you wasn't nuttin
I fucked wit'cha and I turned you into somethin
Now fuck J-Lo, be your own woman
Now take your ass back to work the track jumpin
Say beotch! I'mma be pimpin forever

Say say say say ho! I'mma stay mackin forever

Say beotch! You better get that cash
Old-ass man wanna hit that ass
Older than your daddy, more like your granny
Let his old wrinkled ass get in them panties
I show you how to get it, I'm just a dog
You had a good thang and you fucked it off
I'm like the big bad wolf, you better scream
Run for your life cause I want that cream
Your father told you, to stay away from me
And now you gotta call me daddy?
Now let me ask you, you think you've got it together?
You're too fine to be broke, you gotta get whatever
Now I don't give a fuck in any weather
When I see you, you better have a G or better
Look into my eyes, and say you understand me
Cause now I'm your family (say beotch)


Your father wants to know, when you comin
But you never liked home so you keep on runnin
Now I got you, you're mine for life
Bitch get your mind right, don't let the limelight
Steal your soul, and make you old
Make the happy lil' girl turn bitter and cold
Now your brain is frozen, your body is numb
You're stuck in the ho-zone, you gotta get home
You can go to Oz and won't learn shit
Click your heels three times and go turn a trick
Beotch! You better get that cash
If you don't got it when I see you I'mma whip that ass
And all of you squares, that hear my flows
Most of y'all bitches wouldn't make good hoes
Never talk down on a pimp and his whore
Unless you know the whole story, broke bitch! (say beotch)


Say beotch!
Yeah that's right, ho up if you wanna blow up
Say say say say ho
And all you cute broke-ass bitches stop hatin on these real hoes

Can’t Stay Away,Can’t Stay Away,1999.0,"Intro:
Yeah thats right baby
You rolling to the sounds of Too $hort
Album #11 (Just Can't Stay Away)
You knew I couldn't stay away (can't stay away)
Dedicated to the funk baby
Thats how we do this, we been doing this

So I made a new album
Fresh out of retirement
I can't stay away, I'm ready to ride again
I could do it for the money, I'd rather do it for the fans
Break out my old caddy, I'd knew he'd understand
See I don't stop rapping, so how could I retire
I had to re-negotiate, 'cause the stakes were getting higher
Lawsuits and jail, partnerships fail
Didn't have a drivers lisence, so I was always making bail
Three years ago I told Jive: get my scrill
They gave a nigga millions with the same shit deal
You know I gotta live so I might as well learn
I'd be the first motherfucker to tell you I got burned
So I retired, started all over again
I put the game down like an Oakland pimp (Oakland pimp)
And now I get payed like the NBA
First class on that ass,every game we play
Fuck your attitude bitch, you ain't hurting me
I'm felling to cool, I'm rolling three times Barkley
You can get your ass out and walk home
I'll find another young broad and get my fuck on
So please don't trip, in my cadillac bitch
Maybe some other time cause I ain't having that shit
Right now I'm about to lean to the left
Wipe that frown off your face bitch I mean what I said
I'm bout to bump this beat, I'm wasting time talking
Keep fucking with me and they goin find their ass walking
I'm to the next level, but I keep on rapping
This shit I be doing just ain't suppose to happen
What you know about the motherfuking east side connection
Hitting backstreets in my motherfucking oldschool flexing
Niggas on the eastside we ain't no punks
Made em get four way stop signs and speedbumps
Always highspeed chasing everyday and night
They call me $ir Too $hort bitch you better say it right
I had to look past rap music and R&B
I be a leader and watch this niggas follow me
I could be 40, album 15 it wouldn't matter
I probably got way more rhymes then all you rappers
I know i got more songs then you ever made
I stayed on the charts and I stayed paid
So don't come around me bragging bout the shit you achieved
Cause I know excalty what you and me need
To be in two different places all the time
I ain't concerned with yours so stay the fuck up out of mine
I own all my shit so you can't destoy it or enjoy it
Unless I  say so and motherfuckers better know it
If you living really good it ain't nuttin but fate
I love to see a new rapper doing something great
When I hear a funky base line I always pay attention
I spit these pimp ass rhymes cause hoes love the way
I mention pimp shit all the time
18 years of making music, I bring square bitches to my house
And watch her straight get loose wit it
Too $hort baby can't never stop funking
I've been doing this for years and I got hella songs that bumping
All you hang-around-a-long-time, one-hit-havin
Got no love for this rap music, you need to stop rapping
I thought you  was jealous of my bitches and cars
But you just mad that your shit ain't hitting like ours
I'm so real about these beats, I tell all my freaks
At the studio, bitch don't bother me
Its all about the funk, live bass
Trinity, MPC, JV-2080, dump some chords with the vintage keys
You hear what I'm saying, learn from my example
Break out the instruments and stay away from the samples
Get your publishing for everything you write
Instead of selling it keep it for the rest of your life
So just take my advice and don't quit
Cause if you do, you won't get shit, beyatch

Much love y'all
Short Dawg's in this
Verse One: Too $hort
I'm high profile, but you can't see me ho
Got limosine tint like a real CEO
Hands free, talkin on the speaker phone
Handlin my business, just tryin to get my freak on
You know, bitches always beepin me with code 69
I'm real with mine, I make hoes wait in line
Can't fuck em all, and don't want to
Cause some of these tramps might front you (watch out)
You waited six months, I fucked her on the first date
And so I smoke the green weed to keep my mind straight
It's Friday, doin shit my way
Me and yo' bitch, rollin down the highway (right)
While you shootin that.. she gave it up easy
Fore-a-play and all that, wasn't tryin to tease me
Now you wanna feud, fuck that shit (slut)
Let's fight behind a lady, not that punk ass bitch
(singer croons ""be my.. dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Watch em.. keep your eyes open
Doesn't make sense
Verse Two: Too $hort
Now here I go, spittin another verse
Let the pen read my mind cause the shit ain't rehearsed
I'm so curious, about what this fat bitch have
A big bag of weed and a pack of zig-zags (smokin)
So I kicked it with her, with no intentions to fuck
Smoked up her weed and got my dick sucked (yeah right)
I said I got a lot of money but I'm short on cash
Could you give a nigga some so I can get some gas? (stupid shit)
She gave me twenty dollars, I know it's small pimpin
But it's mandatory, when I deal with all women (all these hoes)
It ain't gon' be no one-sided, I support her shit
Just because she hurt, Too $hort got a grip, beyitch!
I break it down, like the beat
Ride you like a motherfuckin seventy-three
Old school, everytime I roll through
All you suckers know who all the bitches go to, Short Dawg
(singer croons ""be my.. dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Fuck a bitch.. they fuck with you main
Foul mouthed little motherfuckers.. ?
Verse Three: Too $hort
It's cause rap music is like sellin dope
Every dollar you invest you get seven mo' (and that's real)
I hope you never ask me, how much it costs
If you can't figure out how the fuck I floss (big ballin)
You better get in where you fit in
Cause a nigga like me ain't kiddin (no jokes)
Here come her boyfriend, with that narrow minded shit
Kissin on the bitch, she sucked e'rybody dick (slut)
Don't get mad, you knew the bitch had flaws
Ridin in the Benz (bitch) dick hangin out my drawers..
.. now why she give me head? (why?)
All she ever wanted was to get in my bed
I ain't gotta be a trick to tramp your ho (nope)
I spit the game like a pimp while I'm ridin chrome
I had a dream I was through, can't sell records
Can't catch hoes, bring em home and get naked (what?)
It's not the first time, I had this dream
But music is my drug and I'm a dopefiend (straight)
The way I put it down, it don't seem too hard
Scorin points like Kareem-Abdul Jabbar (swish)
And if you tryin to catch me, you'll find out fast
What you tryin to do is an impossible task (can't do it)
Cause what I'm doin (can't do that) no rapper ever did it
(can't do that) Eleven albums and I'm still the shit, bitch!
(singer croons ""be my.. dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Can't do that.. nah nah.. ain't gon' happen
Old school Too $hort, that's right I said Too $hort

My lil homie rapping on, came to show you how
To take my skills and keep paying the bills
Fuck what you're saying cuz I'm staying real
The young homies keep me on my toes, still got the old flow
Book me in your town and there'll never be a no-show
Kick it down south where they keeping it crunk
Cuz the niggas down south got they own funk!
You heard about the West Coast, heard about the East Coast
Heard about Miami-base, but what about 
Or Kalamazoo, they got MC's too!
If you come around my crew, you gonna have to say a few
Or you can just get your bitch-ass out
You come to me you can play, sing, rap, no doubt
You got to go, what the fuck is this?

Funk 'till eternity, folks gotta learn to be together
Cuz we all on the same journey
So as I roll, I'ma look out for you
If I see you do it wrong I take my time and show you
How to get it right, make money every night
Gotta use your brain if you wanna win the fight
East coast, West coast, who got the best flow?
Maybe at your next show, niggas oughta test your
Crowd skills, and check your record sales
Then we'll find out how you fake as hell
I said it ain't where you from it's how you do it where you're at
Real players from your town all knew that you was whack
Fake nigga in Cali', fake nigga in New York
Small time, you never be bigger than $hort
Now why you trying to front so hard?
You from a gangster town but you is a punk ass mark
Respect don't come cuz of where you from
Keep it real in your heart from square one
And all you highly influenced followers, on the wrong path
Spitting game to make the motherfucking song last
It's a shame you can't make no cash
Everytime we roll out we gotta wait on your ass
You're just slow, can't be down with nation wide
Cuz we seriously, trying to get the paper right
Talking bout contracts, cash flow, credit cards, mean cars
Signin lot of that for the next 16 bars
Make a hit, get paid, get laid, what you want
Tellin motherfuckers where you getting all that money from
$hort records now you trying to flip 18's
Got what it takes make a hit, make G's!

My baby momma brother put me down with the D
I bought my babe a 'lac and changed my name to Pimp-C
I put the pimping down to the hoes
Now $hort got me rocking on the microphone
And all the trill niggas riding trues and vogues
And all the bitch niggas trying to buy these hoes
Got a bitch try to chip me on my cellular phone
Smelling like 64-dollar cologne
Nigga got mad cuz his bitch chose me
But you just showed you ain't no real P.I.M.P
Like Kool Mack A Ace and Sir Captain
You ain't no goldy motherfucker you was acting
And all that punk shit we could do without it
I'm still down with Master P so bitch I'm 'bout it!


(Pimp C):
I dip from city to city, squeezing ass and titties
The head was good, but the pussy was shitty
She just wanna kick it with a rap star
The bitch got freaky, tried to fuck my car!
ATL, the city of bless
Where hoes like to take big dick in they belly
Got two freaks from Decateur wanna lick our sacks
I tried hit you $hort, man where the fuck was you at?
(Too $hort):
Out in Nashville, Tenessee
Bitches in with me for sure
Sipping on the Remy X ho!
With the hoes, last night I did that
Every blue moon I got to pull out my big hat
Do some more shit other niggas can't do
Like hooking up this funky ass nation wide crew
We come from everywhere, working under one roof
Come through, front, somebody might stump you
With a rhyme or a boot
What you finna do?
Getting blood all over my nigga's tennish shoe
You better take my advice and get lost fast
Before them boys from Texas, get off in your ass
And it won't be pretty, if my uncle Frank Middy
Come lookin for you, shooting at you, it gets shitty!
But in your mind you rank higher than me
Put your money in the bank then come wire it to me
Cuz I'll flip it, while you trying to buy a new car
Find me in the studio signing new stars
Take a hundred thousand dollars make a quick million
Start from the floor and go straight to the ceiling
You hiding from reality, nigga you is a bitch
Niggas like me get used to getting rich
Signing autographs, taking pictures of my fans
Hit the town and take your bitch to my place
She get a bigger and better deal, fucking with me
I heard $hort dog ran up in your freak!
She dissapeared, heard she went to Cali!
Jumped on the plane, and flew the bitch to Maui
Or maybe Atlanta, I got your bitch posted
Popping champagne bottles 'bout to get roasted
Chilling at the house, me and four hoes
Jumped in the jacuzzi ain't wearing no clothes

(Pimp-C spitting game during the last chorus)
Say $hort can I fuck?
Smoke something bitch
Bitch!
Hol' up",https://genius.com/Too-short-all-about-it-feat-pimp-c-lyrics
I Want to Be Free (That’s the Truth),Shorty the Pimp,1992.0,"You think Oakland California is a city of punks
It only takes a second, to pop the trunk
And just like that you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed
It's all about the game, and nothin else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
You catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
Tryin to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin
This little town is gettin wild as hell
Check the penetentiaries and all the jails
If they could lock us all up that would be just fine
Got my partners from Oakland doin serious time
You can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
But it's a mindgame, and you gotta deal with that
I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money, cause back in the days
When I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone, and show you how
But I was broke, the only thing I had was game
I started makin money and knew things would change
Bought a Benz, thought it might earn respect
But the OPD, found it hard to accept
I got jacked by the Task and jacked by the Vice
Face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
Put the handcuffs on backseat I'm in it
Illegal search for about thirty minutes
Askin me, where's the dope
Where's my gun, but I don't know
I said I'm rappin, they laugh like I told a joke
And to this day they think I'm sellin coke

I want to be free! (and that's the truth) Ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! Ohhh yeahhh

I be in Oakland California every day of my life
Bass so hard you think I'm smokin a pipe
And if I don't smoke it, I gots to grind
Searched all my stuff, and all you find
Is a pocket full of money count seven G's
Now you wanna think I'm sellin keys
Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police wanna send me to prison
They see a brother makin major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass
And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin on the dank smoke
Cause all they wanna find, is guns and coke
In court all the time tryin to fight it
We get rich, we get indeibted
So what's the problem Officer this time?
Is havin' big money being black a crime?
Or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
Charge me with somethin, or just ask questions
About the brothers I hang around
What's really goin on in the Oakland town
Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But Too $hort baby just ain't no snitch
You say you're just doin your job
But you're gettin on my nerves, just like Bob
Everytime I hit a corner, I see you
Always tellin brothers what to do
You lock me up cause I don't know how to act
But I'm down for mine so I be talkin back
And when I do, you treat me bad as hell
I'm sick of spendin nights in jail


Got out of jail about fo'-fifteen
Walkin down the street like a broke dopefiend
Had a pocket full of money tryin to play the role
Benz got towed and I was hella cold
But I ain't trippin, I'm gettin used to it now
Handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
For three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
Cause the five-oh's always tryin to jack a playa
For no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong
You think I'm lyin, singin that same ol song
Well I'm a black man, ridin in a Benz
How in the hell did I make these ends? Here we go
I pull over to the right
Stop the engine keep my hands in sight
I start cursin, cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence
If I was plannin, a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank
And I hope I don't get robbed by you know who
Make me donate some G's to the boys in blue
And if I sue, I won't get nothin back
But I ain't mad... I'm just black...",https://genius.com/Too-short-i-want-to-be-free-thats-the-truth-lyrics
Lil’ Shorty,Still Blowin’,2010.0,"Don't act like that
What's up wit' you? What's up?
That's a bad lil' bitch

Lil' shorty got a nasty lil' dance
With a whole lot of ass in them pants
Do you think I'm a passionate man?
Ice cold player with a master plan
A lot of females just don't know
That lil' shorty got her own dough
When I met her it was on right away
If I was married, I'd leave my wife today
Light-skinned with the curly hair
Did my finger like this and said, ""Girl, come here""
She's on South Beach, havin' lunch with a dude
I whispered in her ear, ""Later on, come through""

Yo shorty, we can kick it, baby
Baby, you know that I'm with it
You can hit me on my phone
We can do it all night long

(She said) Oh, yeah, I really wanna rock your world
Yes, I know you, boy, I'll be your girl
Trust me, baby, you'll be satisfied
You could be mine tonight
(She said) Oh, yeah, I really wanna rock your world
Yes, I know you, boy, I'll be your girl
Trust me, baby, you'll be satisfied
You could be mine tonight, boy

That lil' shorty is well stacked
Her shoes, her purse and her belt match
Hella cute, even in the morning
A super top notch, better get up on it
Ass fat, she's a class act
Menage-a-trois, she don't have that
She's all about them dimes and pennies
Tens and twenties, hundreds and fifties
Whatever you got, she'll take it
Make a nigga stop, drop and get naked
I guess it's just a sign of the times
'Cause shorty got a crib that's as fly as mines

(She said) Oh, yeah, I really wanna rock your world
Yes, I know you, boy, I'll be your girl
Trust me, baby, you'll be satisfied
You could be mine tonight
(She said) Oh, yeah, I really wanna rock your world
Yes, I know you, boy, I'll be your girl
Trust me, baby, you'll be satisfied
You could be mine tonight, boy

Lil' shorty is a freak, mayne
Gamed up with the street game
Did a lot and left me wantin mo'
Lil' shorty ain't no punk ho
I don't sip fine wine or drink champagne
Don't mix with fake hoes that think I'm payin'
But I do like women, that know about pimpin'
Keep gettin' money so we don't stop spendin'
Lil' shorty knows my background
I was raised out West in a mack's town
I wanna get some money and have fun wit'chu
Lil' shorty, what you wanna do?

(She said) Oh, yeah, I really wanna rock your world
Yes, I know you, boy, I'll be your girl
Trust me, baby, you'll be satisfied
You could be mine tonight
(And then she said) Oh, yeah, I really wanna rock your world
Yes, I know you, boy, I'll be your girl
Trust me, baby, you'll be satisfied
You could be mine tonight, boy

That’s how it is in the Bay, baby
We hella muthafuckin’ disrespectful, bitch
Ay, Mistah F.A.B., tell these muthafuckas how we do it

I just wanna ride around town getting high with a bad bitch
I just wanna high-side, pull up on the side of my old bitch
I just wanna ask a nigga to his face ‘Why you actin’ like a bitch?’
I can’t wait to tell a hater nigga ‘Fuck you and that bitch’

I just want a sexy bitch from another country
A Southern girl thick as fuck, and hella country
I just wanna buy a Bentley, black on black
Then buy my young bitch a fake Louis bag
200 thou foreign parked in front the house
If the bitch is boring, kick her ass out
If the bitch is choosing, make her cash out
I don’t want the pussy, bitch, I want some mouth
I want the blue strips, these bitches foolish
These bitches choosin’; pimpin’, let’s do this
Bitch, I am ruthless; I used to be toothless
I was still stuntin’ hard, clean ass cars, pullin’ up with a cute bitch

Hell, all my niggas we are out of housing
I just want a Rolie, not too much to ask
A ghetto ass bitch with a lotta ass
I just want a chain and my diamonds dancing
A whole bunch of cars and a private mansion
Some supermodel bitches that I don’t remember
My closet looking like a nigga robbed a tender
Pull up in the Benz, pull up in a Jag, pull up in a Bentley
Ignoring hella texts and super bad bitches saying
“Can you come and get me?”
No, I don’t feel like dealing with these bitches
I don’t even wanna really be bothered
I ain’t gotta go on Maury just to tell a bitch “I am not the father”

I just wanna ride around town getting high with a bad bitch
I just wanna high-side, pull up on the side of my old bitch
I just wanna ask a nigga to his face ‘Why you actin’ like a bitch?’

With them lil' ol' thongs on, I can almost see they coochie lips
And she backin that thing up on me, so I do the damn thing and pop her
With a lil' curl that ha-hangin proper, drunk off champagne and vodka
Just cause it's us in the club they krunk, it's $hort and Twista
And I know the ladies know we love to cut, I can tell it when they whisper

You must be a magician cause you're nothin but a trick
Tryin to give her all your money, but whatchu gon' get?

Up against the wall, just got another number to call
Y'all see me I'm a real player, I do this nightly
You wanna fight me, cause you can't be like me
All you hatin ass suckers in the place
You better stop starin in my motherfuckin face
Too many jealous thoughts goin through yo' mind
You mad like you guilty, goin to do some time
Pay yo' pussy bill nigga if you want a date
But you just talkin shit I figure you just wanna hate

In the rearview, make a wrong move and I gotsta have your head
I put 23's in the game on the Avalanche and give you the blues
And blow white smoke up out the sunroof while we keep it on cruise
I ride with a hog in the back and the vogue in the back and you hatin on that
It's just V. White, T. $hort, Twista boy we blazin on track
It's just that Eastside psycho-chronological mind-stopper
Keep a burner at yo' waist while we serve these haters proper
You better get up, get out, get somethin; nigga, and stop frontin
If I had no car and stayed with my momma then I'd be hatin on somethin
Nah but nope, not me, I give 'em out, above the knee
You could catch one in the torso, b-2-1-2, fuckin with me
Now you can hate me all you want to cause I ain't hard to find

Pop That Pussy,The Pimp Tape,2018.0,"League of Starz

She had a rough childhood
All bad, man, it wasn't that good
Her stepdaddy used to play with her
That’s why she walks around with all that hate in her
A born sinner, tryna be a straight winner
If Sister Souljah made a movie, she'd play Winter
Her momma never loved her
And on the day her daddy left, her mama said, ""Fuck her""
Went and stayed with her grandmama
But granny's house was hella packed
Six aunties and they all smoked crack
What made it worse, granny lived on the ho track
Where they was robbin’ and shootin'
She grew up in the West like Huey P. Newton
Every day, she witnessed prostitution
Pimps running game, tryna give her solutions

They said, ""Pop that pussy, pop that pussy""
They told her, ""Pop that pussy, go on, girl, pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy""
They told her, ""Pop that pussy, pop that pussy""

He said, ""Choose up with a boss, baby, we gon' floss""
Took advantage of a black girl lost
She was 15, but she looked 25
Redbone with some hazel eyes
Got stuck with a pimp when her granny died
Turning tricks in the cold, every night she cried
He beat her so bad, she had to leave
Nowhere to go, no strategy
Just a rent-a-day ho, she's a loose one
I heard she was stripping out in Houston
Finally started winning, tired of losin'
Paying herself, no more choosin'
First time in her life she got her own dough
Stack that money, you ain't hoing no more
Enrolled in school, that's ambition
Tricks pay tuition, the bitch reversed the pimpin’

Pop that pussy, she had to pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, she learned how to pop that pussy
Go on, girl, pop that pussy, pop that pussy
Hey, pop that pussy, she learned how to pop that

She came back to the Bay in a red Benz
Went to the track, seen her old friends
She said, ""Bitch, I don’t fuck with no pimp""
Ran into this nigga named Gold Lips
Her old pimp still trippin' on old shit
He said, ""I don’t get left by no bitch""
First thing he did was took her keys
Then yelled out, ""Bitch, you can't leave""
She flashed back all the shit he used to do
Went inside her purse and grabbed the .22
He said, ""Bitch, you ain't gon' shoot""
You could see the rest on the Channel 2 News
On the Channel 2 News, you could see the rest on Channel 2
They told her, ""Pop that pussy""
Couldn’t take no more, so she popped that pussy",https://genius.com/Too-short-pop-that-pussy-lyrics
Players holiday,UnKnown,UnKnown,"T.W.D.Y. - Player's Holiday
F/ Mac Mall & Too Short

What?
You say what?
The president did what?
Ah man, that's hey, that's all good baby
He got rid of the player haters too?
Ah man, we need to declare this a national holiday
We gonna call this Players Holiday
Ant B-Z what up man?

Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday
Chorus:
Today's the day the Players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
Cause you know it's gonna be a lovely day
Chorus:
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
(A lovely day)
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

January 1 the year 2000
We gettin' all the money and we ain't through clownin'
You can tell everybody that stays around your way
Today is the official Player's Holiday
Short Dog I'm lovin' every minute of it
Cause pimpin's been around since the beginning of it
We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Buy some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap what you doin?

I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never
Chorus

Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days
Chorus

Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped everyday and every C-note got big face
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, Short Dog and Ant Banks
Mac Mall do it big on a Players Holiday, yeah",https://genius.com/Too-short-players-holiday-lyrics

Oh you dont know, we gonna tell you how it is
Chorus:
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
Verse One:
YOu thought it was a fad, you really can't understand rap
How these young playas come up and live fat
Big houses, cars, watch the homies bubble
Do a lot of good but can't stay out of trouble
?? cause hes the president, he bought a lot of stuff you could never get
Take us to the game you wanna see my bus
But all the little kids wanna be like us
When they get home, and turn the TV on
Its Too $hort baby on the microphone
I see a lot of styles when im watching videos
Looking at the backround talking at the hoes
Then they R and B cats incorporated rap into their program
(What happened to the slow jams)
We dropping platinum, numba one, bitch, thats how its done
Chorus:
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride

Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
Verse Two:
Lil homie went to school everyday, knew what he wanted
Wa'nt trying to be a thug wa'nt trying to get blunted
It was all a dream, but theres certain things
You gotta do, like do good in school
His best friend wouldn't listen didn't make good grades
Coach kicked him off the team wouldn't let 'em play
So he stopped going to school and started hangin with some g's
Drinkin beer and smoking weed
Two years later one went to college quick he got a basketball scholarship
His homeboy was in the hood one day got arrested
Took him to the pen they say he got molested
Jealous cause his old friend took the right path
Watching ESPN I saw him in the draft
Now he got a V-12 sittin on dubs, thats how it is when ya what
Chorus:
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
Verse Three:
She used to be a nerd on the honor roll
A four eye conesour, books kinda short on looks
A latch key kid, best friend was her computer
In high school nobody wanted to do her
When she graduated from college she got paid
Got a good job, now she got it made
Gots some contacts, and let her hair down
She gots the legs and the walk that'll make you stare her down
You betta get youre shit together you running out of time
Something on your mind, you need to stop lyin'
You ain't balling like her you can't get into the party
Out in beverly hills trying flip a ferrari
Butcha credit ain't cool and you got declined
He said ""Youre welcome"" and ""But to come back anytime""
But me, im spending cash for this bitch
And thats just the way it is
Chorus:
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride

Max fold, the chef could be proffesional when rap is my colateral, for this cash flow
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum peices and some ho's from over seas
A mansion, a yaht, and some G's
To be respected for the past and the present
Uh, and show my ass at every session (yeah)
And sure enough, (what) I'm gettin' closer to my destin
(Nigga, Breed you ain't shit) No interuptions only testin'
(But I do) Uh, prove that I'm smooth with an aseditive
Bumpin' just a little bit better than my competitor
Hard you better than, you ain't gotta say it is
Everyday that's the way it is, keep it Manist
Back for some of that, Breed when the funk shit
All up in yo' ass and get cash yo' ass bump this
Bobb and weave MC's never could handle me
Thinkin' bout' changin' my name to Scandal-la, you follow
Now get the paper with my motto
Them niggas need to get in position and go on and hate me if you gotta
Gotta meal won't you have a plate, I'll have you wait
Go on and sit inside my Lincoln while I navigate


Mackin' in my lac and when I stack em' in the back
I don't give them bitches slack, cause if she's in my Cadillac
She'll be giving up the crack tryna' get a niggas scratch
When she suck a million dicks the bitch'll get a platinum plack
I said BIATCH, that's what I said when I grabbed her pony tail and she was givin' me head
I said BIATCH, you know what's up I put my dick in my draws' and zipped my jeans up
And instantly; you finna' see how pimpishly, I get these ho's in the streets
You niggas killin' me; you ain't feelin' me the bitch got you burnin' smokin' penni-cillin-weed
Or dip yo' dick in some hennessy, you'll be a God damned fool if you listen to me
I tell you shit that you can't believe, I got the bad ass bitches and they stankin' free


I told Breed these young niggas think we gettin' old
I seen em' gettin gas down on Cascade Road, still makin' money in these new days
Used to have sky pagers now we got two-ways
We dipped to my house and let the beat crank
So many placks on the wall you can't see the paint
But its loud, you know how wild your friends get
Ballin' so long been through three body styles and big Benz's
If I cut it, in the garage
I'll make the bitch think im the wizard of Oz
Click yo' heels three times you swear you seen magic
Now she's a star, she used to be a maget
Her pussy went platinum, thats what I heard
Like when I'm rappin, you never get enough of my word
I'm in my third decade of gettin paid to rap
Back in the day my tapes stained the deck


This shit bumpin mine ain't it
Oh you gotta be riders if you wanna bum this Short dog shit
You can't be in no little bullshit ass car with no bullshit system
What you ridin' nigga, you got candy?
You got rims nigga?, yo' beat ain't bumpin' nigga
This shit bumpin', turn that shit up, BIATCH!",https://genius.com/Too-short-candy-paint-lyrics
Pimp Life,What’s My Favorite Word?,2002.0,"I chose to live this life

I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggas

Niggas trippin - and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up even to a, total stranger
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin' your cum on them
Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucka
To pay a fee for pus-sy but not - me, motherfuckahHHH
I move quick with my pool stick, Slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly
But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it
And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, 'cause that's the life that I chose

Pimp life!
I chose to live the - pimp life!

Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin' to cross the line, but with that I gotta bring the pain
Now, I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done, when it comes to your pride & your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, cause I gots me a rep to protect
Now, I mights be known for this, and maybe recognized for that
But they be high-beamin me; and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be
'Cause through seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years
Man I reckon that it's power, fuck them freaks, blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be
 Pimp life!
 That's the life I chose for me

I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggas
Niggas trippin
 I chose to live the
 Pimp life!

Yeah, I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
'Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I cain't help it.. can't stay witchu girl cause I can't tell if it's
Official, or just another ritual
It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin for me to, get a hoe
I know it sounds, pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a P-F-L, 'til I'm a old nigga
'Cause I never spend my life with groupies, or gold diggers
I see these bitches now, shakin' naked, tryna' make it
If you spendin all his money take it bitch you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin' like the snub-nosed, they pay me
I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new Vogue's and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose
To live the pimp life
 Pimp life!
 I chose to live this life
 Pimp life.. pimp life!
 I chose to live the, pimp life

People ask me question bout this, people ask me question bout that
Say what? I'm a handsome John motherfucker independent of the nasty-ass cuts
Young, Gipp, still around the corner in the hood
Gipp, still runnin down in the wood
Gipp, still ridin' out like Vogue's
Gipp, still cruise hundred spokes
Straight from the 80's ladies
Grew up in nuttin' but dem Grady babies
Pimpin the game since ninety-six
Can't sell a big ol' pimp no box of bricks
Gipp put it down for the A-Town to the Bay to the Oakland foothill strip
Too $hort, Bun B, Devin and Big Gipp yo we all some pimps
Gettin money out the sexual industries
At the same, tryin' to get our slice
Never lookin back twice - livin in the pimp life
 Pimp life!

I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes

Wild Wild West,Players,1985,"Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
With his gangsta waves and gangsta hoods
He made friends with dealers and crooks
And when the party was on you knew he had come
It is like Gladis Knight and its five oh ones
Walking right up to the dj man
And give another emcee's rap
Cuz they knew about him and his gangsta rap
The fact they just couldn't manage that
He was known around to be the best
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
In a land where whips will watch the car
Tell you everything and they still want more
Where life is only give and take
In a land where the strong control the fake
He was known around for all the time
Everybody went wild when he said his rhyme
Said things that would never been thought out
With his gangsta ride his turned that town so out
Like Jesse James in a land
Where game that controls the lane
Yes the wild wild west that's the place
Suckers take a bite and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
When the sun rolls out every chance it get
The wild wild west that's where you see
Emcee rappers make you look like weak
Cuz you would never hang in the wild wild west
Without your six-shooter and your bulletproof vest
You can get down but I don't know where
You come out here you better act square
Cuz we don't play don't come my way
When you sucker wanna front you'll hear me say
""Front me"" 'cuz you'll front yourself
I'll leave you standing there mad as hell
You can rap your best that's what you do
But you just can't hang and you know its true
Like a homeboy said its one two three
West coast raps straight to the beat
You got have a lot of game to spit that rap
I wanna put a little game to you just like that
Too $hort I thought you knew
You can't count three and then skip two
It just won't work but you might try
To front a emcee from Seventy Five
Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild west
Making you look weak cuz we don't play
All you sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... front me...
Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
With his non-stop rapping and his west coast style
He had the whole damn party just going wild
Singing rhymes all time back to back
Turning every party out with the west coast rap
That's when the sucker emcees all came to be
Nothing but everyday sucker emcee's
They were all his friends all his fans
Walk right up and shake his hand
And you always knew everytime
Sucker emcee's wish they could rhyme
Just like pimp but what's the fact
The fact they just couldn't hang with that
They were all frustrated, all rapped out
Didn't even know what to rap about
Homeboys, do you agree
Ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucker emcee
Cuz much come fresh and all sound bad
Sucker emcee's couldn't make him mad
With a rap like his, a rap like that
There never was time for a sucker to rap
The sucker emcee would just wait his turn
Sucker emcee's don't wanted to get burned
What emcee knew the play
He had the sucker emcee's all running away
Didn't want none you couldn't bring them back
They never could deal with a real big mack
One emcee was the best
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
There was one emcee who knew the tip
And the sucker emcees don't even trip
So tell it to the world it's not too wise
To front an emcee from Seventy Five
Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild west
Making you look weak cuz we don't play
Sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... front me...
Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
Just a true emcee didn't pass the test
Singing raps like this all rated X
Hanging like a champ with a heavyweight rap
No emcee could rock like that
Then the boy got paid again and again
Saying he wouldn't stop till he got a Benz
I never thought about it till the other day
He had top drop rolling away
In a eighty five or eighty six
Said he got paid cuz he rapped like this
You could see it in his eyes he was seeing stars
Shoes,  and caviars
Just checking out the girls walking down the street
In the wild wild west that's where you see
The freshest emcees you will say is soft
From Seventy Five Girls so raw
Like Silky C and hollywood
They come so fresh cuz you know they could
Like sir Too $hort when I'm on the mic
West coast rappers rap all damn night
So watch how you talk in the wild wild west
East coast rappers make us look fresh
With the ""say ho and everybody scream""
East coast rappers make all the green
With a New York rap and a New York slang
Not too many could spit that game
Now the time has come and I'll tell it right
About a rapper like me who will rock the mic
I'm trying to wake you up on the western coast
Were giving you more than just the most
Its everything you could never have
You can spend your money and buy my rap
The wild wild west that's what its called
About the west coast rappers that stand so tall
The freshest emcees you'll say you saw
From Seventy Five Girls, so raw
Wild wild west",https://genius.com/Too-short-wild-wild-west-lyrics
Me and Ya Momma,The Vault,2019.0,"$hort Dog
A lot of you niggas runnin' around here talkin' 'bout
Bitch
""You ain't my real daddy, you ain't my real daddy""
Well, looka here, I'm fuckin' ya momma, for real
You know what it is
Now that's real

If your homies find out
I be fuckin' on ya momma, I be all up in your house
When you go to bed at night I fuck yo' mama on the couch
I wake up in the morning in her bed smokin' loud

It's just me and ya momma
It's just me and ya momma

It's a whole lotta things going on with you
And you don't even know I had nothing to do with it

The first time I fucked her you was in your room
She was screamin' so loud you had to know what she was doin'
Woke up the next morning and she cooked us breakfast
Standin' at the stove, booty big as Texas
I said, ""Baby, I wanna have some fun wit' you""
Seen you gettin' mad, so I smoked a blunt wit' you
Told me I was cool, and you said you was a fan
Don't worry about ya momma, she in good hands

(I'm fuckin' ya momma)
It's just me and ya momma
It's just me and ya momma
It's just me and ya momma
It's just me and ya momma

I'ma keep pullin' that muhfuckin' deuce and a quarter in front of your muhfuckin' house
And every time you get off the bus from school, nigga, you gon' see that car in front of the house and you gon' know who's in there
It's me, nigga
(It's just me and ya momma)
I'ma be sittin' on that muhfuckin' couch, nigga, drinkin' your Capri Suns, nigga, watchin' Dr. Phil
Chillin' on your muthafuckin' couch
(It's just me and ya momma)
Fuckin' ya momma
(It's just me and ya momma)
Don't talk shit to me, nigga, take it up with ya momma
Ya momma's lettin' me do this shit
Ya momma like me

Open up the door, she lost the key
You talkin' 'bout, ""Who is it?"", nigga, it's me
Every time I come through, the weed is free
So if your friend's talkin' shit and say she fuckin' Too $hort
He probably turned the camera on and then pressed record
You better tell them muthafuckas I'm your stepdad
And when I walk up in your house you gon' respect that
It's me and ya momma

I said, ""Nigga, stop watchin' me""
(It's just me and ya momma)
Got me fucked up
(It's just me and ya momma)
But anyway

Everywhere I go it's just me and ya momma
We tryin' to get you out, you always be in some drama
And every time I make bail, you act like I wanna
When every other day you gettin' dumber and dumber
Nigga, that's why it's just me and ya momma
We butt ass naked, we don't be in pajamas
Got me wastin' my money on your bitch ass
But I love ya momma, boy, so you gon' get that
You should be happy I'm wit' her, you lucky as fuck
'Cause when I ain't around, you be fuckin' shit up
It's just me and her, mayne

It's just me and ya momma
Me and ya momma
Me and ya momma
It's just me and ya momma
At the grocery store, it's just me and ya momma
At the cleaners, it's just me and ya momma
At the court, it's just me and ya momma
At the school, it's just me and ya momma
In the strip club, just me and ya momma
In the hood, it's just me and ya momma
In jail, it's just me and ya momma
In the bed, it's just me and ya momma
You know, ya momma said to me the other night, she said, ""Make love to me, talk dirty to me""
I said, ""Your kitchen, your dishes ain't been washed in two weeks""
(Man, you rich, man)
I ain't got no money, nigga, I got three strikes, I can't find no job, nigga
I'm the one makin' ya momma happy, nigga
I'm around the house, I'm fixin' shit, I can cook and everything, nigga
I've been to the pen, and I ain't bringin' no money in the house, nigga

Chase the Cat,Chase the Cat,2001.0,"Why..
Why..
I'm a junkie, looking through my book
I can't be cured, I know I'm hooked
I gotta get out the house, I'm so hard
Chasing that cat all over the yard
But why, do I chase the cat?
Been at it so long since way back
Why would I want to be a player for life?
Spitting this game every day and night
I'm talking, body language, facial expressions
Fuck a flight attendant on a layover session
She's serving my dick
Falling in love, but she ain't my bitch
Why do I need to be in between her
Since the first time I seen her?
Hit it from behind, now she want to be mine
I'm all up in her feline

Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money
Why must I, chase the cat?
You see ain't nothing changed, but the game, pimping ain't easy

Uh, being settled down, just ain't for me
Hold hands, walking down the aisle, about to get married
I thought that once, will never think it again
'Cause I'm a player in the game and I'm playing to win
There's too many fine hoes to be stuck with one
Too many wet pussies just to be fucking one, shit
It's like a disease, like JT in ""Five Heartbeats""
It's impossible for me to be with one freak
You can't live with them, you can't live without them
I never would trust a bitch and I don't doubt them
Cause I'm a dog that love to chase the cat
If you a fine bitch, I might put my face in that
If you do me first, then I'll do you
And the game jumps off when the bitch is through
Hoes nowadays be as bad as us
They love to suck, fuck and bust fat ass nuts


Ever since I was a youngster, new to the game
I was going to the mall, ""Baby what's your name
And your number?"" - I never been under
Always been a outright player no wonder
I been through so many hoes in the last 20 years
Bitch getting fucked, bring her ass up in here
I keep two or three hoes on deck
Too $hort baby don't take no shit
I'm a pussy junkie, and bitches always want me
But my first love is money
And I'll forever be faithful to her
I won't give her to a bitch just to do her
And play with her kitty
Got some nigga's name tattooed on her titty
I see a cat and jump the fence
My name is $hort Dog and I'm a pimp, bitch

Why must I, chase the cat?
Cause you know.. she's a ho..
Why must I, chase the cat?
Whaddya know.. she gives me dough..
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money",https://genius.com/Too-short-chase-the-cat-lyrics

Shake that ass, girl, move it around

It’s too much—what you gon’ do with it now?
She know what I’m on, I’m tryna get her in the bed
Lick a nigga balls, give a nigga head
Make a nigga cum then lick it up
Let’s do it all again—can a nigga fuck?
She said, “Nope”, I had to get some cowboy boots and some rope
She like to get her hair pulled back and get choked
Spank her on her ass then watch the bitch go
You ain’t seen nothin’ when she dance like she fuckin’
Hand in her pants acting like she cummin’
I put her up against the wall, let her grind on my balls
Pussy hella wet and she ain’t wearing no drawers
Get it, girl

Dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Bad bitches, dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Pump it, shake it, wiggle it, drop it, back it up, arch that back

Ay... bitch! ...
My ho got the money for me
I told her meet me at the spot, cause I wanted to see
How much she got from the tricks today
It's a normal thing for me to get paid
And my hookers don't stand at the intersection
Them tricks go surfin on the internet
And then I count it that night, or maybe in the mornin
I'm just another pimp from California
Oakland, up in the bay
We break new hoes in every day
How many hoes you got, don't ask tonight
Cause these hoes get turned out faster than lights
I've been countin G's for days
Who cares if she leaves or stays
I get somethin for nothin, cause you wanna touch her
Hug her and love her, I get paid and say fuck her

Cause if I cain't get mine
You ain't gettin shit you better wait in line
If I cain't get mine
You ain't gettin shit you better wait in line
Cause I'm pimpin, pimpin, pimpin, pimpin
I'm pimpin, pimpin, pimpin, I'm pimpin baby!

I got 16 prostitutes
When it's time, I do what I gots to do
I'm on the grind, for every nickel and dime
I let a bitch get mine, and then I spit these rhymes
No it's not a freestyle, it's me
I just wanna be wild and see
How the hoes start choosin when the pimps walk in
Shut your mouth up when a pimp's talk-in
Beeatch, I know you heard
I got the whole world sayin my favorite word
I got your ex-girl layin in my bed, she's work
Seen her at the club and she had to flirt
I smoke the pert, I light it up
Yeah I'm a pimp but I like to fuck
Sexy lil' long-haired women
But I still let 'em know that I'm pimpin

""I'ma see if I can go catch me, a nice pretty young bitch""
{*phone rings*} ""Hold on, let me see what bitch that is""
""Okay this the bitch here right now, y'knahmsayin?""
""Hey bitch, what's happenin?  I already know what you fin' to say bitch""
""Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, only thang you do bitch, is just go to work
Handle my business, get my money, don't give me no problems, everythang gon' be alright""",https://genius.com/Too-short-im-pimpin-lyrics

You took it right away, babe, took my vision from me
Shooting my shot now
Pulling up like I'm Curry, far away, a hand in my face
Baby, let your guard down
I thought about cuffin' when we locked eyes
Far as my attention, girl, you got it

She's the baddest little bitch I ever seen in my life
I couldn't stop staring, I thought about her all night
She gon' make somebody happy, she gon' break somebody's heart
She gon' give you pretty babies if you love her from the start
I lost some good ones, mayne
Keep her if you got her
You want that new pussy but that one you got is hotter
Niggas layin' in the cut, hoping you fuck up
Slide up in your main thang and treat her like a slut
I saw her yesterday, she looked too good
You need to do something wrong, I wish you would
Make her hella mad, so I can tell her that
She fuck with me, I'll buy her better shoes and better bags
And even though I'm not, I'ma hit that spot
I can see her with my eyes closed, she tellin' me ""don't stop""
She's the finest muthafucka I seen in a while
I'm Ray Charles in that pussy, I don't need to see her now

Baby, give me back my eyes, they're on you
Yeah, you got my eyes on you
Girl, you know what I'm trying to do
Give me back my, baby, give me back my
Tryin' to get on you

I love to fool with that shit
Vision hella blurry and I'm cool with that
Poppin' her bubble gum, blow it, babe
Now you see what I see, and I don't see no stop sign
Only you and I are fine, combination's complete
A reason to stop, girl, I just can't see
I thought about cuffin' when we locked eyes
Far as my attention, girl, you got it

No beer-belly fool, we get it all for eats
Cocoa Puff the green leaf, cloud up
We some gangstas makin money, never been a scrub
Whattchu know about sellin dope...
But the only thing you good for now, is droppin the soap
Goldie Loc, Tray Deee, Too $hort, no doubt
Tell 'em how we eat and what we all about, nigga

These hoes know what's up, niggas been havin game
O.G.'s tell me real good, bitch I'm the same
Motherfucker make 'em feel good, ya know my name
Bitch, if ya still could, you'd do the same
Made thirteen albums in a row
Be like Too $hort baby and pimp a ho
It's so easy, if ya know how to get it
You'll never be another broke-ass nigga

We got, top-notch hoes, y'all fools got crack-hoes
We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios
We got, top-notch hoes, y'all fools got crack-hoes
We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios

Fuck a business suit, I'm out to where we juice
Push the Bentley coupe and spend endless loot
Runnin game from the brain or the stainless steel
Pushin Holt's high-heels when we bang the field
With the heat out, jack the whole hood with G-clout
Invisible perimeters for niggas to keep out
You ain't got to ask what the fuck what we bout
Whatever, get the cheddar than an nigga can ease out

I used to be able to jump from the free-throw line and bang
Now I bust and crush tracks, nothin really changed
Except, twelve-inch scars on my body
What I mean by that, I was hit by some hotties (nigga)
Call somebody, I'm layin in this motherfucker bloody
It wasn't because of my shoes, clothes, or money
I was at the wrong place at the wrong time
Paramedics don't know, I was a victim of the crime

Just keep gettin that money mayne
Fuck them niggas, yeah... this how we eat

 Don't be trick, you know these hoes so slick
 Do yo' thang and get rich

 You could slang some rocks, but better change ya spot
 Ask anybody; I stay paid
 Most niggas want pussy, tryna get laid
 Stayin soft with a ho getchu crossed by a ho
 I break a bitch down then I'm off with the dough
 I'm so hungry, I can't wait to eat
 I ride brand new shit down the street
 Life is a game of chess, who plays the best
 is the last one that's laid to rest
 I know you wanna eat good - it ain't hard
 to be a real ghetto superstar
 Focus is the key - if ya want it, it could be
 If ya know where ya goin from the moment you could see

Man look at her, baby look good
The way she dancin, maybe I should
Step up to her, and run this game
I wanna FUCK - I don't wanna know her name
I play the role though, act like I'm interested
By the end of the night, she done been molested
And she loves it, that's how I do it
You tried to get with her too but you blew it
I told her I ain't had no woman, I got three
And you ain't leavin this club without me
Cause I'll be - your breakfast in the mornin
See the sun rise while you're nake and you're moanin
And when I get up, talkin like a pimp
That's when reality, starts to sink in
You want me to fuck yo' pussy 'til it hurts
And I wanna put yo' fine ass to work, bitch

Bitches always tellin me
You're a player (a real player)
I don't care about these other hoes
Just keep fuckin me (keep it up in you, way up)

I can look in yo' eyes and see I got you
You so fine girl I had to knock you
We left the bar, we in the car
I'm treatin this bitch like a movie star
It's all game, I just wanna hit it quick
Try to turn a bitch out so I can hit a lick
And it's a trip, she's such a good bitch
Mama told you bout niggas that look slick
You knew about the hoes when you met me
I'll add you to my stable if you let me
So you can get me, what I need so quickly
I want G's bitch, about a hundred fifty
All these hoes, know my style
I'll put you to work but don't go too wild
Cause we'll get this cash, just take our time
Choose or leave, you better make up yo' mind

Bitches always tellin me (what dem hoes say?)
You're a player (that's right, I'm a fuckin player bitch)
I don't care about these other hoes (na nah)
Just keep fuckin me

You said put it all up in you, keep on fuckin you
Knew what time it was and I knew just what to do
Bitch I get at you, have you stuck like a statue
Use nothin but words and I have you
I give a fuck if you think I'm too rich
I ain't gon' cash you out like these new tricks
She wanna eat, drink and fuck good
That won't make you get my cash, but what would?
If I turned you on to this player life
Quit fuckin rich niggas tryin to be a wife
I can show you how to put this game to work
Don't do it, unless you put some change in yo' purse
Bitch you know whassup wit me
I'm from the O, I roll in luxury
I mack broads, and smoke big buds of weed
Can't be a ho when you always fuck for free, beitch!

You're a player (.. that ain't no lie)

And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say b*** like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word? B***
Why they gotta say it like $hort? B***
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs, stay on the porch

Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my s*** gets around
Leave the country come back and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York and ATL
Houston and L.A., ask Dave Chappelle
About my rich b***, he got her from me
And made 50 million dollars, I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy, you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy

(That's right) Gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life

Smob to the tip, I feel no guilt
She's young and she's fine and she about to get peeled
I know you heard why, no need to tell
You looking at a certified P.F.L
You wanna be like me?  I don't think you can
Your girlfriend loves you, need to be her man
She never told you how she was a Too $hort fan
She kept it to herself, you wouldn't understand
I met her at the mall when she was mad at you
She said, ""Gimme a call"", and I was glad to
That night, I gave your girl a ex tab..
.. the best sex she ever had

I gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life

It'd be nice to wake up to some little smiling faces
Saying, ""Daddy"" - instead of being in wild places
Smoking fatties, four hoes in my Caddy
Each one willing to have me
Sometimes you want my life, sometimes I want yours
I'm trying to find a wife and you trying to find whores
Which one of us is looking in the devil's eyes?
I'd settle down if I could have seven wives
But that's illegal, and everywhere we go
We roll through the town taking every ho
And of course, we show no remorse
I'm doing one-twenty with your ho in the Porsche


'Til death do us part, with all your heart
It was love - right from the start
But could you do it - could you change your life
And get married, stop running game every night?
Ex-player with his wife and kids
Looking happy; I wonder if he really is
I would hate to be committed even though I ain't wit it
Still out in the streets trying to get it
It's hard for a man with access to one vagina
To be faithful, when she's so much finer
Than his wife - she seen it comin'
He fell in love with another woman


I keep coming back to the same thought
Falling in love'll throw the game off
You let her get to you, you know you still care
But I was raised by them real players
I try to tell the homies fuck the party
This player lifestyle ain't for everybody
You gotta make your own choice - it's your life
How would it be without your kids, and no wife?
Waking up with a tramp - you don't like
Nigga, you better hear what I'm saying on the mic
You wanna be a pimp, you better go back home
Leave them tramps alone, you know you're wrong
You're wrong

See your bitch and I’m flirtin’ with her, nigga, yeah
Google my name, ha, see what they say
Been giving ‘em blues, Burger King, you get it your way
These fuck niggas always ask about me
Same ones that be talkin’ ‘bout me
Can’t tell if he ass kissin’, if he dick suckin’ or just money countin’
Money flowin’ like a water fountain
Sticky icky got the money pilin’
Coulda hit, my nigga wrist drownin’
But sittin’ on a nigga thousand island
Fuck nigga sayin’ my name, ones with no game
Mad, you lit the whore, huh
‘Cause I’m with two extra whores, Porsche with the two extra doors
Extra bullets and shells—who you gon’ tell we got in the door?
Be giving ‘em blues, they want an encore

Pull up in something foreign, strip club money stormin’
Where the ones? Keep ‘em comin’
If you ain’t tippin’ then you boring
Just give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues
Just give ‘em the blues
If you a pimp, keep ‘em hoeing
This pimp shit, keep it going
All these trick niggas ain’t knowing
These bitches, we be on ‘em
And get ‘em to choose, get ‘em to choose, get ‘em choose
Just get ‘em to choose, or give ‘em the blues

Yeah, I need all huneds with the blue strips, got ‘em feeling some type of way
His main bitch steady choosing up when she see some real niggas come her way
I’m in the strip club steady tippin’ her; ass fat, I can’t get enough
Kick her out once I get a nut; savage mode, I don’t give a fuck
East Oakland, yeah, that’s what I’m reppin’ nigga—these dudes ain’t bout it bout it
Pullin’ up in that old school; gonna run up on me, man, I highly doubt it
Shorty always tryna spend the night; phone off, give me space, hoe
I’m in the air like a real player, make her do whatever I say so
I need the whip and chains like Django; Fabby scooped me in that Range Rover
Free the bitch, I’m never cuffin’ it; I can show you niggas how the game goes
Town Business if you ain’t know, no time for a lame hoe
Only focus on the bankroll, going places that they can’t go

Pull up in something foreign, strip club money stormin’
Where the ones? Keep ‘em comin’
If you ain’t tippin’ then you boring
Just give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues
Just get ‘em to choose, or give ‘em the blues

I’m pimpin’, she’s hoeing
Great girls, yeah, it’s snowing
Good weed I’m blowing
Smoke too much, now I’m zoning
Fuck too much when I’m boning
Bust a nut, now she own it
Bitch, you want this long dick?
Well, that’s what you gon’ get
All that money, I’m taking it
Can’t fuck with me, you ain’t make this shit
‘Cause meaningful relationships are like aliens and spaceships
Is it real? I’m so sincere
Ain’t no women, just hoes in here
We don’t want the good girls out there
Ask a player, we don’t care
It’s like last week, ask Ashley
I don’t let nothin’ get past me
Twerkin’ all day in them ass cheeks
You a stripper? Don’t flash me
‘Cause my pimpin’, it never ends
New girls, we break ‘em in
Little homies, we make ‘em pimps
Then they pull up in a brand new Benz
BITCH!

If you a pimp, keep ‘em hoeing
This pimp shit, keep it going
All these trick niggas ain’t knowing
These bitches, we be on ‘em
And get ‘em to choose, get ‘em to choose, get ‘em choose
Just get ‘em to choose, or give ‘em the blues",https://genius.com/Too-short-give-em-the-blues-lyrics
Playboy Short II,Born to Mack,1987.0,"Well I’m Playboy S-H-O-R-T
I rap so fresh to the funky beat
I’m always here, the Oakland player
Breakin’ young freaks, baby, I don’t care
I was born to mack, I don’t care what you think
I’m young and fresh and havin’ bank
Too $hort, baby, cold as hell
Down to rap, and so for real
I’m never fake when I break ‘cause I sho’ can rap
Sucka MC’s acknowledge that
I’ll be a star, you’ll be my fan
I’ll treat you like my woman putting bank in my hands
Just an everyday thang from the big O vet
All the players out here tell you that’s no sweat
Rollin’ two-tones, baby, day and night
And I don’t stop rappin’ when I’m on the mic
All the young girls scream, “Short, don’t stop”
Got 75 waitin’ back in my drop
Me and Chic pullin’ freaks from near and far
Even pulled a few freaks for my bodyguard
Eight deep in a limo, jammin’ the beat
Rollin’ on back to the O city
On a one-way trip, if you catch my drift
Straight to the house for the homie’s fix
Too Short baby, on the go
To all you freaks, I know you know
Get busy, or get lost
‘Cause if you come with the crew, you’re tossed
Sittin’ back, she likes my body
I kick on back while I watch her mount me
I come fresh every time I speak
Right at my show, see me pullin’ a freak
I’m gettin’ busy, forget the junk
Too Short baby gotta get that funk
Like a champ in the back, just opened the roof
No champagne, drink gin and juice
There’s a freak show jumpin’ on the old Bay Bridge
Too Short baby all on that bitch
I’m a veteran, baby, in this game
And Too Short baby that is my name
I don’t stop these raps when I’m on the mic
I spit it hard and fresh all day and night
So check it out baby ‘cause it just won’t stop
Too Short baby
She’s a fast mouth bitch, broke ass bitch
Walking around town with a vicious itch
I heard you started hookin’ – where’s your pimp?
Tryin’ to get a hit and ain’t got ten cents
You work all day, so you smoke all night
You know it’s not right but that’s your life
You just steal from your mother, breaking your broad
You think you’re down but you really ain’t hard
Fake mic singer, but you ain’t that
You’re a lowdown, no good dirty rat
So you smoke for a hit and then come right back
You wanna start smoking and only get smacked
Too Short baby, I make G’s
I work leather suits when it’s 90 degrees
See me sweatin’ like a pig, but I’m not trippin’
Jumped in the Benz with the air condition
Turn on the beat and wiggle my toes
And rock that bitch like brand new Vogues
Might saddle up, might ride it tough
But before I'm finished, I will get rough
I’m from the E the S the O, and yes
Freak nasty, I am so fresh
People might tell you I can’t rap
But I roll Benz and my bank is fat
Since I was born, I wanted to be a player
Now I got young freaks everywhere
I’m the M-the A-the C-the K
The truest young player in the USA
Too Short baby, you know I’m hard
Your girl tried to choose me and I dogged the broad
Keep telling yourself couldn’t be like that
But the bitch so sprung on a Too Short rap
I could do what I want, just do what I please
I walk through the door and she’s down on her knees
Players like me play it just like that
My game jumps off and I don’t step back
Too Short baby, on the mic
And I tell ya like this, I’ll tell you right
I’m the Playboy Short, big mack on the mic
Every day of my life fresh raps I write
Gonna chill on out where the players chill
Studio piece in the Oakland Hills
From New Year’s Day to New Year’s Eve
You’ll find me here just rockin’ the beat
With my pen in my hand and my headphones on
And right next to me is the microphone
So when I grab that mic, I just get right up
Hit a few raps while I tear shit up
Like Molly the mopper, the big big bopper
I got her in the bed and I just couldn’t stop her
Too Short raps in your fuckin’ face
The beat’s real funky and you feel the bass
You see I made it, played it, and now it’s out
So just kick on back while I tell you about
This freak I met, her name was Mary
I took her to the house and I popped that cherry
She was so willing but she was so tight
I had to work it and I worked it right
Because that’s my nature, I don’t quit
When the funk hits me, you can’t tell me shit
I’m a player, baby, call me Short
I rock D.C. the way I rock New York
You see the Playboy S-H-O-R-T
Will come just ready with a funky beat
You see I rock L.A. then I hit Detroit
‘Cause I’m the MC mack, the real McCoy
I’m not from New York ‘cause I got my start
Coming straight from Oakland and I still rap hard
So before you say it, I’m warning you, watch it
Whenever I rap, homeboy, I rock it
Just two hot, two fresh beats
Sir Too Short in about two weeks
And in L.A., the jam is played
Way past 2 by your favorite DJ
Two times, and then maybe two more
Everybody wanna hear Sir Too Short
So just turn it up loud and I’ll be coming through
And you’ll find out, baby, that it just takes two
Just two hot, two fresh beats
Sir Too Short in about two weeks
I’m the Playboy Short, the ladies man
Doing it twice for all my names
Funk it up, funk it up and have no fear
A young virgin told me wait two years
But I was outta that place in two seconds flat
All it took was two and I rock her back
Punk bitch

I took homegirl to a drive-in movie
Jumped in the back and freaked her groupie
Had it going on in the back of the hog
Had the radio on and the windows fogged
Have a girl saying, “Short, give me some more”
It only takes two, cool Sir Too Short
Just one MC all by myself
I said it only takes two and I don’t need help

I went to a party – guess who was in it?
Two dumb suckas and in just two minutes
They were on the mic speaking my name
Saying Too Short don’t know the game
But when I got on the mic I said two rhymes
And both of those suckas said “sorry” two times
I couldn’t lie, I tried to be nice
But I just couldn’t help it, I was laughing twice
With just two hot, two fresh beats
Sir Too Short in about two weeks
And the jam is made by one named Too
Fresh as hell and it’s just for you
So just take it, and don’t give it back
‘Cause it’s worth a lot of money with Short on the track
That could only be true, and I have no doubt
It only takes two and I’ll turn you out

Still Strugglin’,The Wood (Music From and Inspired by the Motion Picture),UnKnown,"Intro:
Still strugglin, still hustlin, tryin to get my money on
Fresh outta retirement, you know I ain't tryin to fall off
Too $hort records, we ain't tryin to fall off
We ain't goin nowhere, I'm tryin to see everybody make money
I wanna see everybody get paid, everybody
Chorus:
Another day, another dollar spent
And I'm still out here strugglin
Caught in the game, and I'm just hustlin
Don't even trust my closest friends
Verse One:
Don't ever say you can't do it, it's not that hard
You wanna be a lawyer, you wanna be a star
You can do anything you wanna do
Forget what they say, as long as you believe in you
Keep chasing your dreams, wherever they take you
You gotta hustle, which shouldn't have to make you
Get your money on, like I always said
It's playin like a old song in your head
You say it ain't cool in the hood
I know some folks in the ghetto livin good
Now tell me how you get there, tell the next man, too
You ain't got it, give him yours, cause he got less than you
Give him game, and that's all he need
The knowledge, to plant that seed
And make it grow, get the dough
Even though I make money, I'm trying to get some more
You gotta be the best at what you do,
 and even though you ain't
That's just how you need to think
Don't tell me no, I already made up my mind
It's going down my way this time
I'm so deep into this
It's like I'm in some pussy, fucking my bitch
I've been going platinum, you walk by
You player-hate, don't even try
Chorus
Verse Two:
Don't ever quit, once you get started
It's on til the end, til you're dearly departed
You know you can't quit, too much time invested
You learned your lesson, no time for stressing
Looking in the mirror, trying to act hard
Walking down the street, thinking bout a car
I been there a million times
I'm like baby, Dee, I got a million rhymes
I been a famous MC since 1983
When Run-DMC was singing sucka MC's
Niggas in the papers ride Too $hort
Rolling brand-new Vogues, smoking Newports
$hort studios, in my room making tapes
When I moved up to Oakland from L.A
I was a square, I ain't gotta lie to you
I wasn't rapping, I was fresh outta private school
Now I'm old school, Too $hort, fuck what ya heard
There ain't no way I could memorize all these words
I been rapping for years, spitting game
Twenty years from now, you could say the same thing
If you determined, look at me
I'm getting on the car, used to roll two feet
Back in the day, selling dope fiend
Based on SunnySide, up Ninety-Sixth to Birch Street
Chorus
Verse Three:
Don't ever say it's old, I know you wanna go gold
Trying to be like me is getting old
It's been proven, there's only one Too $hort
Most Valuable Player, you know the sport
It's time to be you, cause being me comes natural to me
I hope you make it in the industry
You could work on Wall Street, or be a doctor in a hospital
As long as you're happy, I know you got a little
Stash, stack your cash
And keep hustling, cause it ain't gone last
How many times you seen a broke nigga, wanting to be a dope dealer
Make some money, and turn into a cold killer
Alot of people came up like that
But alot of y'all faking that ya hold that gat
Now your little ass is out
You finally realized, you took the wrong route
You got alot of talent, don't let it go to waste
Handcuffed on the ground, with dirt in ya face
I know the trap, circumstances make ya sell crack
Shotguns and change, take us all back
To slave-free, back when the days would be
Long and hot, with nobody paying me
These days we have opportunities
To blow up and give back to our communities
Chorus",https://genius.com/Too-short-still-strugglin-lyrics
Coke Dealers,Players,1985,"Now.. I come from the Oakland town
Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down
Young brothers my age making dollars so long
Drive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone
See him draped in gold, we call him Big Bank Bob
Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job
Call him trash, he supplies for the dopefiend's tweak
But what you make in a year he might make in a week
Cold cash money is the answer to life
Feedin fat hovers to a dopefiend's pipe
Gotta keep rollin, just can't stop
Only two worries are a thief or the cops
People keep sayin: it's all so wrong
But the rocks roll strong all night long
Another part of street life, the age old story
And now the coke dealers take all the glory
They're the ones you meet big time on the street
I say the coke dealers are now the elite
See, the average dopehouse will take your soul
Trade it for a rock and do the same with your gold
But if you think about it really it all sounds silly
Smoked out Willie in his washed-up Philly
Open up shop down the block
And everybody's tryin to get a piece of that rock
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Smokin
Coke

Cocaine the demon, it knows you well
Sellin you a trip to a place called hell
You never even thought you'd get hooked
Starin in the mirror, scared to look
You think about life and think it's cold
Like drivin with a flat down a rocky road
Now the rock man is your best friend
The only one you talk to time and again
You even tried dealin, but that's no fun
Before you made a sale it was in your lungs
So the coke dealer now lives on your life
Like a four year marriage you're the man's wife
You can hate it with a passion, but you won't fuss
He's the driver of a Caddy and you're ridin the bus
You think it's not fair, I tell you it is
Cause he bought yours and you bought his
Bought his cars, his clothes, and he bought the coke
Now he looks good and you look smoked
It doesn't take much to realize
All you gotta do is just open your eyes
You're cold bein pimped by a rock in some glass
What's it gonna take before you fall on your ass?
Bankrupt, smoked out, just simply through
Cold street walkin with a hole in your shoe
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Smokin
Cokeland

I once had a homeboy rollin strong
Sold coke all day and all night long
He made a lotta money and bought a lotta stuff
But soon he went broke and it didn't take much
First he started smokin, and all that he figured
Was the more he sold dope, you see his bank got bigger
But my homie thought wrong cause he could be stopped
The vice squad rolled and the boy got popped
He was out on bail before he made it to jail
Wasn't about to do time when he's doin so well
Say he had a lotta money and some real good friends
But he was almost broke when he flipped again
So he got on his grind, he wasn't wastin a day
Opened up shop and started pumpin the weight
He thought about the boys that he could not pay
So he hustled by himself thinkin that's okay
But one night he was chillin with a freak named Carol
His door was kicked in and he was starin at a barrel
The brother with the gun saw him tweak on the base
Walked right up and put the Uzi in his face
He said, ""Give up the dope if you still wanna breathe
I tell you one time, you better listen to me""
As my homie got robbed he lost the fight
And now he's just a smoker probably toking tonight
Coke dealers
Yeah, I'm big time, baby
Smokin
COKE!
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Coke dealers
Big time, baby

In tha Oaktown,Short Dog’s in the House,1990.0,"(Verse 1):
You hear me talking you know I'm from the O-A-K
I tell it like it is and that's the only way
I'm the M the A the C the K I write my rhymes everyday
Now all you one-rap rappers what are you doin'
I got so many raps so just go right thru 'em
My name is Short but I rap long rhymes
Hand me your mic I do it all the time
Now could you be like me I hate to say it
It's like comparin' Mickey D's and Quick Ways
You only got 3 stores I got the whole wide world
I get beeps everyday from your favorite girl
But I'm such a dog I never call tha freak
Hit it once and she was just too weak
At my house I keep finer things
The candy paints, got her sprung on my diamond rings
She could live like a queen if she was Miss Too $hort
Have 2 babies, get child support
But at this point she gets nathin from me
I ain't fakin' it, freak, I'm just makin' the beat
So don't dance, ride the strip
All day long playin' Too $hort hits
Pop in the tape and start ridin'
Silly young freak who started sidin'
In the Oaktown

Oaktown , Oaktown
Oak-Oak-Oak-Oaktown
In the Oaktown

See I'm a true MC, I'm not a MC fool
I'm just rich and famous and way too cool
I get paid to rhyme and I do mean G'z
You don't like my raps don't buy 'em please
I give you no refund cause my bass is phat
Make it hit so hard just like a punch in the back
It's that dopefiend beat got my rap on your plate
Tryin' to bite my style and make a demo tape
Now could you be like me or someone else
Bass hittin' hard like the Freaky Tales
Oaktown style it goes just like this
If you never heard me rap don't trip
Cause I hit the scene with my homie Too Clean
We slap hands like a tag team
Some people say they don't like Cali raps
People like that must be smokin' that crack
I rhyme good it's been 10 long years
Gettin' sick of all that stuff I always hear
Too $hort can't rap, he's from the Westcoast
Between me and you patna I sell the most
So let's take it to the stage and don't get scared
Cause me and Too Clean, we come well prepared
They call me Playboy Short, and the girls I play
Every single day

I could die and you still won't catch up
How you gonna step up when you let them little heffers
Dig in your pocket while they suckin' on your left nut
You a soldier? Nigga I'm a vet, what
I'm old school with a new style
Girls hear me rap and act too wild
But that's how I like 'em, what you wanna do now?
Get you all alone girl and turn you out
You want a man that do all he can
Hold your hand, and take you to the promise land
But I refuse to help you get there
(Good luck) I hope you choose on the best player

Shittin' on 'em
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em beotch!

She said I'm too old, get fucked it's too late
She said tell $hort it's a new day
Bitch I say fuck what you say
I'm from the Old Bay and the New Bay
When you make the wrong choice, who you gon' blame?
I'm all in your ear tellin' you the wrong thing
But you listen anyway, buyin' the dream
You know about us pimps, we be lyin' and things
I don't wanna fight for the bitch Joe
It's all about the game, and who can spit the most
I'm never too faded to hustle
Ball up my fists, and make a muscle
I stay strapped, I don't wanna tustle
Fake ass bodyguard nigga wanna wrestle
Cause you think she's likin' me?
She's goin' hella stupid on this hyphy beat?
And now you wanna fight with me?
Make me mad, and I'ma fuck your wife-to-be
I'm from the Eastside where the Raiders play
Where you get your game from? I say the Bay
You think I'll square up? You can't be hopin'
I'm hard on a bitch, I was trained in Oakland
I never turned in my player card
Ask anybody, they'll say I'm hard
I'm shittin' on 'em

I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em beotch!

You so horny, tryin' to find you a bitch mayne
I'm hustlin', I gotta stay rich mayne
You friendly, like to buy hoes gifts
But I'm mean, I hit 'em with the closed fist
You a sucka, take a bitch on a trip
I kick back, and send a bitch to go get my stack
And you'll never do that
You're weak for a bitch, you better move back
Why they always use you?
Cause you pay 'em, that's what they used to
Man bitches everywhere
Treat niggas like you like teddy bears
You'll get to feel on her and touch her
You always with her but you still ain't fucked her
You fell in love with the bitch last summer
I fucked a few times then dumped her
You tricks, always tryin' to find you a better hoe
I told you, never put the pussy on a pedestal
Them nasty little cum freaks, F 'em
If they wasn't bout the money I left 'em
Burn rubber, I'm drivin' fast
That's my new motto 'cause it's time to smash
I flew past still givin' it gas
Made a right turn, swingin' the ass
I'm shittin' on 'em

I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...

She Loves Her,What’s My Favorite Word?,2002.0,"{*women's voices moaning in ecstasy like porno videos*}

Are you in heaven, or is it real life
Cause ain't nobody ever made you feel like
You can't get enough it, you keep wantin more
Ever since you was young, you felt the need to explore
Baby girl youse a natural, you can't hide it
The way you put that strap on, and let her ride it
Gave her multiple orgasms, witcha vibrator
All five flavors tasted like Life Savors
I know you love her, everything about her
Laid in the bed, you sprinkled baby powder, on the sheets
Smilin, kissin down her spine
Climbed over, and then y'all did the 69
Cause her touch, is nothin like your man's
Soft as a baby when her butt is in yo' hands
And she does, so many different things
Make yo' body start shakin almost instantly

{*women's voices moaning in ecstasy like porno videos*}
 She loves her
{*women's voices*}
 She's lovin her
{*women's voices*}
 I know you love her
{*women's voices*}
 She's lovin it

Sunshine in your life, hope it lasts forever
No bad weather, got her ass on the dresser
Lookin so good, she got you so wet
You might be switchin up the good but you don't know yet
It's a brand new experience, you knew the day would come
Find you a girl, and get you some
If it's her first time, I bet you can't tell
Cause she got down on her knees and licked that thang well
And when you taste her, you can't replace her
Smooth like Remi X-O with no chaser
You look in the mirror, and see your own reflection
Face in her thighs, with no long erection

{*women's voices moaning in ecstasy like porno videos*}
 She loves her
{*women's voices*}
 She loves her
{*women's voices*}
 I know you love her
{*women's voices*}
 She's lovin it

I saw it in her eyes, I could tell the way she smiled
She's thought about these things, it's been a long while
She wants to play witchu, if you can be alone
She turned the radio on to play her favorite song
She didn't take ex pills, smoke weed or drink
Just take your clothes off, and let her kiss that thing
Don't be scared, I see you gettin down like that
On your stomach while you run your tongue around that cat
Y'all can be the Mary Jane Girls, ""All Night Long""
Play the radio with nuttin but the hall light on
It don't stop, juices flowin like a stream
With no man in between, feels like a dream

{*women's voices moaning in ecstasy like porno videos*}

She's never broke, she's a better whore
Asking questions, you tell her more
Buying all that shit that you can't afford
Don't buy that shit, just be like $hort
And tell that bitch she can hit the door
Get the fuck up outta here
When you see her later on, tell her 'bout a player
Break a bitch, pimp a ho
Rubber bands, not envelopes
You had the bitch, you was in the door
She said you too friendly though
You lost your work to  a slick talker
Used to be a mack, you a trick stalker
Bitch just wanna get pimped on
How the fuck you end up in the friend zone?
When I see the bitch, I get cashed out
When I come through, get your ass out

Niggas talkin bout a drop but man I ain't dealin nothin
I'm a self made nigga on the grind in the skreets

From sales to hotels and dough from pote(?)nail
Pay everybody bail, ain't no spendin time in jail
Been around the world, y'all niggas ain't seen all the shit I seen
Them girls, send them to Essence cause they sixteen
I'm comin through a couple bars to pimp them nipplezeens
In Southern Benz, S-Class, know what the fuck I mean?
A pimper, a stankin shriver(?) a Jack Tripper
A candy sweet dipper playin with cock and suckin on nipples

How we stayin on top? You cain't make me tell
And no we don't claim to be the biggest stars

Tryin to, find a way to be my friend
Climb in her vagina so deep, I'm in
And all these mad rappers tryin to flag me down
I throw a piece sign, I'm 'bout to turn back around
But I keep flyin, lil' homey keep rhymin
While you keep whinin, when you see me big timin
Cain't keep it to myself, man I had to tell
You still rappin in my ear, I'm still mad as hell

 I was fuckin supermodels when I was in 6th grade
 I fucked four thousand bitches

 Bet you never met a nigga like me

Bitch
And it don't stop
To the beat, baby
Oakland, California is in the house
Bitch

I tell you, nobody does it better than Too $hort
I got so many raps, I know you can't have more
Cause I grew up on the mic, I spent my whole life
Writin raps, late at night
And I never would make no fake LP's
Sucker MC's don't make no g's
They make weak, weak raps, and need to quit
22 songs, and only 3 on hit
Frontin on me like you want some
Better sell a million records, go platinum
Cause I wouldn't waste my time on a one-rap rapper
You wanna get with me, you gotta climb that ladder
But you ain't nothin but a joke
Rappers make money, tell me why are you broke?
We get paid like a muthafucka, and we get
A brand-new house full of brand-new shit
A brand-new car in my brand-new driveway
I always keep the top down on the highway
Too $hort, baby, known everywhere
Had a life-long dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was everyday, 'just make that pay'
12 years later, still in the game
And you never talk down on a player's name
Cause I'm (Too $hort, Too $hort)

You see, I'm fresh like always with funky beats
I say what's up to the brothers on 10th Street
It's goin down in the Oakland town
Home of the infamous Too $hort sound
So keep your jealous-ass thoughts in your diary
And if you're lookin for a leader, you can hire me
And if your so-called boss don't pay
The only thing you need to say
Is ""I quit, I'm through with you""
Pack up your raps, and join the Dangerous Crew
We got mo' beats than the average joe
And a 24-track studio
So forget what you heard, and we'll see it's on
Oakland, California can't leave me alone
Cause I'm the most rappin, most rhymin
Sold my drop-top, but I'm still high-sidin
I'm (Too $hort, Too $hort)

Now that I've established my career
I wanna help some other brothers out here
Hook em up and let em make some dough
Flip Benzes and turn out shows
Cause Oakland got talent, fool
MC's in elementary school
Not to mention musicians and singers
And Shorty B with his magical fingers
We get funky like skunk weed
Light it up, hit it, and get keed
This dopefiend beat will get you high
If it don't go gold too soon, I'll cry
If the bass ain't deep, somethin's wrong
It must not be a real Too $hort song
Cause the first thing I do when I make my tape
Is drop a few kicks from my 808
And when my tapes hit the store, they sell so quick
You can tell by my big fat royalty check
It's just a Dangerous thing when I'm on the mic
And the local police don't even like
The way we hit your town, it's so funny
It's all about makin big money
So before I go, you should remember this

Haha, we do it live ya heard me? Haha

I got that old game, but I don't need Viagra
Spit a few lines in no time I'll have ya
If I don't, I find a new bitch
And if you tryin to get back it's useless
I can't do shit, unless you pay me

Ain't nuttin changed, it's still a pimp thang
And if you ain't wit it, you must be insane

Yeah you might talk like a pimp, walk with a limp
But look - you bout old as the game
Short Dawg shit is all in your name
And fuck dick, cause it all be the same
Shit, I be the one to get in your brain
To make you know you ain't shit
You got a Benz, I got a Jag, so what?
You got hoes, I got niggas to cut
And I treat 'em like prostitutes and sluts
Take it from Chyna; niggas ain't shit but dick and nuts

Yeah baby.. I always respect the game
That's why bitches, always let me hit that thang
I hit it good, I hardly ever keep in touch
Top notches, it's hard to believe I fuck
But I did it, every time I see her I get it
I know you heard Short Dawg got digits
Don't forget it, I'm all about the pimp shit
I ain't no sucker with a limp dick

Fuck the dumb shit, niggas they come quick
9th Ward bitches always get they cunt licked
You know the game, if you get a ho it's probably from the fame
Ugly niggas pretty bitches you know the aim
I got niggas with my name tatted on they chest
And I don't give a fuck about another bitch cuz I'm the best

Back to back with a Lex, lettin off tecs, ya heard me?

What what game recognize game baby
What what all my thugs let 'em hang baby
Chyna White and Too Sheezy off the chain baby (ya heard?)

I been spittin this game since about 2:40
It's a quarter to 3, whatchu gon' do shorty?
Choose on a player or roll with a square
I'm tryin to holla at you, fuck them hoes over there
I wish I could get you outside in my truck
Put my hang between your legs maybe then I'll fuck
You know whassup, I'mma see you next time
Droppin sex lines, so I can fuck one time

Nigga how many times you done seen ""The Mack?""
How many times you gon' think with your sac
Then talk with your genitals?
I run with strictly criminals
Top notch bitches, in drop top sixes
I'm from New Orleans, where bitches put shit in your greens
Bury your drawers, shatter your dreams, make you stop eatin
Cabbage and beans, dolla dolla what them know bout the cream
And fuck the worl cause it ain't what it seems (ya heard?)

Still wear perms with big old waves
Three or four hoes in a mini-van
Ridin round tryin to get all I can

When I say funk session, i ain't talking about George Clinton
I love that nigga though
I ain't talking about James Brown and Sly Stone
I'm not talking about mother fucking the Time and Prince
(What you talking about?)
We talking about funk session 96 style
96 funk mean a different thing
That means you looked at my woman, and I'm stepping to you
And you about to pull out the gat and try to blow a nigga's brains out
Too Short:
You see we can't along cause we just don't want to
You cross the game and my crew will just stomp you
It's ignorant, but we just say oh well
And the white man keeps on building more jails
I know the system ain't nothing to fool with
Cause you locked up all my homies that I went to school with
And I know damn well you got my name on the list
Cause I'm the one that called your daughter a bitch
Just a black man doin good, you wanna do me
Before you ban rap you need to ban them violent movies
Gangsta rap causes crime, Mike Tyson wrecked the system
Larry Hoover ran a gang in Illinios can't forget
Malcom X taught us knowledge, Martin Luther preached for peace
And every day black men lying dead in the street
So where's the real education, in the hood
Peace to the muslims cause they're doing real good
They're never giving up, on the black folks
We need to buy our own land and try to stack dough
Get rich if you want to, I ain't trying to front you
If Robert Dole want some funk tell him come through
It's been a long night but we're still getting funky
Who opened up the cage and let out the monkey
I heard it when she said it, ""You just a dogg Short
Like them G's out in South Side Chicago""
I said that's right ho, I'm from the East O
And I will never spend my money on a six-fo
High performance, is what I'm riding
I got the game from Oakland so I never stop siding
I'm getting money in this criminal's country
Ho's show me love because my pimping's so lovely
I'm not a role model, unless you trying to mack her
Cause first I am player and second I'm a rapper
Third I'm just a big ass baller
Top notch on my beeper but I still won't call her
Cause I got one with me, And I'm a pimp till I die
Don't be talking to them snitches, you'll get sent on a lie
Doing time in the pen for some backstabbing
I wonder what would happen if they catch em
You burn his balls with a big lighter, get the gasoline
And he'll be smoking like a mother fucking dope fiend
Nowaday's they like to kill your whole crew
For coming to the party and stepping on a shoe
He said excuse me, but it wasn't al-right
So now you want to take his punk ass outside
So you can hit him, and with him
Let his momma bury him in a suit that don't fit 'em
You don't give an F-U-C-K
So just fuck him
Didn't have to shoot him, just walked up and stuck him
Knife up and down all around in his gut
Standing in his blood looked down and said ""What's up?""
What's up nigga, Shock G tell 'em like Treach
Shock G:
East coast niggers are the craziest
And West coast niggers are the craziest
And down south niggers are the craziest
It seems like all american niggers are the craziest
It done got out of hand
We don't drink that potion at the white mother fucking masses
Immediate and cooked up for us and now we killing each other
Remember me all, I want everybody to look back
Yo this is Shock G from Digital Underground
I want you to look back right now
We rolling with the Dangerous Crew
I want you to look back when I said
Y'all remember that shit when I said, I said ah
America, Get busy Humpty yeah
The red the white the blue and the blue and red for crips and bloods
The white for whose got you doing time
We busting caps on one another and it never stops
You know it never stops
But you know, that Shock's been searching for someone
Who can rise like Malcom and Farahkan
To straighten you niggers out
Shit they call me MC Blowfish
Back when Digital Underground first started
Say, I was running the whole thing, say
The call me MC Blowfish hey
Yeah, and I kick a little thing like this
I say, I say, I say, I say
Shorty check me out
I say, I say
Now follow as I slip into that butter melody
This is the part Shock takes your heart and leaves you vision blurry
So try to focus on my dope
I suggest that you invest in a telescope
As I come with hella rhythm
Move closer to your television
Get your look just like that hooker catch Jay ism
Even with my vocals for your ears, you still couldn't see me though
As I flavor rub this vidy like oregano
I'm slanging them nouns and verbs
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I guess I'm just a little different cause I do love them hoes
Just maybe not the same way I love my niggeros
Cause I love it when they say something fly
The ill caps make me laugh till I cry
Some frys and some freaks and it's on
All night long
I love to see my homies living strong
But then that cook with that cloudy cookbook
Rains salts on another brother's sunny day
I'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely G game we play
I said I'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely G game we play
Cause it's hella fun here, I'm not going to front on that
Yeah, niggers have booming fun
Flossing and fucking with these hoes and capping niggers
But wheres we heading as a people
Where is we heading
This is the funk session y'all
Check me out
This is Shock G from D-Flow production Squad
Cooling right now with the Dangerous Crew
Yeah I got my man Breed in the house
Breed bought to roll a fatty while my man Shorty B get on the 6 string
And blow your mind, Yeah
I got Pee-Wee in the house
And you know what Pee-Wee said
He said, He said Shock, You know that...(fade out)",https://genius.com/Too-short-funk-session-lyrics
Female Funk,Don’t Stop Rappin’,UnKnown,"Hey there baby what's that haps
I never saw a girl looking good as that
I said you look so fine and your hair so long
When I see you baby I'll gonna sing this song
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk

I tell you about a freak that I met
Short got vicious when the funk got wet
She's the one I won't forget
Gotta get that funk like it ain't no sweat
Like a seven eleven on a non stop street
The first young tender was a true blue freak
Cuz the funk will never quit
When the funk gets mean can't tell me shit
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk

The second tender that I had
Talk about fine, that girl was bad
But young tender and Sir Too Short
Gotta get that funk everyday at four
Cuz a brother like me can't do without
That funk, that jump, there's just no doubt
She once was yours but now she's mine
But when I get that funk I sing this rhyme
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk

The third young tender that I pulled
Couldn't understand that Taurus's the bull
Big time rapper that's what I am
But in that funk I'm superman
The dirt young tender she's the one
For two whole days she had me sprung
Working that funk like I know I should
Just sing that song when the funk gets good
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk

The next young tender was the fourth
So much love for Sir Too Short
The fourth young tender I regret
The girl got scared when the funk got wet
Without that funk what's to play
Sleep, and eat, and work all day
Give me that funk and I might just shout
Sir Too Short just turned you out
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk
Too S-H-O-R-T female funk is all I see
Baby and Short all night long
Give me that funk and sing that song
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk
F-U-N-K female funk is what I said
Funk, funk, give me some more
You get a lot of funk when you're named Too Short
Give me that funk give me a lot
That funk, that jump will never stop
Just give me that funk, don't be wrong
Everywhere I go they sing this song
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk
I gotta get more gotta get in her
Told my homie about the fifth young tender
Called me up on the telephone
And said ""Sir Too Short I'm all alone""
I said there's no need to say anymore
Getting real funky is up to Too Short
The true emcee is who I be
Working that funk to the female beat
Funk  I gotta get that funk
Female funk
Thirty eight, twenty four, thirty six
All my tenders are extra thick
Work that funk if you dare
Cuz my young tenders got funk to spare
Watch your step you just might slip
Sir Too Short on a tender tip
Got to get that funk with that G
When the funk gets hot just sing that beat
Funk  gotta get that funk
Female funk
The next young tender down the line
Is just a fan who loved my rhyme
She saw me rolling so so hard
Recognized game in the start
There's no time so the story goes
I rolled that freak like to's and fro's
Cuz I'm a vet not a punk
Sir Too Short just rock that funk
Funk  gotta get that funk
Female funk
Female funk, seven days, twenty two times, twenty-three what
Smooth in motion around the clock
Sir too short just rock that cock
Funk  gotta get that funk

Where the bitches at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Yeah, where they at?
Where the hoes at? Where they at?
Where the bitches at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Verse 1: (Captain Save 'Em, Too $hort)
Captain Save 'Em:
Yall niggas always talkin bad about a breezy
Talkin bout that young-ass, rich-ass nigga Too Sheezy
Always callin a woman out a name
Callin her a ""bee-eye-itch"", now thats a shame
What if somebody called your woman that?
Youd be all up at the century club boy with your stri-nap
Talkin bout ""I'll never save a ho""
Then why you have that breezy drivin your big-body benz for?
You say you only out to get some head, and then to stab
But I see you up at Monty's feedin her lobster and crab
They say that Captain is a playa's worst enemy, so whats next?
You just mad cuz I got more hoes than you got diamonds on your rolex
Too $hort:
I realize after makin 6 platinums in a row
The shit was easy, so I had to get some mo'
I never did like stiff hoes
I fuck like a rap, ain't no quick flows
I'm a California nigga, born and bred
Got a wild imagination when I'm on the bed
I love my woman, I love her girlfriend and her sister
Felt on her mommas booty but never kissed her
Been mackin on these hoes since the 8-0's
It don't take much for me to break hoes
You must be dreamin, if my bitch chose you
We in another lifetime, my game is foolproof
It won't happen, as long as she's my bitch
I give a fuck if you fake pimps peep my shit
Cuz I'mma mack these hoes like never befo'
And everytime I grab the mic I gotta better flow
Hook
Verse 2: (Too $hort)
I went from rappin about the clothes I was wearin at a party
To all the hoes that let me see their naked bodies
It's not an overnight transition thing
I wasn't born pimpin hoes wearin pinky rings
Never walked around sayin ""Who am I?""
Cuz when I seen old movies like ""Superfly""
It was my destiny, to live a pimp legacy
And reach levels other niggas never see
In '81 I rapped friendly, but now its on
One day I said somethin on the microphone
About sixteen hoes, suckin ten toes
People loved it, thats how the story goes
It's true, in 1982
Me and Freddy B sold the tapes to you
X-rated, talkin bout bitches and thugs
All the dope-dealers gettin rich sellin drugs
Too $hort bumpin in the background
You thought I retired, bitch I'm back now
Like a house party, or a side show
I got the spanish, black and white hoes
Ask an East Oakland nigga, I bet you he know
""Is she mixed with japanese or fillapino?""
I always spit the game when I rap
All I wanna know is where the hoes at?

Don’t Hate the Player,You Nasty,2000,"Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
Everybody talkin bout they gettin hated
All these lies is bout who they been datin
If you never was a player, I cain't hate you
You know life is one time, you cain't take two
You seem to think cause you ain't fuckin mo'
That some other nigga's all up in yo' ho
It ain't yo' fault, did you do that?
You think yo' ex-bitch, gon' ever take you back?
Hell naw, you still thinkin you a player
You only got one girl;
You just a square from nowhere
You starin at the ground, fuck the ceiling
Love is the word that describes yo' feelings
You're hooked, you can't leave her alone
You're like O.J., wait til he brings her home
You wanna kill her, but you don't wanna play the fool
You never was a player, we cain't hate you
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
What you mad at?  Your bitch let me have that
And I ain't even say shit about your fat ass
She chose me, don't get an attitude
It really ain't got nuttin to do witchu
I'ma fuck her - anytime I wanna
Like a dog, I'mma climb up on her
She don't sweat me bout my other broad
But you called her on the phone and said I'm just a fraud
I beat up hoes and I'm a rapist
Then you told all your homies how I hated
Damn nigga!  I don't even know you
I seen you actin like a groupie at a show or two
I know she knows, the way you lied
Last time I hated it was 1985
I was young, caught up with a bad bitch
I took my time, learned the game, I had to have the shit
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
She said you had a little dick, and can't fuck
Other niggas fuck her good, but you ain't up
Can't do that stuff with a freak, can't never be weak
Cause a nigga like me'll put a dick in her cheek
And to the beat, I start humpin on her face
Grab her by the ears and then give her a taste
Yeah nigga, I fucked her and she's mine now
You know I been a dog for a long time now
But I ain't gon' fight you for this pretty ho
You think somebody player hated, you don't get it though
Just can't figure it out, and you never will
Your bitch went out and found her a better deal
Said it was cool, kickin it witchu
But she has more fun when she's lickin on dude
I hate to be rude, but you know the rules
Life is the game nigga - you lose
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)

F**k Faces,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases

You know what I'm saying baby
It's either now or never

This My One,Get Off the Stage,2007,"UHH~! Where I stay they gotta temper they locks
Get they hair done down at Nappy or Not (BAY AREA!!!)
No funk abusin the cops
Droppin off yola in the Wal*Mart parkin lot (parkin lot)
Hustle in our arteries, re-up and re-cop (cop)
Cemeteries, mortuaries, tryin to get guap' (UHHH)
Drugs, fetti and sex
Chicken one day, fed goods the next (UHHH~!)
I got a cold conversation
Could talk a cop out a ticket in front of the police station
My niggas KNOW I'm a patient
When you're funkin or beefin all it takes is a little patience
(UHHH) Gotta be slick and sly
I ain't gon' kill nuttin, and I ain't gon' let nuttin die
Looted up, suited up, rap for fun
Wanna hear this black right here? Nigga say, this my one

Droop-E made the black, Sic'Wid'It hog
Who that rappin on the track? 40-Wat' and $hort Dawg

{We gotta get it how we get it} this my one
{Like the beat hear knocks} this my one
{Got 'em all in the clubs yellin} this my one

Things can't stay the same
Somebody gotta break the chain
Put some big money back in the game
We havin big money and we at it a-gain
But can you handle it mayne
Or would rather be grimy doin scandalous thangs?
You wanna ball, you can't tell him he ain't
Cause if the music don't pay he gon' sell 'em the 'caine
All the crack babies are growin up now
They got ADD, throw it up and act wild
Extra hyper, she asked me if I like her
Slow down girl, you move faster than a Viper
You're too freaky, you're way too sleazy
You could make some money but you give it up easy
Can't even get a coke dealer
You a broke bitch fuckin with a broke nigga!


UHHH... I play my position
So much throb in the trunk got the CD player skippin
(CD player skippin) I'm smokin and sippin
Hood life, speed bumps in the residential district
UHHHHH~! Pimpin this the anthem
Got the Chrysler lips, lookin like a phantom
Like a PHANTOM!! I burn rubber on a hater
If it ain't about yaper I'm hit the 'ccelerator

Me and E-40, we rap for money
On funky-ass tracks with slappin drumbeats
Pay me up front cause I'm not a dummy
Promoters like bitches when I'm hot they want me
... And that's all the time
I stay on tour, knockin all the dimes
I can't name 'em, the list is long

The Old Fashioned Way,What’s My Favorite Word?,2002.0,"What you rhyme mayne?  You always spend G's
How much cash you got that you can lend me?
Think I'll pay you back, think you flossin hard
When you ridin down the strip in yo' boss's car?
With your silver chain on and your fake diamonds
Cain't do it right but you stay tryin
You got big dreams, to hit a lick quick
And buy a brand new house, but you ain't get shit
Wouldn't even know what to do if you had bread
How to be a baller - can you pass the test?
There's more than one way to hit the top
Trunk full of dope nigga don't get stopped
Take it to the house and bag it up
Make that money and stack it up
Or spend it all in one place, what you want from me?
I can't tell you how to run yo' company
And don't start bitchin bout Too $hort
What the fuck I wanna listen to you fo'?
Look at you, you ain't all that successful
Them plates ain't made out of Cristal
You just regular, plain ol' frontin
You come from nowhere and you don't claim nuttin
Stop bein phony, actin hella hard
Girl at the mall, maxin your credit card
Answer your cell phone, now you smilin
Talk to your girl, man it's been a while
Since she left to go shoppin, girl where you at?
She out havin lunch with a player mack
I'm in the background, don't trip partner
Just munchin on the lunch that your bitch bought me
She don't love you, she just used to you
Got your mom and them wonderin what she do to you

I don't pay hoes, I turn 'em
I teach hoes, you learn 'em
How we get them hoes, don't concern 'em
The old fashioned way, we earn 'em
I been in the game, I did it
I'm true to the game, I'm so committed
I got a lot of hoe money, where you get it
The old fashioned way, I just spit it

I'm pimpish, I never let hoes pimp me
I let one bitch get me, and instantly
She dipped to Mexico, I'ma get you hoe
I'ma find you and check you like a physical
I'm not a doctor, but I cut a bitch open
With this game have her broken never quit hoein
A bad habit, I picked up along the way
Break a bitch, and make a new song every day
I do my own thing, I'm original
I was ""Born to Mack"" when I came in the do'
Just so you know, I got the game from the East
Lake Merritt(?) to Sobranny(?) in them East Oakland streets
Took my game on the road, became a millionaire
Tell the world get ready for a real player
And so it happened, I grabbed the mic and start rappin
Make that money keep stackin
I made a new album, fourteen times
Hoes screamin out Too $hort keep rhymin
I got rich screamin BITCH
My favorite word; I hear it on - E'RYBODY shit
And when they say it like me, I couldn't want mo'
Send a special thanks out to yo' Uncle $hort
Do yo' thang nephew, y'know I'm down witcha
Stay strapped, watch yo' back, don't let the town getcha
And when you get mad, try to use your brain
Get some street etiquette, don't abuse the game
You know us real ones, you know we never bite
When these hoes start shit you know we never fight
Cause I'd be layin on the ground feelin real silly
All I did was fuck his bitch, that nigga still killed me
And even though I know a sucker spent all his cash
Just so he could fuck and try to get some ass",https://genius.com/Too-short-the-old-fashioned-way-lyrics

Say you make a lot of money and can't stack enough
Spend it on the strippers and the prostitutes
Do what you gotta do
No SoundScans, got your record label hot at you
They droppin' you, two years ago we was poppin' you
You was talkin' shit about nobody stoppin' you
I told the lil homie a long time ago
If you put your mind to it, you can find some dough
It don't matter, even if yo' pockets kinda low
All you gotta do is knock a fine ass ho

I'm talkin' cold cash money, nothin' else'll do
Get my money bitch, you better fuck him 'til he's through
Make that trick come quick, and don't stop him
And if he's slippin', you better rob him
Go out and turn another date, don't hesitate
You know daddy loves you when you keep my money straight
You ride the best cars, eat good, and drink fat
You can't do this shit without me, don't you ever think that
Recognize my bald head and my gangsta limp
Damn, it feels good to be a pimp

Lay on yo' back bitch, and get my cash

I want the money, I ain't tryin' to get laid
Ain't nothin' new about this shit, it's the oldest profession

Can I Hit It,Chase the Cat,2001.0,"She's a BEITCH!  Say what, bitch?  Don't get it twisted
Sup with that little crazy man - it is what it is
Yeah, yeah - tryin to get with that mayne

You call that a dance?
Look like you're fucking the Invisible Man
I wanna put my hand - in between your legs, and grip it
Stick my finger in you, see if you with it
So I can hit it - know what I mean?
Freak nasty, all on my thing
I never seen nothing like that
I'm looking at the cat - it's looking phat
But don't doubt me, 'cause when I put my mind to it
I take my time, I run a line through it
(And what?) Get up in them guts
I make you scream while I'm fuckin it up - beitch!

I wanna fuck this bitch; I wanna hit that shit
I want her to suck my dick - can I get it real quick?
I wanna fuck this bitch; I wanna hit that shit
I want her to suck my dick - can I get it real quick beitch?

She's shaking that ass, but she ain't no whore
(What is she?) She's on the dance floor wanting more
(She's a freak) Alcohol
She went to sit down and was about to fall
She's too drunk - but that's cool
I'm bout to take her to the old school
Big freaking (yeah)
At the house drinking (yeah)
I do this every weekend
And on the weekdays, I do the same thing
Getting all this love that the game brings
I cain't sing - but my songs made me rich (pimping)
Now watch me break this bitch!


I walked up to her, and said, ""Whassup?
I love the way you dance, I bet you can fuck""
That's when she blushed, I started spitting it
Give me two hours, I'll be hitting it (up in it)
Getting it, while the getting is good
I made her grab my dick, I knew she would
And when she felt it - it was on
She said, ""Take me home"" (sure did)
And two rubbers later, she was whipped (whipped her)
Forever my bitch
But don't trip - cause I ain't (I ain't tripping)

Most of these niggas, I came with some hoes
Hell nah they don't know me, askin' is he with us
Back in the day groupies was always bitches
Just throw 'em all 'cause you can't warn 'em
Why you wanna be on stage with me? You ain't performin'
I don't come to your job, tryin' to flip your burgers
I can handle this crowd, I don't need your service
You wanna be my dancer, you must be trippin'
If you ain't got big titties, why you up here strippin'?
You better take that shit back where you came from
Throw it up nigga... go 'head, bang on me
Just get off the stage

Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage

You wanna hug me, and take pictures
Talkin' bout you love me, I like bitches
You jumpin' round like we rehearsed this
When I called the girls to the stage you was the first bitch
All in my ear, askin' bout a after party
I'm tryin' to do a show man, back up off me
Security shouldn't even get paid
I watched 'em push the ladies back and let these niggas on the stage
They'll tell you tomorrow, exactly how it happened
They was all on stage with me, while I was rappin'
Gave me women and weed, then we dipped to the pad
But all that really happened was they made me look bad
Get off the stage bitch

Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage

When all the rappers come to town you wanna stand next to 'em
What you swingin' on his nuts for man, what you doin'?
Go back in the crowd, and stand with your homies
I got niggas out there and damn you don't even know me
At first, you was just chillin' on the side
Now you next to me, you must be feelin' alright
I don't lip sing, everything I do is live
Your name is Too $hort? Then motherfucker who am I?
Why you celebratin'? Raisin' both your arms
You gon' help later? You ain't makin' no songs
You ain't the manager, on the turntables
You don't dance for the group and you don't work for the label

You know I loaded it with the gun, pop pop..
Aiyyo, LET'S GO!!!
Here we go y'all
New shit new shit, out the door y'all
Shorty Pimp, E-Dub once again
So buy you some of this ghetto slum
Underground music from A-T-L
X rearranged it, Shorty B played it
Me and Short laid it, my niggas OK'd it
Carnefious Crawfish, next to slay it
Damn right! We do it all day bitch
Ride around in Benz's, twenty inch rimzes
What Short told y'all, New York to California
We put them high beams on ya - parking lot pimping
With the boom-boom twelve inches kicking, we stay hitting
Huh? The most consecutive
Fifteen albums, we're the executives
Who talking money?

Let's do it baby
Me and Short Dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shooting all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, E and Short be on fire!
Everything we do is fire!
This song is on fire! YO!

Bitch! That's my favorite word
I cashed a million dollar check on Thursday the third
Now it's flowing like water out the kitchen sink
I make more money every time you blink
Got you scratching ya head, made you stop and think
He couldn't made all that he must have robbed a Brinks
We been around so long, making funky songs
Now you getting mad, say this can't be going on
How come E and Short get to stay in the game?
Don't ever talk down on a player's name
So when you see us on top of every chart
You know we been number one since the very start
We feed families when we rhyme
, celebrate like champions
You see mine - I never worry
I don't want the stress, you know my story
I learned how to ball from the best

Let's do it baby
Me and Short Dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shooting all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, East coast be on fire!
West coast be on fire!
Down south be on fire! YO!
(Detroit, Chi-town!)

Don't stop the song now It's not over
I must leave the scene wrecked, before closure
Highest doja, L.A. weed
Monopolize the south like L.A. Reed (BITCH!)
Sick individual, this here be the Southwest coast
East coast material
Erick Sermon, that's what I said man
Fuck with Short and I and be a dead man

This is fire, pass it to me
It's so hot, E lemme hit that weed
Uptown, hydro is in my genes
It's like green, I just might be a fiend
'Cause I been trying to O.D. lately
And you're never gonna rehabilitate me
On a mission since the eighth grade
Keep getting high and stay paid

Let's do it baby
Me and Short Dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shooting all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, tonight is on fire!
The roof is on fire!
These hoes be on fire!
Yo, Crawfish!

It's the lawless, flawless
Carnefious Crawfish
Number one draft pick
Master this rap shit
Getting to this cabbage
Like rabbits
And stack these Carats
You don't want no static
From the wood to the glen
From a hood to a 'Benz
You don't want me vexed at you
Better keep me your friend
I'm ?
New comer with four stars
E-Double and Short Dog
Running for Short Dog
Never ? more, dog
Nigga staring at me, vexed and shit
Like you want some more, dog
Give me the smack nigga watch me eat the ?
Nah, fuck that shit, I'm going to defeat the ?

I heard short dog settled down and tied the knot
You think I'm dreaming
You think I fade 'em all and lied a lot
My real friends know
I always try to find me a woman
But everywhere I go
Bitches try to slide me something
Now listen up, I try to make it quick
I tell you about my greatest hits
My latest flick, was a porno
Cuz I reached that level
I fulfilled all my fantasies
I passed several.. beautiful women
Im a thrill seeker, a pro player
My speciality is ex cheerleaders
Dancers, gymnasts, and ballerinas
They all hot like some halapenos
If I released the names and pictures
Of all the bitches
Drop everything you doing
And call the missus
She was young when she met me
So don't hate her
Im an entertainer
And a master manipulator

Wine and laughs
Candle-lit bubble baths

Way before you knew your bitch
Shes kinda fast
I still wanna do your bitch
Take a chance, sit down and have a seat
You know the saying 'dont bring your girl round me'
Did you think my greatest hits was gonna be some songs?
Nope, just some stories about a bunch of thongs
Fo sho
Shes the type that you haad to marry
You walked in the room and said Halle Berry
Thats what she looked like
So I put my thing up in her, rolled over and said good night
When I woke up in the morning, she looked the same
So I did the same thing to her, hooked her mayn
I hit her two best friends first
Thats what I did
She heard I was good in bed
Thats what they said

From 14-41, 4'11-6 feet
Lil mama was a big freak
The 6 footer had her time with me
I got some supermodel head on miami beach
Then I fingerfucked the woman on the plane next to me
When it landed, the flight attendant had sex with me
And they ask 'is it the pimp in you?'
I hit reporters morning after interviews
Checking in, lil cutie at the front desk
All in my face, lookin like she wants this
Later on, she asks me to play her a song
Getting nasty in my room with her uniform on
I been with roommates, sisters, EVEN twins
Next door neighbours ??? and best friends
I got passed around the crew, WILLINGLY
Until this very day they all feeling me

What’s a Pimp?,Married to the Game,2003.0,"Damn
Sometimes we lose some good ones mayn y'know?
They don't really understand this playerism
Just gotta break it down to 'em, keep it real y'know?
I'm a P-F-L, sworn to the P.I

I spent so many days with you, so many nights
It's nice, I wanted you to be my only wife
We didn't make it, I couldn't take it
I tried to square up, it's too hard I couldn't fake it
And now I see why, since I was knee high
I swore to live and die by the P.I
And I'm stayin true, born in this game and it's payin too
I wish I could have stayed witchu
But it's over, I love you and I still care
We can kick it any time, but I'm still a player
... damn you got that look I like
I tried to settle down it felt like you took my life
I left town, I got women all around
While I was out soul-searchin, guess what I found?
The more hoes the merrier, you think I wanna marry her?
Bitch that sounds scarier and scarier
I need to have a few wives
Cause I don't wanna come home and tell you lies
In my heart I think I found her if she feels the same
You think I've changed, think I'd play her if I'm still in the game?
Hell yeah!  One woman, I don't think so
I let the game be my wife, and I'm faithful
I never do her wrong, I never cheat on her
And if the game was baseball, I'd be on first

(I see you watchin this) I see you watchin
(I know it looks real hot up in here) It's pimpin baby
(But what's a pimp?) Oh you know
(I say but what's a pimp?)
(They wanna be like this) They wanna be like this
(I know it looks real fly up in here) It's real fly
(But what's a pimp?)
(I say but what's a pimp?)

It's like this
I don't lie, I told you what I felt at the time
I wasn't high, I know you see yourself in my rhymes
A lot of women I dealt with, could hear these words
And realize there's no way I could still be hers
Unless you wanna share me with a hot one named Tarrie
And don't get mad at me when I'm out poppin cherries
I know some ladies they just wanna have babies
Collect child support from rich men in Mercedes
It's cool, but that's not what players do
Get with me, those days are over, I swear it's true
You're through, havin sex for nothin
Hopin some day some man'll give you somethin
Your own bank account - don't laugh, it's not funny
You only fucked with him cause he got a lotta money
But you never get paid, don't lie to me
You just look good, and you get to ride for free
What you eat and what you drink, you trade for sex
Pick you up in the Benz, next day in the Lex
Are you happy?  Do you think you're, on a roll?
Do you love your life?  Are you achievin any goals?
Or are you sad, mad cause it ain't your way?
Call mom and dad they'll be glad that you ain't gon' stay
Or call me, I got a solution
Choose me and then hit the top with your new man
 w/ variations

I don't have fantasies, just needs
I need more than one woman to please
And she's like a love roller coaster, the thrill never lasts
And I always seem to find some better ass
Some bitch that can suck better, get wetter
She got them super skills to do anything you let her
So I'm done with you, I still care
I love you baby but I'm still a player
I always been aware and I never been scared
Found some magazines on the top they said Player$
I was young but I was old and I wanted those hoes
Found out playin with girls was mo' fun with no clothes
You can call it what you want to, Doctor or House
Hide and Go Get It, then I'm knockin it out
If she ain't widdit, I find another little chick
I'm quick to switch, even when I was six
I had a backup bitch, when my bitch would trip
I'd go play with my other girlfriend and get me a kiss
And at the age of thirty-six I'm to the same old tricks
Too $hort baby no the game don't quit
I'm playin games with these lame brains
Treatin superstars, like some plane Janes
I wanna get new thangs, so I used the game to maintain
Bitch I refuse to change

Pussy you ain't cared 'bout that when you had her
But now you wonder where she's at

But it don't show
Cause all I heard from your mouth
Was ""fuck that ho.""
But deep down inside I know it hurts a lot
I know you can't go on but it's worse to stop
You daydreamin 'bout your x, tryin to figure what's next
Other females can't compare to her sex
I'm tryin' to picture me, all in love with these hoes
But when I meet 'em, they just wanna lick my balls
You can't tell me shit, fuck that
You're just another fine ass bitch with nut breath

That’s How it Goes Down,Married to the Game,2003.0,"You're thuggin and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin major heat
And niggas hatin, and you ain't stop to think about
Niggas runnin they mouth, niggas cessed you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
Flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall

I came up in Cokeland, better known as Oakland
Your weed could sell, are you smokin?
Eighteen with a big Mercedes
Sellin dope in the mid-eighties
Homie talkin bout I'm about to win
Now when you gon' let'em all out the pen
You sold crack to hell and back
Whoever would have thought you could fail at that
Bein broke ain't never been cool
And it ain't no hope when youre failing in school
You might as well flip the sac
Roll out of town and take a trip with that
Or you could just hit the block
Stayin on the corner, come and get the rocks
Bein out on the streets as a young teen
Wasn't always a fun thing

You're thuggin and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin major heat
And niggas hatin, and you ain't stop to think about
Niggas runnin they mouh, niggas snitched you out

I remember when you and me used to ball
We had it all, and we took a fall
That's how it goes down

Dope fiend still get high
While dope dealers barely get by
You better get your life right
You wanna live in the 'burbs with your white wife
Do your own thing
I know you want change
And I can't play you wrong man
I'm laced with that long game
It's just not a lot of choices man
You ain't plannin to go to jail with the poison clan
So you could be another number in the system, stuck, for years
Got a brother in the pen fucked up
All the stashes you know you kept
And everything that the police left
It's too late when you notice it
It's all gone, motherfuckers done stole yo shit
You wanna kill'em and you still do
But realize that real killas get killed too

You're thuggin and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin major heat

I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall

He's dissappeared into thin air, he's nowhere
Whens the last time he been here, we don't care
Cause he don't come around no mo'
Nigga live with his momma, down in brough
He's just tryin to survive
I guess it's all right cause at least he's alive
Cause nowadays a lil kid might shoot you down
Life's wild in the town
Young fools like to clown
He did the same thing, fall for the lies
Hold your head up high and swallowed the pride
Caught in a trap, but don't know what you in
Had a million, now you ain't got two cents
You can't say nothin, now what
I don't hear you talkin all that loud stuff
If you live and you die by the game and you lose
At least you did spend your life tryin to change

You're thuggin and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin major heat

I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall

That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down

And it's a cold cold cold cold day

Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit

Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
Too $hort:
I got too many girlfriends what am I gonna do?
Play em tell the world ends and always keep a few
When it comes to women I did everything I thought of
Players like me, we never get caught
Who's the next on the list? It's a daily routine dog
She give me short, then she'd take my jeans off at
First she wasn't messing with me told me to lick it
But now she's always sweating me. When we gonna kick it?
Spend some time wit her, I need to come through and hit it
Any time I feel like I want it, I can get it
I'll be here for you, you never wonder were I'm at
So when I come through put the spare key under the mat
When I come in, there ain't no holding back
Just feel what I am doing and roll with that
And even though I admit I can't commit this time
It's cause I got my heart broke at the age of nine
I've been hard core every since I sucked up the game from pimps
You never hear me rap about the same bitch
I never turned a ho into a housewife
Short dog East Oakland in the house right
Chorus 2:
I'm ready to ride, ready to ride, ready to ride
I'm the mothership wish it comes
I'm ready to ride, ready to ride, ready to ride

Too $hort:
I thought we was cool like that, why you go behind my back?
Trying to cross me in the game when you know I'm a mack
Can't do that, you all up in my mix
Get the phone book callin all my bitches
You know I don't really care if you interfere
Cause I don't think you know about these real players
If you need a lesson, you better listen up
Cause I don't think you ready for this pimpin stuff
I'm Too Short baby on the microphone
Since you  got no game, I gotta write these songs
To wake you up and get you motivated
I'm about to flip the script and I know your gonna hate it
You can't infatuate my game no more, it's fool proof
So when you try to cross me up, I pull through
Like a solider, cause we fighting a war
Haters against Players, who you fighting for?
You all in my business trying to make it theirs
I need to hit you in your face tell you 'mind your own affairs'
I'm Sir Too Short, and I'm knowing just how to be a player bitch
Chorus 2:
Chorus 1:
Too $hort:
BIOTCH 
Now if your trying to be a player, do your thing
But if you wanna be in love, it's cool mang
Don't try to be a player when you see that you can't
Let your peers pressuring you into being what you ain't
It's hard to be real in this fake world
Would you  result to violence if I take your girl?
Or would you realize she likes me more then you
Our relationship is starting and yours is through
Are you riding on the bench. Who you starting for?
Do you have another girl or is your heart broke?
Do you know how to be a player?
Is what they say about me
I'm straight down with the after party, late night freaks
Belita Woods:
She's just a pretty face, and she doesn't even use her own name
She stole it from a magazine
She's just a pretty face
And the words she say ain't coming from her mouth
She stole the can and loves the pot
She's just another pretty face

Respect The Pimpin’,No Trespassing,2012.0,"Ooh, respect the pimpin'
Ooh, respect the pimpin'

I'll never forget the Ward Brothers, player
Old school pimps like Roosevelt Taylor
The list goes on for like three generations
Oakland pimp shit, all in your face, man
Some other cities take pride in trickin'
You can hear it when their rappers start spittin'
Instead of you and your woman gettin' money together
You do all the hustlin' and she gets all the cheddar
You tell her go shop but she ain't got a job
Then you brag in your raps, to me it sounds odd
'Cause I was raised by pimps in the O
They taught me real good how to send a ho
And now you niggas tryin' to bend the rules
You must have came up around some friendly dudes
You need to stop doin' all that extra simpin'
And change the words in your song and respect the pimpin'

You've got money but you got no game
Think all the ladies wanna love you?
Probably gotta make it rain, take her shoppin'
Respect the pimpin'
You been frontin' for the cameras, posin'
Got your Gators and you're super cute, can you feel me?
Respect the pimpin'

All I wanna be is well known now
Drive a 'Lac, big mack and do my own style
Keep a freak on the street that fit the profile
At the pad, money stack, watchin' dough pile
Reminiscin' of a player that I once knew
He had it all, went broke but he still kept it true
Bounced back like a real mack, got a new sack
New hoes, new clothes and found a new track
Now that's a player that I always wanna be like
Did dirt, went to church and lived the street life
Ask Short, ask Snoop, we gon' tell you the truth
A real pimp keep a prostitute, and she get lots of loot
Do what she gots to do
Come back with moolah like she 'posed to do
And stay close to you
So if you ever fell
Here's the one most important thing about this tale
Ask Michelle, Tammy and Nell when they went to jail
They know who came through with that bail - it was me
'Cause I respect the P, do the same
Don't be no lame, respect the game

Respect the pimpin'

Now all that little stuff don't get you mad
And once you get your foot in the door

One day you gotta let go, but don't settle

To get what I got and I'm way too strong

Can't do no ballin like yo' nigga $hort
But once you on a roll, they can't stop it
Receivin checks, makin bank deposits

Feelin’ Somethin’,The Sex Tape Playlist,2018.0,"You wanna shoot that dope? Snort that coke?
Pop them pills? You love the way it makes you feel?
Smoke them ‘woods, them Percs feel good
That lean is real, you love the way it makes you feel

What’s up with Afghanistan, that Taliban, that heroin, that Oxycontin
That morphine, that codeine, that Percocet and them Vicodins
You want that poppy seed? You so high, you can’t talk to me
Afghanistan, Colombians, cooking grams like coffee beans
We just want that hookup, man
Selling ki’s, fuck cooking grams
It’s the opioid epidemic , it’s going down and it’s not a gimmick
Fuck that, I’m ‘bout to call Obama
Ever since they killed Osama
Them poppy plants, they got a million of ‘em
And the whole world just fell in love with ‘em

You wanna shoot that dope? Snort that coke?
Pop them pills? You love the way it makes you feel?
Smoke them ‘woods, them Percs feel good
That lean is real, you love the way it makes you feel

I know your ass giving me something
So high, so good, I’m with you, we floatin’ away
We floatin’ away, ah
So high, so good, I feel so good when I’m with you
I know you know, I’m so far away
So far away

Can I get a line, Obama? Can you put your boy in the game?
I need that Afghan plug, I’m just tryna make some change
Mexicans sell that ‘caine, everybody bang with gangs
Get that bag, boy, nothin’ ain’t ever gon’ stay the same
If it’s poppy seed or coca leaf, we don’t use it, we just smoke the weed
Getting money is how it’s supposed to be
You get rich, you stay close to me
‘Cause heroin makes more than crack
We go to war, we bring it back
It’s what we did in Vietnam, and nobody cared if we lost or won
Just bring home our son, even if he’s hooked on heroin
Give me that dope, I’ll sell you some
It got you hooked, can’t tell you nothin’
These opioids, they everywhere
Pain killers, they hella scary
Fuck around and OD, sippin’ on that codeine

I know your ass giving me something
So high, so good, I’m with you, we floatin’ away
We floatin’ away, ah
So high, so good, I feel so good when I’m with you
I know you know, I’m so far away
So far away

You wanna shoot that dope? Snort that coke?
Pop them pills? You love the way it makes you feel?
Smoke them ‘woods, them Percs feel good
That lean is real, you love the way it makes you feel

You know you wanna turn off the lights
Grab my hand and let’s get high
We only got one night
Take a couple shots, nigga, get high
So high, tonight…

Don’t do drugs…without me",https://genius.com/Too-short-feelin-somethin-lyrics
Everytime,Players,1985,"From the day we met up until right now
If I wanted that girl I always knew how
To find her, and get her, and take her home
Getting everything I wanted when we're all alone
Everytime I see her it's time to toss
I'm walking in the door taking everything off
Cause I know I'll get it call now and later
Call me $hort homeboy and I'm a stone cold player

She was mine and yours, but more and more
She was giving that funk to the playboy $hort
Wanting money, but maybe it was just the fact
The life I live made me the king of the rap
Everytime I see her you know I take her
Straight to her house and then I break her
If I don't see baby, she'll give me a call
For the same old freak show having a ball
Breakdown

Now she's a tender, a star, an angel in white
My wildest dream on a Saturday night
My freak of the week, best pick of the day
If I like it like that, it will be that way
Now everytime I see her she be doing it soon
Like ninety on shorty in a motel room
She's the one I can't resist
And everytime I see her I tell her like this
Breakdown
Bass!

She'll be coming 'round the mountain 'bout ten to eight
Tryin' to hook me up on a late night date
And I'll be right there homie when I open the door
Saying baby oh baby are you ready for more
Everytime I see her you know what I mean
We in the back like that doing sexual things
Same ol' freak show all them moves
Call me $hort homeboy and I just can't lose

Stone cold freakin' dressed in lace
The finest young tender in the whole damn place
Baby so fine I keep telling myself
I want the young tender under my love spell
Didn't waste one second, to take a chance
I walked up to her and asked to dance
Baby said yes, we hit the spot
My rap came on and the freak got hot",https://genius.com/Too-short-everytime-lyrics
Lotta Hatin’,Hella Disrespectful: Bay Area Mixtape,2017.0,"“Yeah, we hella disrespectful”

If a nigga walk up on you, what you gon’ do?
Kick in him in the face with a boot
Beat his ass up with your crew
If his bitch don’t stop talking, she can get it too
Hit that bitch with a bottle
I don’t give a fuck if she look like a model
Pretty ass bitches get slapped too
And you better not say shit if they ask you, PUNK BITCH
You better get your ass out the VIP
‘Cause don’t nobody know you
We ‘bout to give them bitch ass niggas over there another funeral to go to
(FUCK YOU, BITCH!)

All my life I’ve been a player
Hoes mad ‘cause I don’t care
I take your bitch so quick, so fast
You mad like that ain’t fair
A lotta hatin’ over there, muh’fucka
A lotta hatin’ over there
Why you hatin’ over there, muh’fucka?
Why you hatin’ over there?

A lot of broke niggas in here mad at money, mad money
I said ‘Bye, Felicia; bye, Felicia’, you can’t have nothin’ from me
Where all the niggas at that’s gettin’ it?
Where all the niggas at that got bands?
Where all the bitches at that got it?
And they got it without no man
They give a fuck about everything but a bitch
Razor in her pocket, she’ll cut a bitch
Fake niggas can’t wear no jewels
My little niggas ‘bout to rob them fools

Muthafuckin’ goddamn asshole”

That’s what you get fuckin’ with fuck niggas

Toot that shit up before we shoot this shit up

{Scarface:}
And you can tell em I said it
I said muthafuckas is takin the credit
Been in the game for 20 minutes, and they thinkin they legends
All on their videos showin off, frontin for the camera
One-hit wonders is playin games, fakin stamina
I damage ya, throwin blows to your egos
Flossin new leather, think you the shit wearin these clothes
And supposed to flash and have the finer things
But can't seem to keep your money, cause you're buyin rings
What is you gettin, 7 or 6, new record contract?
Bustin your bomb raps, but you ain't gettin your funds back
Fuck that, I been around since '86
Way before my muthafuckin mind played tricks
And when Too $hort told me this bitch, it wasn't givin
Cause I'm sick and tired of niggas fantasizin they livin
All on the tell-lie-vision tryina front like that's your car
With a fat-ass cigar, you ain't no muthafuckin star
What you are is a nigga lost, dazed and confused
Back in the day that you stepped in it is the day that you do
But on the  cool, some niggas been around since the '70s
Steadily preachin to us all longevity

You don't get shit for free
Your own destiny

10 years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
But back then I said: fuck rhymin, I was tryina get laid
But now it's '98, I'm all about gettin paid
Fuck that bullshit you niggas be on in your videos
Drive the shit your C.E.O. own
In their home, at their parties, you niggas dummies
Muthafucka, fuck the fame, it's all about the money
And then the power (money and the power)
Slingin tapes like powder
Everything I own is mine, don't understand 'ours'
This's a serious business
My nigga, take care of your business
Especially you niggas with gimmicks, your ass is finished
In the nick of time, fuck havin the tightest rhymes
You better grind, it's plenty fools dope without a dime
So I'm tight with mines, and I prove that every time
Just to let you niggas know I'm out to get mine
That's longevity

Who got the freshman flop or the sophomore jinx
Rappers blow up, fall off, and think
Been there, done that, about to make a comeback
I'm on some new shit, not like my young raps
I know what you sold, first album went gold
Then you changed the style, shoulda stuck with the old
Flows, and the old clothes, cause now you fake
You ain't got no hoes committin foul play
Hatin on me, but you're waitin to see
Old school Too $hort in the place to be
I ain't backstage chasin young girlies
I'm chasin money, I'm in my early 30s
Still sellin records, and I'm still a real player

Sixteenth letter of the alphabet, I'm certified, believe me
My campaign is so greezy, that alcohol was too easy
Take off your hat before you greet me
No hand outs, no freebies
Can't afford to lose my life or go to jail, my people need me
F.A.B. called me 6 AM, I just left the booth
Said I ran plays on Salute Me and Pie 22
Told me let's work, I said what's good? I'm lacing up the boots
Flight leave at six up to So Cal to get some game from Snoop
It just hit me, I'm surrounded by panthers and lions
Huey P. Newton's, Bobby Seale's, black kings, we timeless
I don't tap out, I do not quit
Yes I'm a dog but not the bitch
Red nosed pit but I'm mixed
ALLBLACK ready, I stand tall like a Great Dane in this bitch
Don't do leashes, no leftovers, I ain't locked behind no fifth
Pass a dog, give Rollo the keys so he can drive my whip
It's a rager at Cal Berkley, got the addy, bitch it's lit
I like to party with white crowds who play pony shit
I mix brown and clear together, y'all ain't bent how I be bent
Forgot to introduce myself, I'm your real daddy bitch
E14 to Post Street, don't wear no suits and I don't limp
Run all fades and I pull cards, I'm anti to simps
Hibachi chicken over rice, I do not fuck with shrimp
I'm from Oakland, ain't no fuckin' city like mine
Marcus Peters in that booth, bitch it's game time
Came back home, runnin' my city like I'm Marshawn
Foothill boys, roll with the forty when I was on my grind
It's BLACK

Nigga I been gettin' money for a long time
It took all day to count them bands, that's a long time
Nigga I been gettin' paid for a long time
I ain't seen no rainy days in a long time
A long time, a long time
My diamonds shining but my Rollie say the wrong time
Every time your bitch say she need alone time
She with me, I'ma get some love me long time

Poochie's son, everybody know my mama
Catch a flight to the Bay, everybody 'bout that drama
Can't swim in the bay, it's a school of piranhas
Where them bands, it ain't a dollar in your wallet
You ain't really from the Bay, what you know 'bout carryin' drama?
Snatch my chain, it's a shootout
Fuckin' right, I talk my shit and tell the truth
Give a fuck about no rhyming
I be trippin' out in public, I be trippin' when I'm private nigga, Rolla

Yeah, I been said I'm the coolest in the city
It's good where I step, everybody fuckin' with me from
Ice City to Brookfield, my niggas is too real
They shootin' that real steel, these niggas will kill Bill
Posted on the corner 'cause we had to
Long day at work, late nights bringing in the food
Campus Village baby, Lower Bottom raised me
I'll be damned if I let a nigga play me, bah

Nigga I been gettin' money for a long time
It took all day to count them bands, that's a long time
Nigga I been gettin' paid for a long time

Hoochie,Shorty the Pimp,1992.0,"Yeah, you know, it's like, ehm - I rap
I got two platinum albums
I do a lotta concerts all over the place
I seen the groupies
They do whatever you say
When you want it, how you want it, and where you want it
But I ain't trippin
Cause these are the '90s
So when a freak say to me she loves me
I just say somethin like this

I say baby, why you wanna do all that?
Sleep with a brother just because I rap
You keep lookin in my eyes, and you just won't stop
All damn night you been on my jock
But I'm no fool
Cause you're sprung on my house and my swimming pool
Call me a dog, I got several freaks
When I do my shows I can't get no sleep
Cause you keep knockin at my hotel door
I was there to sleep, and can't get no more
Sleep, so why you wanna wake me up?
When I told you once I don't wanna fuck
So get on, girl, won't you mind your own
I'm tryin to sleep, so just leave me alone
Next time I see you, I do my duty
But tonight, I got another hoochie

Hoochie, tryin to be bourgie
But you're nothin but a groupie
Riding on my snoopy

I'm short dog, I wanna take you backstage
And you can read it like it's on the front page
You wanna do somebody right
For those who ain't famous - not tonight
You do the nba and the nfl
Rappers and singers as well
Keyboard players and the drummer
It's like track and field with just runners
So let me get on the phone and call all my friends
Ain't a damn thing changed but the paint on our benz
Get somethin that you can't get from good girls
Care less about a weave or a jherri curl
Cause I know something you don't know
Ain't nothin like these groupie hoes
And since tony toni ton? made the track
Get lost, fool, and tell your girl I'm back
Sing it


Get off my lap, cause you're gettin kinda heavy
Lookin at the bed, askin am I ready
Ready for what, sex?
Well, after that, baby, what's next?
We get a house in the suburbs, two-car garage
And every night I get a good massage?
Save that drama for later
And take this number to my skypager
Keep in touch, but don't call too much
When I come back around, you know what's up
It's time to get busy once again
Bring a few partners, cause I got friends
It's goin down like always
Young groupies in the hallways
I got the money, the fame, and all the things you like
So I see you next time when I rock the mic

Invasion Of Flat Booty Bitches,"Raw, Uncut and X-Rated",1986.0,"Baby, check this out!
Yeah, you
I wanna ask you a question:
Where is your ass?
Baby, what happened?

A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lot of butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's OK if she's got cash

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feeling shabby
Got juiced up with a big fat Cabby
Cuz every morning you know I have
A big fat Cabby and a nice hot bath
Just soakin, smokin, Sir Too Short
Thinkin about the day before
Thirty minutes after I woke out
I pulled a freak and took her to the house
She was hella young, with alotta butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That  tight pussy, I wouldn't pass
A light-skinned freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin away
I wanna do the same thing again today
I want bitches, bitches, and more bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The day my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself I must need glasses
Where's them bitches with the big round asses
Me and my group just wanna be tough
Freak two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I seen a bitch
But that ain't nuthin' but a cap
None of them bitches didn't have no ass
Waitin' on the bus, some was walkin'
Me and my homie just started talkin'
I said ""Homie, she looks good""
He said that ass is flat as wood
I said what about Vicky in the black
He said, Short, she's all that

The Invasion was on...

Every single day of the week
For every nigga living there's a freak
If you've got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cuz bitches all over wanna get worked
I just need one with alotta turf
Me and my homie, rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie, I hate to say
All the bitches with booties stayed home today
And he said Short, what now?
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-Town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind


We hit the B-Town like Oakland players
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tits so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
I capped on her like a motherfuckin fool
I said ""Biatch!"" I know I'm cappin
Where's your ass, baby what happened
She turned around and capped on me
She said, fuck you nigga, where's your teeth
I damn near fell jumpin out the car
But I slapped that bitch, and slapped her hard
My homie said Short we gots to cut
But I was kickin that bitch in her big flat butt
I kicked her ass, got in the ride
Looked at the bitch and said bye bye

The invasion was on..

We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said baby, baby, baby come here
Yeah you baby with your long long hair
Baby came over from across the street
She was standin on the corner just talking to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
Cuz I didn't even notice that big flat ass
Shit, and I was ready to go
We was rollin back to the O
I told that bitch I changed my mind
She looked at me and she said why?
I said I'm Sir Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and yo flat booty
Flat ain't the  superstar
I could see if you was white, but you're black as tar


In the Berkeley temp, what did we find?
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day, I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again

Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Damn, I must be dreamin
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Wake me up 'fore I start screaming
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
What's this world comin to?
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Where's your ass, what happened to you?

Don’t Even Stop,Players,1985,"I'm the young emcee that don't rap too long
Everytime I spit a rap is a brand new song
Always coming that fresh is so cold
You wouldn't have time to look at my world
Cuz you be dancing to the beat having a ball
Then I'll tell you to give me a call
I'm Too $hort baby I always say
When I'm rapping to the beat I don't play
I'm on the up and up so for real
Rapping that rap realer way real
Working that suckers everyday striving to be hard
Stacked with bean pies in the back of the car
Playing Too $hort in your stereo
I couldn't even hear your radio
Cuz just can't quit it short done took it
Found it like a tag ain't nothing but amusing
Just being short you think I'm small
But eye to eye I stand too tall
I make not make sense but I make mail
The beat don't stop and I just can't
Keep on going and I just won't stop
Too $hort over don't even stop
That's how I am that's how I jam
Just don't stop rapping when I regress
Being a rapper ain't everything
They madder now lost they change
On the short watch the cops say let's got
Raps to raps rocks to rhyme
So many raps all the time
Making raps everyday and still can see
The dope with a ride won't come to me
I spit raps every week of the year
Rapping on the mic just screaming snitch
My homie T rocks came hit me up
Went in the studio came hitting it up
Always catching the flash out of the cap
No hoes its all straight rap
No breaks no fakes just straight man T
And I always know what to do
The girl the other day just block up
Too $hort baby might just walk up
To me and she had to act Too $hort sews the rap
When I told baby all yes I am
We were walking down the street holding them
She said Too $hort spit that rhyme
And next thing you know that freak was mine
Girls going wild seeing female funk
Riding in the cut just hugging the back
Call me short and the girls I play
Love Too $hort when you hear me say
Girl that's your life
Girl why you smoking that hype
To the girls girls all the girls
Real long hair or short curls
Here's to you a special toast
Its all about you cuz I'm the most
If you hold it down let me hear you rap
Fresh to the beat don't even stop
Everybody on the mic or the floor say Too $hort
Suckers don't know that rapping game
Spitting on the mic can't even hang
With these sucker emcees every check
Rapping like this they will soon begin to realize
That rap is made to be tamed and ticked rush released
To the rap fans that can do like this
Just rock to the beat don't fade that shit
You probably wonder about rapping what does it mean
To thing with wondering things
Spending fresh leather what does it seat
Got a bright color you know it's cheap
Not loud enough to make an elephant speak
Put them to your homeboy mack
I'm all about rapping but it ain't like that
You better tell your homeboy don't make me laugh
I'm the too s.h.o.r.t. I don't rap wacks
I'm a too emcee all you sucker rappers hanging with me
Its a shame cuz in the bay they won't let it be
Keep on lying and see what happens
Too $hort baby just won't stop rapping
All I can do is just keep smacking
Cuz Too $hort baby just won't stop rapping
Yes tip roll the strip
I'm going to take your mind on a serious trip
Like a video like I'm tight hoes
Girls just rolling like leave me alone
Even though I'm on my back still let me in
If I did it to the front I'm a do it again
Sir Too $hort won't even stop don't stop
I'm here to stay cuz I'm so cold
Riding round town dripped in fold
I'm the laughing man laughing all night long
Got freaks out there freaking to my song
Couldn't put backstabbing thevies to work
I'm putting biching emcees to the whole earth
Spitting them tenders on a wild goose chase
Up in the hills making my place
Getting raps getting traps found and clowned
Everytime you see short baby you get down
Cuz the raps I make are the raps you like
The way Too $hort rocks the mic
This one of a kind rapping style
Had the freaks in the back just going wild
When I spit that line what's the deal
Bitch bitch bitch make me rich
I have such a good mannered mind
Sometimes I might make dirty rhymes
But these are just some dirty times out fresh",https://genius.com/Too-short-dont-even-stop-lyrics
Better Player,No Limit Records Presents: Mean Green: Major Players Compilation,UnKnown,"Yeah man
These niggas always comin' up to me

And that bitch, and what do I think
Man.. know what I tell these niggas?
Man I ain't trippin' on you and your ho, man
Got my own bitches
I got my own ho's, nigga
(Verse 1, Too $hort)
Now I don't really care about'cha Benz
Or ya light-skinned bitch
Could give a fuck who ya tell
You don't like this shit
The fact still stands
You got one girlfriend
And I feel like
The whole world pimp
I can't be like you
You always actin' fake
I could tell you how much
A real mack can make
A million dollars ain't shit to spend
I get some new ho's, and get it again
So don't tell me, what'chu wish for
You wanna be kept, by a rich ho?
Bitch ass nigga, tryina lic me a lic
She better pay me right now
If she wanna get some dick
I told you, got the game from the old niggas
Every time I park my car, I come to gold-diggers
With the ""Easy Pussy"" sign, on display
If you lookin' for some money
Don't come this way
(Hook, Too $hort)
You couldn't be a better player than me
Even if you fucked every day of the week
I know you think you got it like Platinum Pete
I be fuckin ho's every day of the week
You never could be a better player than me
Even if you rolled in luxury
I know you smoke coke and that top notch freak
You never could be a better player than me
(Verse 2, Too $hort)
Now I don't really care about'cha phone book
You think you're pimpin'
Ya chillin' at the club
Wit' all ya women
You lyin' on ya dick, save the drama
Got my eye on ya wife, and ya baby-mama
Cause you snoozin' (You know the rules pimp)
Ya bitch is choosin' (You 'bout to lose them)
Yellin', ""get'cho ass in this car bitch!""
But I'm much too fast with this hard dick
Short Dogg took ya broad, it just can't be
Your bitch sucked me n' fucked me n' then she thanked me
I know the whole story, you ain't servin' it right
I'll probly slide by, and put some work in her night

You couldn't be a better player than me

I know you smoke coke and that top notch freak
You never could be a better player than me
Biatch!
(Verse 3, Too $hort)
Now I don't really care
If you fucked the richest bitch on Earth
You could be a gigolo and couldn't get more work
Cause I'm a player from way back
Taught by the best, no way you could say
That I was short like the rest
Of y'all half steppin', lil' dick wanna-be big-wheeler's
Got a bad case of the Syphilis
In the studio, you're make-believer's
In real life, you're more like, they can't foresay this
You rushin' to the scene, savin' ho's
Every time you come across them, crazy folks
You cuff 'em, hurry up and get 'em to safety
But sooner or later, the bitch gotta face me
Cause I put the game down from the start
And you ain't nothin' but a dumb-ass mark
And do yo thang, and watch me do mine
Get the bitch on the phone
And let's see who's lyin'
Nigga
(Hook, Too $hort)
You never could be a better player than me

I know you smoke coke and that top notch freak
You never could be a better player than me

Couldn't be a better player than me
I know you couldn't be a better player than me
Biatch!
Couldn't be a better player than me
Even if you did it every day of the week
I know you think you got it like Platinum Pete
I be fuckin ho's every day of the week

Don’t Ever Stop,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm the young emcee that don't rap too long

Always coming that fresh is so cold
You wouldn't have time to look at my world
Cuz you be dancing to the beat having a ball
Then I'll tell you to give me a call
I'm Too $hort baby I always say
When I'm rapping to the beat I don't play
I'm on the up and up so for real
Rapping that rap realer way real
Working that suckers everyday striving to be hard
Stacked with bean pies in the back of the car
Playing Too $hort in your stereo
I couldn't even hear your radio
Cuz just can't quit it short done took it
Found it like a tag ain't nothing but amusing
Just being short you think I'm small
But eye to eye I stand too tall
I make not make sense but I make mail
The beat don't stop and I just can't
Keep on going and I just won't stop

Just don't stop rapping when I regress
Being a rapper ain't everything

These Are the Tales,Chase the Cat,2001.0,"These are the tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
(tune in to the history channel)
These are the tales (learn a lesson biatch)
These are the tales that I tell so well (Short Dog)
I'm thinkin' way back, it's been a long long time
In 1980 I wrote my first rhyme
I like to spit a lot of game
But back then, I was just sayin' my name
I had a record player, on my stereo
Got down on my knees with my radio
From Oakland California with some new shit
I'm Sir Too $hort I'm bout to do this
In 1981, that's where it all begun
We do it for the money we don't rap for fun
Five dolla's fo' a tape, Too $hort and Freddy B
Money in my pocket's all I ever need
It was me, Fred B, and Freddy Brack
Dipped the sermon sticks then we smoked them phat
While we rapped about the bitches and all the ho's
Can't be in the hole tryin' to ball without vogues
In '82 you was in the game
With a Falcon, Cougar or a Mustang
Me and Freddy B used to hit the turfs
With a bag of tapes puttin in work, Biatch
In '83 you hit a house party
A dolla' get you in and a dolla' fo' a drink
I'm on the turntable smokin' get-right
And at mid-night I'll be rappin' on the mic
I did the same thang, for the next two years
That's why they say my name, when I come through here
When I was 16, I want'd to be a mack
I went to Fremont High with Lil' D and Black
Young ballers in the town livin' real phat
Never had the sack but I smoked a little crack
Crushed up in the weed, we call em bass rock Caddies
Goin' on them grimmies make them ho's call me daddy

These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well

It's been 15 years since that shit happened
But Too $hort don't stop rappin'
In '85, I was on the right page
Ten thousand niggas, $hort live on stage
Underground tapes was all they ever heard
But the whole crowd sang along with me word for word
And that changed everything
Went to Seventy Five Girls and hooked up with Dean
Real player-ism and that's no joke
Snort a lot of coke with ho's that like to smoke
I was makin' records but wasn't makin' money
You can take it seriously or you can think its funny
By '87, I was on my own, started Dangerous Music
And I made the song ""These are the tales, the freaky tales""
No radio or video or CD sales
Six platinums in a row Ice Cube and Cool J
Who else did that shit? $hort Dog from the Bay
These ho's try to play it safe
But I been mackin' hard since eighty-eight
And from eighty-nine to ninety-six
I was rappin' on the mic talkin' shit about a bitch
I'll retire 10 times and I'll still be here
My old records sell about a half a mil' a year
I say ""bitch get naked"" so pimpishly
Spit rhymes through decades and centuries
And bitches just love my dirty mouth
When I see you again I'mma cuss you out, BIATCH!
That's my gift, now all you rappers get to say that shit
I won't sue you, but that's the trademark
I was a grown ass man when you was playin' in the park lil' nigga


Now I'm in Atlanta I still love the O
I gave you my bitch but you can't have my flow
I guest appeared on 47 albums
Fuck McDonalds and fuck Calvin
I get money with Erick Sermon when I'm in New York
I get respect, they call me Too $hort
I live swell in A.T.L. cause I'm a player
We fuckin' hella ho's at X House in Decatur where it's greater
You know how we ride
I got love for all niggas from the EastSide
It was me, Ant Banks and Shorty B
All we need to do is find my nigga PeeWee
We used to be on Murdel Street makin' funky songs
If you see him tell him Short said its back on
Lets get this money, midwest down South
East coast West coast ride out, BIATCH

That's my gift to rap, you can have that word
Say bitch all you want, all you regular fake ass niggas
You finally get to have Too $hort's bitch, trick",https://genius.com/Too-short-these-are-the-tales-lyrics

""Pimpin ain't.. pimpin ain't dead.."" - repeat 2X
{*background scratch: ""Hard on a bitch""*}

I'm so hard on a bitch nigga
I mean it's nothin though, you know I'm from the town
Everythang on a bitch
That's how we do it
{""I'm hard on a bitch, go ask my first ho""}
I'm not nice to these hoes, most of the time
I say what the fuck, is on my mind
I grab my pen, and write a rhyme
And say somethin 'bout a bitch on every line
She just gave me 800, a G last night
She could pay me for years and couldn't be my wife
Everybody talkin 'bout, how these pimps be funny
A bitch couldn't lock me down with Whitney's money
Some niggas get paid but they're not the boss
Cain't even show off, stop and floss
... without askin permission
Why you bitch-ass niggas always askin yo' bitch
If you can do thangs, what'chu wanna do mayne?
You wanna help your girl step up her shoe game?
Take her shoppin, just to get it poppin
You weak for the pussy and you know you need to stop it

Hard on a bitch, I'm hard on a bitch
I'm hard on a bitch so hard on a bitch
Hard on a bitch, I'm hard on a bitch
I'm hard on a bitch I'm so hard on a beee-itch!

But you ain't though, and you cain't flow
She's a pro, but you ain't know
You so soft, you ain't pimpin these hoes
You take 'em to the mall and buy expensive clothes
And let her drive your car, so you can say you're fuckin
She disrespects you and don't pay you nothin
But that's you - cause if it was me
She'll be comin to the table with a meal to eat
And I stay hungry, I like hoes that make money
You got a pussy, and they want it
So give it to 'em and collect the fee
Buy some mo' shoes and give the rest to me
Cinderella and her glass slipper
They say, a lot of fuckin makes yo' ass bigger
I say, keep fuckin make my ass richer
While yo' booty and my pockets get thicker",https://genius.com/Too-short-hard-on-a-bitch-lyrics
Shut Up Nancy - feat. Kokane,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Shut up b! tch, you talk too much
Getting on my nerves, you're so irritating
Using too many words and my ears can't take it
And your voice is kinda loud too
What else can that mouth do
You like cum? Tell her what it tastes like
You keep some on your tongue make you stay quiet
What? Better not hate me
Cause you still gotta  still gotta penny
What's my fee? I charge what you earn, you're so lucky
You get the cargo the sperm
Now it's all in your sperm, got you acting crazy like you smoking sherm
But all I smoke is the kush
You need to shut your mouth b! tch, hush!

She talk to fucking much, she just don't wanna shut up, (Nancy)

You fucking all that stuff, b! tch don't pick it up (Nancy)
I just can't be with you
Cause you run your mouth too much, can you feel me?

You know me, I'm always clowning
But now Nancy, that b! tch is always frowning
And now, she don't even like to smile
She just makes me face and talks too loud
Shut up Nancy, you getting on my nerves
Too many adjectives and not enough verbs
Every time you speak, all you do is babble
We ain't at the house playing scrabble, b! tch
Fuck you, and fuck your opinion
Cause I just fuck this big butt Dominican
And hit that shit from a lot of angles
She ain't speak English, just body language
So we ain't have to say nothing
Just stay up all night fucking
Nancy, you can never ever feel like us

Shut up Nancy, you're such a disgrace
Talk shit to me, you get fucked in the face
I don't care b! tch, tell them that
My name is Too $hort, who the fuck you yelling at?
Fuck with me, you being the silence of the lambs
Your boyfriend left, you can't find another man
You're too upset to play with yourself
So you never have sex, remember how it felt?
When you used to get kissed on those lips
But now all you do is talk shit
You need to wipe your mouth with some toilet paper
Turn up the lights and drink 
Cause you already know what's up
I'm trying to get you drunk and when you're throwing up
Just spit out all them words and flush
Shut your mouth b! tch, hush!
Can you feel me?

One, one, one...

From here to New York
Everybody's talking about sir Too $hort
And its all not good cuz some talk bad
Sucker emcees wanna make me mad
But I don't stop rapping and they don't seem
To really understand just what I mean
You a sucker emcee and worst of all
Sucker emcees don't stand too tall
I could spit you a rap then you'd hear
A rhyme so fresh everyday of the year
I could spit my rap straight to you
Sucker emcee and your whole crew
Everytime you said I was what you wanted
You never even knew you soon be fronted
By an emcee rappers like me
And giving no slack to you sucker emcees
I laugh in your face and then might slap
The same damn face i was laughing at
Cuz sucker emcees don't know the tip
And your going to pay for everything you dip
Trying to front Too $hort, you need to quit
Rappers like me won't even trip
So if don't recognize fronting your gear
If it's you against short you will never win
Cuz I'll stand here and won't stop rhyming
Until I see you don't stop crying
Or I won't stop that's what you heard
Cuz you keep listening to my word
Everyword I say comes loud and clear
Out of my mouth straight to your ear
And I just don't stop once I start
I take a sucker emcee and just tear them apart
Like this
With a rap like this I could be on the mic
Spitting my rap to you all dang night
Just give me a break before you get broke
You couldn't be saved by John the Pope
Cuz you sucker emcees don't see the light
But you all want to see Short rock the mic
And when you find out that I don't quit
I'm rapping to the beat like superslick
Talking about you, sucker what do you want?
You want to take a chance and try to front
Too $hort baby here I stand
From here to New York, known to jam
Not one of those suckers that play rap songs
Making those words to sing along
I'm fresh yeah, fresh as hell
So damn fresh I know the deal
I'm from Oakland, California the big O-town
Too $hort Too $hort I'm so down
I put my whips down fresh I don't play
From here to New York emcees will say
I'm Too S-H-O-R-T spitting my rap to you sucker emcees
Cuz like I said its time to pay
For everything you said and everything you say
Trying to front too hard, you need to quit
Rappers like me won't even trip
See I knew you didn't knew what you stepped into
When you front on a rapper like Playboy Too
Everytime I rhyme, people love my rap
And you sucker emcees can't deal with that
Just faker than fake you want me to be
Just like you but soon you'll see
Too $hort
I'm in every drop I ride oh no I don't
And losing to a sucker you know I won't
But you keep on fronting, you so slick
All your homeboys made you wanna rap against me
Now your homeboys standing there looking laughing
Cuz you went against Short and broke you in half
Like that, I didn't give you a break
I put you on the mic now they know you a fake
Then I got on the mic, look at me now
Too $hort baby from the Oakland town
Not hard to believe but one more time
I'm proving to a sucker that short can rhyme
And I know he knows Too $hort can
Cuz the boy ain't nothing but one of my fans
Wanna be like me so damn bad
The impossible dream all you emcees have
If you really don't know who's the best
Too $hort baby from the wild wild west
All the way from here to New York
Everbody's talking about Sir Too $hort
The way I rap like a homerun hitter
Knocking out suckers cuz I'm so much better
At rapping so what could it be
Give me a mic and a beat and you'll soon see
I'm to cool sir Too $hort
Turing everything out from here to New York
Remember my name and I be back
On the mic all night just spitting my rap
True blue king, never been crowned
I'm so fresh I could never be clowned
Its just like that until the end of time

Lollypops,What’s My Favorite Word?,2002.0,"Tell a nigga.. telephone, telegram; two-way that motherfucker
Somebody let him know.. tell that nigga
His bitch is out of pocket

It was me and yo' broad, ridin in my 'llac
She tried to climb on top of me and slide on my lap
I said hold on baby, we almost to the spot
We gon' do somethin nasty, with all this lust you got
I fucked her on the floor then we got up in the bed
Woke up in the mornin, can't remember what we did
Last night we was drunk, stinkin dirty motherfuckers
Stayed up all night, 'til 7:30 can't touch us
When we down on the beach, in the sand in Miami
I done found me a freak, done got my hand in her panties
She was playin in the water, MAN she was wet
So I laid her on her back, I pulled her panties to the left
I told her.. naww baby, we ain't do it too soon
Straighten up your dress, let's go up to my room
Tell your man you was lost, ran into a boss
Then I opened that ass up like a can of sauce

We don't like those lollypops
Sucker ass niggas don't know how we rock
They can't even handle it
When you tell the truth, they can't stand a bitch
We don't like those lame marks
That run the other way when the game starts
Cause they don't know what to do
Don't lie tell me why would I fuck with you

Stop hatin since we datin the same lady
Don't hate the player, hate the game baby
I like her style, she's kinda wild
And when we do it we don't waste time goin out
We into it like the X-Rated flick with no plot, it's so hot
Don't hesitate and don't stop 'til we on top
She got a dude - but what I gotta prove?
Ain't no need to creep, you know she's a freak
Take it all, 'til the balls, disappear in her jaws
Then she take off them drawers, let me hit them sugar walls
And when I'm done havin fun tryin to be a player
She kiss my thang goodbye and say I'll see you later
Now if you can't take it mayne you need a good girl
Take a ride around the town and try to look for her
Cause yo' wife's a hoe, you might like to know
If she see a big dick, she might go..


I watched her eye, she witcha man, stop starin
Stop the lies, there's no comparin
You wanna ride well let's go; I got a magic carpet with vogues
I'm nice to the ladies but I'm hard on the hoes
And when you jump in my car bumpin ""Freaky Tales""
You told me pull it out, you wanna see it's real
I know your type girl, you ain't fin' to wait
That's how a pimp taste ridin on the interstate
It's in your mouth, make you wanna scream and shout
You can swallow or spit, when the cream comes out - bitch!
Just don't tell your man
Cause whores start wars when they know they can
I understand, you really wanna do me
Dance to a slow jam, ""Feelin' on Your Booty""
And after tonight, when you kick it with a real one
All them fake-ass niggas you ain't even gon' feel 'em (hell nah)",https://genius.com/Too-short-lollypops-lyrics

This thang on my hip got me feeling violent
(“Hi, kids, do you like violence?”)
Your bitch kinda wet, looking like an island
She on something, I can see her eyelids
Keak tryna tell me ‘bout some shit that I did
I’m getting juiced and I’m feeling violent

Nigga, I don’t give a fuck ‘bout getting kicked out this club
Every nigga that I’m with ‘bout to turn the fuck up
C.T. on the beat, man, you know that shit slap
That’s your freak on the beat ‘bout to make her ass clap
Give a fuck he gets mad—pussy nigga, do something
You a sucka, you a sissy, you ain’t ‘bout to nothing
You a Cookie, I’m a Lucious; Eazy-E, bitch, I’m Ruthless
We go stupid like it’s still ’06, you a doofus, bitch, you’re useless
After I fuck, man, I call that bitch a Uber
I’ll slide on your squad like a kid on a scooter
And your bitch on my dick from the rooter to the tooter
You an Internet thug, you only hard on a computer
Fuck your bitch then I boot her, bust one on her hooters
Leave her in the Boondocks, Aaron McGruder
Shrunk up like a tutor, act like I never knew her
I leave a punk bitch on ice like a cooler

I said this drink in my cup got feeling violent
This pill that I popped got me feeling violent
This thang on my hip got me feeling violent
(“Hi, kids, do you like violence?”)
Your bitch kinda wet, looking like an island
She on something, I can see her eyelids
Keak tryna tell me ‘bout some shit that I did
I’m getting juiced and I’m feeling violent

Security better go on somewhere, ‘Fuck you mean ain’t no hats?’
Bitch, I already bought a table, and it cost me two racks
Better have my bottles right, and the chasers on point
Got some ‘woods rolled up, got some papers for a joint
Fuck them freeloading bitches—they ain’t chip in, they ain’t sippin’
$hort, go on with all that cool shit, talkin’ ’bout I’m trippin’
Muthafuckin’ right I’m trippin’, they done charged me some bands
So if a bitch wanna sip, I bet she comin’ out her pants
Bitch better dance, fuck a groupie and a stan
“Get away from me, blood! I don’t want no pictures with no man!
All these hoes up in here, and you tryna take a flick?
Better knock you a bitch and get the fuck off my dick!”
Crack a nigga in his head with a champagne bottle
Little Brodie keep a .40 and that .40 filled with hollows
We gon’ kick this bitch off, we startin’ a riot
You know them Oakland niggas crazy, bitch, we violent

I said this drink in my cup got feeling violent
This pill that I popped got me feeling violent
This thang on my hip got me feeling violent
(“Hi, kids, do you like violence?”)
Your bitch kinda wet, looking like an island
She on something, I can see her eyelids
Keak tryna tell me ‘bout some shit that I did
I’m getting juiced and I’m feeling violent

Here We Go,Can’t Stay Away,1999.0,"We talk shit, cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When ya'll want heat we provide it, ride it
'Til the wheels fall of, shaking 'em all off
Six figure niggas with it, over did it, spit it
In ways that'll cause a rush
Keeping your face in a state of disgust
Hating but still trying to be like us

Twist the lime on the corona, grab my crime diploma
Then head to the block, to pull up five in the mona
Shit, I need to chrome up, become a home owner
Look lifes a bitch, but im on her
I almost cracked this, no more hustling backwards
Up the ave I zip, nigga trying to have shit
Im your average, ghetto nigga turned maverick
You'd never, said to a nigga ""Whateve for the cash, im with""
I dont have step, I leave it in youre averix
Then shoot it it the air, whateva I have left
Outlaw, simply I out draw y'all
Wether clubs or the street, I out ball y'all
Niggas ain't ready, I doubt all y'all
Fly ass niggas I reroute all y'all
If it ain't for the paper I dont show my face up
Make a bet I turn the ace up, $hort and Jay, what

I never stop making money dont give 'em no slack
Drinking dirty motherfuckers til a ho come back
With my scratch, bitch I was born to mack
To uphold the pimping, I was sworn to that
I hear a lot of shit talking when I listen to rap
Only a few mc's get to hang that plaque
On the wall rappers ball, but they dont live phat
Nigga, I doubt if you go gold or platinum
What we do has only been mastered by a few
I take a half a million tapes sell 'em straight to you
All that shit niggas talking just can't be real
I dont need a record deal, I need eighteen wheels
I roll right up in the hood I got tapes for sell
Bitches running in their house they can't wait to tell
Somebody, she got a new Too $hort tape
And hes spitting pimp game with his homeboy Jay

We talk shit, cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When ya'll want heat we provide it, ride it
'Til the wheels fall of, shaking 'em all off
Six figure niggas with it, over did it, spit it
In ways that'll cause a rush
Keeping your face in a state of disgust
Hating but still trying to be like us

Now here they come again the gold diggas trying to get paid
Wanna trick the old rich niggas, trying to get laid
She'll suck his dick, as soon as she meet him
Dont have to sell a body for me I dont need her
To turn tricks for me, how much you cost bitch?
Im all about large bank deposits
On and off the mic I always set trends
Either you see with bitches, or Im rolling with pimps
Brook-laan to Oakland, I keep smokin'
Jay-Z and short dog at these hoes again
The kinda niggas that'll take a square bitch around the corner
Put this pimp game on her
I dont fuck with broke hoes and I dont trick
But I'll still rub my big ass dick on her clit
Get her hooked, wanna be mine I need some money
If she ain't kicking in all the time she dont want me

Hoes, flows, money, cars
Y'all wannabe stars can't fuck with none of these bars
This is real nigga rap, we can spit it through the mic
And you can feel niggas scratch, and sell a mil if that
So real when we drop this shit its in trouble
When I guess the pair you gotta ship it double
In the independent phenom, y'all minature dons
Wannabe jigga, pops styles and hennessy richa'
When I die, leave my canopy richa'
I put it down hard ever since I entered the pit'cha
Can fuck with me for records to the recreational cent'a
I got it wrapped y'all from the grammys to the back park
Short dog y'all, what you thought y'all, Oakland, Bk, New york y'all
Be the voice for the streets we supply for years
And go platinum on our most quiet years

We talk shit, cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When ya'll want heat we provide it, ride it

Damn girl!  Better get you some management
All this time you been trickin for the low-low?
You coulda been gettin rich, you just don't know
Girl you worked all night for that chump change?
Let them ballers write you off as a fun thang?
Take my hand - I got a quick plan
I know you dream about marryin a rich man
See his wife in the Benz with the cute babies?
The hype'll make your friends and you crazy
Cause you know about his two ladies
But he ain't fuckin wit'chu baby
Come holla at your Uncle $hort
I'll have you playin these niggas like a sport (HA HA!)

All this time you play around, you love to love me lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick
All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face - why you hobo ho?

My name is Too $hort, I'm known for pimpin women
And last night, I did it again
New money, new bitches
Why they actin crazy, who is it?
I never heard of Too $hort - then you must be a square
Fuck around and get slapped when you fucks with a player
Real women get much respect
Golddiggers and groupies, don't fuck with it
I'd rather get a real ho
Put the bitch to work and get some real dough
I don't wanna spend a night for cash
What'chu been doin all day wit your triflin ass? (Bitch!)


I made too many songs, to name the tracks
Not enough walls, to hang the plaques
Say hater, what you aimin at?
You ain't no G, you can't be claimin that
Your girl said she had to find a trick
Cause she don't like you, OR your tiny dick
I don't really care, what she's sayin
As long as this song, is what she's playin
I know she better slow that roll
I ain't said a word and yo' ho just chose
You know I gotta take her from you
And after today, you couldn't make her want you (HA HA HA)


I just don't know what bitches see, why all these hoes want chicken feed
Ain't none of these hoes worth 50 cents, so break these ladies all you pimps
Never have this much fun anywhere, to go back home I just don't care
Me leave this game no I don't dare - why you hobo ho?

Set Up,What’s My Favorite Word?,2002.0,"One.. two.. one, two, three, four

First we got the crack
Then we got the gats
Then they changed all the laws
It was a set up
Lockin all the young homies up
Gettin 'em all shot dead in the streets
Straight set up
I remember when the world went crazy
Crack cocaine, hit the streets in the 80's
Right before the crack they was smokin fat
They called it freebase and rich folks did that (that's right)
It's all good, but nobody in the hood
Put powder in water and cooked it, they never would (naw)
A white boy did it, showed niggas how to get it
The rich man's high got the ghetto addicted
It used to be expensive, fuck that ten shit
Turnin out cute little bitches that was innocent
Five years later, she to' up from the flo' up (be-itch)
Niggas used to kiss her, now the bitch smell like throw-up
(hoe) What? I'm tellin the truth
The man had a plan that was killin the youth
You can smoke it, or sell it, if you choose you lose
It was a set up, got everybody singin the blues
They gave you the crack to start flippin your sack
You makin your money, it's sittin in stacks (yeah)
You bought you some gats, for niggas who jack
Put a 50 in the crib, motherfucker bag that (nigga what?)
Somebody died, you're goin to war
You got a lot of straps and you want some more
You in the little leagues, AK's from the Middle East
Guns and coke, you wanna get a piece?
It was a set up, that's what the O.G.'s say
I heard Rick got his dope from the CIA
A new kind of baller out in sunny Los Angeles
Benzes, houses, young niggas havin this
Oakland got a taste and all over the place
Detroit to Miami they was rollin case
Down to I-75, whatchu need in Atlanta
White Christmas, a bag full of dope like Santa
(Whatchu need homey whatchu need?) It was a set up
(I got whatchu need baby, I got whatever you need)
(You got the money? I got the llello)
Don't look in his eyes, use your automatic weapons
Shoot in the crowd and keep steppin (that's yo' ass)
Read about it later, wrong nigga got hit
Shot a gangster in the leg, but you killed a little kid
Now where in the fuck did the guns come from?
They used to put 'em up and say you want some?
Now you get shot, makin all that loud noise (nigga)
Have your pistol on your side like the cowboys (beotch)
Cause you can make a lot of money when you sellin dope
Sell your soul to the devil, say to hell with the Pope
At the Benz dealer (yea I want that one) spend a hundred thousand cash
You feelin like a hoe, money comin out your ass
In a way, it's not your fault
You stupid as fuck, that's why you got caught
You never get out, and I'm still amazed
You shoulda opened up a biz and bought some real estate
(I'm havin money) Niggas strapped like the military
Know how to cook it, package it and get it there
You get paid? You coulda been a CPA
When you weigh that yay, tell the DEA
It ain't mine (it ain't mine) I don't wanna do no time
They got the new laws havin niggas snitchin and lyin
Cause what we do y'all we gotta get our own hustle
I'm cool on the coke, I don't want no trouble (fuck that)
I got a felony (one strike) I was caught in a bust
Got probation, they can't stop us (unstoppable)
I got two gat cases and I still ain't been to jail
They caught my little homey on the hill and made him tell
He told about the murders and the whole operation (shit)
I feel like the slave, on a plantation
Now I'm stuck in here, and don't wanna stay
I wish I was a kid so I could go out and play

Fresh out the gate when I meet a bitch
I tell her, ""Check it out, do you need a pimp?""
My mama taught me how to treat a woman
The game taught me how to treat a bitch

I know I probably broke a lotta hearts in my life
Quite a few, one or two I shoulda wifed
But ain't no tears, I ain't cryin' 'bout nothin'
That's the way the game go, that's the way the game comin'
I stay on point when hella shit goes down in the town
No matter what happened, I still stayed down
I stay pimpin' with my tools, that's all I need
Some bad bitches, some good weed
And if you're ever looking for me and you need a friend
Just holla at a pimp if you see me again
I never would stunt on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
And nowadays, I ride luxury shit
I'm doing 150 while she sucking my dick
They say ""bitch, bitch, bitch"" is all I say
But that bitch kept me paid

I'll give you some game if you need some
I'll always be a friend if you need one

Ride with you, ride with you, yeah

You stay talking on the beat, we got another one
If you get a lotta money, give your brother some
Why they always fuckin' with you, Joe?
Get a bitch and get paid like Too $hort
Dedicated to the game, tryna get mine
She wanna choose on me, bitch, get in line
I hustle all night and in the daytime
But if you ain't fine

I'll give you some game if you need some
I'll always be a friend if you need one

Drama (drama) just picture me and you gettin our freak on in the sauna (sauna)
Stress free without no rubbers or no condoms (condoms)
That's the real, treatin each other, crustaceans, {?} or Benihana's
No more 7/11, time for real chimichongas
Sheeeit, f'real f'real, we'll change the program up so quick


I see her choosin, it won't take me long
I got too much game, so I cain't be wrong
Ain't no safety zone, for a bitch when I'm around
I lead her anywhere and go pimp her by the town
I'm Too $hort baby that's what I do
You wanna play all the broads, but I do too
You know the rules of the game, take my hoe, ain't no shame
Cause I can do the same thang
You wanna sleep wit her, be sneaky and try to creep wit her
She take his cash and he let her
Not knowin, I was gon' get it all
You love the way we players ball


She like them paid niggas, let 'em have they way wit it
She like them baller niggas yaeh you know we all hit it
She like them real G's who treat her like she's filthy
She like to keep the square even though she still be fuckin
With that other nigga, that's what she likes
Niggas packin pistols

Niggas ridin bikes
Rated PG if you keep on the lights
You ain't gotta work hard, you his wife
Fight in clubs and I'm lookin at the price
Nails and toes, get some done
Not his kid but he calls him son
I don't know what you did but you got him sprung
Never me doe (me doe) I'm hard as a diamond
That ain't me hoe (me hoe) I'm a hustler
Be timin to the utmost (utmost) shinin and grindin
With my kinfolk (kinfolk) collectin and stackin my loot
Steppin with soldiers and trues, pimpin and panderin hoes
Strikin a player pose (strikin a player pose)
 - 1/2

That's what she is
A funky, once a month bleedin, dirty down BITCH
That what she is, you know what I'm sayin?
Like you call me a pimp
Somebody somebody would take that offensively
A square would, you know what I'm sayin?
Or some, some brothers get mad cause you say nigga
Right? Well the bitch, to her
At least to, to my hoes, that's more of a, a pet name",https://genius.com/Too-short-cootie-cootie-coo-lyrics

I ain’t throwin’ no money
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You know what? I give a fuck about a bitch

Nigga, who is that?
She ain’t nothin’ but a ringtone (Why?)
‘Cause she everybody theme song
I let it rain, bitch, leave me ‘lone
I ain’t broke, I’m in the green zone
I just touched down on a hoe, look
If she fuckin’ up, I throw the flag on the floor
If she bad, get her number, call a blitz on that hoe
And then I add up everything that I get from that hoe, let it go
Let it go, stop swingin’ on the pole
Line it up, free throw, two shots, let it go
Ten-hut, ten-hut, baby, either right or left
They don’t give you no money mean you don’t wanna fuck?
Pop that pussy like a cork
Made it motor for the sport
Got her comin’ out her shirt when she twerk
And cat daddy go to work

I ain’t throwin’ no money
She wanna smoke, you wanna eat and drank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You wanna fuck then count my bank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
Little bitch, I don’t care if you strip
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You know what? I give a fuck about a bitch

They ain’t gon’ play this at the strip club
But I don’t give a fuck if the bitch fuck
I ain’t got nothin’ on the pussy
Stop asking for shit, you too pushy
No, I don’t need no ones
I’m wondering why this bitch ain’t giving me no funds
You want me to throw all my money at her?
I ain’t giving her shit, I ain’t giving her…
I’d get some money with a bitch
It’s some hoes out here getting chips
This other bitch got her hands out
I said, “Bitch, stop pulling your pants down
Standing there looking like you wanna cry
You wanna sell me something I don’t wanna buy
I don’t want a discount, and I don’t want it for free
You selling pussy? You better sell it for me”

I ain’t throwin’ no money
She wanna smoke, you wanna eat and drank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I ain’t throwin’ shit, I don’t care what y’all think
I ain’t throwin’ no money
Little bitch, I don’t care if you strip
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I give a fuck about a bitch

The game, that’s what I represent
So if you see me, just say, “What’s up, pimp?”
You ain’t gotta tell me what you spent
‘Cause these bitches, they nicknamed “Your rent”
And that’s cool, if that’s how you feel
You like to help a bitch out with her bills?
It’s all in the name of fun, she gon’ give you some
If you throw a few thousand ones

I ain’t throwin’ no money
She wanna smoke, you wanna eat and drank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You wanna fuck then count my bank?

But if you had a million dollars, could I have it?
If I was broke and starvin, would you feed me?
If I drove a big car, would you see me?
While I'm foldin yo' money in half
If you was holdin on down to yo' last
You know I need it, everything you got
I gotta get it or we'll never see the top
If it was a Happy Meal, or a half-a-mill
It's the same thing baby, that's real
Don't matter if you're holdin out, no doubt
If you fuckin Ludacris bitch, +Rollin' Out+
With a Chinese name, Won Gone
Pack yo' bags, and get the fuck on
It's understandable, why I do what I do
Gettin money every day and I'm still comin through, right..

I'm a woman that'll hold you down
When the other ones can't be fou-ounnnd, that's right
I'm a woman that'll keep you rich
When the others want you to tri-iiiick - that's right

I need team players, to roll with
Get down with an O.G., knowin it
Would you mix Hennessy, with Tanqueray?
Let me fuck yo' best friend every day
Would you walk from Compton to Hollywood
From Richmond to Oakland I got it good
From the Soul Train Awards to the Grammys
From New York City to Miami
If I went to jail, would you bail me out?
If I went through hell, would you help me out?
Get a king and have better things
Sell your grandmomma's wedding ring
Unconditional love, would you donate yo' kidneys?
I wanna know how much would you give me
Let my dawg hit it, matter fact let us all get it
Break somethin off on it, right..


I woke up one day in the A-T-L
With a pocket full of money feelin way too real
Thinkin bout what happened 'fore I went to sleep
I'd be broke if it wasn't for the pimp in me
Read my mind, I want what you got
Top down girl, bumpin 2Pac
You got too much money in your freak pants
That's why I keep my ladies in a deep trance
From January to December
She can't remember, her mind's in a blender
Wake up in the back of a Caddy
Don't even know who's your momma or your daddy

My dick's in her mouth, let a hoe be a hoe
Cause I flip 'em like pancakes
I smoke weed like Scoot and Band-Aid
Comin back, from Humboldt County
All I blow is kush, I don't want no brown weed
So light it up, let's get it on
I smoked a lot of purp but that shit is strong
You can buy it on the turf, that's whassup
But niggas like me hit the cannabis club

I only shop at the weed store
Smoked it all up now I need some more
That's what I do - what you ain't knowin?
I got/bought some O.G. kush and I'm still blowin

Ain't nuthin changed I'm still blowin the purp
Ridin in my car, goin to work
My clothes are wreakin, but fuck the smell!
You can say what you want nigga I cain't tell
I smoke half on the way, the other half later
Receptionist flirtin with me, I don't wanna date her
I just wanna hit, and sleep with the slut
We can smoke and fuck but don't keep in touch
She got a sexy body, yeah she's a hottie
She's a nymphomaniac, nasty and naughty
I'm wit'chu girl, if you say so
She gave me a massage and I gave her a facial

I just spent 28 days in rehab
Weed and alcohol, I need it bad
Shit won't help - I've quit before
Didn't take too long for me to hit some more
I used to smoke Newports but I had to stop
I even used to smoke my weed with rocks
My square girlfriends said I need to stop
But I'm hooked on weed like it's hop, bitch!
And I don't need no poppy seed
No coca leaf, or no PCP
All I need is some good-ass weed
Keep the styrofoam cup, you can have that E

Don't be mad at me
Cause you a stupid motherfucker you don't have to be
Fuck the peer pressure - what you ain't knowin?
You can do you Mr. Kush and keep blowin

Where the pimps at? Where all the pimps at? Beeitch!
Where the pimps at? Where the pimps at?
Where the pimps at? Where all the pimps at?

All pimps ain't men, all hoes ain't women
Why you always braggin when you know you ain't in it
Why you so fake, man you're just a lil' wimp
Why you wanna shake hands and touch a real pimp
I heard you went to jail and got broke for your smokes
You know you ain't nothin but a joke to my folks
If you had game, the world could be yours
But you don't even know that your girlfriend's a whore
She's good at suckin dick, make you cum quick
She's got her own website, pay her rent to click
It ain't free, and no she's not a lonely bitch
She likes to shop, I hope you're not her only trick
Cause if you fuck with her
You're not her man, you're just a customer
Cain't even hang with the boys
All the real pimps make some noise
 * last line changed
* Where all the pimps at? All the pimps in the house make some noooise

Ye-yeahhhhhh, hey hey
Yeah baby, all that we have seen
On the TV screen about, all that we have dreamed of
Is not before you, real pimps own game
Real macks on this
It's Mr. Real Feel Pimpin at you once again
Game done changed but I'm still at them Benjamins
So break bread hoe, huh, get too it honey
Make it rain in this bitch like Hurricane Money
Big macks on 'gnacs now get your {?} on deck
We breakin bitches in Hollywood with them big fat checks
It ain't hard for you to fit in, go do the figures
You fuckin with gator legends some, some bigger niggas
Mack A-C-E, in 3-D
Representin this motherfuckin P-I-M-P
I-N-C bitch now don't hate it
Game decorated, Pimpin' Incorporated

Relationships, they come and go
Next thing you know she's on the flo'
Dancin, she wants some mo'
Her ex-boyfriend he'll never know
She's still sprung, can't tell her nuttin
She was young, when she fell in love with him
Used to spend every day with him
He cheated, and now she's hatin him
He's a fraud, don't tell her that
You can do a background credit check
Show her how to have better sex
And it still ain't over - never that~!

It ain't over, I want you to get it closer
Wanna get to know what, what I want will get me goin
It ain't over, got a man but he ain't gonna
Wanna get me goin, come on baby show me what's up

You hot, girl I'm thizzin too!
So you gotta be home at 10?

While we havin sex and you hella loud

You say you want it and that I'm in love
I got another but I'm feeling yah
You so hot, but I been involved too long
It ain't over, boy I just can't go, oh no

You think he slept around
Held you back and kept you down
You was sad, are you happy now?
At your momma and your daddy's house
With a sad and long face
Wishin you had yo' own place
You've been lonely lately
Even tried to go on and datin
But then you met me, I'm a different type
Can't fall in love, I'm pimpin right
Probably wanna fuck by the end of the night
Push your dress up and your panties aside
The best ever, it can't be true
I'ma pull on your hair and spank you too
You like it rough, I think you do
I'ma beat it up 'til the pink turn blue

You say you want it and that I'm in love
I got another but I'm feeling yah
You so hot, but I been involved too long

Call it Gangster,What’s My Favorite Word?,2002.0,"I was so glad, when they said unto me
Let us go into the house, of the gangsters

If you don't call this gangster, I don't know what a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is
Said it's one thing to be real, but real ain't all a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is
I know

I was so glad...
I only smoke with the folks that came in when I came in
I don't smoke with bitches cause I don't know where they mouth been
Dawg I'm a celebrity, I got fans, I don't need friends
I don't need security, cause they ain't checked me when I came in
All that you impressed with, is what I already did
The life you choose to emulate, that's the life I live
Dream house, dream car, quarter past that
That money that you makin, was my champagne tab
Dawg, that's yo' girl?  Be cool, relax
I just need her tonight, call the phone, you can get her back
You gon' ball then ball, you gon' mack then mack
Your mouth sayin one thang, but your action don't say that
You told me all aboutcha, and I ain't even asked
Look at ya, nervous, jittery, can't stare me in the eyes can ya?
Real recognize real, you can't deceive a gangster
Short Dawg, Petey Pab', what was y'all thankin?


I know you wanna live the good life
New car, new house, what it look like?
You'll never see it, tryin to be somethin that you're not
You runnin to the car cause you don't wanna get shot
But at the bar you was hard
Ain't even no straps in your car, you better call the law
They got guns, you got a cell phone
Do some gangster shit, and get the hell on
... You talked all that shit
But a bunch of ass-whuppins, that's all y'all get
Actin tough in the club
You found out you was fuckin with some thugs; put them hands on ya
So fast you ain't know what happened
Outside seen 'em ridin in a fo' do' cabin
Tryin to kill you, this shit is real fool
You won't survive in the streets if you don't know the rules


Uhh; Black Continental, suicide golds
Gators hit the flo', I ain't payin at the do'
While you fly outside, waitin for the guest list
And to get frisked, it's niggas like me creepin with heat
That'll burn ya crisp
I'm at some work, you would open your mouth to kiss
Why you at the bar, roused off Cris'
No longer courageless, grabbin hoes by the wrist
Chose one, mix wasn't hit, so you wet her clothes
And said BITCH - put it on thick, like Lonzo in ""Training Day""
Not knowin she with a clique, that's aimin at your face
Soon as they get word, hope your friends don't desert
And valet got your Benz parked next to the curb
You ain't a gangster, L7
Quick to bail out, like a nigga in jail stressin
A lesson to be learnt, bout what a gangster is

Well I hope he got skills if you know what I mean
Everything from oral sex, to cookin and cleanin
Rich niggas want it all, just like you

You wanna be kept, keep yo' mouth shut
But youse a golddigger and you go out too much
If I choose you, it'll be the wrong choice
I'm sayin fuck you loud, with a strong voice
One rainy day and yo' ass is out
No money to spend, you start passin out
So dramatic, even though it ain't yo' cash
Bitches like you I wanna thank yo' ass
For bein shallow, I know you a bad ho
I wouldn't let yo' punk-ass stand next to my shadow

The only thing he own is that outfit
But he still stuck his dick in yo' mouth bitch

He called a taxi to take you home in the mornin
Dumb bitch, you just got fucked by a flunkie
See you at the club and you actin like you want ME
Don't make me laugh
We get married, and you take half
I don't think so, see you at the bank ho
You wanna walk down the aisle but I cain't go
I got her number, but I never call her
You better look around and find another baller, beotch!

I don't want yo' key, you ain't gettin mine
Ask to use my car, you commitin a crime
Leave yo' panties or yo' bra, I throw 'em away
Cain't find the door? I show you the way
Hope you come back, but you just cain't stay
We can get together on another day
I come get you, when I miss you
Cause if I see you every day I'd probably diss you
What'chu gon' do when you get you a baller?
Rich man, what she gotta do to get you to call her?
Better talk about, might like what you hear
Say it right in her ear, every night of the year
You can be together, beotch!
You better get a job if you wanna be rich
Go to school or somethin, get a degree
I know you wanna baller but it can't be me

You say you never would fuck wit' a player
You so happy, you in love with a square
You got your little car and your apartment
You don't want a thug nigga always tryin' to start shit
All you ever wanted was to be in love
But you can't stop starin' when I pull up
'Cause you got an eye for some shit that's fly
When I jumped out my car, you slipped and said ""Hi""
We talked for a while and it made me wonder
Why you say you got a man and still gave me your number?
'Cause all I'm talkin' 'bout is gettin' money
I heard it from your homegirl, you said you didn't want me
Now you're on my line all the time just to holler
Askin' me all about how to get them dollars
That other bitch, yeah, I know how she got it
I don't wanna tell you, though, 'cause you ain't my bitch
(You ain't my bitch)

If you see a real pimp walk in the door
A broke ass bitch, I don't give her no (Mercy)
Choose on me, she'll be gettin' more
Fuckin' up the game, I don't give her no (Mercy)
If I don't want the money, what I'm pimpin' for?
If she ain't gettin' money, I don't give her no (Mercy)
If she ain't on point when I send a ho
I'ma fire that bitch, can't give her no (Mercy)

I used to have this little bitch from The Town
She knew how to get money, so I took her all around
She was a good one, things couldn't be better
But I knew it wouldn't last forever
And after that, I knocked so many hoes at the house
I had to move away 'cause I turned 'em all out
And now, I'm so international
They come around me, these bitches have to go
If she give me that look like she wanna get with me
I'm sendin' her, like a delivery
She'll be knockin' at your door, you got a pocket full of hundreds
You could have that ho, you could do what you want wit' it
So what you gotta say, mayne?
Get your ass out the game if you can't hang
Ain't no secret how we do it, it's a Bay thang
And if you keep them hoes workin', man, they stay payin'

If you see a real pimp walk in the door
A broke ass bitch, I don't give her no (Mercy)
Choose on me, she'll be gettin' more
Fuckin' up the game, I don't give her no (Mercy)
If I don't want the money, what I'm pimpin' for?
If she ain't gettin' money, I don't give her no (Mercy)
If she ain't on point when I send a ho
I'ma fire that bitch, can't give her no (Mercy)

So I started knockin' bitches from out of town
Showed 'em how to get money, showed 'em how to get down
I say, ""What you doin' in this small town, girl?
It's too little, I know you wanna travel around the world
Come on, it's gotta be a better way
Than you strippin' in this club for 300 a day"" (Fuck that)
""Now, what you wanna do wit' your life?
You ain't close to your family and you're nobody's wife
You been to Vegas? I'll take you to the top of the world
To the Stratosphere, way up in the air
You wanna fuck with a player in the game gettin' it?
You wanna see your name on a plane ticket?"" (I got you)
""Or should I leave you stuck, bitch?
Ridin' around town in your little ass bucket
And no need to keep discussin' it
You choosin', bitch, what's up wit' it?"" (What's up wit' it?)

If you see a real pimp walk in the door
A broke ass bitch, I don't give her no (Mercy)
Choose on me, she'll be gettin' more
Fuckin' up the game, I don't give her no (Mercy)
If I don't want the money, what I'm pimpin' for?
If she ain't gettin' money, I don't give her no (Mercy)

Bring yo' ass back, here right now
Cook my food, and clean my house
Put my dick, in yo' mouth
Hell naw bitch you ain't goin out
You better realize she's a ho by nature
Takes one to know one fo'sho' I'm a player
She ain't really happy 'less she lickin a dick
With a sucker-ass nigga that be trickin an' shit
You can't train the pussy, by lockin it up
Raw dickin the pussy, and knockin it up (nope)
She still gon' be a ho and a baby by you don't mean shit
What kind of player are you?  Let's get rich
Run the game with no glitch
Look her in the eye and say BEITCH!

Analyze the game and tell me why; cause pimpin won't die
As long as these tricks want pussy to buy; the pimpin won't die
You can analyze the game and tell me why
Y'know the pimpin can't die BEITCH
As long as you believe I'll never lie - can't die..

Ain't no need, for you to front (nope)
Keep it real with these hoes, they give you what you want
Tell the bitch, you wanna fuck (yup)
If she say no.. so what?
Cause all you really wanna do is get this cash
Pull hundred dollar bills out a bitch's ass
Too many niggas with the wrong agenda
Can't love the bitch, turned around to pimp her
Make your wife your ho, and your ho your wife
You can't do this dumb shit your whole life
That ain't pimpin - you need to let that go
Run home to your wife and forget that ho

Analyze the game and tell me why (tell me why).. it won't die
As long as these tricks want pussy to buy; this pimpin won't die
You can analyze the game and tell me why; the pimpin won't die
As long as you believe I'll never tell a lie - it cain't die..

Nigga you all straight lines and fo' corners
Squarer than a motherfucker, Oakland California
That's where I got my name, I never could change
Runnin through the streets of the O is to blame mayne
You always frontin - whassup wit you?
You either do what you told or tell people what to do
Are you a boss or a worker - you big pimpin
All by yourself and ain't got no women

Analyze the game, please tell me why.. the pimpin won't die
As long as these tricks want pussy to buy.. pimpin cain't die
You can analyze the game and tell me why.. y'know the pimpin won't die
As long as you believe I'll never lie - pimps up hoes down beatch

Top Down (Part II),UnKnown,UnKnown,"We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind
How freaky can you get to a Morning Strip?
Hella freaky like I said to a song that hit
I'm the dirty rapper Too Short, the Rated X
I Got The Girls, Cause You're Hated Than Sex
Which is worse, my bark or my bite?
You heard about me and now I'm Jocking you
All Day & Night
You must of thought I got nicer, talking about Heiser
I'm an old dogg and old dogg's get wiser
Caught up in the game, got ya thinking while your doing this
You never did this, Hangin' With The Big Pimp
You Know What? You better check the size, and recognize
When I'm between your thighs
Ride, I get hard from the sound of a kick drum
Laughing And Smiling They Be Watching A Sitcom
Shiny bald head catching sun rays
Going backwards down runways
Four eighteens with the zues and the Zapco
Sounding like I'm riding out a concert at a rap show
Hit a back street and put the top up
Stopped at the light see some Girls watch 'em jock us
I'm so roll with my electric top
Hit a button, ain't gotta get out, Touch with nuthin
I'm Let the top And just lay down
Slamming hard passing by the schools and the playgrounds
Everybody knows when Short's in town
Cause I keep the beats thumping hella hard with my top down
Drop the top
Just drop the top

Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
Nine albums out, ain't changed my talk
A thousands girls walked on I'm still a dogg
Ain't changed nuthing but That Ain't No Love
Still riding through the hood all the homies say ""What's up?""
Give me my props cause I always rock
And I still gets top But They Just Won't Stop
Still smoking Indo getting burned out
Still got the orange juice bottle full of gin 'bout to turn out
A show, a smashed back to the O
Put them Freaks on my beeper then pull some mo'
Cause we y'all straight bump than acne
What can you learn that you just can't mack me?
I'm off of Gin and Juice, don't even introduce
If you ain't with it back up cause I'm finna choose
I want some freaks that could make me write a Freaky Tale
Drawls back, Moving Pack, up in a hotel
Just to say you got some Too Short
You wanna show some evidence, don't swallow don't spit
Cause I bust more nuts than a squirrel
And my tape’s been in decks all around the world
If you had a copy of it and you asked the fan
""What's that?"" I bet you say, ""Too Short, Man""
I still taunt the fine girl and get shot down
I say "","" slam the beat, smash off with my top down
Just riding with my top down

Drop The Drops!!
We rode the AC transit bus
Selling joints for a dollar, smoking angel dust
On the way to a house party, a maybe delux
Selling Too Short tapes, making some bucks
Looking out the window at the Mustang and Falcon crew
Asking myself ""How can you?""
Roll like the Giants down the foothill strip
With beats thumping top down Lovin' It
See I had to have drop, didn't care if I had a Volkswagon
Pick up the beat, had a Whole flaging
Siding with the top down, lit like a lamp
Blowing out the amp, trying to bump a tramp
Most Players couldn't afford to have a drop top
So they got they get cut at the chop shop
Couldn't tell fools nuthin way back then
A lot of homies died or they went to the pen
Couldn't even see the homie Short Bubble
Bank get fat and my whole account double
When I walk in a club Girls say ""Ooh God
Is that you Todd?""
Me and my homies just hoo-ride
And take advantage of a life we never had
Stop eating cheese sandwiches, broke, living bad
I'ma do it for my homies that's there in lock down
Ride with my beats slamming top down",https://genius.com/Too-short-top-down-part-ii-lyrics
Get In Where You Fit In (Video Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"A lot of people try to be what they can't be
And when you be like that you just can't see
What life is all about
Put a roof on your head, put some food on your mouth
'Cause in the long  you got nothin' to prove
Life to me is like funkin' a groove
You gotta get right in where you belong
Find the right mix, and write a song
And don't try to stand all out
Frontin' on them young girls, runnin' yo mouth
You gotta; get yo money on all the time
Althought you put two 11's on bust them rhymes
You gotta hustle, to get every dime you can
'Cause it's hard on a black man
Now how many punks try to come to the hood
Hang around and try to get in good
How many unemployed bitshots do you know?
How many pimps ain't got no hoes?
You said ""Baby must be rich"", 'cause she looked it
When outside she was ridin' in a bucket
With two kids in the welfare check
Fat bank, roll the food stank, you know what's next
Let's have sex, I rather do it by myself


And I just squeeze up
Grab the microphone, another freeze up
In case you didn't know, we got skeezas
Ready to just please us, oh Jesus
(You know they need us)
With the dib-dib-dab man, pimpin' is a hobby
Got a boat float of girls downstairs
And a lobby and you can't be actin' sobby, we ain't havin' that
So pour some Gin over ice, she's feelin' nice so we doin' that
I'm steppin' over to a smooth lead
The way I'm kickin' this game, my nickname should be Bruce Lee
I'm in , sayin' what she wanna hear
My breath's fully loaded with chronic and beer
But oh wait, I really should redeeme myself
But see, I'm stuck on  like a 
See, um, I got the cash but the money ain't nothin'
See, I gets respects from the rhymes I be bustin'
And if you got a question we can settle it like 
But if not, my homies goin' in this penaltin'
And pullin' out a big fat cannon
And if you wanna run,  tripped to 
So act like you know when we flow
All we really wanna know is can you get in where you fit in?
And I pretendin'
So all you fakestas jams for you
So $hort Dogg and my end: (you know it do)

Get in where you fit in, fool
You was a mark up at the high school
Now you're hardcore like CB4
Biting, what you wanna be me for?
It's your life, you wish it was a Too $hort rap
But you gots no game, and your bass ain't fat
You need to quit, rapping just ain't your place
So back on the grind and don't catch no case
You just silly, that's what you always be
Like them young female that try to get with me
I run all up in it but this ain't no race
I (censored) right in her face
You probably wine her and dine her
And get jealous when you can't find her
You're nothing but a mark
I bet you get your ass kicked hanging at the park, punk!
You better watch your back
Before you get jacked by a gangsta with a gat
Cause Life is Too $hort, I'm In the House like that
Shorty the Pimp, was Born to Mack
And I don't stop rapping, one thing I never do
Is stop making this funky-ass beats to ride to
And other rap crews can see
Dangerous Crew got the funky beats
So when I see ya, and act like I don't know ya
I'm like Missouri, cause I can show ya
Why is my beat so funky it stanks?
Pee Wee, Shorty B, and Ant Banks
You outta pocket trying to hang with my crew
You might of just learned, but it ain't that new
What happened to your funk, did you lose it?
Or did you get ganked by Dangerous Music?
We stole all your money, and all your songs
Did you like a tramp and then sent you back home
One punk came and went
Had to fire, yo, but I'm still a pimp
(
MC
) Lawrence (The fake gangsta)
Would've never came up without the Bad-Ass Banksta (you little punk)
Now he's gonna play on out ('Cause he's a mark)
Had to put his fat foot in his mouth (You fat trick)
Quick to say ""I'm sorry"" when you're funny
Y'all can have him, cause Dangerous don't want him
Can tell a lie almost every other minute
I'm like Bennett, I ain't in it
Go on with your reject rap attack
You'll get more from a prize in a Cracker Jack
And since Banks said he can't have no more funk (Hell naw)
Get in where you fit in, punk

Ah, no, did I get him, did I get him?
Wait! (Yeah you got him) It's the end??
(Yeah, it's cool right there)
It don't end right there, it didn't use to end right there",https://genius.com/Too-short-get-in-where-you-fit-in-video-version-lyrics
Fed Up,Still Blowin’,2010.0,"When a player's fed up
There ain't nothin' she can do about it
If I'm runnin' out of love
The bitch is who need to talk about it

It's over - bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
Don't call me, 'cause we ain't got nothin' to do
You on your own now, find a new manager
My bitch is on cruise control - I can't handle her
You so complicated, tellin' lies and stuff
Too emotional for me, and you cry too much
I roll on these hoes when they test my game
They wanna be spoiled, buy 'em extra thangs
We supposed to be a team, real players winnin' shit
We hustle every day and we share the benefits
It used to feel good but now I'm barely feelin' it
'Cause now, I don't really care if we end the shit
Bitch! You gon' change on me?
You better take a good look, 'cause you ain't gon' see
My face... ever again
I'll find a better ho and you can get a better pimp

Now when I'm through wit'chu, ain't no gettin' back
I don't want money from you, and I don't care who's hittin' that
Don't speak when you see me and don't call a player
You can fuck a dog, for all I care, bitch
It ain't the same on your own
I know you miss me, that's why you playin' games on the phone
I'm like Pimp C, I'm just not willing and able
To keep a bitch like you in my stable
You're nothin' but trouble, you never could be on my level
You was turned out first time I said ""hello""
You a freak and you fine but you weak in the mind
And worst of all, you're cheap wit'cha grind
You don't earn enough, got me burnin' up
'Cause you ain't even willin' to learn new stuff
Get the fuck out my face 'cause right now I will
Whup your motherfuckin' ass, bitch, you know how I feel

When a player's fed up

I ain't the one to be makin' it rain
But every damn day I be grippin' on grain
A hundred and seventy karats in my piece and my chain
I like knowledge but I love good brain
Never been to college but I got a degree
In breakin' a bitch, I got a Ph.D
I remember '98, Atlanta gentlemen's club
Buyin' out the bar, smokin' light green drugs
Free Big Meech, nigga; break a Georgia peach, nigga
First verse upfront, ain't no speech, nigga
She jump in the Lambo, money from my pocket
Fuckin' 'round with me, I knock your pussy outta socket

Somethin' better, 'cause she don't really feel much
With that nigga, he don't really freak her tough
She said he can't go deep enough
I don't give a fuck about him or that bitch
She all in my face tryna give me that shit
So hit that, then I give it back
She let me fuck when I want with no strings attached
Like a slave, he owns his wife
Keeps her locked in the house, she lives a lonely life
Never let her out and never says he loves her
Won't even fuck her, barely even touches her
The bitch was sad when she told me all about it
I'm straight from The Town so you know I started poundin'
You mad at your man, what you want me to do?
Give you some dick? Well, bitch, come on through

Show me whatcha workin' wit', bitch, whatcha got
I really wanna fuck witcha, bitch, whatcha got

Grab the microphone, spit this game at you
It never ends, I just keep goin'
Pimps keep pimpin', Hoez keep ho-in'
And niggas like me, never stop hustlin'
Put yo' mind to it, makin' money ain't nothin'
I flip the script, came with this nation-wide shit
All I get is love, so thats all you gonna get
Out here, niggas come from everywhere
Trynna relocate, trynna become playaz
Tryin' to survive the game you know it ain't easy

Backstage chillin, gettin' in the limo
But i dun' click up with these nation wide niggas

Natural born killaz, boys in the hood can ya fil' us?

We ain't trippin' dummy, we nation wide man, we just gettin' money

I'mma be laughin at ya talkin' bout 'there you go'
But if ya rap tight you still might not be right
If we get into some shit and you scared to fight
Some sucker talkin' bout what you wanna do?
From the head, from the hips, ain't no punks in my crew
We used to free-style, at M-C Breeze' house
Same niggas on the mic that make ya bleed now
What? Motherfucker can you hear this shit?
He only got one fear, don't be near his bitch
He never be rich, you ain't ready for the show biz
You need to marry that girl and have four kids
Theres no way you can hang with us
Cause niggas like us are too dangerous
We nation riders, we've been blessed with this game

I was sworn to the pimpin, that's the way it goes
I keep the winners and get rid of lazy hoes
Yeah I pimp her, from Vegas to Hawaii
They know I'm a pimp and her parents still like me
Cause this is business, and you should know
Look around, it's hard to find a good hoe
Before you get my next album, ""Up All Nite""

She's hoein, I'm mackin
Buy some mo' real estate and keep on stackin
You trickin, keep savin 'em
Niggas like you I tell the hoes keep breakin 'em

How Does it Feel,Can’t Stay Away,1999,"Chorus: D' Wayne Wiggins
How does it feel when ya livin like that, and ya pockets are fat?
Cuz you're a playa, and you're pimpin hoes
So tell me how does it feel when ya money ain't right
And ya pockets are tight?
You're still a hustla, and you can't let go
Verse 1:
When I was broke, I used to feel the pain
Now I got money, ain't nothin changed
Same hustla, tryin to hold on to what I got
And thats alot, players like me can't be stopped
I was starvin, couldn't afford a TV Dinner
But now I roll around in a DB-7
Throwin up the two, to the hoes and pimps
It's all about the money, you know what I'm gettin
How the fuck you think I felt when I was broke
All the rumors I got killed and I was smoked
I tell the truth, I don't care how you feel about me
I'm still in the game and you still gotta see
My face goin down the muthafuckin street
Top down, beat loud with a top-notch freak
You say it ain't real life
Cuz you don't know what it feels like, beyotch
Chorus
Verse 2:
I feel like I'm a million dollar bill
Still in the game, all about the real
Can't feel sorry for you, do your thang
Don't be mad at the world cuz you can't hang
If you feel like doin somethin that ain't productive
Look in the mirror, check yourself and say ""fuck it""
It's the year two-thousand, I know you feel me
But I can't understand why you niggas wanna kill me
Went from broke to rich, I got your bitch kneelin
I told her ""smoke this dick bitch, don't fight the feelin""
And when she did it, she started jockin me
I saw it in your eyes, you felt like sockin me
For every action theres a consequence
Playa-haters always tryna start some shit
But then you gotta fight these niggas here
It feels good to be a playa, bitches everywhere
Chorus
Verse 3:
I feel like eleven albums ain't enough
And at the same time you feel like you can't come up
Sometimes real life don't feel right
You been fuckin her for years but its still tight
Then I came through bammin, vagina started expandin
Used to be shallow, but now you landed in
Deep water drownin and thats some real game
It's been your pussy for years, but it don't feel the same
I been creepin, feelin your bitch up on the weekend
Is it still good she calls me Dr. Feelgood
I'll be her last pimp, you just a has been
And when she talks about you its all past tense
I said I don't give a fuck about history
I'll tell you bout my life then show you how this dick'll be
In you all night, go ask your bitch was she feelin me
Man, you niggas be killin me, haters

I just wanna spend yo' dough (spend yo' dough)
Give a pimp what I need (what I need)

And Freddie B, had the tooth fairy turnin tricks
Befo' Eazy-E, Ice Cube, N.W.A

I grew up in L.A., back in the day mayne
I moved to Oakland, and soaked up that bay game
Mo' bounce to the ounce, we was bumpin Spoonie Gee
Or Grandmaster Flash, Sugarhill to me
In 1982 we had fun in the streets
All they played was Too $hort, and Run-D.M.C. nigga
And I was rappin X-rated back then
I was just a lil' kid, but a real mack pimp
Now all these niggas, pimpin, without no hoes
All these niggas, rappin and can't rock no shows
And the rest of y'all frontin, in your videos
Gettin it, actin like some silly hoes
You ain't pimpin mayne! You don't talk like we talk
You like a wannabe gangbanger tryin to C-walk
You ain't a crip motherfucker, and you ain't a B-dawg

Don’t Stop Rappin’ (8Ball & MJG Version),Can’t Stay Away,1999.0,"Space agein', baby (Don't stop rappin')
Right, right, right, right
One time
Bitch
Yeah, you know how we like it, baby

From 1980 through '88
I don't stop rappin' like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell 'em instantly (Instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (The pimp in me)
In '89, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin' to sleep with me
Every night sold out, turnin' young hoes out
Tell her, ""Baby, no doubt, stick this dick in your mouth""
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes (That's right)
Always fuck other niggas' bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin' on 20's, wearin' nice clothes (Nice clothes)
But ain't nothin' like pimpin' hoes, and ridin' Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad to get to the point of havin' this
Opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song

Me, Squeeky, Flex, and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin' white boys bumpin' ""Dope Fiend Beat""
'88, my pockets wasn't straight but I was makin' it
Niggas like Lil Tim was out there ballin', sellin' cakes and shit
I was right there, on Lamar Circle, writin' raps
All about my snaps, tryin' to put Ball & G on the map
Nowadays, I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin' it wit' rich niggas in Rovers and candy 6's
Deliverin' hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggas who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in wit' your chronic, mayne
Short Dog, I don't know why you tried to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writin' raps, makin' more than them niggas movin' weight
The game been good to me and I know that muhfucka blessed you
Thanks for passin' game, now let's get out here and make this loot

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money, bitch, I can't stop rappin'
We some presidential players with money by the layers
Ain't nothin' you broke ass niggas do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money, bitch, I can't stop rappin'
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
And meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

I had to sacrifice, get things right, in this rap life, I paid my dues
Learned how to crawl before I walk, then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tried crime but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact, it did it worse for me
In the eyes of God, went weak when get times get hard
It could only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my fear of pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon' help me to survive
Stay alive, good with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin' fool
Hell, this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin' straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber, nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up where I come from, to make it out is a blessing
'Cause havin' cash where I come from, the little learn they lesson
My first love, even before I had a daughter or a lady
Was rappin', sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see on TV is fame
But the rap, I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I make too much money, bitch, I can't stop rappin'
I live the fast life of an MC
And I sell a lot of records makin' pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make 10 G's
Fuck 'til the mornin', sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always get my dick sucked on the highway

My way, pimp 'til I die, fuck a ho
Unless that ho is breakin' me off some dough to hit the studio
Blowin', niggas ain't knowin' how far this shit is goin'
I wrote all my shit, but niggas always talkin' 'bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them real niggas stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or ho, rich or poor
Eightball got flow, MJG

Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
8Ball & MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
The pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck, so why should we settle down, leave the kitchen, put the kettle down
Stop revealin' all you hoes, give up the life of Trues and Vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too thick
So I hooked up with my comrades so we could all get rich, nigga

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money, bitch, I can't stop rappin'
We some presidential players with money by the layers
Ain't nothin' you broke ass niggas do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money, bitch, I can't stop rappin'
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
And meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

Yeah yeah, one time for your muthafuckin' mind (Don't stop rappin')
Pimp shit, bitch
8Ball & MJG, now what, you ain't me
Short Dog in the house, slammin' Cadillac doors, pimpin' hoes
Nothin' but the real shit, 9-8, for these tricks, it's too late
That old school pimpin' all the way from Memphis to Oakland
Straight smokin', baby, firin' up fat
Atlanta to Houston, we still doin' it like this
Yeah, New York to L.A
Bitch
Ha, that's right, Space Age forever, nigga

Lunch money, and they let me hit it, too
'Cause all I ever wanted was a Cadillac
And some hoes that'll call me Daddy Mack

Bitch, I'm gone! (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I've been gone (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I'm gone! (Is you gone?)

I never had only one girl
If I wanted, I could have any woman in the world
You can't save me from the game
I'm in it for the money, fuck the fame
But everybody seems to know my name
And these hoes, know I ain't playin'
Bitch, I'm gone, and I ain't never comin' back
Yeah, I'm both - I'm a player and a mack
You ain't stupid, you know the business
You under new management and gotta go get it
Next time I see you, have a stack of Ben Franks
Give it all to me, and tell a pimp ""thanks""
Stuff it in the mattress, we don't put it in the bank
Hundred thousand dollar car, puttin' gas in the tank
Use my phone, tell your man you chose
Fuck all that old shit and get some brand new clothes

Bitch, I'm gone! (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I've been gone (Is you gone?)

Bitch, I've been gone (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I'm gone! (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I've been gone (Is you gone?)

You wanna go with me straight to the top?
You gotta check ""yes"" or ""no"" in the box
I was tellin' hoes that shit in '76
All them dreams I used to have I knew I'd better get rich
I wanted all the bad bitches, and all the cars
Drop my top at night and see all the stars
I used to walk down the street daydreamin'
And now it came true, these bitches stay creamin'
And I still don't give no bitches no slack
Get involved with me, fo' sho', bitch, you know that
I don't hold back, I put it out there
Do everything I say and don't doubt a player
'Cause if you do, I ain't fuckin wit'chu
I'm through, I don't want nothin' from you
Just listen to the song
While I put the pedal to the metal
Bitch, I'm gone

Bitch, I'm gone! (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I've been gone (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I'm gone! (Is you gone?)
Bitch, I've been gone (Is you gone?)

I burn rubber on a bitch and I’m out

She ain't gon' see me again
Do it on her own, see if she could win
I'm a champ, I celebrate
Stay the fuck away from me, you hella fake
I don't care if it don't seem fair
And you don’t get it, you ain’t no team player, bitch
If I ain't wit’ it
I'm inside her mind but I ain't tryna hit it
She wants sex, she wanna do me
Money comin' in, I said, ""Bitch, give it to me""
If I let her keep it, she gon’ spend it
I'ma take it all and I'ma keep on pimpin'
You think I got a lotta women? (Hell yeah)
You wonder why I keep havin' auditions?

Burn rubber, she ain't got my shit
And just like that, she's not my bitch
It ain't about money - what is it?
I don't wanna talk, bitch, it ain't about business
Tell me some shit I don't wanna hear
I gotta make a run, I'll be gone for a year
And when I'm gone, better be on your grind
Don't be lyin', 'cause bitch, I could read your mind
And when I'm back, I need all mine
She been stackin' that shit for a long time
It's Too $hort, it's like that
I send her to track, she gon' run it right back

If you're lookin for a baller, baller
From the yay, from the yay
Poppin my collar
If you're lookin for a baller, baller

Whassup baby?  Still dreaming?
For a rich man, you still fiending?
Well I hope you got skills if you know what I mean
Everything from oral sex, to cooking and cleaning
Rich niggas want it all, just like you
And when I ball don't ask me what I do
You want to be kept, keep your mouth shut
But you'se a gold digger and you go out too much
If I choose you, it'll be the wrong choice
I'm saying, ""fuck you"", loud, with a strong voice
One rainy day and you're ass is out
No money to spend, you start passing out
So dramatic, even though it ain't your cash
Bitches like you I wanna thank your ass
For being shallow, I know you a bad ho
I wouldn't let your punk-ass stand next to my shadow


I like a Cinderella story, but most of the time
These nothing-ass gold digging hoes are fine
A nigga fronting, you wanna have sex with a star?
He drive a Benz, but it's the next nigga car
The only thing he own is that outfit
But he still stuck his dick in your mouth, bitch
And after all that getting fucked on the floor
He called a taxi to take you home in the morning
Dumb bitch, you just got fucked by a flunkie
See you at the club and you acting like you want ME
Don't make me laugh
We get married, and you take half
I don't think so, see you at the bank, ho
You want to walk down the aisle but I can't go
I got her number, but I never call her
You better look around and find another baller, beotch!


I don't want your key, you ain't getting mine
Ask to use my car, you committing a crime
Leave your panties or your bra, I throw them away
Can't find the door?  I show you the way
Hope you come back, but you just can't stay
We can get together on another day
I come get you, when I miss you
Cause if I see you every day I'd probably dis you
What you gonna do when you get you a baller?
Rich man, what she gotta do to get you to call her?
Better talk about, might like what you hear
Say it right in her ear, every night of the year
You can be together, beotch!
You better get a job if you wanna be rich
Go to school or something, get a degree

Can’t Stop,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Space, Age in, baby
Right, right, right, right
One time
Beyotch
Yeah, you know how they like it, baby
Nigga you can't retire
From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I Don't Stop Rappin' like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell â€~em instantly
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E
A bunch of fine bitches tryin' to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin' young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggas bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin' on twenties wearin' nice clothes
But ain't nuttin' like pimpin' hoes and ridin' Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin' this
Opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song
Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin' white boys, bumpin' dope fiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin' it
Niggas like Lil' Tim was out there ballin' sellin' cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin' raps
All about my snaps, tryin' to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin' it with rich niggas in rollers and candy sixes
Deliverin' hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggas who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
Short Dawg, I don't know why you tryin' to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin' more than them niggas movin' weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin' game, now let's get out here and make this loot
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
We some presidential players, with money by the layers
Ain't nuthin' you broke ass niggas do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
And meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes
I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin' crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Getting' eyes scarred, bein' weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin' fool
Hell this music thing is all I got
I ain't makin' straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Â€~Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I live the fast life of a MC
And I sell a lot of records makin' pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck â€~til the mornin', sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway
My way pimp â€~til I die, fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin' me off some dough
To hit the studio blowin', niggas ain't knowin'
How far this shit is goin'?
I wrote all my shit but niggas
Always talkin' â€~bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggas
Stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money
And try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG
Here comes the one they call the P I M P
Never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf
Helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too Short
We all must be
The pimps of the industry
Shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin' all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen
This shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades
So we can all get rich, nigga
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
We some presidential players, with money by the layers
Ain't nuthin' you broke ass niggas do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
And meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes
Yeah, yeah, one time, for your motherfuckin' mind
Pimp shit bitch
Eightball and MJG, now what you weigh me
Short Dawg in the house, slammin Cadillac do's, pimpin hoes
Nuthin' but the real shit, nine-eight
For these tricks it's too late
It's that old school pimpin'
All the way from Memphis, to Oakland
Straight smokin' baby, fryin' â€~em up fat
Atlanta to Houston, we still doin' it like this
Yeah, New York to L.A

$hort Dog Wedding,The Pimp Tape,2018.0,"We're gathered here today
To witness the greatest historical marital ceremony of our time
The legendary, honorable Too $hort a.k.a. $hort Dog has proposed to the game
And before we go into the attributes of the game
I've got to give you a scripture
About the emotional mathematics that a fully qualified player has to go through on a daily basis
And there was a scripture in the Mac Bible, Page 211, Chapter 187, Verse 10, that clearly states:
He who trusts a ho shall surely be broke
$hort Dog, do you promise to honor, cherish, and retrospect this game through punishment, incarceration, and pain?
(You know I do)
Do you, $hort Dog, promise to honor, retrospect the fact that a bitch don't belong to you, she belongs to the game?
(Fa sho)
Do you, $hort Dog, retrospect, recognize that you can't make a tramp a champ
Even if the bitch was trained and conditioned by boxing's legendary Angelo Dundee
The bitch'll still be a bust
Oh, $hort Dog (What's up, mayne?)
Do you honor and retrospect this game? (Fa sho)
Put your right hand in the air and solemnly swear
That you'll never put a bitch before a soldier (Never)
So by the power of the game invested in me, I announce $hort Dog officially official
With a clear understanding that I'd never give a bitch sweat off my balls if she was choking in the desert on a peanut butter sandwich
I said he's official like a Shiite Muslim with a nuclear missile
$hort Dog has earned every aspect of this game to be married to the game
And I accept the honor and the respect that one gangsta to another, from one man to another
We are officially bonded, between the game (Biatch)

Maggot Brain,Still Blowin’,2010.0,"Bitch!
Short Short
I'm from The Town

Ten years ago, you was havin' thangs
Now you ain't nothin' but a maggot brain
Used to be on the block gettin at 'em mayne
Back in the days when you was slangin 'caine
Now you fresh out of jail, just comin home
Livin' at your mama's house, nothin' goin on
Can't hustle, and you can't fit in
Hit the corner, but you ain't makin' friends
Your life just twist and turns
Out on parole, now he fin'sta learn
If you sleep too late you can't get the worm
You can't smoke weed 'cause ain't shit to burn
That's where you at, and ain't no way back
These lil' niggas on the block stay strapped
Fuck that! Convicted felon with a gat?
It's mandatory; you get caught, you goin' back

You cattin' off doin' nothin'
Get your mind right, ya need to do somethin'
Spend all day smokin' blunts
You maggot brain, get your mind right and do somethin' (Something)
You cattin' off doin' nothin'
Get your mind right, ya need to do somethin'
Spend all day smokin' blunts
You maggot brain, get your mind right and do somethin'

You barely pay your rent; spend all day on the phone
You're always lyin', your excuses be irrelevant
You let 'em hit and use your food stamps to feed his friends
Always yellin', always beggin' somebody to babysit
Hell, you're always in barely everything
Always causin' problems, always with it, barely know his name
You's a trainwreck - think we can't see through that?
Get your mind right, you's a burnt out desperate rat
You barely clean your house, it always smell like piss
You only straighten up when company comes over
Then you jumpin' in the shower, snitchin' and you're gossipin'
Ain't nobody rattin' to you, wonder why she not your friend
Silk, it's Silk-E, not cotton blend
Authentic, not rented, official game spitter
Fight over your baby daddy, he don't even fuck with her
Always talkin' shit, always on my nerves, you's a maggot brain
Maggot brain

You cattin' off doin' nothin'
Get your mind right, ya need to do somethin'
Spend all day smokin' blunts
You maggot brain, get your mind right and do somethin' (Something)
You cattin' off doin' nothin'
Get your mind right, ya need to do somethin'
Spend all day smokin' blunts
You maggot brain, get your mind right and do somethin'

I know you doin' bad, but don't stalk her
Your girl upgraded, now she's fuckin' a baller
She don't wanna be wit' you - why would she?
Video games, blunts and pussy?
That's all you want, 'cause you have no goals
Stayin' at your mama's house is so old
You need to reinvent yourself right now
You need a makeover, a new lifestyle
Some new clothes, new place to live
Go get your baby mama and take your kids
Stop doin' crime, and stay out of court
'Cause you know you ain't never paid child support
And if you get a job, they take it out your check
Can't get a driver's license, now you really 'bout to quit
Ten years ago, you was havin' thangs
And now you ain't nothin' but a maggot brain
BITCH!

You cattin' off doin' nothin'
Get your mind right, ya need to do somethin'
Spend all day smokin' blunts
You maggot brain, get your mind right and do somethin'
You cattin' off doin' nothin'
Maggot brain, get your mind right and do somethin'

You out looking for a man to trick
You really need a manager, bitch
You got a lot of potential, superstar qualities
A bitch like you could get a lot of cheese
Now wipe your face off, get up off your knees
You my favorite little bitch, my prodigy
Whatever I say, don't question me
I'm tryna make you the best you can be
So your diamonds bling when you get in the car
You so motherfuckin' hard when you shit on these broads
I got you baby, I'ma show you how to get it
All that depression and complaining, just quit it
All that confessing and explaining you did it
But now you 'bout to live the good life, if you with it

A leader you can follow in hopes of better tomorrows
Build your brand up, head high, you can stand up
Bad bitches call, you can really raise your hand up and not second guess it
Your problems? We'll address it
A little less aggression, I'll show you how to finesse it
Figure all there, teach you to lay the dresses
Your girls can't hate, 'cause all of them hoes is messes, baby
What? This the chance of a lifetime
Celebrate, a real one done throw you a lifeline

Player Card,Still Blowin’,2010.0,"Nah, baby
I don't think I wanna be a player no mo'
I done been through a lot of hoes
Lot of women, lot of bitches, lot of relationships
All the drama
Tryin' to find a real one, baby

If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

There comes a time in every player's life
When you think about a family and havin' a wife
You had enough, you can't take this shit
Put a end to all the meaningless relationships
And find one that means everything
I'm talkin' 'bout white dresses and wedding rings
Used to be strip clubs and the Bunny Room
But now you're in love on a honeymoon
You used to keep a extra chick
Just for booty calls and sexy trips
But now you at the grocery sto'
Target, Wal-Mart, and Home Depot
If you break out of prison, and jump the wall
You couldn't even get a date, you wouldn't know who to call
You had a lot of women and you played 'em hard
But you retired now, give up that player card

If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

A lot of players called it quits
Come across the love pit and fall in it
Ain't nothin' wrong with love
Early in the morning you just want a hug
I've been there a million times
Ask me how I'm doin', I'm feelin' fine
But really what I feel inside
Is the need to have somethin' real in my life
I had it before
But I'm like Cameo, I go ""Back and Forth""
Like Big Pun and Joe
Sometimes ""I don't wanna be a player no more""
And when the time comes around, you know what's next
Throw away my phone and my Rolodex
It's gone, and I didn't even notice it
My player card expired and I'm stuck with my old bitch

If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

Your player card got revoked
And it can't be renewed - no, it's not a joke
Once you give it up, it's hard to get it back
'Cause fallin' in love is like hittin' crack
One hit and you a junkie
All day and night you'll be lickin' that monkey
You love the way it's sticky and funky
You said, ""I don't wanna live, if she don't want me""
I never had days like that
'Cause I came up in Oakland, raised by macks
I gotta get that scratch
I get it from a batch, or from my raps
It's gon' happen, 'cause the game is here
Ask Bishop Don Juan, I'm a famous player
You know when love'll happen for me?
When I start buyin' hookers, and rappin' for free
Never!

If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

It ain't expired yet, baby
I'm thinkin' 'bout renewin' it

It's been way too long, you've been gone from home
You wasn't ready when you left to be grown on your own
Now deep down inside you're his little girl
Gotta swallow his pride cause you're his little girl
Wouldn't be so bad, if you only stripped
But you don't do dancin just lonely tricks
Now you're hooked - ain't no love
You in this game, it's just like drugs
Your family wrote you off cause you fucked that up
You way out of town and you stuck
Now you're on your own, you've been disowned
Since you left your hometown all your friends are gone
It's girls like you that truly make us
You're lost in the world so I moved you to Vegas

And now you gotta call me daddy?

And if you really knew the truth, would you tell it?

The things you lost, would you rather get 'em back again?
I tried so hard to believe you
But we all know the things that Europeans do
Now what if the Asians, Africans, and Indians
Never taught you nothin', you would still be primitive
What we all need is self-education
That's the only way to educate this nation

Built on lies from back in the days
Great Britain, France, and Spain got bold
Destroyed the New World lookin' for gold

I know we built the nation with our bare hands
Helped you fight your wars just like the Indians
But when he tells you his story, we ain't in it
Why you stealin' people's lands? You can't admit it, can you?
Tell me why do you lie to little kids
With your one-sided stories? Tell 'em what you did
Better yet, tell 'em what you didn't do
It wasn't brains, your gun was your pimpin', too
That's how you mastered the slave trade
Shipped from overseas so you could stay paid
Divide and conquer, everywhere you go
But by the time we finish school, we barely know the real truth
Need to stop and take a serious look
Who wrote these government-issued history books?

Man, information - can you buy it? Can you sell it?
And if you really knew the truth, would you tell it?
Just like History class when you're in school
You grow up and learn the truth, you're just a fool

The European couldn't do it by himself, y'all
If the Indians wasn't here, he woulda left, y'all
But instead, he gave 'em all his diseases
Tried to kill 'em, take the land and seize it
Move into the camps that the Natives built
Named cities and states but do they say who helped?
Hell nah, they say Lincoln freed the slaves
But we ain't free yet, I still see them days
Racism ain't goin' nowhere
Watch movies about the future, niggas ain't there
Maybe one or two - what happened to the rest?
They tryin' to keep your self esteem low, it's just a test
Every man had his own land before the European
I can't believe what I'm seein'
That's why your pride is on vacation
Brainwashed a whole nation with the wrong information

Can you buy it? Can you sell it?
And if you really knew the truth, would you tell it?
Just like History class when you're in school
You grow up and learn the truth, you're just a fool

Information, bitch
Gotta get the right info, baby
(Gotta get it while the gettin' is good)
Fuck around, goin' around talkin' 'bout some stupid shit, bitch

All For Love,Still Blowin’,2010.0,"I give a little, I take a little
I give a little, I take a little

I can't be sober, 'cause I smoke weed a lot
Tried to be faithful, but I like to cheat a lot
You couldn't even trust me, 'cause I used to lie sometimes
I'll say I love you, but not until I get mines
I tried to have one girl but I flirt too much
I know exactly what to do to get her to fuck
Baby, I promise, you're the only one for me
You know you want this, you always have fun with me
But not tomorrow, 'cause I got another date
If all the little girls would just do what their mothers say
I wouldn't be a player, and shoot 'em with the facial cream
I used to manage my love like a baseball team
I had to have a good line-up
Put 'em in rotation when they sign up, a whole lot of vagina
I even had a farm camp where they'd get upgraded later
Can you hang with the players if you make it to the majors?

I give a little, I take a little
I give a little
We do it all for love
I do it all for love

Can I change? Or will I stay the same?
Will I be serious or keep playin' games?
Tonight, I'm tryin' to see the light
Is there a woman in here that wants to be my wife?
I want a family, I got a lot to give
I want children, but I ain't got no kids
I wanna love you, but did I wait too long?
It took smiles and tears to make this song

I give a little, I take a little
I give a little
We do it all for love
I do it all for love

Here's why we don't hear shit while y'all pleadin' your case
Your fingers crossed behind your back and a smirk's on your face
With million dollar dreams fallin' in and out of your neck
What you want us to do? We girls, we ain't playin with a full deck
We expect some of the bullshit, so we play along
It's wrong, the game of cat and mouse, you hit and you gone
Now we 'sposed to feel sorry for the big bad wolf
Find him, fuck him with no condoms, the game come from the crooks
How would it look? A queen gettin' played by a rook
Be your baby mama by evenin', can't have that on the books
Dickmatized, with sex faces in the D-boy stance
Effervescently sellin' me dreams of circumstance
How I need to be a team player, I'd rather be the owner
Why get with bein' a boss to be some work on the corner?
You're huntin' for the next hot ass before the club close
How you lookin' for love if all you run with is hoes?

You give a little, you take a little
And sin a little
You do it all to fuck
You do it all to fuck

Enjoy the ride, baby
We smokin' good, we ridin' clean
And you in the mix wit'cha O.G. potna Too $hort
We 'bout to get back on that pimp shit right now, baby

G-2000,Can’t Stay Away,1999,"What y'all know about this shit man, okay
Yeah (niggas desperate to be) nationwide baby
(But don't really know what it means to be)
A new millenium (a real true G)
Niggas say, there's gotta be a whole different crew on the set
(Gangsters live and gangsters ride)
Just to rearrange the whole game (it's hard to survive, either do or die)
And that's what my niggas is doin (in this gangster life)
That's what we doin, come check us out, yo
Us young niggas came up with nothin but hopes and dreams
Obscene intentions, picture perfect for the pinchin
A new invention to this dope game, I'm slangin CD's
Instead of cocaine, meanwhile takin it in and gainin mo' game
My background descended from the hustlers and pimps
True redemption for you niggas, I blew up like the blimp
Strong attempts to make these power moves, nationwide we devour crews
My momma told me never follow fools
On the backstreets, gat beats, had her runnin like track meets
Tax freak, class G, servin up them crack trees
Joe Rizza, rhyme blizza, from the streets 'til I take my roll
I take control, bank fold, ain't never gon' sell my soul
I stay committed, when shit go down in my town they say I did it
I gots ta get it, and when yo' stash look touched you know I hit it
You won't admit it, we bring it hella from that Detroit city
Nitty gritty, kick so much ass it gets my gators shitty
Niggas desperate to be
But don't really know what it means to be
A real true G
Gangsters live and gangsters ride
It's hard to survive, either do or die
In this gangster li-iiiiiiiife
Dirty repercussions, nasty destruction, I'm talkin I'm bustin
Dumpin bullets in my foes, trigger pullin on you hoes
Born with the soul of a soldier; you don't even know what it means
To be a G well fuck with me and I'ma show ya
The definition, of a killer nigga, get that nigga
Bring him to me but don't kill him, let me deal with him
Cause I'ma peel him with my scalp, wodie shoulda kept his mouth closed
Now it's gonna scream high notes, like some altos
My nigga the war is true to down my haters and imitators, smash niggas to pieces
Slash the anger from my gun crucify you bitches like Jesus
Squash beef, respect those when my niggas roll through
You claimin a side I'm claimin trues when you make yo' move I make my move
Showtime fool, as I think about how you chin checked
Any minute they drop like two bitches beggin to get wet
Have some respect, cause on my team, a nigga marine
Stayin a foot off you scrubs, showin no love to all these hoe fiends
360 degrees fool! Shit, I burn like a Pyrex
So which one of you motherfuckers wanna step up, and die next?
Appetite for mutilation, gangster 2000
An operation no time for debatin, my troops is waitin
We roll like Dayton, wires, we keep yo' block on fire
Not Juvenile, but I crush empires, fuckin with me
I hurt you, like a Jamaican {?}
My bitch get evil like {?} a nigga murder mad
Niggas desperate to be
But don't really know what it means to be

You Say It,The Vault,2019.0,"You say you down, is you really down for me? Yeah
You say you really wit' it, shorty, gotta show me, yeah

Picture a youngster, with nothing but visions of prison life
No more chances, circumstances of livin' trife
No more weed or Hennessy when you ride out
And all you wanna be is free when the lights go out
Rememberin' the way we used to kick it
Used to holler at the hoes just see if they was wit' it
(Yeah, they wit' it)
On the block it's like a robbery
Pocket full of money, but ain't nobody stoppin' me
I'm Dog, baby, see me runnin' out the back door
Seen you tryna creep and get some head from a crack ho
You better be careful, all the things you do
'Cause you're hated by many and loved by few
I give a fuck what you think of me, or what I got
You gon' take my shit? Nah, nigga, you're not
I bling bling, every time you see my top like Don King
You muthafuckas ain't gon' say a thing (Won't say shit)

You say you down, is you really down for me?
(Really down for me)
Is he my homie or he only plottin' on me? (Plottin' on me)

If you get jammed, promise you won't ever say my name

You say you down for me, nigga, then don't switch on me
You say you down, boy, call me for no bitch, homie

You keep talkin' that shit now (What?)
We 'bout to shut this muthafucka down
(What's wrong?) Nigga, what's up now?
He just fell on the ground, fuck that clown
I'm bound, to shoot his ass a few more times
I hope you don't mind, I won't do no time
I'm not the only homicidal maniac on the street
Spray four, lay low, then I'm back on my feet
I do the same thang with my gang, we ain't playin'
That ain't paint, them bullets made that red stain
Died like a bitch, face down, ass up
9-1-1 wasn't fast enough (What's the problem?)
We really need to stop all this dumb shit
You make it so we can't have no more fun, bitch
You act hard, but really that's some bitch shit
Shot up the spot, now can't nobody get rich (That's fucked up)

You say you down, is you really down for me?

You say you down, boy, call me for no bitch, homie

Used to be my homie, now he's snitchin' on me
Talkin' to them folks, givin' out his testimony
I'ma ride solo fo sho
With the fo'-fo' by myself in my four-door
I could smell paper from a mile away
And undercover cops, I ain't got time to play
I put it down and make a grip
And shorty, you ain't sayin' shit, 'cause doin' time ain't payin' shit
Just tryin' to keep from goin' under
That's the name of the game, it's called divide and conquer
And the stage is set for the grand finale
But it ain't gotta be a shootout in the alley (Bitch, you hella scary)
That's the reason I don't ride deep
You never know, your homeboy might be weak
You can't have too many all in your business
Next year up in court he's a material witness, fuck that

You say you down, is you really down for me?

Is he my homie or he only plottin' on me? (Plottin' on me)

I Want To Be Free,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You think oakland california is a city of punks
It only takes a second, to pop the trunk
And just like that you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed
It's all about the game, and nothin else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
You catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
Tryin to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin
This little town is gettin wild as hell
Check the penetentiaries and all the jails
If they could lock us all up that would be just fine
Got my partners from oakland doin serious time
You can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
But it's a mindgame, and you gotta deal with that
I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money, cause back in the days
When I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone, and show you how
But I was broke, the only thing I had was game
I started makin money and knew things would change
Bought a benz, thought it might earn respect
But the opd, found it hard to accept
I got jacked by the task and jacked by the vice
Face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
Put the handcuffs on backseat I'm in it
Illegal search for about thirty minutes
Askin me, where's the dope
Where's my gun, but I don't know
I said I'm rappin, they laugh like I told a joke
And to this day they think I'm sellin coke
I want to be free! (and that's the truth) ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! ohhh yeahhh
I be in oakland california every day of my life
Bass so hard you think I'm smokin a pipe
And if I don't smoke it, I gots to grind
Searched all my stuff, and all you find
Is a pocket full of money count seven g's
Now you wanna think I'm sellin keys
Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police wanna send me to prison
They see a brother makin major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass
And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin on the dank smoke
Cause all they wanna find, is guns and coke
In court all the time tryin to fight it
We get rich, we get indeibted
So what's the problem officer this time?
Is havin big money bein black a crime?
Or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
Charge me with somethin, or just ask questions
About the brothers I hang around
What's really goin on in the oakland town
Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But too $hort baby just ain't no snitch
You say you're just doin your job
But you're gettin on my nerves, just like bob
Everytime I hit a corner, I see you
Always tellin brothers what to do
You lock me up cause I don't know how to act
But I'm down for mine so I be talkin back
And when I do, you treat me bad as hell
I'm sick of spendin nights in jail
I want to be free! (and that's the truth) ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! ohhh yeahhh
Got out of jail about fo'-fifteen
Walkin down the street like a broke dopefiend
Had a pocket full of money tryin to play the role
Benz got towed and I was hella cold
But I ain't trippin, I'm gettin used to it now
Handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
For three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
Cause the five-oh's always tryin to jack a playa
For no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong
You think I'm lyin, singin that same ol song
Well I'm a black man, ridin in a benz
How in the hell did I make these ends? here we go
I pull over to the right
Stop the engine keep my hands in sight
I start cursin, cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence
If I was plannin, a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank
And I hope I don't get robbed by you know who
Make me donate some g's to the boys in blue
And if I sue, I won't get nothin back
But I ain't mad... I'm just black...

From sales to hotels and dough from pote(?)nail
Pay everybody bail, ain't no spendin time in jail
Been around the world, y'all niggas ain't seen all the shit I seen
Them girls, send them to Essence cause they sixteen
I'm comin through a couple bars to pimp them nipplezeens
In Southern Benz, S-Class, know what the fuck I mean?

A candy sweet dipper playin with cock and suckin on nipples

In the Trunk (LP version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's on
Where they at, where they at, where they at
I sold tapes every day me and freddy b
Been famous since 1983
Give me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed
A rap all about you called the special request
Oakland, you know I go way back
To coug nuts, fal stangs, and cadillac's
When homeboys put vogues on any car
With 6 by 9's smoking burners
Everybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat
Whole town fucked around and started smoking d
Every rap I ever made was about this town
I made 7 whole albums with no james brown
And even though I love his music, I just can't stand
The way they used it all up and didn't pay the man
And after 2 platnum albums, you call me weak
Cause I don't sell records in the east
Now what's funky, I say pussy on an old hoe
I guess y'all fools don't know
Why some good rappers can't sell no tapes
It's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake
You wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box
While the young bitches ride on your jock
You can't do it like this homey, so just pass it
And stop kissing them white folks asses
It's like you smoked a whole damn key
You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat
I'm from the old school, I love p-funk
But now rap music is all that they want
So when I'm in my car, I play clinton
And when I'm on the stage I start pimping
And when I hear your shit, I push eject
Then I throw it out the window with the rejects
And when the hard core rappers go soft
I like to watch when they ass fall off
Cause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka mc
And any other rappers ever talk about me
I don't stop rapping, that's all they can say
And how I dogg bitches, every day
But if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak
You be phony like a side show freak
Some rappers try to come off positive
Where I'm from that just ain't how it is
They say rap music is here to stay
But the sucka mc's don't think that way
It took 8 long years before I got my break
So I wonder why rapper's make fake ass tapes
You won't get paid like I did, so give up punk
And while your in the studio, I'm in the trunk
You got no choice, so don't flip that coin
This ain't the military, so you punks can't join
It ain't pop, it's called underground rap
From oakland california and the shit sounds phat
I'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I used to be broke, but now we all used to be
Got no game for a bitch, all the game is for me
And these bitches, can't say shit to me
They could never could fuck with short baby
I'm not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style
Don't dress hip hop and dance real wild
But I do sell records like a motherfucker
Even though you might I'm just another sucka
I find the beat and then never switch
Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch
You want rent money, I got pimp money
One thing's for sure, I won't give it to a hoe
I throw a bitch in the God damn trunk
And start slamming that oakland funk
Short dogg's in the house, once again
Trying to fade the platnum, with shorty the pimp
And when I do, I'm going straight to the bank
Withdraw some money and buy some dank
You can't relate to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I grew up on the funk called p
But these motherfuckers growing up on me
And if I ego trip, and my head is fucked
I take my ass back, to where I grew up
And get real boy, it's never too late
Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape
I'm in the trunk...
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block",https://genius.com/Too-short-in-the-trunk-lp-version-lyrics

Now bitches be on my dick when I pull up in a platinum blue 'llac
They come and spread they ass crack, let me hit it from the back
On the flo', they bend over, shake them titties and twurk them hips
With them lil' ol' thongs on, I can almost see they coochie lips
And she backin that thing up on me, so I do the damn thing and pop her
With a lil' curl that ha-hangin proper, drunk off champagne and vodka
Just cause it's us in the club they krunk, it's $hort and Twista
And I know the ladies know we love to cut, I can tell it when they whisper
They say -
See the ballin niggas in the party
They came in new Escalades
And I got a single, wanna get up in the lobby
I'm with that, come freak all in my body, it's on
We about to break your back and your hip
Smoke a sack and just sip, sit back and eat some immaculate shrimp
Stackin chips as a mack and a pimp, in the club you gon' bounce

Show me love when you see me, don't hate

Charge it to the game, if I lose, I lose
You never know when a hoe is wearin choosy shoes
You must be a magician cause you're nothin but a trick
Tryin to give her all your money, but whatchu gon' get?
I get 'em all, suited at the player's ball
Up against the wall, just got another number to call
Y'all see me I'm a real player, I do this nightly
You wanna fight me, cause you can't be like me
All you hatin ass suckers in the place
You better stop starin in my motherfuckin face
Too many jealous thoughts goin through yo' mind
You mad like you guilty, goin to do some time
Pay yo' pussy bill nigga if you want a date

Now you can catch me I-80 in the diamond lane gettin head
In the rearview, make a wrong move and I gotsta have your head
I put 23's in the game on the Avalanche and give you the blues
And blow white smoke up out the sunroof while we keep it on cruise
I ride with a hog in the back and the vogue in the back and you hatin on that
It's just V. White, T. $hort, Twista boy we blazin on track
It's just that Eastside psycho-chronological mind-stopper
Keep a burner at yo' waist while we serve these haters proper
You better get up, get out, get somethin; nigga, and stop frontin
If I had no car and stayed with my momma then I'd be hatin on somethin
Nah but nope, not me, I give 'em out, above the knee
You could catch one in the torso, b-2-1-2, fuckin with me
Now you can hate me all you want to cause I ain't hard to find
I got hitters on payroll and parolees dyin to shine

What The Fuck,No Trespassing,2012.0,"What the fuck is wrong with Too $hort?
What the fuck you tryin' to make somethin' new for?
Why that nigga keep spittin' all that game?
Why he still gettin' bitches? This shit is insane
All my life I've been writin' these verses
Learned the game 'cause I like to go in pussy and purses
It feels good to be a muthafuckin' pimp
Sometimes I knock a bitch just to do it on the strength
Every time you see me, I'm on 'em
That's how we was raised up in Northern California
She bought it all and if you gotta ask why
You ain't on the case, man, you not a P-I
Don't trip, I know what's up with you
You take her shopping and the bitch ain't even fuckin' you
Nigga, you 'bout as sorry as they come
They took you to a strip club and bought up all the ones

What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What the fuck, bitch!

What the fuck is wrong with some of you bitches?
Waitin' on a wealthy man to come through with riches
And shower you with presents - what's the mission?
You shoulda been a ho 'cause there's really no difference
What you want - a marriage and babies with a millionaire?
But not too many ladies get to live in here
You better stay in school
'Cause old sluts with ball players just ain't too cool
Spent all them years on your back
Hella niggas with contracts, they fucked that
Bitch, you got some things on your mind
Used to be a dime and now you ain't so fine
And all the little girls wanna be just like you
They wanna fuck a rich nigga too
You worse than me - you not a good role model
Offer her a shot, the bitch drank the whole bottle

What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What the fuck, bitch!

So I had to do it all again
What happened to the game? I can't call it, pimp
You tell me - we let the squares change the rules
Snitchin' is cool and y'all trickin' like some fools
What the fuck you niggas thinkin'?
And where the fuck is all the muthafuckin' kingpins?
What would life be without snitches and the feds?
A mattress full of money, two bitches in the bed
It's hard to get around them federal guidelines
Too many real niggas sittin' on the sidelines
While bitch niggas keep playin' a role
You know you not a gangsta, what you sayin' it for?
Picked up the phone and said, ""Who is this?""
You got your own label and you're in the music biz?
But you never put out shit, you never had a hit
And never went to the bank to deposit one check

What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What the fuck, nigga!

I Got Caught,No Trespassing,2012.0,"He loves her deeply, his only woman
Those other women, he don't want 'em
He could keep 'em cummin', give 'em that good lovin'
He used to be a player, and now he's sick of 'em
He loves her so much, his life is getting better
He proposed to her, and now they live together
The whole engagement thing, she always wears the ring
And if you ask him, he tell you she's his everything

I went over to see my friend yesterday
His old lady told me he was gone away
She said she was burnin' with desire
And she wanted me to put out the fire

I got caught making love
To another man's woman
Y'all don't hear me, ooh, yes I did
I got caught making love
To another man's girl
Woo woo woo, another man's girl

Last night with your boys you was hanging out
The homie left early, dipped to the house
He left his cell phone, you took it on your own
Said you'd drop it off on your way home
But it was too late, in the wee hours
And you know it wasn't cool, I'll see him tomorrow
The next day, just like a true friend
You drove straight to his house in your new Benz
You rang the doorbell, she was fine as hell
She said, ""Come inside,"" only time'll tell
Why she did that, some kinda get back
Why his girl suck your dick and let you hit that?
In the living room, and the bedroom
She said, ""He ain't comin' home no time soon""
You know the rules, never trust a whore
'Cause as soon as you came, he came through the door

I got caught making love
To another man's woman
Y'all don't hear me now, from the top this time
I got caught making love
To another man's girl
Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, talkin' 'bout, hey hey

Now what you wanna do? There's no excuse
No explanation, so what's the use?
He found you both naked, it wasn't makin' sense
Just some fuckin' fake shit, look at his face squint
He caught his best friend with his fiancée
The one he thought was finer than Beyoncé
You smashed his chick, what happened next, after sex
Probably gotta move and find a new bitch after that

She told me to step inside the door
And then she reached over and turned the lights way down low
Before I knew what was goin' on, she was in my arm
And suddenly, my homeboy walked through the door

I got caught, ooh, making love
To another man's woman
With another man's woman
Y'all don't hear me now, from the top this time
I got caught making love
I can't believe it
To another man's girl
To another, oh, ooh ooh
I got caught, yeah, making love
To another man's woman
I can't believe it
I got caught making love

But I got it, a fat sack in my pocket
Do me like the purp, girl, smoke it, suck it
Swallow it, hold it in
Take all of it, now you smoke it big
It's so thick in your neck, you wanna blow it out
Turn you on to some shit you don't know about
Used to be a good girl, but you're hoein' now
Knowin' how niggas from The Town will burn you out
Smokin' back to back and that's a fact
Like a little groupie, she don't know how to act
So I break it down, spit a lot of game to her
I seen her runnin' 'round with some lame dudes
Turnin' out hoes ain't a thang to me

Now she'll do whatever for a little of the cush (That cush)
All up in my face like she know, she phony
She really wanna smoke big and ride that pony
I boxed the whole way here, now the cush my cologne
I tell a bitch don't bother me when I'm up in a zone
I do my thing on stage, girl, that's how I get paid
I bust money moves, girl, while your ass renegade
Look, you know you wanna hit this blunt
We keep avoidin' her 'fore she fuck with us
She only wanna get high
I think that's why

Cannabis for men, take the buds off the stem
Rip her clothes off, she's smokin' hot, we hotbox with her friends
He puffin' on outdo, he 'bout to get backdoored
I bomb happy homes, dictator like Castro
She was on me, the tree just an ice breaker
Roll bold blunts, Swisher sweeter than a Life Saver
Gave her the chills and the thrills, now she like danger
Gettin' high, gettin' fly with a life-changer
Ooh, and I love to watch her hit the weed
I ain't gon' lie, I take the Phillie out and picture me
Got kidnapped and bribed with some weed
I'm a sucker for THC and her cream
Pay taxes? We could play Madden
Kick it like Janikowski then run ya back like McFadden
Take it to the black hole, beat her with a black pole
Watch our sex tape, gettin' higher than the astro

So now you know it ain't a damn thang changed up
Stayin true to the streets since we came up
So blame us for givin you the game plus
Much bass now the name is just Dangerous
So here we go, its time for some new shit
From 94 to 95 we can do this
So nigga just love this with no playa hation
Cause we gets respect all over the nation
Still in this to win this so you can pretend this
Beat this like my dick in yo mouth, until I'm finished
The shit goes on and on and on
But when you gets no promotion
That ass is gone
In the studio all day puttin in work
Hoes didn't give a fuck and man that shit hurts
Used and abused no pain no gain
Sure them hoes tried to play us, but we still in the game
Still in the game, after all these years
Been bumpin so long I can hardly hear
Still got the same flow that I used to have
You can clown if you want, but don't do it too fast
Cause I'm gone slow it way down, than shoot your ass
And send you wanna be pimps, back to class
Cause Ant Banks been making these beats too long
You trying to get with these funky songs
But the formulas patented, we ain't havin it

You can't make it hard
Can't tell a motherfucker how to play this part

10 Years chillin in the game, well respected
But check this, some niggas don't give a fuck
Never be givin us props, see we don't stop cause we don't give a fuck
We gets paid, so tell me what a nigga know
We hit him low with the bass, than we get more
Number one album, so where the fuck you at?
Doing sit-ups, stay off my dick still tryin to rap
Damn, we never ballin out of control
We open doors for the motherfuckin O
Now lets roll
Everybody up cause we all got to get it
And when you get your motherfuckin chance nigga spit it
So listen to what I'm tellin G, come with the melody
Or keep yo skin tight so you can have longetivity

At ten years old, he was a real vet

Wasn't old enough to drive, but I still bought a car
Ten years later, he was sellin coke
Fuck with the nigga he was killin folks
Had to do a couple of niggas or he would've caught the crome
Hopped on the plane, straight got gone
10 Years on the run, still in the game
Bounce back through the town ain't nothin change
Caught a murder beef, but the shit was weak
Charges got dropped in less than two weeks
Nigga went through alot, but his bnk is fat
Tried to catch him up with them wiretaps
But that snitch thean told
Its simple and plain
You can clown all you want, but we still in the game

Shut up, bitch, you talk too much
Always complainin' 'bout the same old stuff
Gettin' on my nerves, you so irritatin'
Using too many words and my ears can't take it
And your voice is kinda loud, too
What else can that mouth do?
You like cum? Tell her what it taste like
You keep some on your tongue, make you stay quiet
What? Better not hate me
'Cause you still gotta stay with me, you still gotta pay me
What's my fee? I charge what you earn
You so lucky, you get to gargle this sperm
Now it's all in your perm

You know me, I'm always clownin'
But Nancy? That bitch is always frownin'
And now, she don't even like to smile
She just makes mean faces and talks too loud
Shut up, Nancy, you're gettin' on my nerves
Too many adjectives and not enough verbs
Every time you speak, all you do is babble
We ain't at the house playin' Scrabble, bitch
Fuck you, and fuck your opinion
'Cause I just fucked this big butt Dominican
And hit that shit from a lot of angles
She ain't speak English, just body language
So we ain't even have to say nothin'

Fuck with me you'll be in Silence of the Lambs
Your boyfriend left, you can't find another man
You're too upset to play with yourself
So you never have sex - remember how it felt?
When you used to get kissed on those lips
But now all you do is talk shit
You need to wipe your mouth with some toilet paper
Turn off the lights and drink boilermakers
'Cause you already know what's up
I'm tryna get you drunk, and when you're throwing up
Just spit out all them words and flush
Shut your mouth, bitch, hush (Can you feel me?)

Where they at, mayne? Where they at? The real ones

I put her through boss bitch training
Been doin' this shit since back in the day when
Bitches started asking me, ""Would you be my daddy?
You can have me, I wanna be in your family""
You wanna be on the winning team?
She said, ""You muthafuckin' right, and I'll do anything""
You ain't gotta be a ho to know the rules of the game
Bitches like you just gotta use everything
Ain't hard for a pretty girl to get a lot of paper
A lot of rich men wanna go out on dates with her
Pick a number, better get what you want, girl
And roll your eyes at them stupid ass dumb girls
Leave the club and get fucked for free
But when she needs it, she ain't got no money
If you a hustler, I know you ain't feelin' that
Somebody tell me where the real ones at

You wanna be on the winning team, better watch what you say to me
(I'm a boss, bitch)
You watch it as it goes round 'cause this game out here ain't free

I really can't explain it 'cause ('Cause) I feel it runnin' through my bones

Keep payin' 'em if you wanna fuck 'em
You see them pretty titties and I know you wanna touch 'em
She'll do some things that'll make your day
She's not a hooker but you still gotta pay to play
'Cause with a ho, when it ends, you go
But these boss bitches wanna spend some more
And don't complain 'cause she don't like it when you clown her
Just pull your card out and swipe it at the counter
When you met her, you thought you had a chance
Seen her at the club and got a funky little dance
But the bitch needs help - are you willing and able?
Got diamonds in your chain, bottles on your table
She don't want a lot, just enough to get by
Keys to the house and you can fuck every night
Access to the whips and don't talk no shit
Nigga, you got a boss bitch

You wanna be on the winning team, better watch what you say to me
(I'm a boss, bitch)
You watch it as it goes round 'cause this game out here ain't free
(I'm a boss, bitch)
I really can't explain it 'cause ('Cause) I feel it runnin' through my bones
(I'm a boss, bitch)
But if another girl's around, she got to pay me

I know I make it look way too easy, but it ain't easy being me
Hard to dumb it down when you're global
Like fittin' a 10 in a 6, it can't hold me
You can't see me, man, it ain't your bifocals
(Tell 'em how them boss females do it, Silk)

Heel game sick, hips move like whips
Floatin' on that black ice, baby, dancin' in the rain
My mind fucks, nigga, but the truth is so slicker
Should be focused on a bitch and got you stuck on the frame
Highly motivated, baby, stay in your lane
I'm out of your league, plus I got a good aim
I'm cross the skyline for no reason
You buckethead broads out here sleazin', fuckin' for some change
My passport full, I'm plottin' on an empire
I got the bank, and you know where, that's a misfire
I fraternize, boss playa certified
Tell that sport coat man, ""Hurry up and buy""
Make 'em, I make 'em hate that I'm his ex-girl
He tried to give my swag game to his next girl
Ha, and if I catch you impersonatin' Silk-E
Bitch, I'ma make you cut your cake, girl

Who you work for?
Haha, y'all got uniforms? Haha (I'm a boss, bitch)
He ain't even a real one, damn (I'm a boss, bitch)
Shoutout to the ones doing their own thing
Getting their own dough, making their own moves
Ain't waiting for no handout, ha, ya dig?

Trying To Come Up,No Trespassing,2012.0,"You want the money? Wanna be a big mack, dog?
You swimmin' in women on backlog
Daydreamin’ 'bout the dividends
The little homie said, ""Man, I'm ’bout to get it in""
It's just a sign of the times
You get a little older, now you wanna do crimes
He went to jail and now he's got big muscles
He don't think he failed, he just picked the wrong hustle
Came home, went straight to the block
He got a P.O. but he don't care about the cops
Pockets full of rocks, hella money in his sock
Rims and paint, he don't wanna ride stock
Loud and clear, the beat gon' knock
And a lot of girls walkin' down the street gon’ stop
And tell each other how they love you
You gettin’ money and they all wanna fuck you

I'm tryin’ to come up, oh
I'm tryin' to come up, got to keep on movin'
Come up, oh
I’m tryin' to come up, oh

The world is violent, so what you yellin' ""peace"" for?
Gotta take another ride in a police car
They don't you don't tell no lies
'Cause the judge gon' set your bail so high for crack
You never shoulda sold it
'Cause everything you know, you told it
I thought you was a cocaine cowboy
You caught a case, and what you doin' now, boy?
You singin' that same old song
Tellin' on your homeboys so you can go home
And now who's gon' win?
I don't need enemies if you my friend
You just another crab in the barrel
I'm tryin' to see the top, stop grabbin', it's frail
I know you wanna come up, make a few mil
But the homies gon' kill you if you tell

I'm tryin' to come up, oh
I'm tryin' to come up, got to keep on movin'
Come up, oh
I'm tryin' to come up, oh
(C.O., nigga, West Oakland, BTT, nigga)

I got a two-year joint suspension bundled in my bitch coochie
High tech in my styrofoam, she just popped a half a louie
Ridin' with my hockey stick, I'm just tryin' to camouflage
Just hit a grower house, it's drying out in my garage
P.O. fuckin' with me, say I gotta find a job
Honeymoon comin' up, bitch, I'm married to the mob
I'm just tryin' to come up before a nigga lock me down
I'd do life in Salinas for feedin' a nigga 50 rounds
I'ma say slow down before a nigga go down
Before a nigga starve, I'd funk with the whole Town
Tired of cookin' coke, I need grown man money
Some of that business, foreign car, own land money
I'm just tryin' to get dough, but a nigga will skit quick
Them hollows gotta get my point across, then so be it
And me and God, we got a real good agreement
I won't start no shit, but if they try me, I""m swingin'

I'm tryin' to do right, just tryin' to get by
Feel like I'm about to lose my mind if I got to keep on doing crime

I'm tryin' to come up, can't do this no more
I gotta come up, ooh ooh

I'm tryin' to come up
I'm tryin' to come up

Hog ridin', hog ridin'
Yeah, this how we do it on the West Coast
Harley Davidson, baby, everything chrome, bitch
Hog ridin'

On my hog, I keep it at a hundred-plus
On the freeway, you don't wanna run with us
'Cause we racin', we bettin' big stacks
You get left back, ain't no way to catch that
So fuck it, you can't ride like the hog does
Think you a ruff ryder but you ain't hard enough
You ever seen my cousin Sideways
Burnin' rubber on the highways?
Now watch me, I'm 'bout to swing my shit
Just like Ike, just like my nigga Richie Rich
That's how these West Coast G's be
We showin' off on HDTV
I know you wish you could be
'Cause when I ride my hog, the girls get freaky
They hear us comin' from a mile away
We hella clean, we ridin' in style today
It's all custom, down to the wheels and tires
You could see the smoke, but you don't see the fire
I never would stop burnin' rubber, son
We tear 'em up and then we build another one
Yeah, I got my bitch on the back
But I ride so fast, I split from the pack
You tryna keep up, what you want, man?
You fuckin' wit' a daredevil stuntman
Wit' my front wheel straight in the air
I do this shit for real, I ain't fakin' it, player
My niggas ride these right; you say do, too?
You just might be right, so go ahead and prove it
Pop that clutch, do some shit
Stop squeezin' it, makin' noise, you stupid bitch
You revvin' up your engine like you playin' with toys
Round here, we'll fuck you up, boy

Hog ridin', hog ridin', hog ridin', hog ridin'

Ay, what's up, Richie Rich?
Gon' pull that glide out, wipe some of that dust off that thang
Like that, mayne?
I tried to tell these niggas, haha

Niggas be wolfin' that bullshit, I don't give a fuck about none of that
And if ain't QB'in', my nigga, then you must be a running back
Yard for yard, pound for pound, so sideways when I'm in The Town
Throttle left, hold it down, last real muhfucka like me around
Talkin' to the cherry paint, lettin' it know
When we hit 88, bitch, I'm lettin' it go
First to the right then back to the left
Ooh, shift to the right then back to the left
Second gear, slidin' right, now who wanna fuck wit' Dub tonight?
All my niggas, they down with the club shit
And we don't give a fuck what you got in that bike
I'm a rider from The Town
Bring a pink slip if you wanna get down
No salvage type is the way I ball
You built that bike, boy, you ain't Paul
Senior or Junior, you're just another sucka
Your bitch bought you that bike and you think you're the motherfucker
Nah, it's pimpin', bitches know my steelo
No back rest, no quick release, and we gon' get a C-note
I tap that leg, she tighten up, and watch daddy run past it
And when take this exit, bitch, yeah, we gon' drift like nasty, ooh
I think I'm talking too much
These niggas say my bike's dog, it's 'cause I walk him too much
It's Rich Richard, and now I must get out that ass
Get your bitch ass off the brake, nigga, and hit that gas

What we doin'? We drinkin' and dancin'
Got more females than the Playboy Mansion
You better get you one
Chase that pussy and lick on some
Pull it out and say, ""Bitch, I'm hung""
Take her somewhere and make her cum
I know it's wet, you won't regret it
You little cum freak, I know you want me
I like having sex in the city
Driving down the street while I'm kissing them titties
And no, I'm not getting married
I fucked her in my truck when I popped that cherry
She just came, now she wants me to hold her
But I ain't done yet, I put her legs on my shoulders
I'm 'bout to turn that ass over
And fuck her doggystyle in my Range Rover

We up at the club havin' a party
We doin' shots, fuck the toast
And all the pretty girls we wanna fuck the most
I like the ones that are extra fly
That's why I hang out with Jesse and Sy
I'm Bill Clinton, she can't get the stains out
Creeped in the room and I fucked her little brains out
'Cause I love to party
I pull her real close and I rub her body
She's got a little dress on
And the DJ's playing all the best songs
Ex-boyfriend, she don't fiend for him
'Cause I'm doing freaky things she never seen before
And she's a crazy bitch
But she fuck so good, I'm on top of it

I know it's tight, I do it right
And if you like me, I'll fuck you nightly
I love you do that shit, girl
The way you make them hips swirl
You probably got a man
If you do I understand but I'm your number one fan
Let's do it right now
36 C's, booty like ""pow""
And her best friend looks good, too
They fuck with us now, nigga, fuck your crew
You ain't did nothin' 'til you had the baddest
Beautiful women with the fattest asses
She just realized how good she could have it
Got hooked on my dick, now she's an addict

So You Want to be a Gangster? (West Coast Classics Radio),West Coast Classics Radio,UnKnown,"So you want to be a gangster, all that shit
Smoke any motherfucker, don't even trip
You be hard as hell, take whatever you want
Punk suckers wanna front, they get done
'Cause you a gangster—nothin' more, nothin' less
Put my boy to the test and catch one in your chest
Since he was young, homeboy won't back down
'Cause real gangsters always hold that frown
Until you lose control, then you sell your soul
To the devil, motherfucker, 'cause you're way too cold
And all the people hide and just run inside
'Cause you keep usin' yo' gat, committin' homicide
Boy, I tell ya, life is way too short
Another brother just got smoked
And you killed him—ain't that a bitch?
'Cause it really ain't shit

Ain't that a bitch? (gangsters)

Let me tell you somethin', youngster, you got it all wrong
Gangsters don't live that long
I had gangster partners get they heads tore off
For some of that gangster shit, caught in the cross
You want stripes, take yo' ass to the service
'Cause when it's on, ain't no time to get nervous
Pull the trigger—yeah, you did it
You's a gangster and I got to admit it
But you's a youngbuck, you ain't learned yet
Killin' don't make you a vet
Get out the fast line, stick with the homeboys
Ready-made gangster get gone, boy
'Cause where I'm from it's the same ol' shit
You call them shots when you're down with the click
Niggas dyin' everyday, but that's a black thang
You either sell dope or you gangbang
But you got the biggest heart in the click, man
You did a murder, and now you're a hitman
All your homies tryin' to tell you, that ain't cool
Playin' shoot 'em up like a fuckin fool
But you's a gangster, one they can't destroy
Don't even give a fuck about your boys
You go for self, you wanna be on top?
Fucked around and now your brother's shot

The Magazine,No Trespassing,2012.0,"You only see her in magazines
Look, look at shorty, she follow the dreams
But you can only see her in the magazines
And I hit that all the time

You in love with her, you wanna marry her
Make lots of love and have kids with her
'Cause she's a bad girl, you can't get with her
Unless you go to her job and you tippin' her
(She's a bad girl, yeah)
You fantasize about a lot of things
But the truth is, that's not your dream
That's hers, and that's all she wants
Can't tell nobody so she gots to front
We all gotta have a dream
Staring at things in the magazines
Life ain't fair but it always seems
I never wanna talk when you're callin' me
We have sex but we never kiss
What you gon' do with that wedding dress?
I saw you on stage, you the finest thing
But I still can't buy that diamond ring

You only see her in magazines
Look, look at shorty, she follow the dreams
But you can only see her in the magazines
And I hit that all the time

You fell in love young and got married
To some of these girls, that's scary
Stay home, you can't go out now
Stuck in the house on lockdown
Just can't go on like this
'Cause all you get is boring sex
Keep watchin' them porno tapes
You want it but you can't go on no dates
So you stare at the magazines
Dreamin', wishin' you could have those things
But all you do is cook and clean
Feels like somebody just took your dreams (Took your dreams, dreams)
And your husband said it: ""It won't happen, forget it""
You laughin', but it ain't so funny
'Cause you know you coulda been a Playboy Bunny

You only see her in magazines
Look at shorty, she follow the dreams
Coulda been a Playboy, coulda been a Playboy Bunny
And I hit that all the time

It feels good when you clap to the music
Can't dance? All you gotta do is two-step
Listen to 'em play that acoustic
We 'bout to do this
You wish and you dream and hope you get things
You want 'em, but nope, it's just dreams
Wake up and don't know what it means
(Coulda been a Playboy Bunny)
We all gotta have a dream
Staring at things in the magazines
Dreaming, wishing you can have those things
