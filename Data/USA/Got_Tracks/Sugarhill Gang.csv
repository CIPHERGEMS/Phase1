Rapper’s Delight,Sugarhill Gang,1979.0,"I said a hip-hop, the hippie the hippie
To the hip, hip hop you don't stop
Rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see
 
the Knicks
 
play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all get on the floor

I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
Uh, come alive, y'all gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Rock it up, uh, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat


I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, uh, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

It was 12 o'clock one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cutting the jams and making it free
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down and make it rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doing a do
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says ""momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull""
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""man there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby but bubbah we're still friends""

With a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

I say ""Hank can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo""
I said ""come on, make uh, make the people move""

I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said ""sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from '66 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all
A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop

It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends

A like that y'all to the beat y'all
A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop
Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?

Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the  Bar-Kays singing 'Holy Ghost'
The sounds to throw down they're played the most
Just like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the barkays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doing the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven
Dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat, beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time
Cause every night I had a part to rhyme
Going on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A saying on and on and on on and on
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
Call me the master gee you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Apache, jump on it, jump on it
Wolololololo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!

I'm Big Bank, I am the Chief
I got a lot of raps but I'll be brief
I never need a horse I like to chill
So I, drive up in my new Seville
My Tribe went down in the hall of fame
'Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James
Pound for pound, I will never break down
(Big Bank!) No sir, I don't mess around

Wolololololo! Ho!
Wolololololo!

Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Kemosabe, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Apache, jump on it, jump on it
Wolololololo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!

Like Kemosabe, of course it's me
I'm better known as the Master Gee
A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, ""Get them squaws, fast as you can""
To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a ride
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away
Hi, yo, Silver, is what I say

Ho! Ho!
Wolololololo!
Hit it, gang!


Ho! Ho! Ho!
Wolololololo!

Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Kemosabe, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Apache, jump on it, jump on it
Wolololololo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!

A pow-wow, just rock it out
Finger poppin' to the break of dawn
Keep it rockin' like the stuff that we call maize
(What's that?) Hot buttered popcorn
You just hippa-hoppa-dippa-boppa bang the boogie
Woogie betcha wanna boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your mocassins
Kemosabe got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin'
His head began to boppin' his foot start to clappin'
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work
They were jammin' off a record that said it best:
""Now what you hear is not a test!""

Wolololololo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!

Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Momma, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food!""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so, you say, ""That's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks!""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah
But we're still friends""
With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?
I said, come on make the, make the people move
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!""
So from sixty-six to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all
A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop
Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop
A-Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?
Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show
A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man, Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A-like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like The Bar-Kays on the mic
Like gettin' right down for you tonight
Like movin' your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said, the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doin the' do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee, it's all the way live
At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Dontcha know I went off?
I got right on down to the beat, you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme
Goin' on n n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on...
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop
A-saying on n n on n on on n on

'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight

You do the Freak, Spank, and do the Bump
And when the sucker MC's try to prove a point

Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was coming home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""by the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane""
""And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""he's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""you need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it

'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody and dance to the beat
I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you dont stop
Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat
I said I can't wait till the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called The Freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist
Everybody, I say, it goes like this:
Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!
The Cassanova legend must have been true!""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party till the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I gon' do it, I gon' do it
I gon' do it, do it, do it
And I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop y'all
A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, ""It's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece""
And now, people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party, ya got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance, you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:
That to have a party, ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream
And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two, just a-doin' a do
Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive, girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do The Freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Momma, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food!""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so, you say, ""That's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks!""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah
But we're still friends""
With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?
I said, come on make the, make the people move
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!""
So from sixty-six to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all
A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop
Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop
A-Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?
Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show
A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man, Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A-like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like The Bar-Kays on the mic
Like gettin' right down for you tonight
Like movin' your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said, the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doin the' do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee, it's all the way live
At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Dontcha know I went off?
I got right on down to the beat, you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme
Goin' on n n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on...
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop
A-saying on n n on n on on n on
I say you don't stop, gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
'Cause I'm a helluva man when i'm on the miC
I am the definite feast delight
Come to the Master Gee, you see
The brother who rocks so viciously",https://genius.com/Sugarhill-gang-rappers-delight-medley-lyrics

And I said he's ready to rock with me
Let me tell you something before you get lost
Angie B.'s the one that they call the boss
Hey all of your people this is no disguise
We're ready to rap and socialize
With the capital A-N-G-I-E
But it's really no fun without the capital B
Far as I'm concerned 'bout Master Gee
He's vicious when he's rappin' with me
(We're from the north!) And we're from the south!
And as a combination we can rock the house
We go

But you're listening to the voice of Cheryl The Pearl
We're gonna rap to you about the serious gang
With the bow-bow boogie and the big bang-bang
But since Big Hank didn't hear my voice
I guess I have no other choice
I heard he's bad, mean and tough
But I want to hear some of his funky stuff
Jam!

Skatin' on ice
The dedicated king of the disco slide
Yes yes y'all, we don't stop

Supersonic group that's gonna rock this block
Keep on, and you get rocked
I got a mansion on the mountain, Rolls in my garage

To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song:

Check it out, Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three emcees
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

I said M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then jam you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind

You can’t get enough of that Sugarhill, Sugarhill, Sugarhill
You can’t get enough of that Sugarhill, that makes you do the freak!
Hey Mike, do you see that girl over there?
The one with the long black pretty hair?
I don’t know about you but I’m going to see
Maybe she might do the Patty Duke with me
Now no one else is with her, and I’m telling you no lie
That there's beams of light sparkling in her hair, and a flicker in her eyes
So let’s change the beat to make her move her feet
So if you lower than Gee
And let’s kick up the band with a wave of a hand, and a simple 1, 2, 3
Dibby-dibba-bop-lada-di-da-da
Twidlee diddly do it and you do that rock
Now there’s a reason why I rock all the season with a little a touch of savoir faire
‘Cause I am down with the Sugarhill Gang and we rock with pin-point flair
First you hip the hop and then hop the hip
And then you hippety the hop and don’t quit
Then you hip the hop and then you hop the hip
And then you hippety the hop and don’t stop
Just on and on and on, on, on and on
Like hot buttered pop, the pop, the pop
Hippie-dibby, pop-a-the-pop-pop
You do that rock and get right on down and gimme what you got
Stop!
Before it gets too hot now
Now, why in the world did you do that for?
Everybody in this spot was begging for more
Now, both of you know we have to hit the streets
And you just start rapping to the beat
So come on
(Wait a minute)
First things first, first high then low
We think we’re coming to someone's stereo
And if you’re thinking what I’m thinking someone’s around
To check us out when we throw down!
Young ladies, young ladies, young ladies drive me crazy!
We go back and forth and forth and back
We’re The Sugarhill Gang, we take no smack
We don’t wear diamond rings and drive big cars
But the people just treat us like movie stars
We’re just three young rappers who want to be known
As professional magicians of the microphone
Well I'm Big Bank, rhymes are my game
And soon I’ll be elected to the hall of fame
Like a lime to a lemon, a cherry to a plum
We won’t stop rappin’ till we all get some!
Wonder Mike, it’s on you
You’re the freak of the night, so what you wanna do?
Just give me the mic in the middle of the night
And I’ll show you how I know to rock real tight
When I was young I ate my Wheaties every single day
But it wasn’t the weenies that helped me chart
The groovy hip things I say
It’s the rhythm of WBGL that helped me sing my song
So you can rock with this such channel to the devil beat all night long
If you do the mad dance and you get on the floor
And you decide to put the boogie to shame
Well, we’re the Gang bubbah, don’t you fret   Because you can bet That I can rap to the beat just the same
Dibby-dibba-bop-lada-di-da-da
Twidlee diddly do it and you do that rock
Well, I carried two hundred girls off of my feet
Bet you know who’s the rapper tall
It’s Wonder Mike and I’m ready
Gotta, gonna give you a hip and hug you a hop
I’ll take the hop and with the help of water drop
You know I’m coming to  Top of the Pops
Leavin’ you a tip that turns into a hip
And then you stomp it to a freaking scholarship
Dibby-dibba-bop-lada-di-da-da
Twidlee diddly do it, you do that rock
I’m the Master Gee, a man you know
A man who rocks in stereo
I said hey diddle-diddle, the cat and the fiddle, we let in a bat and a dog in the middle
I’m gonna rock this mic to move these wings
Get up in the morning and do it again
I’m gonna hit you with rhymes you’ve never heard before
And direct them to the lady that I adore
‘Cause I’m on the go, I’m on your mind
Hold my attitude to shake your behind        To the beat
You don’t stop
Rock the rhythm and I’ll make your body high
Get on down!
(C’mon, party angel)
(C’mon, hurry Hank!)
Well, he’s featured on the drums and he came to stay
And he goes by the name of Tito Puente!

To the beat that makes you want to
A-to the beat that makes you want to
A-to the beat that makes you want to dance
A-come on, young ladies let’s take a chance
Dibby-dibba-bop-lada-di-da-da
Twidlee diddly do it, do that rock
To the beat that makes you want to
To the beat that makes you want to
I’m like a double stack mac at twelve o’clock
Like Big Bank with the gangsta rock
To the boogie, to the boogie, be up jump the boogie, baby babe baby keep to pip the pippie
Hippity-ba-hoppas who so-so socialize
Won’t you open up your ears and open up your eyes?
To find out whether you're qualified, and one more thing we’re all the way live
Like a lime to lemon, a lemon to a lime
You can give me your number ‘cause I got a dime
Like a tick to a tock, a drip to a drop, like snap, crackle to the pop
When I’m rappin’ to the rhythm of a funky beat, I rap and tell no lies
‘Cause the way I spell relief you know it's P-A-R-T-Y!
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
Got a black book filled with all the fly women
Tweedle-di-dee or Tweedle-di-dum
Hear the tight pitter-patter of a big bass drum
Baby stand on the rhythm​ of the big top beat
While I snap my fingers and say move my feet
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you wanna dance, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you want to, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you wanna rock, sugar sugar sugar
To the beat that makes you rock the beat, sugar sugar sugar",https://genius.com/Sugarhill-gang-sugarhill-groove-lyrics
Hot Hot Summer Day,8th Wonder,1980,"Get off it's summer
Get off it's summer
Summertime is here
Get off it's summer
Get off it's summer
Summertime is here

I hear ya, so have no fear
Summertime's the best time of the year
You fine young ladies come ring my bell
'Cause I am the man with the clientele
Tipping, sipping the finest wine
All because it's summertime
Well I sit back, and I'm in your dreams
Rockin' the house with the gangster lean
Rockin' in the pool just havin' fun
Chillin' out in the summer sun
Neon lights, summer nights
Big Bank baby doll's gonna rock tonight
So pull out your beach balls, umbrellas and hats
To all the fly girls, take a turn at bat
To the tick tock, but it's too hot
And it's summertime
And it's  sure shot

Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Sunshine on your mind

Summertime is back again
And all I want to do is party with all my friends
Now the voice you hear, is of the Master Gee
I'm gonna show you how much fun the summertime can be
Smell the air it's sweet, skates are on your feet
And everybody's jammin' to a brand new beat
There's a cold out feeling all over the nation
Seniors everywhere, havin' graduation
You feel it in your system, and your system won't stop
It's 'cause you're rockin' to the rhythm of the rhythm of the rock
It's alright, it's okay
'Cause these things happen on a hot summer day
Young ladies in the stores, everywhere
Tryin' to purchase their seasonalware
Bikini short-shorts and beaded hair
Seem to be the style for this time of year

Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Sunshine on your mind
People dancin' and romancin'

Boogidy woogidy, bee bop, da bippity bop
Here's the way to keep cool, baby if you're hot
Rappin' in the summer, sweet and summer groovin'
And your fingers start poppin' and you dance real smooth
And you ask me, ""Hey what can I do in the middle of the summertime?""
You can turn me on your stereo and listen to my boogie wonder rhyme
And if that don't work, whoever heard of that?  Well take a little time to hear me say
In the foogie moogie voice and the rhythm rock how the summer can be sugar day
Like goin' to the beach that has no sand
Like puttin' on a swimmin' suit and swimmin' on land
Like cookin' out without the grill
Like tryin' to catch a tan and you catch a chill

Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Sunshine on your mind
Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Hot, hot summer day
Sunshine on your mind

I'm Big Bank, I am the Chief
I got a lot of raps but I'll be real
I never need a horse I like to chill
So I, drive up in my new Seville
My Tribe went down in the hall of fame
Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James
Pound for pound, I will never break down
(Big Bank!) No sir, I don't mess around
Awowowowowowowowowow!! Ho!
Wowowowowowwowowowowowowowowowowow!!

Like Kemosabi, of course it's me
I'm better known as the Master G
A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, ""Get them squaws, fast as you can""
To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a route
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away
HIYOO Silver, is what I say!
Ho! Ho! Wowowowowowowowow!
Hit it gang!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!

A pow-wow, just rock it out
Finger poppin to the break of dawn
Keep it rockin like the stuff that we call maize
(What's that?) Hot buttered popcorn
You just hippa-hoppa-dippa-boppa bang the boogie
Woogie betcha wanna boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your mocassin
Kemosabi got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin
His head began to boppin his foot start to clappin
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work
They were jammin off a record that said it best:
""Now what you hear is not a test!""
Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!

Never too late
It's never too late to make a change
'Cause you can change
Never too late

The Down Beat,The Sugar Hill Records Story,1985.0,"The down beat
Get on the down beat
The down beat
False alarm, there is no fire
The smoke you're seeing comes from my a-
Stonishing rhythm combined with the beat
My voice is the smoke, my rhymes are the heat
Correlated MC quench ready to burst
With flavor, a party saver, but first
Note; my rhymes are pouring, ready to combust
Flammable to biters, so my advice is just
To play
The down beat
Now if you wanna be down, you gotta get a down beat
But if the beat ain't funky, then the rap is obsolete
In order to be complete, or solid as concrete
You got to pumpin' and pumpin', with a funky funky downbeat
It's the down beat
When the bass is kicking, and the hi-hat's ticking
You're on a natural high, because the beat is fly
Captivating, stimulating and other 
And for the fresh beat lovers, we're granting your wish
And for the biters, there' s a brand new dish
So come on, eat it up, i know you're hungry
And if you want a funky beat, bon appetit
'Cause it's the down beat
The down beat
When the bass is pumping, and the snare is thumping
Rhythm takes its toll, you're outta control
You're in a trance, gotta dance
When you hear the funky drum roll
That's the cue, for you to do
What you want to do
Continue
To clap your hands, and stomp your feet
'Cause you can't help rocking when you hear a funky drum beat
The formula is simple, but I'm not the docs
Don't worry about the rappers, it's the beat that rocks
And if you're thinking contrary, that this ain't the truth
Look at the rappers today, they are the proof
So if you wanna get hot and feel the heat
You gotta go with the flow and change with the beat
You got to get up, on a brand new sound
But remember when you get up, the beat is down
'Cause it's the down beat
The funky down beat
Break, come on, get down!
My name is Kory-O, and I'm down with the Gang
The new addition to the crew, the master of slang
I get stupid, fresh, crazy, flyboy
Ultra smoking nitro, all
Just call me on and gimme a pound
High five 'cause I'm live and you know I'm down
And I got a down beat, that I know will
Make all of the other weak beats chill
When the bass is thumping
And the claps are jumping
The music's scratching and cutting
And it won't mean nothing
But a bass like that, that's pumping
You like the way I kick it, 'cause i kick it right
'Cause I can get loose while my raps are tight
And if you came here to party before you go
It's gonna rock the show
And it's the down beat
Get on the down beat
Hey y'all, the funky funky funky down beat
Come on, 'cause it's the down beat",https://genius.com/Sugarhill-gang-the-down-beat-lyrics
Rapper’s Delight (Re-Recorded),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock
Well, so far youve heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank: come on, Hank, sing that song
Check it out: I'm the C-a-s-an-the-o-v-a, and the rest is f-l-y
Y'see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why:
Y'see I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun, and I dress to a T
Y'see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool which is really on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker, not a dime till I made it again
Y'go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Y'say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin', drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?
Well, it's on n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said m-a-s, t-e-r, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And then, damn, ya start doin' the Freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sure shot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, ya don't dare stop
Come alive, y'all, gimme what ya got
I guess by now, you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna feak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?
I said-a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Skiddlee beebop-a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody and dance to the beat
I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you dont stop
Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat
I said I can't wait till the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called The Freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist
Everybody, I say, it goes like this:
Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!
The Cassanova legend must have been true!""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party till the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I gon' do it, I gon' do it
I gon' do it, do it, do it
And I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop y'all
A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, ""It's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece""
And now, people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party, ya got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance, you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:
That to have a party, ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream
And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two, just a-doin' a do
Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive, girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do The Freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Momma, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food!""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so, you say, ""That's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks!""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah
But we're still friends""
With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?
I said, come on make the, make the people move
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!""
So from sixty-six to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all
A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop
Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop
A-Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?
Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show
A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man, Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A-like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like The Bar-Kays on the mic
Like gettin' right down for you tonight
Like movin' your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said, the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doin the' do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee, it's all the way live
At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Dontcha know I went off?
I got right on down to the beat, you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme
Goin' on n n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on...
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop
A-saying on n n on n on on n on
I say you don't stop, gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
'Cause I'm a helluva man when i'm on the miC

Hey, hi! How you doin'?
Alright, mama! You look real good today, my dear
Hey guy, guy, what kind of girls you like, man?
Man, I like them fat, I like them tall, some skinny, some small
Man, I like all of them, I like the girls
I can dig that, I can dig that!
I'm tellin' ya, one definition for girls by me is: fine!
That's right, brother
Tellin' ya, they are up in here tonight!

What's that?
Why don't we sing a song for 'em?
Okay!

I got to be where they go
Swe-e-tness
Pretty girls (oh!)
Sunshine in their hair (sunshine in their hair)
Perfume that they wear (perfume that they wear)
Girls are everywhere

Now, I'd like to be on an island
With five or six of them fine ones
Even ones that ain't good lookin'
They're the ones, who do the best cookin'
Gimme one with lots of money (yeah!)
Gimme two with lots of honey
Gimme three, that do those freaky things
Gimme four bad ladies, that like to swing!

Girls (oh!)
I love the things they know (love the things they know)

Nothing could be sweeter
Than a girl in my two-seater
We cruisin' around 'till dark (hey!)
And find a nice place to park (yeah!)
By the time we've got to dealin'
She knew what I was feelin'
Then she turned around and slapped me!
Said I got a lil' bit too happy
Hahaha!

And don't you know, you're mine, all mine
Mm-mm-hm, you look so good...

Te quiero, mi amore!
It's the girls that we adore!
With ladies on my mind
Don't you know, I daydream all the time
Hey! Well, I'd try to swim the whole ocean
Just to see the girls in motion
When they wear those black, mesh stockings
My heart starts to tick-a-tockin'
So sleek and super fine
Like a vintage, rosey wine
Hey girl, no need to blush
'Cause I think you look to crush!
I don't wanna play peek-a-boo
I just wanna get next to you
You're so fresh (all the time!), you're in your prime
But let's take it to the bridge, one more time!

Girls (oh!)
I love the things they know (love the things they know)
I love the things they show (love the things they show)
I got to be where they go
Swe-e-tness
Pretty girls (oh!)
Sunshine in their hair (sunshine in their hair)
Perfume that they wear (perfume that they wear)
Girls are everywhere

I wish I was a magician
So I could stop this wishing
I'd wave my magic wand
And poof! I'd have big fun
If all the guys could see me
They'd swear I was Houdini
Before they could count from 1 to 3
I'd have 10 girls, standing next to me!

Girls (oh!)
I love the things they know (love the things they know)
I love the things they show (love the things they show)
I got to be where they go

And I even like the way she looks
And when she turns around with those tight jeans on
Oh God, she’s got me hooked!
Check it out! But there's just one thing I want her to know
And that's just what I’m about
I like pretty girls with the tight jeans on
That make me scream and shout. Come on, girls!
Just take your time and work it all night long (huh!)
Just take your time and work it all night long

Well, come a lil' closer and I'm sure you'll find
That I'm a hell of a fella, and I'm one of a kind
If you happen to stay for just about an hour
You sweet, fine thing, you'll be in my power
Don't stop the feeling there’s nothing you can do
Put out your bag, take off your suit 
Now, if you think that you can’t contain yourself
Put all the silly games right on the shelf!

And them girls, they drive me crazy
And all the ways she shakes that precious thing
Oh man, it’s just amazing!

Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James

To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a route
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away

And you can put me to the test at your request

Kemosabi got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin
His head began to boppin his foot start to clappin
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work

Get, get ready, give it all you got
Just stop what you're doing, lend us your ear

So all you daddy-o's (get up!), young ladies, work your body

Hey hey, hey ladies, from coast to coast
I missed all around, but I missed ya most
So what's my name? I think you outta know by know
So I won't waste time, I'll just throw down
We're back on the one, the people's thrill
And if we don't rock, nobody will
This one's for you, so listen close
It's the ladies out there I love the most
And if you love me too, and you feel alright
Get up out your seat, do what you like
Don't you know you're special, one of a kind
Take me, too look and see what's inside
We won't let you down, we're here to stay
We'll maybe come into your town one day
So to you ladies out there, I can't resist
I'll seal this rockin' with a kiss

And all kinds of grooves that'll make you smile
So hop on the bus, catch a cab
Because the party we have is bound to be bad
To the people on the floor, there's more to come
There's a lot more fun where this came from
(We rock to the max!) We do it right
(Why?) You deserve a break tonight!
Because the week is through, when you want to chill
So you check out the sounds of Sugarhill
So remember that a party is on the 1
When you join the gang to have big fun

Runnin' the streets, playin' ya game
Everybody knows ya face, respects ya name
There's an art to the way you make ya cash
But you gotta be smart to make it last
Talk about fly girls and 4-door cars
And runnin' up bills in high class bars
It goes with the job, it's part of the date
If you choose to live your life that way
In the fast lane, come on!
Money, cash money
Money, cash money

You're a fly kid, livin' high on the hog
Got a lot of money, ain't got no job
Your daddy's rich, your momma's good lookin'
Got a live-in maid to do all the cookin'
Poverty never on your mind
Cause you can spend 500 at the drop of a dime
Watch the young ladies that say they're true
Cause they'll play you for a sucker and jerk you, too

Just take a look at your friends, don't be a dummy
Cause all they want is your money
You always gotta watch the things you do
Cause everybody's got their eyes on you
You're in the spotlight, your life is a show
But there's one thing that I'd like to know
When it's all gone, where ya gonna be?
Cause you're out of touch with reality

If I don't get my cash go flow
I made my cold cash in the fast fast lane
And if I lose it baby then I'm to blame

Lovin' the afternoon, the babydoll
If you could buy, I know you'd try
Yourself a condo on the Moon

Think about it!

Take a look at yourself, analyze your life
Do you waste your money, cheat on your wife?
Wake up in the night, go to bed with the sun
Is you main concern just to have fun?
Forsake your family, forget your friends
Until the girls go home and the cash flow ends
Drink alcohol, corrode your brain
From smoking good reefer and sniffing cocaine
Does your life consist of material things:
Fancy clothes, furs and diamond rings?
If any of these things apply to you
Don't you think it's time to try something new?
Grab a hold of yourself, and take the time
To restore your body, relax your mind
Don't get caught up in a fantasy
You'll see, how easy it can be
Livin' in the fast lane
Talk about it!

Troy,Livin’ in the Fast Lane,UnKnown,"It's always dark before the dawn, dawn, dawn...

The night is black, the streets are steamin'
The air has cracked with the sound of screamin'
Two gangs are out to even the score
In the alley with the rats and burned-out store
With the picks and chains, and a taste for pain
Every man falls prey to the  in vain
But the leader called Blaze is still standing tall
His shadow is big on a bloodied wall
His face is etched with the light he chose
And his sweat ran thick and drenched his clothes
He rules the streets with an iron claw
Everybody knows, that his word is law
24/7 he felt deprived
And every day was a new way to survive
His dreams of getting out seem far away
But he believed they'd still come true one day

It's always dark before the dawn
But it's gonna take guts to keep pushing on
Might break your back, might make you cry
But nothing beats a fail except a try, try, try...

Another night, another fight
And Blaze's old man wanna argue till the daylight
""Get out the gang, if you wanna grow old
Or you'll end up in a alley with a shotgun hole""
And tears burn his daddy's face
As Blaze jumped up, stormed out of the place
In the middle of the night, trying to clear his mind
He walks into the city 
A car flies fast and a gun explodes
And the leader called Blaze lies in the road
With one last breath to end his years
He raises up from the nightmare, sweating in fear
He wants to laugh, but he aches to cry
Because the dream seems real and he knows why
With a big wet arm he wipes his face
Just to be sure, jumps out the place 
The whole room's dark, but the TV's bright
With the video's rockin' on Friday night
And on a TV screen, a breakdance is mean
Two fellas, none o' them older than 17
They flip, spin, stop on a dime
And make you wanna think about the Big Time
""Well, I can break like that, there ain't no doubt
And this is gonna be my ticket out!""

It's always dark before the dawn
But it's gonna take guts to keep pushing on
Might break your back, might make you cry
But nothing beats a fail except a try, try, try...

Blaze tried hard to become a breakdancer
Just couldn't cut it, so it couldn't be the answer
He's thought about quittin', giving up all hope
Going back to the streets, the guns and the dope
But the thought grew hot, it turned his guts
He tried to go back, ""now I've got to be nuts""
So he kept on pushing and didn't look back
It didn't need a flick and bones would crack
He was busting up chops, putting brothers to shame
Because the best on the block would he became
Then the big break came right on time, huh
The first big step right out the crime
A radio station with advertisement
Breakdance competition with a fresh first prize
So be on stage next Friday night
With the gang, the glamor, and all the bright lights
Played one strong, to prove he's the best
So we made him our special guest
The stage was lit, showtime was here
This was the moment he'd come to fear
His heart started pumping like never before
When the lights went down and the people roared
He hit the stage, went to work
And then the whole damn place just went berserk!

It's always dark before the dawn
But it's gonna take guts to keep pushing on
Might break your back, might make you cry
But nothing beats a fail except a try, try, try...

Oh yeah. Whoo!
Alright now, I want everybody in the house tonight (come on!)
Everybody in the house tonight to put your hands together
Come on, help me out now
Yeah, that's good, yeah, yeah
Come on baby, get up girl, show your stuff
Check it out, now. Whoo! Come on
Yeah, come on now. Check it out, y'all
Get this, huh!
Get-get-get-get on up, y'all! And clap your hands, come on
Get-get-get-get on up, y'all! And clap your hands
To the beat, come on!
Get-get-get-get on up, y'all! And clap your hands, ah baby
Get-get-get-get on up, y'all! And clap your hands
Don't you know...?
It's always dark before the dawn
But you gotta, keep-keep pushing on
It's always dark before the dawn
But ya, but ya, but ya, but ya
Gotta, keep-keep-keep-keep pushing on!
Yeah, alright everybody. We love you!

Kid’s Rapper’s Delight,Jump on It!,1999.0,"Yeah, all the kids right now, come close to the stage
Come close to Sugarhill Gang right now
We're gonna dance all night long with y'all, come on now
Now let me tell you something about this song right here
This song here was the first song that created the whole rap phenomenon
""Rapper's Delight"" by the Sugarhill Gang

Somebody say ""Ho!"" (Ho!)
Say ""Ho! Ho!"" (Ho! Ho!)
Somebody scream! (Ahhh!)

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""Hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker not a dime 'til I made it again
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend
Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and I'm feeling the lows
The beat starts gettin' down to your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in the seat
And then jam, you start doing the freak
I said jam, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all, get on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put the jig-jig-jiggles in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
Come alive y'all, gimme what you got
'Cause I guarantee to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Skiddlee beebop, we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, kids: we love you
'Cause you rock and you roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we're like hot butter on your breakfast toast
Rock it up, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat, beat, it's so unique
Come on kids, let's rock to the beat",https://genius.com/Sugarhill-gang-kids-rappers-delight-lyrics

Time to make your burgers with the cheese on top

The sheep's in the meadow and the cow's in the corn
Yo, where is that boy looking after the sheep?
He's under a haystack, fast asleep
Now Little Miss Muffet, sat on a tuffet
Eating her curds and whey
There came a spider who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away

Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down and he broke his crown
And poor Jill came tumbling after
Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep
And she doesn't know where to find them

I was the only little kid who could see my pal
Which I thought was kinda cool 'cause it fit style
'Cause I had imagination of 15 kids
I used to say ""Hey ma, look what I did""
With the pen and paper, paper and pen
And the help of my little playmate friend
Check it out y'all, he was a cool little dude, yo
He never said a thing and he wasn't rude
If I got a little mad, he was there
And if I was little glad, he was there
And if I got a little sad, he was there
He did it 'cause he was there

We're gonna shoot the entire work, so fireworks they show
We declared our liberty two hundred years ago, yeah

In 1776, there were fireworks too
And original colonists you know, their tempers blew
Like Thomas Paine once wrote
And it's only common sense
That the government won't give you your right
You better get a new government

Some people tried to fight it
But a Committee was formed to write it
And it was Benjamin Franklin, Philip Livingston, John Adams, Roger Sherman and Thomas Jefferson
Yeah, they got in done, yeah
The Declaration, the Declaration of Independence, in 1776
The Contintental Congress, they said that we were free
They said we had the right of life and our liberty

When England heard the news
They just about blew their stack
But the colonies, good to fuse
And there ain't no turnin' back

They had enough of injustice
But even if it really hurts
If you don't give us our freedom now
You're gonna see some fireworks

On the 4th of July they signed it
And 56 names underlined it
And now to honor these first 13 states
We turn the sky into a birthday cake
They got it done, yeah
The Declaration, yeah
The Declaration of Independence in 1776

We hold these truths to self-evident, that all men are created equal
That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights
That among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness

Fireworks, fireworks, fireworks, fireworks, fireworks, fireworks, fireworks!
