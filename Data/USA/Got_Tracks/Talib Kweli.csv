Get By,Quality,2003.0,"We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
Through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, hey, hey

We keepin' it gangster, say ""fo' shizzle"", ""fo' sheezy"", and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk
Yo, our activism, attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly, the TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on
All types of drug, when all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon: imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

Yo-yo-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-get-by-lyrics
Push Thru,Prisoner of Conscious,2012.0,"I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin' self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-push-thru-lyrics
Ms. Hill,Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD,2005.0,"Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

I wish I could talk to Lauryn
I mean excuse me, Ms. Hill
And let her know how much we love her is real
The industry was beating her up
Then those demons started eating her up
She need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup
We used to kick it in the salad days
When she look at me like she ain't know me when she see me nowadays
I nod, she nod back, that's how it stay
Her songs still better than anything out than ""Hot"" or ""Power"" play
Remember how they accused her of saying, he did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing and tell the Pope about herself
Just after she left the Fugees, started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelle's Block Party
She made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful
Took Black Star on tour in Europe, I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but I'm sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls' self-esteem was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She ain't healthy, I'm a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load, but no

Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

Got your assistant on the the phone, ""I need to talk to Lauryn""
And I wanna walk through the storm, and I could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
Please, 
this no disrespect to whoever your man is, though
This relationship is 
strictly music like D'Angelo
I know you hate Babylon
, and 
wanna see it fall
But they won't let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope, you give us faith, you the one
They don't like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come, whoa
Now that's powerful sis, it's black power
We get money, keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I ain't saying you Christ, that would be sacrilegious right?
But you can blow and you nice, sisters them raps is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read 
Francis Crest
 or anything
By 
Third World Press
 impressed
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Donda West
, yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on?
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it, cause I really ain't got the words to say it
But yo

Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say

Come Here,Prisoner of Conscious,2003.0,"I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Why you so far away? You need to feel this
I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts
I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you
Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable
Your whole style is colder than Minnesota
I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over
We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer
We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Like a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor
Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure
I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like ""sure""
She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby
As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali
She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown
Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around
This last bird probably flew the coop
Blastin' Outkast, last words: ""Ooh-Dee-Whoo""
I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi... how you say, ""voulez vous?""
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me

Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
While I manage, just serving long sentences, no commas
Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
You the Earth, that's emphatically ""yes""
But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't gotta ask her ""why you stare"" - that's a ""yes""

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-come-here-lyrics
Never Been in Love,The Beautiful Struggle,2004,"I know there's a first time for everything
First time I let her in my bed she got wetter then the perfect storm
That we weathering together
 and
This the first time that I've ever considered wedding rings
But first things first yo
I met her at the bar
 rolling with 
three wise men like I followed the star
There she is shorty bi coastal
Thick like bifocals,
 
stacked like 2Pac vocals
 
her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so I'm romancing the stone
The rhythm is to the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone
, yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest and I'll fly make you testify
Damn baby I know we got some haters and

I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to seeing
Because I never been in love before

You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the 
beautiful struggle
Now baby tell what's it gonna take to prove that I love you
When I'm gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening to
Don't get it confused I'm trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this its like a miracle you
You You stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I took above it's clear skies that's surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and I'm down to serve let's deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo
Here we go


You looked good when I tried you on
So I had to write a song
Use to be the guy that always made her cry when I'm gone
Always kept a stable and I never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone why
I'm never home scared of commitment
Ready to forever roam
We at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to R.I.P. Proceeds my name up on the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes
Dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them do you I don't care who she speaking with
Because I already know she made it clear who she leaving with
And it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you ain't no groupie ho
Sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something that you should know",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-never-been-in-love-lyrics
All of Us,Radio Silence,2017.0,"(We must love and support each other!)
We have nothing to lose but our chains
(We have nothing to lose but our chains!)
Now you say that shit so loud, them motherfuckers outside hear you
It is our duty to fight for our freedom!

It is our duty to win (It is our duty to win!)

Yeah, if our struggle is a strain then the strain is dominant
My name is prominent for entertainment that's laced with consciousness
But really it's just common sense like Lonnie Lynn
You don't need binoculars to see the light coming through the dome like it's an oculus
The common myth that we're savages with no history or accomplishments
Or knowledge of ourselves, they did a job on us
Considering the prediction of economists, 
machines will do our jobs for us
The future for the working class is ominous
They got us indoctrinated through a bitch's brew, a religion mixed in with abuse
Emotional we sit in pews, it's physical, we get the noose
And hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves, refuse to change ourselves
When I talk about our past it doesn't ring a bell
They make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
They'll take you from your family, your kids will never respect ya
Attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message
We start acting if we cracking the whip better than the oppressor, yes
Every problem can't be solved at the ballot box
We unifying Africa like Gaddafi, that's what got Malcolm shot
They out to stop anybody with knowledge that figured out the plot
On the balcony like Martin Luther King, I been to the mountaintop
The blue wall of silence, it's really the blue wall of violence
The good cops who retire and get fired
They screaming black on black as an excuse for you to not care
'Til the cops roll up in their SWAT gear

I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan
Sweating all through the night just like the Holy Prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with J. Cole and Kweli
Just before Jehovah the God crowned me the king with his goldie locket
Alhamdulillah
, we've come really far, ain't it?
The little engine who could, could power any car can't it?
The mothers in Chiraq say the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times, the holy Quran and Bible
We on the last page and line, the verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the matrix, inside of the spaceship but the savior's blind
Or so it seems, years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs
I hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways
Officer friendly is an enemy now, looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the asiatic ancient-semitic peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple

Turnt Up,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"Ayo, Fed—whassup, bro?
Whassup with me? You know what's up with me, man
I'm trying to get paid in full
Check this out, right
Since Javotti is the label
And I'm talking over this def beat right here
I think we should turn it up
We got my man (Tr-tr-Trend on the beat)

Thinking of the master plan
Where there’s nothing but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket my prophet is heaven sent
I dig deeper, you know I represent, represent
Yeah, money over bitches, my sisters go over everything
My bandz will make you dance, I'm forever like a wedding ring
Far above the hate and, the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Trying to get away from the 85ers like Evelyn
Ride with me, 
I got ‘em leaking like Nene
Got ‘em leaking like Wiki, these monkeys biting like hickeys
Cause they’re seeing what I’m doing, filling them with confusion
Cutting just like a truant, I’m fluent just like a student
Of the romance languages
, 
only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnishes just like your wages is
The crib’s outrageous like really it's no joke
The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke loud

Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people

You can feel the heat from your speaker, my sound will darken your features
Run it down like a zebra, 
I move with the speed of cheetahs
I’m from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a two-litre
I ain’t asking for no followers, I'm looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading, 
alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming all through my semen
So every time I bust, babies begin being born
Talk turns tough til them toasters that's tucked get
Drawn like a picture, picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leaders the lazy is lollygagging
On my grind 
getting guap, guess green is the new black
Meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car, you know who blew that loud


Ayo we drink good, smoke good
These cats wearing funny hats like the pope would
I come in looking quite clean in the loafers
So hood might scheme up to no good
You no crook, Gosling in the Notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I Wood
I still rep P.O.C.s like I'm supposed to
Coming live from death row like I know Suge
My rhymes like a laser beam - so focused
I’m in the ring, so lean I need a foam cup
I ain't lying, bare teeth so ferocious
Maybe I’m lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and I'm floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music, I’m complete in my devotion

I’m complete in my devotion",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-turnt-up-lyrics
In the Mood,Eardrum,2007.0,"Yes! Welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Ladies...

I got you in the mood, for an interlude
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview
I know you into me, so, let me get into you
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin
And rappin and fuckin', and passin' the dutch and relaxin'
And puffin' and hittin' and duckin', the rippin production
These kittens ain't muffins, just because we stuff 'em in the oven
My words is drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, 
get a clue
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady, but
One glimpse and I know they're ready, you already know
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars (uh, uh)
Navigate through the truly bizarre (Yeezy, uh-uh)
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight (Woo!)

You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told you, oh
Lose, eat crews like crews like soul food
The only producer that feel like ""fuck rappers!""
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say...
Is this a Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like
Just like, I'm the shit
Uh, you ain't figured out what I'm about yet
Always rockin that ""this ain't out yet,"" but this ain't 'bout that
From a city where niggas plug like outlets
Far as music go, yo, it ain't no outlets, so, when I go out
Niggas always out to get me in the studio
And I ain't in the mood to flow, I'm with my girl
And I'm tryin to hit the movies yo, and they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tootie
This girl got a silicon booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like 50, throw her in a pool, G!

I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

Break it down, uh!
What?
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Yeah!

Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes, don't compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Donte and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, 
Mr Bojangles-ass dudes
Dancin around the club,
 doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!

I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

Wow, that's a nice track!",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-in-the-mood-lyrics
Black Girl Pain,The Beautiful Struggle,2004.0,"My mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way, still, you've come so far
They just know the name, they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself, know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
They just know the name they don't know the pain, Black girl

I do it for the people, I do it for the love
I do it for the poet, I do it for the thug
This is for victory, and this is for the slaughter
I do it for my mother, I do it for my daughter
Promise I'll always love ya, I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your brother should be looking out for one another
I'm so blessed, man, y'all the reason I got up
Somebody put his hands on you I'm getting locked up
I'm not playing, that's the prayer I'm saying for Diani
And if I die then she'll be protected by Amani
That's her bigger brother and I love the way he love her
She a girly-girl, she love to imitate her mother
But she a Gemini, so stay on her friendly side
She'll put that look on you, it's like somebody friend just died
My pretty Black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting Black business
Teach her what black is; the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided, bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free; she ain't no black zombie
This is for Aisha, this is for Kashera
This is for Khadijah, scared to look up in the mirror
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a Black girl name, she living Black girl pain
This is for Makeba, and for my Mamacita
What's really good Ma, I'll be your promise-keeper
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a black girl name, she live in black girl pain

Mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way, still, we've come so far
They just know the name they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself, know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
'Cause they just know the name they don't know the pain, Black girl

This is for Beatrice Bertha Benjamin who gave birth to Tsidi Azeeda
For Lavender Hill, for Khayelitsha
Athlone Mitchell's Plain, Swazi girls I'm repping for thee
Manenberg, Gugulethu; where you'd just be blessed to get through
For beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain; I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Coloured for realizing we're African
For all my cousins back home, the strength of Mommy's backbone
The length of which she went for raising, sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elna's back, I march
Fist raised, caramel shining, in all our glory
For Mauritius, St. Helena; my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Eadie, for Norma, Leslie, Ndidi
For Auntie Betty, for Melanie; all the same family
Fiona, Jo Burg, complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
This world's yours, and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls, raise up your hands; the world should clap for us

Mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way, still, we've come so far
They just know the name they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high

Beautiful Struggle,The Beautiful Struggle,2004.0,"This is a tear jerker

The revolution's here
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

Yo, I heard it's said the revolution won't be televised
But in the land of milk and honey there's a date you gotta sell it by
Otherwise it just expires and spoils
And these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
Cause the fire boils inside
You go to church to find you some religion
And all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradiction and
You try to vote and participate in the government
And the muh'fuckin' Democrats is actin' like Republicans
You join a organization that know black history
But ask them how they plan to make money and it's a mystery
Lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you
The revolution's here, the revolution is personal
They call me the political rapper
Even after I tell 'em I don't fuck with politics
I don't even follow it
I'm on some KRS, Ice Cube, Chris Wallace shit
Main Source, De La Soul, bumpin' ""2Pacalypse Now""


Yo, I speak at schools a lot cause they say I'm intelligent
No, it's cause I'm dope, if I was whack I'd be irrelevant
I'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
Stay optimistic, thinking change is gonna come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray, on top of that, act today
Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away""
Everybody pass away, the pastor prays, the family mournin'
Everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in (You'll try to change the world)
You fight in the streets, start bleedin' 'til the blood is pourin'
In the gutter, mothers cry 'til the Lord be livin' by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
The same reason I always rock dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery


It's a beautiful thing that's happenin' right now
Right now G
Yo, I'm rockin' with my man Hi-Tek on the track right now
We fightin' the good fight

Yeah, let's go

State of Grace,Gravitas,2013.0,"From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
In a state of grace
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
Would never come back to the hood, no immunity
Usually a nigga like that so fake,no different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
And she love Beyonce cause she run the world
Her mama used to run this city
Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy
When it came to the music then she got real picky
From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie
No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
And she felt that Pac was more lyrical
Plus she never went to college
But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical chords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Now all her daughter got is ""Love & Hip Hop""
Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
No desire for the lying and the violence
That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
Her body is politics
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
She won't do it no more, lost all her faith
They say she exaggerate when she hollerate
But it's only so much she can tolerate

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
Her entire graduation was a dire situation
Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
But no longer felt a part of the conversation
Used to be I'm a ''ride or die'' chick
B.I.G. with the ''Me And My Bitch''
No objections, being an object,major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
She erased all her songs from the phone
You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
She tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering
And this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion
Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?


In the face of hate
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
Put it on tape, let her know I could relate
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
When you hate yourself, when you hate your race
Let's get to the core
Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
She a bitch, she a whore
And you rich and you shit on the poor
In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me?
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
With the charge of repping it correctly
When it's free online or in a cloud
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
Rhyming is a memory
The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
Running through you like fast food -  Big Mac's
You don't want no problems, fix that
All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Now you ain't never gon' get back


She don't love it, no
She don't love it no more",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-state-of-grace-lyrics
Human Mic,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"I exhibit characteristics of the average misfit
Who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit
It’s sick and tragic how antagonistic we get
When there's no power it go sour
I seen 'em crossing a bridge by the masses,
Covered in the ashes of both towers
Native New Yorker the way that we talk
Make him an offer that you can't refuse
Come back later on after you thought it over
Look out for shooters that we’re popping up at the opera
To pop ya, daughters paying for the sins of the god father
Popular music got ‘em confusing killers and artists
I kill it the hardest. Competition dearly departed
They feeling some sort of way 'cuz my flow revealing the garbage
I'm making 'em throw it up. You just making the people vomit
When it comes to this rhymin' I’m a legend like Tutankhamun,
Or the Chupacabra, the way I weave it together and tie the knot up
Made a macramé of macabre, you daquiri with a shot of
The Amarretta, you’re sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that
You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts
On track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently
Viciously off the rip, we be rippin' it like a shredder
Some symphony hall shit, gettin' higher than your falsetto,
Getting better. Drop a pearl every jam like Eddie Vedder
Very fed up with self appointed preservers of past eras
Who never see their reflection when they’re walking past mirrors
They got bitten and now they smitten with the taste of blood
They take enough drugs for the sleepin' they weepin' and fuckin' they make-up up
I raise the bar and the waiters up
All this hate is just confused unadulterated love
The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
Advocate for artists, regardless cause I got faith in us
For the workers who don’t get paid enough
Take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts
As far as they’re concerned food on the table's the only way to love
It takes a slum village to raise a child, you got to raise it up
Raise it up, raise it up,raise it up, take it up, take it up",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-human-mic-lyrics
Ghetto Show,The Beautiful Struggle,2004.0,"Ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard

Precious metals round our necks and arms
We tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods
Ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard
We tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods
Precious metals round our necks and arms
We tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
Even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings,
 
pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling,
 shit seems real and
What's real is the estate of mind that we're in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight, so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

If lyrics sold, then truth be told
I'd probably be just as rich and famous as JAY-Z
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense
Cause it's the music, the blues, it's the jazz, it's acoustics
Soul, Rock and Roll, the hip-hop that we producin', yea
It's the gear, it's the flare, it's the stare
Nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air
We got our own elected officials,
 
no matter who the mayor
I know you know what I'm talking about
From New York to the South, take off your shoes when you walk in the house

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Yo, I grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah, B.I.G. and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
But rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hip-hop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like stic.man and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more

A man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard it's a drought
Up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God, but you try to get by
It's like the block keep blockin'
You try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
These shorties in the court, need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin', me and Kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach

Bitin' off more than you can chew, create orphans
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin' nails into they own coffins (c'mon)
Hear come the Dundee moves rocket-launchin' (yeah)
Black Thought, quit playin' him close and back up off him

Kweli -- spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee

One by one I knock 'em out like Schoolly D - my rhymes is eulogy
A flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin' me
I black and blue emcees - actin' new to me, get smacked stupidly
They lack skills, like the black community lack unity (uh)
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz'

And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf
Nan nigga competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, gettin' Pharoahe for help

From natives walkin' the Trail of Tears to players sippin' Belvedere
We always comin' well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin' fear
Plus, even my niggas from the Bay, they say you hella scared
Truth or consequences, and all senses be well-aware
Your style - under-developed there, hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see, but I can tell by your stare
Nigga you fugazi, sayin' ya crew blazin'
Like sayin' Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican, we makin'

Guerrilla Monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
When I attack your city, y'all gon' think Dr. Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seed-spittin' contests
With a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to Congress
I'm pissed - cumulus clouds of ominous
Words of the Thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
Unless, you wanna be leg and armless
That's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats

How'd it leak to him? Who told him? Who told him, the Pope? Who? Cause they like, 'the Pope' and 'the money', aw c'mon man, get the fuck outta here.""

Oh you niggas wanna get deep?
Niggas wanna kick knowledge? Y'all niggas ain't deep man
Y'all niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then I'm like, show me the proof right?
Niggas start talking about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga
I'm a grown ass man. Let's go, let's go

You can lead a man to a drink but you can't make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link but that don't mean he gonn' click
What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit, I peeped it
Scared of a motherfuckin' secret, society
And only bein' with people you agree with, you scared of a
Chalice, scared of death, only thing worse is your silence
Illuminati's enlightened, the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars, symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up, no new Bugatti (Yes)
My enemy tryna stop me
But I don't stand a chance if I can't identify 'em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission: abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state, and they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets, they was Scholars, 
early Illuminati was
Sorta like the students in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss 'em, turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration (Keep it goin')
And ain't no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
That's how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact, ain't no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real life's more complex, what's your context?
They put the symbols on the dollar bill
, the monument, the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
It's really just another case of stealin' from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
Population control is real (word), you know the deal but still
Perpetuate the cycle of violence, we known to hold the steel
No, I don't need no fuckin' chorus
Used to read so many books, thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really don't know what you reading if you really don't know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof: a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
Don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister, worse than any blood sacrifice
You can imagine, iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food, vaccines, humanitarian aid
They want control of the region, they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan
Y'all niggas scared of one world currency but still paying your
Taxes, it ain't the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of your enemy
I'm leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat

(Man, we supposed to be brothas!)
Oh what you tryna get smart?
Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge?
Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
Take that shit off

Oh you got a pager too huh?

Offered to try, at first I thought she was shy
'Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
... Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight, Eva Mendes in The Other Guys
Got me in another zone - they call her Sunshine like
""Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home""
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love
Man I, man I, uh

Ehhhh, a gente é desse jeito mesmo é diferente
Ehhhh, é brasileiro é swingueiro, é coração
Ehhhh, a gente é que bota fé na vida pode cre
Tamo ai para viver para encarar
(Ehhh) A vida pro que der e vier
É nois que tá na fita agora pode crê
Brasil crescendo a gente tá ai para aparecer
Se voce quiser colar com a gente, não tem nada não
A gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma união
Brasil o povo de mistura raca pé no chão
Objectividade na vontade de crescer

A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak I'll of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta
, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
From a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line


Uh, uh
I don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it
You're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
It might blow up but it won't go pop
""Pow!"" That's the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you (Rockin My Boat) like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave I'm gonna miss you, 
(Official) like Kardinal
Trust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val
When I come back around, take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love
Man I, yea, yea yea...",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-favela-love-lyrics
"Wack Niggaz, Pt. 2",The Beautiful Mix CD,2015.0,"Yeah
Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This nigga...why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean
 
and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga...

Wack niggas...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out, they houndin' dawg
Sayin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic, exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol' Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskay had them girls feelin' friskay
You was with mey, she said ""Who's the sissay?""
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay
 
and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya ""No hable ingle""
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself

(Wack nigga) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a
(Wack nigga) I'd kill myself if I was that
(Wack nigga) Everything you wear and rock, is just
(Wack nigga) Even if you flossin' rocks you still
(Wack nigga) You can't do it dawg, you's a
(Wack nigga) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass
(Wack nigga) Even your daughter says ""My daddy's a - ""
(Wack nigga - You wack nigga!)

You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more that you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business, niggas don't forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - 
you all can get it, I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like, ""You hold a gat, right?""
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light - act right
You got it twisted, tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now, you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' Nuwaubian and followin' Malachi
Or anything but rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got boy!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-wack-niggaz-pt-2-lyrics

Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker’s club
Mike Tyson face tatted, addict like it rough
Hey scatterbrain, don’t get your grey matter punched up
Til you're hunched, tucked, talking like you punch drunk
One love, two maybe if I’m drunk enough
Naked watching three painted ladies do the bump and rub
Mean mugging Jean the Heebs call meshugenah
Booking her in the Catskills like, look at her rap skills
E-book in the backpack, the nerd in the Rat Pack
Jean Martin de Bergerac, you heard of her murder rap
Her murder rep, then learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, use it for burning cardio
Don’t use it with burners, they’ll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murders, lock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder before murder murder, fuck it, murder
Make it four, insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl, infernal glow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge, hurt her no
Tyler Durden nerve in this, the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy’s a {Black Star}, rap star
Jean a rock star, minus the Pharrell and all the cop cars
Rock soft, lock bars with the realest in the spot
Really y’all should get on your knees and pray us for our forgiveness, say

I’m a man of God who asked the Devil for some face time
The Shaitan, you never see him coming cause you're faith blind
The mainline, Bloods is waving flags like K’Naan
The Crips throwing gang signs
The Beast in the street bear they teeth like a canine
Get low like the bassline
Jean and Kwa think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine
They know they’ll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Run the track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline so we keeping the fire burning
We speeding like Valvoline and we speak for a higher purpose
You believe in magazines, I deliver entire sermons
You need some Vaseline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life so
Picturing yourself as a gangster the only way that you shooting
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic catch phrases just to get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when I’m spitting game I’m adding on
Rappers going hard, the G.O.A.T., I got an acronym for Capricorn
Centered And Prepared, Rigorous, Innovative
Captivating, Ordinary, Regular, Nigga just
Growing daily, your chick goin' crazy, yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rocking the fresh kicks like you felt the baby
We’ll wait til you done being whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wondering why dudes is dressing funny in rap
They need attention dog, there ain’t no more money in rap
So if you mixing with GarageBand, videos on the Flip cam
I’m a big fan, you got more heart than Bret The Hit Man
But shit damn, it’s the pinnacle, gets no better
I’m boasting, but still stay humble
Never cynical, I’m posting

I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

K. West! Kweli!
Got searched on the plane, Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
You flirt 'til she came
Nothin' hurt like the pain and torture
Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lord's name
Put your hands together, got 'em all sayin'

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Yo, it's all ghetto in gear higher than falsetto
More metal for beef that we don't let the law settle
I try to navigate the treacherous waters of
America's ghettos that set up to slaughter us
But there's more of us
Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous, trigger stranglers
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit'
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit'
Our growing pains go way deeper than Mike Seaver's
Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us, but rappers just ain't the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry but you can't stop the music

An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom)
Some many sufferin' cuz deep inside they're scared (so scared)
Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't care?

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Yo, the things I'm seein' on the news is insane
A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front of a train
A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
Three years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help
Tryin' to bring your struggle to life
The label want a song about a bubbly life
I have trouble tryin' to write some shit To BANG in the club through the night
When people suffer tonight
Lord knows I try

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, make it fit like a puzzle
Come on, say it now
Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, yeah

I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Upside down kingdom

Traveling Light,Radio Silence,2017.0,"I come from the God body era
I come from standing on street corners
Smoking blunts out of white owls with 40s
Building and destroying about the suns
And the planets and the moons and the stars
About the nature of man
About knowledge, wisdom, and understanding
And you had to show and prove
And you had to be right and exact

Voulez-vous, rendezvous, coucou le poopoo, come on!
Yeah Chris, yeah, I like that right there, yeah!
Hah, come on! Yeah
KAYTRANADA, classic

Waste these niggas, son, 
I got a doctorate in rockin it
Pardon, we got it poppin, it's marvelous, nigga watch it
You follow a carbon copies I'm stoppin' to intervene
You're erroneous, these the phoniest rappers I've ever seen
When I take flight, I'm traveling light, that's a double entendre
For when I'm touring, exploring outside the genre
Illuminate, when I grabbin the mic, it's so bright it'll blind you
Yeah I'm back with a friendly reminder
We're two ships that're passing in the night, but alas
You got to run into the iceberg, I'm cracking this shit in half
Traveling light, not talking about back of the back
First I get back in the lab, then I hit the road, I'll be back in a flash
I'm Barry Allen mixed with Harry Allen
My blood hot as volcanic rock forming canary diamonds they find on Canary Islands
My rhymes inspired by enviroments of the very violent
I'm the voice of a generation that's very silent
I stick to my convictions like I've been indicted
All you niggas throwing me shade you about to get enlightened

Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

Ay, I'm faster than the speed of sound
Smashing through these barriers, I'm blasting out your speakers now
Travel around the planet till I landin where I'm needed now
We entertainers, they wanna call us leaders now
Woah, extra baggage not in the plans, I'll shop when I land
Stop for the fans, every airport from Okinawa to Osaka, Japan
Stop assuming I live in your time zone
Jetlag is my reality, the road is my home, I roam
Your downfall is you should probably get out more
I been planning out tours, with a band of outlaws
I'm packing my bags, just marijuana and magazines
Wrapping the flag around a pistol, the red, the black and the green
Never crashing, the grill is mean when I'm whipping machines
Dipping between all these commuters, they moving slow like they sippin the lean
Are they living the dream? Get to they office
And that computer's drifting off until they spit start to drip from the screen

Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

City of broken promises, my mission is reconnaissance
It's dangerous for anybody following
That's why I take biting as a compliment, it's proof of my dominance
It's the haters' way of congratulating me for my accomplishments
Well, I'm so atop of this demolishing all the Charlotters
To whisper in the ears of your congressmen
Shoving dollars in their pockets, 
the more we locked up, the more they profiting
They building empires like Ottoman
Now who you wanna face? 
The sharks in the water or the snakes in the boat?
The lesser of two evils be fighting for fake votes
We walking through the valley of darkness so stay close
Need the light at the end of the tunnel to make a toast
Raise a glass to our glorious past, we the wave of the future
Never confusing protesters for looters
Silencing Radioheads and OK Computers
Travel to Mecca like Mansa Musa so let's go

June 11, 2001. Timothy McVeigh is executed and the country breathe a sigh of relief. Goodness prevails over evil, it seems. Somehow when he's gone, we feel safer. Little do we know

Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies, so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real

It's more than pride

August 4, 2001. A drunken police officer mows down an entire family in Brooklyn. The judge lets him go with no bail. It reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system. I struggle, to explain the situation to my son, it's hard

Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal, but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's, but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors, so they working for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

September 11, 2001. Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center kills thousands and permanently scars America's false sense of security. We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst. As firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts, fight to save lives. The world will never be the same again

My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

Special dedication
I'm sendin' this one out to you
And you and you and you

She cold blooded
I love how we meltin' the ice
She like the sunshine of my life
Cause all I see is a hot thing
You're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, somebody like a flick
It got surprisin' twists
I write the script
The main character - your thighs and hips
Award for best supportin' role go to your eyes and lips
The way you move your body got 'em stiff like a hieroglyph
I watched you dance across the floor to the title track
You 'bout to get me ""Off The Wall"" like you Michael Jack'
I make a scribe in your beauty my sacred duty
I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie

Good love you a sexy thing
And all I'm sayin' is you got somethin' I like
Love that you like it
Love that you like it
Love that you like it

Yo, I love your country ass
I love your city sass
I love how you know my ways
You catch on pretty fast
These dudes are pretty crass
Harass you in your past
I love how you snap back and get the last laugh
I love the way your crib smell like Votivo candle incense
The White voice you use on the phone when you handle business
I love it when you freaky
I love when you a lady
Rockin' door knockers from the late 80s, raisin' babies
I love her; god bless you
Your body somethin' special
I love to play connect the dots with your facial freckles
No need for fashion policin' because I love your style
Whatever happen to Shenice, baby I love your smile
I might be fallin' in love, should I let her know
A pimp told me if I love her I should let her go
I sing her praises every time they play this instrumental
Cause she instrumental to my life


I love how we meltin' the ice
You like the sunshine of my life
Cause all I see is a hot thing
You're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing

So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, lemme take you by the hand
You need to tell your man, don't fight it, damn
Have you groupied out like excited fans
I promise you'll be climbing walls like Spider-Man
Knees bucklin' you'll hit the floor when you try to stand (up)
So you drop it like it's hot - oh so heavy
You and me we can leave now - we can go steady
How about we be jetty cause I'm so ready to bounce like a '64 Chevy",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-hot-thing-lyrics
Love Language,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro Talib Kweli)
Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo
(Verse 1 Talib Kweli)
Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things thats normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin like the Titanic here come the panic
Being with you like a habit, without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned on wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf...
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
(Verse 2 Talib Kweli)
Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin approachin
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin but a bird
Yo, yo, yo
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
(Verse 3 Talib Kweli)
Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they dont understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language
Universal love...
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
Love love love love, love, love (Repeated)",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-love-language-lyrics
Give ’Em Hell,Eardrum,2007.0,"Ready or not

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (word)

Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, then what's the word of the reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image, then that means his face is mine
Wait or it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father, then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus, then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James? And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible?
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die
But how they know?

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)

I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, it was a blessing, not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon 
and that's where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
That's why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vein to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin' to go inside

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup)

Living in mass confusion, looking for absolution
The gas seducin' and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew, make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well

Momma say it's her after me
Preacher say it's blasphemy
I say there's gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God, here's you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean

We know (hey)
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd don't mean I gotta be no sheep

Heads Up Eyes Open,Radio Silence,2017.0,"Take it to the top
Yea, that's where we at with it, hah
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character, uh
Don't mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready? Let's go

A wise man know what he know, and what he doesn't
If he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective, but his biblehood never questioned
A dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
He'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth
His word is his bond but his action's always the proof
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down, thunderstorm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce now I'm back like I'm Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday, my twenties went in the bowl
Forgive me Lord for them bitches the night before
Business deals and the Bentleys I can't afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones, on the gone, it was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed, therefore I spark
Recite the Quran, I'm in the dark
Devil knocking on my door, he like a narc

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

No excuses, if I start it then I'll see it through
God is what I see in you so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TV's true? The media deceiving you
They misrepresenting, misquoting then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing, in case you're wondering
If they want the ring, they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe but I back it up with what I know (oh!)
It's the facts versus the facts simile, your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments in Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud, I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire, I walked through the Devil's fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a, beast with this rhyming
That's where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action

I used to put the money first, y'all still do
But that hardly works cause y'all still ask for prices from
The waiters and you're hardly served
You pay once, you pay forever, that you can't reverse
That's why I ain't paid Talib for no fuckin' verse
Mutual respect over below payments
Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery
I been listenin' and four quarters of y'all won't make it
I'm Africa's number one, that's a fuckin' bold statement
And I'm the most relevant
You failin' to admit that is your biggest impediment

Money make niggas break promises
Money turn niggas into pharmacists
Money make you drop outta colleges
But the bars that I spit through God exist
Who we be, that's who we are
Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton
My taste expensive as a superstar
So I take what I want like a coup d'état
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for God's appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin' our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat, need money to live
Need money to keep, need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control, then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when it's sent, we come to our nation's capital to cash the check
According to Dr. King when he saw it clear in his dream
""We built the pyramids, they built a pyramid scheme""

Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate

That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in

Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio

Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth

Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life
It imitate my life

Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff

I’m the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it’s real, but I’m focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you’re not in tune, no, you’re not immune
No Echinacea, no golden seal
So you sick inside, gotta flush it down
When you talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain’t nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you’re out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you’re gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That clock only thing you punchin' out

When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you’re made to do
I got faith in you, you’re gonna make it through
Cause you don’t chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a baby due
You won’t taste no fruits like Naked Juice
Wo!! The world won't wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vow
As long as you on planet earth put family first got to make 'em proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts

This is what I have to do

It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better

Walk with God be still and listen
Try to talk to God what's real I’m spitting
Call 'em Christ by name but he still ain’t rising
Set to my lane but still ain’t listening
Got ice in the veins remain so frigid
Still in the kill brain cells when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don’t stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain’t living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving
People of colour 25% more likely than whites to face prison
But just because the president is black there’s no more racism?
Post-racial? More like most racial
The hate for you disgraceful
Don’t let it take you off your base, let it motivate you
Don’t let it overtake you, so what another cloud
Survive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild
Wow

Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante & Kenny, I mean the Latter more

Split your wig like I got three arms

Some other shit, I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone, I'm still the king of the drama

Upper Echelon,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"Check it out baby
Check it out y'all
This that upper echelon shit
What is this?
Welcome to the Prisoner of Conscious

Brainiac dum-dum, bust the scientifical
You feel it all up in your soul, we getting spiritual
You heard I'm coming back, it's so scary I put the fear in you
I murder every track, cause the rhymers like to stare at you
Real shit back, it's a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof
I'm back with the classical shit, I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer
And then I vaporize ya', my paper may surprise ya'
No need to brag on my paper cause I'm a naturizer
I vibrate higher, the truth break liars
I chose who is like us
The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters
Cut the grass we could see the vipers
We cut the glass cause we the diamonds


I be listening to real shit, real spit, like die hard feeling
Type of shit the fake niggas find hard to deal wit'
I'm on a higher plane, I'm destroying em' while I build them
My threat can't be contained, so my name on Obama kill list
Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Moving the through darkness, the light is what's in front of me
Front on me you posers exposing your insecurities
Supposedly it's wack and replaces lack of maturity
The purity you need to get in the game is gone
Ain't no conspiracy, stop looking for someone to blame it on
Gotta pay a debt, took a stale style and I made it fresh
Wait a second, got your girl wetter than tomato flesh
Waiting on me with baited breath


Welcome to the
Walking through double fisted, I'm lifted on something vicious
Everything is moving, I'm getting me a percentage
Vintage, nothing but the sky is my ascendant
My girl is ride or die, I'm avoiding the evil temptress
Ain't no question who the best is
You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mentions
Pimping down to the socks, and so is business
The all night workout like 24-Hour Fitness
Y'all niggas is adorable, incorrigible
The praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignoring you, why?
The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth
Order suit, niggas is gassed up
Petroleum a lab when these niggas get swept up
Custodians of culture, back to the future rap, DeLorean
I class up the joint the spit is valedictorian",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-upper-echelon-lyrics

Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you ""gay""
Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more, some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through a door, I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it, like it was pottery or
The mouth with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor, I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore, so they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door
To top it all off, if your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce
That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all, I done forgot what I'm following for
Enough about y'all, now back to me, ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece, so when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap

I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders

Oh lord
Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen
To rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus, though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath, what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught, I look at myself and pretend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?
If you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga

Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap for me uh (put your hands together)

I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers (what), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself forward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of mother's unlimited figurative tree
Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming, catch up with us cause we leaving
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders

Lonely People,The Beautiful Mix CD,2004,"All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Yeah I like to go out to clubs
Las Palmas, you know
She this envy if I wanna get grimey wit' it at Bungalow Eight
Opium down in Miami
But when I walk in, I look around and I think

I look at all the lonely people (x4)

Yo, I'm headin' out, 'bout to do some fleshin' out
I know my flesh endowed
With somethin' to prove, I'm settin' out
On a trip to Heaven's mouth, yeah
I'm steppin' out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance?
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mama's all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin' and they love shoppin' and they thug posturin'
Thugs be lockin' horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the 'hood
When you tryin' to make paper out of the wood
You know that money don't grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin'
He snitchin', he twitchin', he bitchin', he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs, gotta be in the club
Lookin' for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him, out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he don't like the way he been livin'
And wanna be forgiven
How I know? Cuz I'm right there wit' him
Yo, yo


Tattoos tell 'em who you are
Plastic Surgery coup d'etat the God
Uh, lasers to remove the scar
And then you are, you a supastar, supastar
It's your birthday and you in the club
Talkin' ""Holla back"" and ""Nigga what""
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really, truth is that nobody there
Cuz it's feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas trees
God complex like they born on Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet, left your man at home
Security snatchin' people camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles, pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend, that's so last year
Last month, last day, last hour, last minute
Your pursuit of cool is so passionate
Doin for the cash in it, laugh in his face
If it's def or anybody who don't stay in his place
So popular can't go nowhere, folks stoppin' ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you go to a movie heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely, that's why you need disguises

Rocket Ships,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"Moving at the speed of a solution
Bleeding in the streets as we're breathing the pollution
They're saying that we need a revolution
But their passion is reduced to all-caps on a computer
Hey, every sixteen I make a sick scene
Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen
Y'all niggas trippin' like mescaline and mixed greens
My flow cleaner than the Sistine, pristine
You going green like Al Gore with 'em
I make algorithms that got Malcolm in 'em
God's favorite, I'm sick as a doctor's patient
We live in a cold world,
 
my job is to rock nations
My occupation? Elation, a celebration of rebels
Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant
It's too amazing how we be blazing, son
Our flowers is the loudest
, they crowd around us
But cower in the shadows of the towers, boy

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

Yo, I plaster the nation, causing evacuation
My manifestation got 'em patient from how I keeps it amazing
See, I'm the reason niggas need some training
While I'm inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion
I'm very engaging soon as I'm awaken
Quickly back you up and bag your bitch
She's reminding me of Sanaa Lathan
Rely on the hating while I'm smiling and waiting
That's when I embrace 'em
If you try to front, you'll be highly mistaken
The mightiest making of a classic, alrighty, I'll face it
My psyche is ancient and I'm hiring, so try me, I'm patient
Sorry, I'm lying, face it, I'm back for the taking
I'm urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in
(Damn, can you cut his mic off?)
See how we got 'em buggin'
Cause they can't believe what we have in the making
Shit so historic, got me goin' for it while I bang the nation
And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon

Bitch, you still cooking this pork in this house?
Stop cooking that damn pork in this house
The hell going on in here?

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

These rap niggas is bitches, nothing but suckers to me
Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me
Your weak product is nothing to me
I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis
Yep, I get buck in the studio like I'm Evil Dee
Pulling strings like the Muppet movie
Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi
Who's the hottest regardless of who's flaming?
We ain't talkin' 'bout the best until you mention my name
Who're you kidding? The truest spitting
I'll break you like a mirror so it's clearer
That we don't believe in superstition
These new additions need supervision
Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me
What are you stupid? Listen
I've been official, it's been official, I'm too consistent
I make a claim cause I'm too official for euphemisms
Staying in the cut like a new incision
I'll put you on your ass like True Religion
So give it up for the truest living

Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor

First, I'm sayin Hi, then I'm wavin Bye-bye
We get in, we get in
Girl, you're so fly, you're so fly

Yo, these swallows is horny as Charlie Parker
Be cutting em cause I'm studying these birds like ornithology
Follow em when they tweeting, holler instead of speaking
Give it a name, she played the wicked games every weekend
Broke up with a dude for almost ending her life
Came over for the closure, ended up spending the night
Got cozy in this apartment, wine bottles started popping
Put scratches up on his back, they questioning where he got them
Forgot it was her, she Freddy, her fingers was like machetes
The fucking was so steady, she shredded him like confetti
Confronted him 'bout every single chick, shes like ""enough already,""
I need to be with someone else, this stuff is so petty
She was reacting to things he did in the past
This nigga was no saint, he couldn’t say no to ass
Her behavior so rash, she gave up all her power
He put her out on the street, nowhere to live, nowhere to shower
How she gonna make it through the night?
How she's so accepting of her station in life?

She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Her fate is sealed cause she dependent on a man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still?
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
How she running the streets but still standing still?
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel

Battery in the back, popping up with the coppertop
Popular with the ass of the Hottentot
Niggas whooping and hollering at Andromeda when she passing the barber shop
Only job that's an option McDonalds or telemarketer
Hard for her making ends come together, this ain't the Beatles
She needing some anesthesia like she going under needles
She doing so much cutting, its a wonder she bleeding
The money was so seductive, no wonder she ain't leaving
First time she felt like a woman was when a dude screamed
""Nice ass!"" out the car window driving past
Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream
They call her Rocky cause her makeup is like a mask
 scars permanently lodged on her frontal lobe
Behind bars for credit card schemes she pulled a month ago
First she getting high, now we waving bye-bye
She's waiting out her station just the same
As she's waiting at the station late at night for a train that never came",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-hamster-wheel-lyrics

Deliver us, deliver us (Yeah)
Deliver us, deliver us (What? Yeah)

And what the people say? We wanna live it up
And what the people want? Please deliver us
And what the people need? Hey...
I got that, yeah

I call these rappers baby seals, cause they club you to death
I could call 'em Navy SEALs, cause they government feds
What become of the vets? They drugged up, they fucked up, they in debt
There ain't no love and no respect, it's like a gang it's like a club or a set
Hip-Hop's the new WWF
What do you rap or do you wrestle? Niggas love to forget
We got til it's gone, you think you on, you still hustlin backwards
Your topical norm a tropical storm, it's a fuckin disaster
Back to the topic we on, it all started at Rawkus
They couldn't find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts
Is he a backpacker? Is he a mad rapper?
An entertainer? or the author of the last chapter?
We living in these times of love and cholera
Synonymous with the apocalypse, look up the clouds is ominous
We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists, shit
We still waitin for the Congress to acknowledge this!
 & (singers in the background)
What the people want? Please deliver us
We wanna live it up, please deliver us
Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel
I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us
I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us
Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow

You ain't promised tomorrow, so get your paper up
You can't always just borrow and asks for favors bruh
Stand on your own two, never covet thy neighbor's stuff
Karma's a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin bruh
I start a conversation based on general observation
Hip-Hop is not a nation, take it to population
Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan
Awaitin trial debatin how the hell I got placed in this system
Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination?
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation; this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow it'll leave you scarred tomorrow
Keep it honest our motto, these niggas keep it bottled
I'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus D'Amato
DJs stickin to vinyl like ""Fuck Serato""
Suppliers who ride around the block, in the custom autos
Ballin like the struck the lotto you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it reeich with the stitch and greedy geniuses
I'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game, treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes, cause they snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth
You can't trust a soul in the biz, so be careful who you eatin with
And sleepin with and also who you chiefin with
You never know they might've added in secret ingredients

What the people want? Please deliver us
We wanna live it up, please deliver us
Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel
I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us
I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us
Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow

Freedom's a road that's seldom traveled, watch hell unravel
Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle
The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water
And not take the hand of every man who make a offer
To black kids wishin they white kids, when they close they eyelids
Like, ""I bet they neighborhood ain't like this""
White kids wishin they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers
It's all backwards it's identity crisis
The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us
Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin, makin narcotics outta household products
We ain't workin out 'til we exorcise the demons that's inside us
Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves
Enough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves
It's officially nigga season, these niggas is bleedin
That's why I'm spittin freedom we had enough of trigger squeezin

What the people want? Please deliver us
We wanna live it up, please deliver us

I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us
Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow

In these tryin days and times
All I need is to be free
I can't do it on my own
Lord can you deliver me?
There are trials still to come
It's salvation that I need
So I'm reachin to the sky

To survive is only half the battle, we won't lose it

I understand sometimes, the world is type cloudy
But like a plane that's over the game, we fly out it
Determination, dedication til the end
I'm there every step of the way, until we win
Cause I believe in prayer, in God Almighty
Get them burdens off your shoulder, send them to the highest
But we can beat it, overcome the lows
Being positive is key, you believe and it shows
I spread awareness, be mindful of your health
Be here for one another so you never by yourself
One step at a time, one time for the cause

Life's beautiful (life is beautiful)
Pick yourself back on up
Life's beautiful (life is so beautiful)

This the highway of life, we stay driven
Then at some point, you arrive at a decision
To fly high, we weather any condition
We doing more than surviving because we living
The music feel good -- yes sir, it'll satisfy you
Like a meal would, real good when it's going down
It's the flavor that you savor when you wait
It tastes great -- compliments to the chef, he got taste
Clean your plate, clear the music in front of a glass of water
Taking stale pictures, see the crystals forming
The horns make me feel victorious, the keys make me feel glorious
The drums make me feel like a warrior
The track feel big, Notorious
Do it for the people feeling trapped in the corridor
Nobody know what you're going through in a day
But don't let yesterday ruin today
And they say..


They say it's all for the money, but I don't wan' believe it
I'm a man of my word, so whatever you been hearing
Is the truth -- flatline, polygraph, that's me
We could all use a break -- spare of Apache
Catch me crossing items off my bucket list
Cause life is good as you want it to get
I paint a different portrait with any color I find
The canvas is the world and the brush is my mind
I don't mind stepping out my comfort zone
I think the greatest fear is the one of the unknown
If you afraid of living and you afraid of death
Then I'm afraid you'll never take a step to the left
Or the right direction
Tonight's confession -- I used to be scared of my own reflection
And what would really happen if I fought that vision
But the matter all along -- if it's not good, it's gone",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-beautiful-lyrics

But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome

You can feel it right here yea

And fucking with life a fraction
Covered in Max Factor, hustling ass-backwards
As sure as Hi-Tek look like Richard from Last Dragon
Your focus on bogus rappers got you caught up in distraction
Distraction. Who fucking who? Who cares? That's distraction
You wish it was you, don't you -- why you asking?
Try to break the law of attraction
Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your blood and you believe in the immortals
We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder
See the water drawing away from the shore
This ain't no ordinary storm
We killing for a humanitarian cause
But have yet to show up in Darfur
The Arab Spring is what it's called
But it's looking at the pride before the fall
They say it ain't about the spoils of war
But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost
Steal the land from the Native American and call the missiles Tomahawks
Make him a mascot, dress up like him for sport
As a final assault to his beautiful culture
Scavengers, feasting on the dead like a vulture
Snacking; how you keeping up with my rapping?
You barely keeping up with Kardashians
You caught up in distraction
It's the living proof -- you try to make the truth elastic as Mr. Fantastic
We recycling these rappers
Truthfully, these niggas is plastic
Coming through the front door blasting
I ain't talking bout them e-mails
That you always send to the masses
That somehow end up in my trash bin
My niggas got the aim of sharpshooters and the hearts of assassins
All this war, all this life, all this passion
The game is distraction
Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin
Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in
Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters
My deep cuts way above your minor infractions
Talk to rappers like children cause that's how they acting
They holding their hands like minors in traffic
The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo
Have a deep-seeded fear of change
For them it's strange -- they wanna go
Back to the 50's, they asking for a return
But them days is much blacker, for lack of a better term
We adapted to the times, but this culture we had to learn
Came about as natural as a perm on a pachyderm
These fascists have had their turn
We packing them German burners, them Lugers
The next shooters waiting for Superman, they get nothing but Lex Luthor
America's nightmare, vivid as Fred Kruger
Our heroes are dead to us
Spirit that bled through us
Endear us with the spirit so the flow is so foolish
What you hearing is precision
The people so thirsty, what they seeing is mirages
But this passion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages
Coming through like Collossus
Exposing the false prophet
Taught how to do the knowledge so I'm never off-topic
A lie is like a potion
First it gets you open
Then you swallow whole straight for the truth
Fuck the chaser, skip religion and the politics
And head straight to the compassion
Everything else is a distraction",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-distraction-occupy-wall-street-freestyle-lyrics
Around My Way,The Beautiful Struggle,2004.0,"Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way...

People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a Christian
I ain't a Muslim, ain't a Jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, 
my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
When niggas ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend


These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-around-my-way-lyrics
Friends & Family,Gutter Rainbows,2011,"You are now witnessing the demise of the music business
I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what I'm saying?
I can't do music with people I'm uncomfortable with
You know what I'm saying?
I can't be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I don't like you
So with that said, shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
That's my Blacksmith family, you dig?

I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah, those was the salad days, my career's appetizer
The main course a casserole, a jambalaya
Of different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers' tutelage
Paying for college, not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this was
Hard to tell my parents -- sat them down, tried to get through to them
Started flowing daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubix and Juju on Flatbush, my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus -- what's up, Jarret and Brian Blackshaw?
And Matt Fingaz; Kendra Ross, you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back, sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with Hi-Tek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots, they played so well
Writing rhymes with Myka 9
Me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in common
Mystik Journeymen introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus, Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Ain't no mountain high enough for him, he never stopped climbing
That's why when the homies win, I never stop smiling
See I'm smiling right now

Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt, that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey, it's just the God in me
Friends and family, yup, they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family, that's right, and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up, it's like you all my fam
Friends and family, like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin, thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family

It started with a blast, now I'm a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself, but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl, your mother never far away
This is for Eque, this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
HeadCquarterz and Guru is love forever y'all
Make it plain cause its too strong for a metaphor or simile
Your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Til the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad -- you could have done worse
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts

Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt, that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey, it's just the God in me
Friends and family, yup, they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family, that's right, and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up, it's like you all my fam
Friends and family, like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin, thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family

First record was with Mood back in '96
In fact, it was pretty fresh, Google that, find that shit
It sound good; I was showing you what timeless is
You couldn't catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me, every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and ""Manifesto""
So much wack rap, I know its hard to tell the difference
But when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
I'm resurrected but I'm no savior
I know the game, I can ball a little bit -- I'm an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered
We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
To snap back like the jaws of gators",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-friends-and-family-lyrics

Wooaahh! yeah
On top of the world
Yeah, that's how my seeds got me feeling' right now
On top of the world
Yeah, you ever felt like you could do anything (Yeah)
On top of the world
Amani Fela, Diani Eshe, I'mma hold y'all down for real (Gotcha!)

It was 1996, 4th of July, looking off in the sky
Dealing with thoughts inside, when something caught my eye
It was a silhouette of a beautiful woman, bright with life
Carrying my first seed, looking like she gone bear fruit tonight
We at the African street festival, and she walking around
Talking about the midwife said, that bring the baby down
I'm about to be a father, the sights and sounds, seem brighter around me
And for starters, I know I'mma work harder, word
We got home at three in the morning, I was beat
Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep
3:05, like every five minutes, then the water broke
We aught to go, yelling at the cabbie, cause he's sort of slow
You know them hospitals all trying to get paid, no questions
Here come the doctor's with they drugs, trying to do c-sections
But my baby stay's strong, in labor for yay long
Eight-pound baby boy, to carry my name on, joy!
 + (Talib Kweli)
Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel
My baby girl

June 10th, 1999, I been on the grind
Since the birth of my son, it's been about, way more then rhymes
Baby on the way, my lady glowing today, at least
That's what the midwife said, on the phone
Anyway, the music got me going away
Like everyday, but it's a blessing, so I gotta have patience
And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation
So it's all good, this time well have the baby in a house
I went the hospital route, I know what they all about (Never again)
So I'm out on tour, in Baltimore
Get the call around four, when the water hit the floor (Damn!)
I gotta rock my show, but I gotta go
Got second thoughts about her not going, to the hospital
I left the show early, Mos held me down, good looking (No doubt)
Call the car service, like, take me straight to Brooklyn (Uh huh)
Got the news in the car, stayed sorta calm
But I cried tears of joy, when they put my daughter in my arms, how precious!
 + (Talib Kweli)
Huh, huh
Said I know how you feel, uh, said I know how you feel when you
(My precious joy)
Said I know how you feel, uh, Kwe I know how you feel
(I know you do, huh, my precious joy y'all)
Huh, uh, said I know how you feel (yeah), said I know how you feel
(My precious joy)
Huh, man I know how you feel (yeah), said I know how you feel

I do it for the seeds y'all, in they formative years when they need y'all
We gotta believe, in what we conceive y'all, it's deep y'all
I give them the truth, so they approach the situation, with ammunition
I keep nothing away, they hear everything, cause they know how to listen
Teach them the game, so they know they position, so they can grow
And make decisions, that change the world, and break old tradition
They put kids in jail, for a life they ain't even get to start
That's murder too, and it's breaking my heart, it's breaking our nation apart
We gave the youth all the anger, it's just
We ain't taught them, how to express it, and so it's dangerous
You can't talk to them
Unless your language is relating to what they going through
So busy ignoring them, you can't see what they showing you
And you wonder, why we called baby-daddy's and baby-momma's
When we grow up, we can't act like adult mothers and fathers, yo
I'm so blessed to have a boy and a girl, everyday they bring joy to my world
 + (Talib Kweli)
Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel

Brother Kwe', I know how you feel, Brother Kwe', I know how you feel

Kweli, I know how you feel, say bro' I know how you feel

Huh, if you know how the people feel, let me really know how you... yo

Je Dois Partir,Le gang des antillais (Bande originale),2016.0,"Oh yeah
That’s the universal language right there
The have nots, vs the have

Growing up, sure was tough
When the money, getting to slowing up
A promise is hard as trying to do to knowledge
When you don’t know enough
Poor enough to notice
But you pour it up, and you throw it up
They say that when they comin'
But we ain't runnin', nobody as cold as us
My life is like a play
But I don’t grace stages
Try to feed my family, but it’s hard on these slave wages
Lucifer behind me, crucify me like a god suh
They never want to pay us, but immigrants get the job done
Job one is self-preservation
I gotta stay healthy
The system always favors the riches, make sure they stay wealthy
How they gon' stop it, if education for profit
The prophets make revelations
The gangsters go in your pockets
I’m stocking up on these favors, cause vagrancy never fly
They value people for they paper
Like animals for they hides
And the battle cry, is that there’s value in our lives
Spirituality over money is where our power lies

Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moi

The attitude they employ say it all
It’s just aristocratic
Fascist police’ll murder people who give em static
They’ll make a cheap version of smack
And sell that shit to addicts
Systematic or incidental that shit is just as tragic
I’m just emphatically and dramatically overwhelmed fam
No job, no money, no safety net, no health plan
No car, no home, no food on the table
No way to provide for my people
Though I’m willing and able to
To pry off government assistance
Cause a feeling’ll enable you
Where pride ain't practical when you lacking that capital
Holes in my clothes, this was never a fashion show
Too broke for the sour roll
But that don’t matter though
Talk is cheap, I had enough of the back and forth
I’m on the verge, snapping out
Trying to laugh it off
I love to work for myself
‘Cause it sucks when you have a boss
But I least I have a job, no one is promised to have it all
I’m in the rat race; pick up the phone when the cattle call
Spitting these tree songs, keep calm like Adderall

Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir

Soon the New Day,Eardrum,2007.0,"And nature's game once more begins

Here we go like, yes yes ya'll
To the beat ya'll
Ain't no sleep ya'll
To the break of dawn
Five o'clock in the morning
We keep rockin' on
The workin' people runnin' like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn 'em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get 'er done
That 'ole hit 'n run
Turn 'em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Ain't nothin' like wakin' up with a stranger in your bed, nope

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn

Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Claude McKay
You have a ball today
It's all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown
Found under the make-up
I asked her, what's your passion
Answered, what's the paper
She sleepin' and they don't want her to wake up
Maybe then she'll realize her own beauty
Baby, you a star and not just a star on some dude's home movies

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn

Steppin' out, I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
I'm slippin' in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree, now we hang behind the rope, we V.I.P
We do it B.I.G
Ain't no need to see I.D
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the sky's fallin
Like you Chicken Little, come on

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one

Write at Home,Radio Silence,2017.0,"Peace, peace, everything we do is a creation
In complete harmony, our creation becomes art
Everything we've ever invented stems from the human imagination
Everything we've ever invented or created
That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
Science and the empirical man, philosophy and the thinker
Religion and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything with a trace of decay is human error
Forgivable human error the curse
From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
Necessary evil so to speak, or we'd have figured it out by now
Striving for perfection is a result of genius
Find peace, share your genius
See I can't see my own face without a reflection
Whether it be your reaction to my expression, a mirror or water
I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
Through this understanding, I know that all things are one
According to science, everything is a wave of energy
A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
Which my mind then depicts as images, same goes for smell and touch
Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
Time and space disappear, I'm simply doing
Yesterday, tomorrow, here, there, poof!
It is always now, all is energy
Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
Technically I'm only a vessel channeling those thoughts
My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
I believe we all function with the same foundation
Energy, which is everything
Everything is one big ocean of energy
Everything is within you, everything is you
The identity of me is but a series of memories
In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
Remember it is always now
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
In other words, energy can neither be created or destroyed
Energy only transforms
We are thus forever, and death is but a blink
So I ask why hurt? Why kill? Why hate? Why fear? Why war?
Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself?
Can the state of the world change?
Can the state of the world change?
If energy only seems to transform then why not?
It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
In the same fashion as electrons do
Around the nucleus which form the cells, which form us
Ah yes, all is one, and my friends, it is beautiful
Let us unify our heart, now feel your power and I thank you
Peace and forever


Yeah, uh
Snap ya fingers, do ya step
Ayyy, where we at with it?
Where you at? Uh, uh
What era is this, man?

The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
Delivered hand to hand like we slangin' the mixtapes
You tryin' to describe us, you might as well get it straight
We the content creators, we greater than clickbait
The passion for the culture, the vultures they try to kill it
It's a war for your spirit, the lyrics is here to heal us
We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
While I get my energy from the sun, all things are one
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue
My color is my penalty mentally on the run
Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun, huh
Releasing blockages I ain't stoppin' until they gone
Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
Until I realized I can change what's going on (let's go!)
To every single place I go I'm right at home
I'm right at home (let's go!)
Waiting for that day to come, huh
Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
Get my energy from the sun
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongues",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-write-at-home-lyrics
High Life,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"This the high life
Call it my life

This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people I think we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it’s a grudge submerged
But I just surf

I’m renting the universe
But the stars don’t fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker

Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor, designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm on path
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? You don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride - inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and pape'
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don’t one quote and the hate just integrates

They feel us like shade, you know we’re feeling great
Not a script that is writ', this is how originals spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we interpolate
Them others be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it

Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I’m putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I’m loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
""Love will fix it"" said Ashford and Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark

Yeah, so in my idle space, they're funny like them bridal maids
Booking like we’re playing spades, yeah, we always make the grade
FSC to get a fade, Valencia then to the Haight
Sucka free I’m in my space, say I’m hella steezy, yeah (yee)
Believe I get a so in, streaking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores, bike parking
Fly chick's sparking
Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, shawty’s gon' be speaking it
Oh, they so uniquely spit

The great debater, the saviour, the caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator
News junky I’m debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I’m bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they're spinning it like a sufi
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they’re acting up I'm directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention
This is the high life

High life, high life
High life, high life
Cause we be living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Yes, I’m living in the high life, high life

But I'm a monster when I hafta smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my 'hands solo' and I don't need Chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis yo

Followers in the herd running over the cliff
I'm the ""Buffalo Soldier"", smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowing the spliff, loading a clip to spit high

How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on
That don't take heart, slave nigga play ya part
I'd rather jump over board nigga, face the sharks
We stay doing it, later for the conversation
Hammers is cocked and waiting, niggas is not debating
We ain't got the patience. You found popping shit
Come in to town just to run you down like poppa ditch
And dig a proper ditch, you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my House, you ain't no real Representative
I make it happen, you ain't official, you tentative
Niggas is sensitive, see how they catching feelings

You a artist from the street, I'll give you the blood to paint it with
So yeah I'm positive, I'm positive I'm the best
Spit bullets to split ya vest and deposit them in ya chest
Dark is the flesh on my bones, calling Brooklyn home
Hang up on niggas like 'I want you to meet my nigga tone, word
Leave me alone like Michael Jackson

Waiting to see what happens
You see me out, know that my crew is flawless

Hell,Def Poetry Jam,UnKnown,"Every Sunday waking up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, then what's the word of the reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine
Wait, or it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n trying to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian
Or that Christianity was made law by politicians
And who was King James? And why did he think that it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground, Heaven is in the sky
They say that's where you go when you die, but how they know?
I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, that was a blessing not a curse
I found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians, found out from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and that's where the crazy boarheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
But when they say one's right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vain to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those that claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognize that life is full of miracles
You can see the flow is divine
I glow when I rhyme
Cause it coincide with a growing tide
Of those looking for God that know to go inside
Looking for absolution
Living in mass confusion
The gas inducing psychopath created a last solution
Based on his interpretation
Of what the words are saying
Looking for God but ended up doing the work of satan
Religion create division
Make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make up rules of faith
That you condition to and gotta follow
God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever been to any ghetto, then you know it well
Peace",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-hell-lyrics
Talk to You (Lil’ Darlin’),Quality,2002.0,"Let me holler at you

Can I talk to you?(x5)

I want you, cuz you make my heart skip the beat that I drum to
I want to be the one you run to, when pain confronts you
You're everything, sometimes I get nervous when I'm in front you
You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do
I'd practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you blackout and collapse I want to help you to come to
Notice I haven't yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
You're everything, you send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet music will start I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart we got to work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list, what I want not what I need there's a difference
These days I'm learning that words got power so I'mma be specific
Word

Can I have a talk with you?
Can I make a dream come true?
Can I be in love with you?
Cuz I would if I could

Yeah sunflower
You must live in the infinite blackness that exists when I close my eyes
I see you when I fall asleep, I see you when I dream

Lil' darlin'
Set your soul on fire (lil' darlin')
Be your one desire (lil' darlin')
Lil' darlin'
Can I talk to you? (lil' darlin')
Lil' darlin', lil' darlin'
Can I talk? (lil' darlin')
Can I talk, can I talk, can I?

Delicate Flowers,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"These times it's hard being a man. I try to explain that to my lady overtime

My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero
Being a single mom helped develop her powers
We stay up to a elegant hour talking inhaling the sour
Reaching out to God cause the Devil a coward
But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen
And now it seems like she ready to leave
We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said ""no, you're wrong
Cause you're way more than that
You need to cut the scam
You're not fooling me, this lunacy
Them excuses might be new to the birds
But they ain't new to me.""
Yo, I hate when the fit is thrown
It's like everytime I pick up the phone you bitch and moan, whoa
I'm like why you stressing for?
I'm pressing ignore, make me wanna never get involved

I need to reap these benefits
Ooh, you so sensitive
I say serve this royalty
She say I deserve your loyalty
Girls have feelings

Men lie out of fear but we front like we're not afraid
Whether arguing or not, the bills gotta get paid
We are not in 6th grade, we're fighting and people watching
On Twitter she emo-blogging, I'm boiling her hemoglobin
It lead to sobbing the arguments never move me
Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal
Libidos are like horses, it's hard to keep em stable
She believed me the way Mike believed in Fredo
But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather wrong I weather storms
She like Katrina got me looking for FEMA
Coveting my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener
But in reality it never is
I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better fish
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
They surely, surely do",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-delicate-flowers-lyrics

I feel good right? (mmm...hmmm...)
Yeah, ok, uhh..
Now what that make me talk about?
Love, love, love, love...(echoes)
Yeah, that's what the world need, ha
Yo, that's what your girl need
All right, we gon' put it down like this
I'll tell you about myself

My name is Kweli and I love to spit it homie
I rap about love and life, ladies get to know me
If you feelin' lonely, I can be your one and only
I put it out in the world, so people show me... love (echoes)
Yeah, I always get it back
This ain't no pimp game here, that's a different track
We talkin' this and that, we need to get with this
I keep it realer than most, this is our business

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, hey baby look like you need a break tonight
Let me make it right, baby won't you stay the night
I got a lot of love as you know you're my favorite right?
Hey my lady, what we gon' make tonight (our love...)
That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across the crowded room, our eyes forever meet
But without doubt and gloom, cuz we can never be
That's why I got to go, cuz you're my impossible love
You're the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now?
Got you hopin' for the glorious
Waitin' for that victorious feelin' wanted by all of us
Kneelin' and praying that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attract to someone else


Yo, Rockin' Los Angeles, House of Blues in Sunset
Performin' like an orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin' me energy
Potentially, wife material connectin' mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And a heart that gives shit, tryin' to play your boy for the her
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (love, love, love...)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Penelope",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-we-know-lyrics
Ready Set Go,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"(Verse)
I switch lanes; it's still blurry, then switch frames
Clowning these lames -- you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Braggin' about the ride that you're whipping, your soul is missing
Racing to your death or the holiest celebration
God bless our lady of holy acceleration
Cuz we speeding while we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I’m staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same chains, work in the same fields
Now we’re independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I'm blowing past the procrastinators
So fast, it's like they going backwards
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Verse)
They hate when I give 'em some straight they need chase
Half these little boys coming faster than speed racer
Pulling capers with my team best believe I’ll be seeing paper
With extraordinary gentlemen, trust me the league major
On the highway of life I’m faster than cop cars
Quicker than the tongues of the rappers that got bars
Never rattled cause we been through the battles, we got scars
This the international half of the Black Star
This is the sound that you’re missing I’m here when your ears listen
Play it loud in your whip when you're dippin your gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick.
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain’t screaming
Just whisper in their ear and we're leavin
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Bridge)
When it’s gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can’t stop it. No, you can’t stop it
Because I’m destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it’s happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
(Verse)
On your mark, get set, when I start the jet
Look how far I get, I’m not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don’t exist, it’s a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market’s flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It’s so ironic, it’s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don’t get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you’re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That’s why I’m leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it’s all about the winning, it’s never about the wait
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door

Before He Walked,Prisoner of Conscious,2013.0,"It's a brand new day
If you passionate about what you do like I'm passionate about this music
This song is for you
It's like I can't breathe
When I wake up in the morning I can't breathe
Until I listen
Feed my family
I affect the world
And y'all along for the ride

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stone
Until my partner died and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on the way
They closing in on me, it feel like any day
Music saves me, swooped in like the navy
Put a lifetime of scars all in sixteen bars
So I took the vow and made music my life
Yep, I proposed and made music my wife
And if ever need to cut a nigga music's my knife
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dyke
So if I degrade it and I hate it, even cried through it
I watch brothers prophesize about dying through it
Music gave me knowledge of self, and I'm a knowledge-ous self
Then gave me knowledge of wealth

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

Music a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the track with brutal honesty
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration guru provided me
The redefining of space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you pop up when I google monotony
Now all the people who rule and spend responsibly
Think your album is trash and it's not the voodoo economy
So you expecting the conscious and introspective views
Eat your lyrical vegetables, let me tell you what’s best for you
My music give you a message true and respect is due
But music is emotion that’s lost on the intellectuals
A tree fall in the forest is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robins and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create is sacred
It cost you nothing but I pay to make it, trust me

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I was born on the afterbeat
I'm like Robert Johnson
When you reach the crossroads
Me and the devil have to meet
I saw the same thing as Clef and Lauryn, when they saw it
Lauryn went looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
We listen to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade of death like we got a fear of living
Having a seance on stage cause the spirit risen
Stop the devilish ways with clever displays of lyricism
These songs are a natural resources of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slaves to the rhythm the masters they eat off us",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-before-he-walked-lyrics
Inner Monologue,Gravitas,2013.0,"Remember, whatever discipline you’re in, whether you’re a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer, a singer, a designer — whatever you do, you have one thing that’s unique: You have the ability to make art. Sometimes life is hard. Things go wrong — in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health. And when things get tough, this is what you should do. Make good art

This about to be the realest shit you ever heard
I lynch rappers, got them hanging on my every word
These bitch rappers be claiming they slinging heavy word
Really snitch rappers, niggas singing like every bird
Rich rappers, nah, I don't know them niggas
Niggas don't get rich rapping, they selling clothes or liquor
My flow is sicker cause I flow with vigor
I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda
Control my center
 cause I gravitate with Gravitas
This my inner monologue
Burning down your party cause our cocktails is molotov
My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd
Actually battery in my back like a copper top
Got it popping, 
started on the B-side of Body Rock
Direct to fan, I'm running my shop like my mom and pop
Modern day slavery today to be an artist, watch
They treat them like a product and try to mount like a hot 'n tot
Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot
Partying like Mardi Gras
, 
get the cream like Häagen-Dazs
Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia
I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia
Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates
Tried to start a union, but they blocked me like a Soviet
I hope they get it, I'm sick of explaining history
I'm rolling with a circle of winners, we claimin' victories
It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet
They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed
Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater
My crew stay winning, we stay innovating
Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes
They get high with you then start dry snitching like Jose Canseco
Prosecco, I'm sipping vino with a vivid hue
Haberdasher rocking Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews
Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule
That's why I had to get at you
Wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga
(Baby, just shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright, so shine your light)

We're in a transitional world right now because the nature of distribution is changing. The distribution channels that people have built over the last century or so are in flux. The print, the visual artist, the musicians... which on the one hand intimidating and on the other, immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions, the now-we're-supposed-tos  of how you get your work seen and what you do then, they're breaking down. The gatekeepers are leaving their gates. You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen. The old rules are crumbling. And nobody knows what the new rules are, so make up your own rules",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-inner-monologue-lyrics

c'est la vie
You could tell I be hell-a-free like college radio
WQHT gonna play me though
This hot shit is to fly like the cockpit
Got spit like a french kiss chicks lock lips
Coming from the deep black like the Loch Ness
Now bring apocalypse like the heart of darkness
It's like the heart of the artist become a target
Pop music is the black market
Recently we witness bizarre shit
The war hit the same time as SARS hit
Terrorists send bombs at the concert
The show must go on yo regardless
I'm just some hip-hop kid to pop shit
And get on some rock shit and start a mosh pit

Yeah
We got the beat to make the planet roooccccckkk
(Come on, Come on)
Yeah, Come on
We got the beat to make the planet rooocccckkkk

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We got the planet to rock, Kweli's standing on top
I'm like a panther when I answer to cops
And bust back before the man get a shot
And the blood on their veins run cold like the cannibal ox
And bring heat like the blood of the mammal that's hot
And keep fighting like the boy with the mechanical heart
And watch time count down on the hands of the clock
Till the hour when the pinnacle start
Wow, and go fast like the bullet that ran through the dark
The hollow tip ripped a man apart, blaow
Yo these soldiers die in petroleum wars
Think they fighting for the holliest cause
It don't matter if you Muslim, Hebrew, or you a Christian
Information is the newest religion, is a true way of living
Ain't no rule to a surpestition stop me with going through with my mission
Come on man


Come on get down, get down, get down, get down
Go ladies, go, go, go ladies, go, go
Come on all my ghetto people stand strong
We rocking on and on
One for me, now rocking with the best and is Kweli
You ain't no MC like me, 
you just a clone like KFC
Come on, B-Boys, B-Girls, we rocking the world


Don't belive niggas running the place
Man everything is dangerous nothing is safe, nigga
Think you a man with a gun in your waist
Let the cops disrespect you right in front of your face
Take it out on your girl, punch her in the face
You ain't a thug you a waste of space
Nigga get out the way, B-boys gonna rock till the break!

Lighten it up, brighten it up, yea
You want the grown step your bars up
You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
Welcome to the complete history
Of the one known as Talib Kweli

Such a blessing, I'm making the bread leven
Descendant of Terra Firma
 
I'm from the era of legend
The blind to my eyesight, too scared of the world ending
My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
Ascending without the stairs, expressing without the fears
We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
Unravelling minds, travelling through time Langoliers
Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
In the park of Washington Square, locks in my hair
Louder than the bull horns we was locking 'em there
Cops would prepare to lock us up
They was scared like tales from the dark side
Summer of the Central Park five 1989
Was the number, the year that I started rhyming
From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin'
Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
Therapy for the prison industrial complex
Provided the context for the crime with the TEC-9
At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
An internal with Puff Daddy, in front of the buffed patio
Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the 'Nati
Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates
Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte
We was standing outside the tower devouring prey, powerful
Display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
I played it like I was David, I was tackling that Goliath
Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
This life it was so enticing, my surgery so precise
I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
At the country club, lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of 
The Source
Rest in peace to Allah's sons, Shabba was liking to call you son
Cause you minor, I call you son cause you shine
What's up Alyasha
, this is OG Brooklyn shit
Not for impostors (nah), pour out a shot of vodka for them
Big L (Big L), Big Poppa (Big Poppa)
Big Pun (Big Pun), 2Pac
, what? (word)
The jungle is too savage, rap true master producing the new classic
This shit is too plastic, it's blow to  to spinal tap
I started with the Rawkus Recordings, we work the vinyl backwards
From DEF JUX to Loaded Lux, I'm the underground
King like I'm rolling with Bun, the vets know what's up
The flow is nuts it's solid, I got the golden touch
Plus my iron sheek and I got the game and the cobra clutch
This the highest caliber, do the algebra
From Yasiin Bey to Jean Grey to Pharoahe Monch
Black Thought to Common
, 
almost 20 years after the
Release of Soundbombing
 and it still sounds timeless
I'm out and on tour with the greatest, A Tribe Called Quest
And the De La's, opened for Jay Z and Nas, who else could say this?
In Vegas with Tech N9ne getting faded before the gig
Only later to hit the RIO and hop on the stage with Prince
True story, I always knew the importance of great shows
Since 1992 
I seen Ice Cube play Toads
Way cold, 
continue to pave the road for the
Kendricks and J. Coles
, continue to stake gold
From making the way for Kanye to meetings with Mr. Harry Belafonte
All started on park benches with Dante
Predicting the future, so observant I'm clairvoyant
The frame can't contain it, I'm painting a rare portrait",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-rare-portraits-lyrics

Heard the name, started changin’ the titles
Now instead of Chaka, call me Nat Turner with the burner
Freedom fighter for this revolution, fuck a wage earner
See, I be what John Wilkes Booth was to Lincoln—blam!
Sirhan Sirhan, peepin' through the curtains with my eyes on a Kennedy
Dead prez, politic, know your enemy
Keep your toast close
Because political power come from the barrel of it
We in a war, nigga—leave it or love it
Since they got us in a scope like a P.E. logo
I watch for the po-po (woop woop) and train at the dojo
Not a gun Deniro but a working class hero
Takin’ a stand, like a Panther with an M-1 Garand
Screamin', “Know your gun laws, self-defense is a must”
When we set it off I'mma be the first to bust

Yo, I'm one with my gun, I love it like my first son
It protects me and makes sure the jakes respect me
I'm one with my gun, I love it like my first son
It protects me and makes sure the jakes respect me

What do you do?
When the police kick in your door like, “Get on the floor”
Shoot you in the back ‘cause who you are and where you at's against the law
You try to protect your home with the illest arsenal possible
Learn how to heal yourself and stop fuckin’ with them hospitals
Get with brothas down for the cause, givin’ it all they got
But every brother ain't a brother (word), fuck around and get shot
By these black kings that pack Gatlings
To make a rat sing like Nat King before they start blasting (blow!)
With no accuracy, handling they beef in the public
Now an innocent child got a bag for a stomach
Property value plummet every time a shot is fired (c'mon)
People feelin’ betrayed, so they take the street to riot
Cops fire shots and try to stop the spirit, takin over the entire block
Politicians say it's time to march
But people is past that, ready to blast at whatever comin’
From the master or for office, niggas is sick of runnin’

Yeah, all my soldiers raise it up.  C'mon.  Now
(Bust ya guns)  Yeah, Kweli with dead prez.  C'mon
(Blow blow)

I'm deep in the runs
Where all that niggas give a fuck about is stackin’ funds
The black and young type that's packin’ automatic guns
If any static comes, sporadic shots'll ring out
You get caught up, you get your fucking brains blown clean out
The killers reign supreme, survival of the illest brain and scheme
For cream, you know the game in my vein
I feel the pain for all the niggas that passed away
Tryna get cash the fastest way we know how, the old fashion way
Blastin’, we actin like cock Tecs and tenements
My squad flex if any shit pop, and put an end to it
It's like hell.  This planet I'm from consist of diligent crack sale
Assisting off the backs of young black males
It's innocent, suspending in packed jails that benefit
White well-being when niggas catch hell just for being
You might as well have a life of crime
Ain't nothin’ free in this life.  I stick a nine in ya spine for mine
No time for talk ‘cause I walk when I talk
Stalkin’ sidewalks, of course, with the eyes of a hawk
Crack a quart to get away from this trife world and thought
Puffin’ Newports ‘cause life's a bitch, and it's too short
My crew sport leather, gold, camouflage, rugged denim
Deadliest venom, totin’ buckets with nothin’ in 'em
But ruckus, some ill muthafuckas for real
Straight hustlas with nothin’ but a taste for kill

I stay one with my gun, I love it like my first son
It protects me and makes sure the jakes respect me
I'm one with my gun, I love it like my first son
It protects me and makes sure the jakes respect me

Yeah, c'mon.  All my soldiers.  Brooklyn, where you at?  Florida, Cincinnati, where you at?  Africa, where you at?  Yo…",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-sharp-shooters-lyrics
Gratitude,Fuck the Money,2015,"And you will need to find your passion
. 
Many of you have already done it, many of you will later, many of you may take to your thirties or forties, but don't give up on finding it. Right, because then all you are doing is waiting for the reaper. Find your passion and follow it. And if there is anything I have learned in my life, you will not find that passion in things. And you will not find that passion in money.
 
Because the more things and the more money you have, the more you will just look around and use that as the metric — and there will always be someone with more

Who I be is the super MC, run up on a group of MCs
Rappin' all rudimentary, like stupid MD
Head of Valley girls full of jealousy
But I see through the envy
I be shootin' for the stars, never shootin' the breeze
When you chase what you want, you run past what you need
Hear the call of the Lord, start fallin' to your knees
And the families be immortal like the dew on the leaves
Yup, every rhyme got a reason
You need me like your mama need Jesus
Murder rap from the words that I rap
Treatin' rappers like celebrity news, got 'em leakin'
Malcolm said I may complain so the deep shit
Is spoon fed to you with the flow if you're peepin'
So wavy with the flow, got 'em seasick
Acquirin' miles, wanna know what's the secret
They all devil worship except the reverend
You keep makin' that excuse but remember this
You feel better 'bout your own failure
When you think success is based on Illuminati membership
Fuck the money, that's my new fuckin' attitude
This the Earth, wind and fire, this gratitude
Whether in paradise or ghetto avenues
I stay inspired by my longitude and latitude
Recordin' in the rainforest in Puerto Rico
Climbin' up the Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios
Joey made this beat in the Trump Tower
Fire like gunpowder, finna light it up cause the blunt's sour
Revolutionary People's Party
Evolutionary, we so godly
Still at the strip club with Nico
When he pull his hair back, we call him Nico Suave
We the people's champ like my top of the year tour
From K Valentine to jessica Care moore
Nico Is to fuckin' with Cory Mo
GQ, Rapsody to Hi-Lo
This the good ship , Jamla the damn squad
Colors of the color to toast in the dancehall
They call me the solution to problem I can't solve
So get off that bullshit and get on your damn job
Get on your job, nigga
Get on your job, nigga
Get on your job, nigga
Come on
We be workin' damn hard
We pullin' the damn cards like you're puttin' your hands up
We're stand up individuals
Fuck respectability, we ain't pullin' our pants up
We plugged in the lamppost, never duckin' no damn folks
We ain't bucking  like Sambo's, to fuck with our damn clothes
Hoes fascinated by the fashion statement
Yet you masqueradin' as a rap crusader
I know you a hater, player
I'm concentrated on the facts and data
That-a-way I've been my favorite
'Til there's no debatin' who's the greatest rapper
Always ready for the battle, no fear factor
RIP PH, we shed a tear after hearin' that we lost a gladiator
What a real rapper
Spittin' bars in the cypher in the hereafter
I'm in artist mode
Writer then before, I'm a writer at the core
But let me get it off on stage and I prove
That I'm tighter than a moor, invite him to the war
The truth about trust is
We motivated by the rewards, no one's above this
So by that logic we're monsters in the makin'
And seekin' justice is really self-preservation and
You don't trust what you can't see?
You don't trust what you can't touch?
Then how do you explain love?
You don't trust what you can't see?
You don't trust what you can't touch?
Then how do you explain love?

Radio Silence,Radio Silence,2017.0,"I know, we back
We home, let’s go
I know, we back
We home, let’s go!
Check it out

Born this way
The universe wasn’t formed in a day
Praise the Lord and pray
We the children of God, better learn how to walk this way
Try to walk with faith but it’s hard, what more could I say?
I feel I’m cursed so I talk this way
Gotta write what I’m livin’ in graffiti
It’s the hood hieroglyphics so I’m lookin’ for a wall to spray
You could picture me rollin’, you could picture me holdin’
You could never picture me foldin’
Refuse to beholden to your racist image of a Black man
Kiss my entire colon
Great mind, even though the legacy is stolen
It’s all for the silver and gold
You can tell you in the ghetto from the litter in the road
Man this middle-of-the-road shit really getting old
Which one is the real you? I don’t know, it’s still you
How can I tell if you under a spell? Did the fake you kill you?
Better pass the mic in the afterlife
If so, let me spit flows, good enough to offer to God as a sacrifice
Born again like I passed away, castigated for being honest
Caught bail like a castaway, cause I feel like I’m swimmin’ on an island
When I’m gettin’ introspective: that’s radio silence
When I’m fuckin’ up program directives: that’s radio violence

You were the one who wants to slow me down
I’m a criminal when you’re around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?

Born this way, woke up like this
The midpoint between science and religion
Is tryna find out what the meaning of life is
October 3rd, '75, my birth is a blessing
Ain’t no spoken word could ever describe how the flow get better
I live on the edge, I’ll send you a postcard
Fuck a phone, I got a chip on my neck that’s a close call
Turn the lights off, see how we glow in the dark
Or we growin’ apart or tryna survive the flood like we in Noah’s Ark
We battin’ down the hatchets and we set sail
Tryna get far away from inhalin’ them chemtrails
My intel says they makin’ people out of the stem cells
The gun's our sunflower seed, we love to spit shells
When them super soakers get let off, it don’t end well
""I ain't know you like to get wet, dawg"", like Denzel
They hype it up like marketers, sparklin’ like a fish scale
'Til you chasin’ a high like Captain Ahab after that big whale
It’s criminal

You were the one who wants to slow me down
I’m a criminal when you’re around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?


Born this way, Capricorn, L.A. on the day of January 15
Dr. King, his dream torn from a warm womb formed from the clay, existing
Shifting from the essence, uplifting in the presence, just drifting, gifting
Through this mortal coil, with mystic lessons from the sage
California spoiled a blessing, blissed up, my first breath in outer space
I kissed death in the face, no identity complex, it gets left in its place
I’m proud to say, no aborted torment to my rejection
Miffed, dismayed and somewhat befuddled
I struggled to hustle and come up when the blood corpuscle boils
I'm pressin' issues, it's business that's mixed with pleasure
It's plizness to play and get paid during this clone war for DNA
You should know more about the donors confessing my doula from prenatal
I'm off fire, water, elixir of liquor with soft or hardcore drugs in my system
Sicker desire to be delivered wisdom, pour black, white sexy texture of lovers
Like jungle fever, wild zebras to make this fetus, brother
The son of my father, I want to hear my one Shawki and my daughter Aja
Lecture selections in musical meters in physics, you should explore and visit more
Exquisite shores and districts, take a breather
Believe in your epic eye memory, you are descendant of natural leaders
Extended from before the Nephilim, Bethlehem, even Eden
And new testaments, Heaven-sent, energy, books, messages read them
Scriptures, look at the various sizes of giants in Egyptian pictures
Stonehenge endured the mathematics of Mayans and megalithic structures
Evidence frequencies Vedas, we're just the latest reproduction
Created out of pure star dust and made in his image but God is greatest!",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-radio-silence-lyrics

I'm born in Brooklyn like Biggie, I'm born in Brooklyn like Jordan
I'm born in Brooklyn like Tyson
, you don't live this, you just a tourist
We ride or die for them corners, 
fuck your private life they spy on us
When they catch us man it's like practice for the new tactics that they try on us
Them cops are lining them coffers, why we get shot we lying in coffins
They want my demise cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often
Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit, 
we like Shia LaBeouf so lawless
Still recognize real, real recognize real like the car I'm driving you foreign
My diamond cut so flawless, no not jewels, I'm talking 'bout songs, bitch
So if they after me like I'm Lauryn, 
I just tell the feds that I'm Moorish

Explore and discover what most fear, 
I will never wait till the brush clear
Swear I will never get stuck here, America, fuck yeah
Measure my career in dog years
, my passport got them dog ears
I set sail, travelling the world like Jesus was doing in his lost years
I might give you the pill like Morpheus
, 
I'm like the P.E. logo in the cross hairs
Standing out cause there's nothing but whores here, pimps rock crocodile like false tears
Bring it on through your force field, I'll be giving you nothing but the raw deal
What I say on display is the purest skill, I'll be giving y'all niggas what's more real
What's more real, what's more real? I got chicks fighting like floor sales
You gossiping bloggers all fail, like at the yardstick measuring your tall tales
And you on all fours you small scale, all in between the legs like a dog's tail
You are what you eat, you don't want no beef, you completely vegan like all kale

Inmates got shanks and dirty cops they got Glocks
We got tribes in Africa that listen to Pac
Fighting with brothers who pump Biggie like they live on the block


These are the tools of the trade
That we use to get paid
When we cruise on escapades
And escalades with guns to blaze
We been this ways since the younger days
Safe from the hunger pains
Pop Bang when the trouble came
Pioneers of gun slang
Supply you with them things
A little something, something
Set fire to the game

Looking for her in the day with a flashlight, that type
That's until I got my cash right, heh
You should have seen your boy last night, that's right
Acting like I was a god in the past life, this is your last try
If I don't act right, this what you said the last time
We know each other so well that we past lying
And we past crying, and we past fighting
It's like dealing with women my favorite past time
I love finding trails to path find, ain't nothing like it
When you stop calling, that was a bad sign
Remember you would blow up the batline now flatline
I was scared to fall asleep so I nap light
One eye open and my phone in my path of sight
Hoping I don't wake up to a catfight
Exposed like them hotel sheets in the black light
You let me cook like the pot was cast iron

Got the egg in the nest and it's chilling, it's left for the children
The hate is so real son
But they full of jealousy and it's killing them, they stressed in their feelings
When I tell her don't let them affect how she feels
She throw the blame right back at me, how we expect to heal?
Investigating like she be waiting for a detective shield
Better still feeling insecure about her sex appeal
She know she cute when she catching a little attitude
She know I love her when she wear her hair natural
She let me back in her life and I show my gratitude
I try to curb my habit of acting like other rappers do

Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying

She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down
Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now
She sleeping on the park benches in the playground
But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick
Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp
Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild
She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style
She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit 
He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it
She looking for love in all of the above
Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug
Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card
But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar

Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah
(How many of y'all think you can do what we do?!)
Yeah! Wait a second (One! Two! Three! C'mon!)

Dreams shattered like broken glass
Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast
You complain for the life you supposed to have
But when you try to make plans, God is known to laugh
Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin
The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying
The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush
Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush
Time's up, she's about to turn 33
Her shit started to sag, she got surgery
Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van
Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N.E.R.D. fan
Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man
She the ring leader in a clique of birds
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain


She was a small city girl with big city dreams
Niggas try to figure how to get up in them jeans
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team
Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love
Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion
Not catching the bus, but back at the station
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name
She need a ticket home if it's the right course
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-broken-glass-lyrics
Rush,Quality,2002.0,"Feel the rush

Yeah, I do this shit for real (you get Chuck D'd, ""Shut the Fuck down"")
Ain't no games being played (remember that, remember that)
It might be the career (yo)
It might be on the stage (yo)
It might be in the street (yo)
But the people come to me (why?)

They come to me for the lyrical, spiritual, raw shit I spit at you
Original, and I see collective, not individual
Visual, in the mic I'm un-fuck-wit-able
Invincible, offical nigga who they come to
For the hardcore, art of war, rhymes that I got in store
Triple-w N'kiru Center dot org
For education and culture, heads is waitin' for Mos to
Do the album with Kweli, we do it like we suppose to
Nobody come close to my crew, we wild nice
You ain't tight, your rhymes is like what a child writes
When he can't spell, you chase crumbs and get ate like Han-sel
Can't hold your mic, like your liquor, your style like an Amstel
Smack a nigga til my motherfuckin hands swell
You ain't fly and you prolly got can-cell
Y'all niggas shaky like handheld, amateur camera work
In walking this planet of earth
I'm the illest emcee and a man of my word
When I came out, niggas didn't understand it at first
I'm known to roll up my sleeves and put my hands in the dirt
We at war and I got a battle plan that can work
With the proper execution so I'm killin' the mic
You get hit like a deer standin' still in the light
I'm spillin' it like, I ain't never had a meal in my life
Feed my family with my pen, it's so real what I write

We fight, fuck, get buckwild
Kill, chill, make love, have child
Freestyle, b-boy, hit the block
Build, destroy, get it hot
Yo, I make the place go apeshit (c'mon)
Ain't no other way to say it, ain't nuttin to play with
I'm Langston Hughes' ""Dreams Deferred"" seen and heard in the flesh
Cause so many people believe the word even when it seems absurd
With keen observation I peep the game
And got blood on his hands, I can see the stains
My street slang spray like shots when heat bang out
Niggas keep my name in they mouth, I put they flame out
Where I'm from, action is first and talk is second
I'm sharp like the blade in the logo of Rawkus Records
New York's infected, niggas beefin' on the mix-tape
Got nickel bag niggas thinkin' they can fuck with big weight
Hell no, give it up, it's enough
We about to live it up, with ten of us
We ride and you live with us
Pick it up, party people, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush
You can find Kweli in the cut, with a Cohiba lit up bout to split a Dutch
Get it up, everybody, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush (whooo!)

Yeah, yeah
Quality material
Yo, check this out
Yeah, you heard it
Kweli
You don't know how to say it by now, fuck you
Broadcastin' live, from Brooklyn, New York City
Yeah, turn this shit up
It's Quality music

Flatbush to Abbey Road, who got that soul?

We ain’t going back without that chip
We ain’t coming back to the Brook without that chip
We ain’t coming back without that chip
You got next, we got forever, join the list

Fresh from the lab like I got the cure
Nothing but the pure for the world to hear
It’s like gravity cause it pulled us here
Red carpet, world premiere
Cinematic, they know the score
Instant classic, tour de force
I paid the price, I know the course
I shake the dice, I know the toss
It’s simple really but you know it’s deep
When the angel and the devil on the shoulder speak
Two voices, two choices
Prepare for war or go in peace
They don’t believe I’m touring overseas
“Nah, he don’t even rap about coca leaves”
Think globally, not locally
You ain’t woke as me, nigga go to sleep
Thank God I’m back, this ain’t hard in fact
This target practice, red beams
Standing up cause I’m man enough
And then turn her on like wet dreams
You can wet it up, you can step it up
You ain’t catching up with my jet stream
And I’m going too fast so I put ‘em up last
Why you showing yo ass? This ain’t sex scenes
They ain’t built to last, they bust quicker
Fast talking like tongue twister
These young spitters can’t fuck with us
Pardon my French like I tongue kissed her
Back in the day they used to hunt niggas
And they hung niggas for being hung niggas
Now the guns are spittin’ when the hunger hit us
These young niggas like come and get us

Flatbush to Abbey Road, who got that soul?

Waka! Waka! Waka! Flocka!
Flocka! Flocka! Flame! Hah!
Fuck that shit, this is quality trap
Y’all really thought I could hardly rap
Better watch ya front, better guard ya back
Every muh'fuckin’ bar is a heart attack
Better work out hard, watch your cardiac
Where my shawty at? Where my 40 at?
My shit a event, you shit a show
Nigga I could still get a brick for the low
Nigga I could still put dick in ya hoe
And I’d rather die rich than live po', oh
Busta Bust better give me some mo’
We gon’ hit a lick then divvy the dough
I’ma sell again one minute ago
I don’t give a fuck if you friendly or foe
I need the ring, gimme the ring
I don’t diss rappers, get in the ring
Sit in the clink before I ever sing
You see me winning, chips with my team (Brick Squad!)
Real shit you gotta deal with
Better check the torch, we still lit
""Flocka, who you wanna get a mil with?""
Niggas I ain’t used to have a meal with
I’m enlightened now, they frightened now
So excited, you like it then bite the style
They did it before, they’ll do it again
I’m a motion picture, let the movie begin
Scared to hit niggas, they’ll sue me again
Got platinum plaques, I’m a truly gem
I’m a rudeboy, roll the doobie again
Forward marching, we moving in

Hang-ups and
Insecurities they gotta go
She always nervous around me
But see this lady inside
She's ready to be my baby tonight
And ever since this lady found me
This woman think I'm dangerous
And ain't ready to put her safety aside
I try to tell her that I got her back
And no matter where we at
In our lives
I'll treat her like she my girl
I asked her ""What's wrong with dat?"" (What's wrong with dat?)
She like ""It just ain't right
There's so many more women and men in the world""
I have to admit the girl got a point (true)
Maybe my ambition's made to make me want something I just can't have
So now it's time for me to blow this joint
I still know I'm in love
I just stay focused

By your man
Asking ""Baby, won't you stay?""
He chilling with his crew
He should be building with you
He got you feeling the blues
Cause the children to glue
He willing to do
Whatever it takes
To save 'em
From a fate he can't see when he misbehaving
Brave men don't let they ladies
Raise they children theyself
You're so busy trying to save 'em
That you you're killing yourself
With the
Stress and strife
And the fights and the advice
From the ladies of the night
Who can't run they own life
Up in your air
Nothing is fair
Why do you care?
Why do you always take it there?
The crying, the tears
You ain't prepared for the jewels
That I'm trying to share
Flying there
Dying inside
Hot in the fear
The writing is clear
On the wall
For you to read the sign
Ayo the fine is the way we design
To be fine
But still ...

I get lonelier each time (I get so lonely)
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake til you come and make things right

You can tell when people wanna spend they life together
Despite the weather
They treat each other like a treasure
Can't fight forever
You got to give it up
I ain't got a lot of time
We got to live it up
I make my music like I make my love
People use it like they take they drugs
In the morning
When they waking up
This music got me out late but
I holla at you when I'm done
Don't stay up
Will love play with us?
It sting like paper cuts
Doused in alcohol
But if it's real
They ain't no greater rush
I got faith in us
It's only you who really know me
I be surrounded by people
And still feel lonely

So baby won't you stay (why won't you stay?)

Everything Man,Eardrum,2007.0,"I don't...
Remember the first time I heard Kwe-li
I don't remember what I was doing
There were no remembered witnesses to my doings
But it seems like I've known him, forever
He who has, moved through mornings and midnights
Through, deaths and dawns
To document our bones our blood our lives
Listen, listen to his exact wings
Strumming mists from clouds
Listen, listen a man always punctual with his, mouth
Listen to his, revolution of syllables
Scoping lightning from his pores
Keeping time, with his hurricane beat
Asking us to pick ourselves up and become, THUNDER

Yeah, they say you can't please everybody...
Let's go~! Yeah, ay, they ain't know what that sound like
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat
Yo, what becomes of a dream deferred
That never makes it to the world to be seen or heard
Do it breathe, do it got a heartbeat, is it alive
Do it leave, only to become a star in the sky
I believe, no scratch that I know, this ain't my full potential
Only usin' 10 percent of my mental on instrumentals
But incidentally my, energy heavenly
Can he be so ill there ain't no, pill or no remedy
The, maker of memories posess the recipe to your fate
Make no mistake there ain't no escapin your destiny
Especially when, 'til death do us part, like wedding rings
I'll be here forever, put that on e'rything

Your everything man

Your Alpha and your Omega, your beginning and your end
Your father, your brother, your lover your friend
The blood in your vein that gets spilled and, runs in the drain
That's right my flow one and the same, the joy and the pain
My name, the burner that destroy the toy and the train
All city all night I'm enjoyin the fame
I'm a hustler, I'm a gangster and a rebel with the rank of a general
In the battle between God or the Devil
I lay claim to your spirit, your religion, your belief system
I’ll do your hittin, your catching and you’re relief pitchin
This kid proficient in, every position
The man of your dreams and your nightmares commandin your vision
'Til it's quite clear like light beer, yeah I'm standin right here
I get you hot but stay cooler than the night air
I try to fit it in the same rhyme
But realize, I can't be everything to everyone at the same time

Your everything man

First time I heard him, I was in Japan
Seems like the first time I heard him was like, the Reflection, Reflection Eternal
Like when Kanye came out I guess was when I started to listen, I hate to say that but
New York native, and serious Talib fan
I came all the way from Puerto Rico just to see Talib Kweli

Demonology,Gravitas,2013.0,"I see 'em, I see 'em
You don't see 'em?
For real?
Look around, son
Look around, son

Take a trip, I got you floating on this real spit
I rock the boat so much you get nauseous and start to feel sick
Too many house niggas, I'm taking 'em on a field trip
Your fate is sealed: a life that come with a kill-switch
My wife said I've got demons I've yet to deal with
But I ain't trying to hear her though, my music is my mirror though
They like to put me on a pedestal for conscious rap
My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back
The polar opposite of too emotional
Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose
And miss the moments trying to control 'em til I'm on overload
Or hard to handle, we get dismantled and now I'm home alone
I power trip like I'm sampling Hubert Laws no more
I got honor, face my karma like a Buddhist law
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you

Demons want a pound of my flesh, it's quite accurate
It's tragic when you feel like your lawyer the devil advocate
Legal-ese ain't a language, they made it up
No wonder I'm losing blood, everybody taking a cut
Speaking in tongues, they depleting your funds, beating the drums
Of war to fry lines to your fortunate sons
You think boys point guns when they run to the sun?
A decoy, Pink Floyd, cause they're comfortably numb
Word, wrapping ourselves in denial like it's a warm blanket
Trying to go native like faces that get war painted
Pac shot in Las Vegas of all places
Fighting dark sides of the Force like he was Lord Vader
Y'all haters develop and lead the role
When they start to give 'em parts of your life and feed the trolls
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you

This feel like church, save that soul
That cry ""good God, oh me, oh my!"", I got to save them
All. Pray the Lord forever call on him
For setting the screen for evil things, then letting me ball on them
Pick and move, or you could die, nigga
Chuck and jive to stay alive, nigga
Propane flames burn your boots like strange perms
Some think ""Don't take, will"", but fuck it, you live and learn
Beware of the roots and salty looks
Voodoo they put on you, baby doll could leave you shook
Pens and needles, hoes and blokes
When it cracking, come snapping out even, kept them feelings afloat
I know, cause my folks lost souls off coast, never found
The triangle ain't just an ocean, it's on the ground
Take heed of the sign, dodging demons that find forgiveness
Young Krizzle

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels

It’s been a long time coming!
Let me try something brand new
Hey yo Ski!
We overdue, man
Come on!
Yo what we do it for?
This is for the day-trippers and the hipsters
Whores and the fashionistas
Spiritual leaders practicing all the laws of attraction
The teachers who read the passages
From the Bhagavad Gita
We bustin off Dalai Lamas and flashin' heaters (?)
With the shooting, the thugging and all the spooning
The crooning, the auto-tuning. Alas
You be tellin', peddlin' to consumers
I'm helping them to see through it
Get with this new movement
Let's move it!

Through the cold rain
I’m still standing right here
Even though it (?)

Yeah I’m a product of Reaganomics
From the blocks where they rockin' the feds like Jay Electronica
Drop and make this a lock that the crime is where the heart is
Could drop, and make us (?), that the crime is where the heart is
Where the Jesus or Muhammad regardless of where the mosque is
They hope for the Apocalypse like a self-fulfilling prophet
Tell me where do we stop it?
Do they ask you your religion before you rent an apartment?
Is the answer burning Qurans so that we can defend Islamics?
The answer's upon us with a hash tag, a trendy topic
You take away the freedoms that we brought in the game
Then you disrespect the soldiers; you ask them to die in vein
In a desert praying for rain
My music's like a drug, and they tend to take it in the vein
It ain’t for the well-behaved
The soundtrack for when you're braver, the score when you felt afraid
More than your average rapper so you sort of felt the (?)
The brain is like a cage, you a slave, and that's why they lovin' you
This is the book that Eli that start with a K-W
 x2
I do it for the trappers, other rappers
The backbackers, the crackers
The niggas, the metal-packers
The victims of ghetto factories
I do it for the families
The citizens of humanity
MCs endangered species like manatees
I do it for the future of my children
They the hope for the hopeless
When karma approaches we gon' be food for a flock of vultures
The end of the world, ain't nothin left but the cockroaches
And the freedom fighters
We freedom writers like Bob Moses
They chose us, freedom writers like (?)
For my block, my boro, my hood, my city, my state yea
My obligation to my community is so clear
Yea, we gotta save them, this opportunity so rare
We do is so big over here that it's not fair
To the punks, the bitches, the chumps, the snitches that sneak in the game

She’s My Hero,Radio Silence,2017.0,"We do it for the babies
They say falling in love the definition of going crazy
The knowledge that makes us just cherish innocence makes it impossible

There be glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors

Woo! Move, motherfucker
I like that one (
go in!

C'mon

They say karma is a bitch and when you take a life, you pay the price
But if your way of life ain't been threatened and you safe at night
How you out here judgin' thinkin' you givin' people great advice
When those who should protect you disrespect you? You can't take it light
Bresha Meadows, resemble my baby girl
14 years old taking a place in this crazy world
Her and her brothers lived in fear of their father's rage
He beat their mother so often, she prayed for the day she could be far away
Father's Day, an awkward occasion would daddy fall from grace
Embrace the alcohol, call mommy a whore, put her back in her place
With black eyes, broken ribs, slashin' her weight
No speculation, just the facts of the case
Stated, allegedly wavin' a gun in her face
After all that he came back, and was great, right, right?
Tired of hearin' mommy scream ""Put the gun away""
She knew that when she got the courage she would run away
But what about her brothers? She couldn't leave her mother
They told the cops but all that did was make him treat 'em rougher
So what was she to do? She did what she was told to do
Exposure to violence increased the amount of violence that you open to
Why bother when the system support her father?
Gradually her thoughts got darker
Do you kill yourself or kill the monster that's making you suicidal?
Decision's too heavy for the mind of a child

There'll be glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
(Yeah) 
Woo! Move, motherfucker
Yeah, I like that one (
go in!
)
Let's go

They say karma is a bitch and when you take a life, you pay the price
We shootin' in these moments to confuse your violence with a way of life
The funnel us from schools to the prisons, it's like they made a pipe
The conclusion that we reach is that the solution is that we take the fight
To you, Bresha Meadows, took matters in her own hands
14 years old with more courage than a grown man
Grabbed the gun that he threatened to whip
Crept in the bedroom, put the bullet in his brain while he slept
It left his daughter with post-traumatic stress disorder
She the phoenix out the flames, it's metamorphosis
Survivin' in the Meadows house was kinda like a war
He threatened to kill her mother and her brothers many times before
The justice system is profit, they shuffle us to prison
But shit is just as toxic for women to get a judge to listen
At first the family freaked out but deep down they felt relief
""Wipe the tears from your cheek, mama, you free now""
Family wearin' purple in the court room
Prosecution lookin' at the feds like make your move
Chance of beatin' this murder feel like zero
Her mama doin' interviews like ""She's my hero""
She shed no tears for her husband
Years to succumbin' to her fears have made her numb
From video games to war as we solve our problems with violence
It's how we speak, they either want your death or your silence",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-shes-my-hero-lyrics

It was as beautiful as Hawaiian beaches
Usually it's the students to be the truest teachers

So gorgeous, this the magic hour, yeah
Start of a new day, it's a new way
Get with the new way

Uh, back to the future like a delorean
Documenting the struggle I'm huddling with historians
Making a way back to Brooklyn like we the warriors
Told you this man's story bordering on vainglorious
Heading to Cali for an education of Sonny Carson
And the need to police resurrection of Johnnie Cochran
Never accepted the rejection cause failure never an option
That's the gospel like Mahalia, I'm a legend, I've been a problem nigga
They still asleep in this dormez-vous like Frere Jacques
Pardon my french like Remy Martin and Henny bottles
The chances of survival more shallow than winning lotto
The liquor that they swallow got them rattled, plenty Benny Blanco bravado
Look at 'em fronting for these models
La mujeres mulattos on the floor with the wobble wobble
Sipping moscato while selling themselves for follows
This shit is intense like a Pentecostal revival
I'm in these streets like potholes, where the guns make Illinois to Chicago
Bap bap bap like staccato
I spit it like I just finished gargling the velocity marvelous
Get your goggles, we hit it at full throttle
I'm praying for a better tomorrow, my candle is burning slow as cubanos
I'm seeing red like Ricky Ricardo
They tried to stop my product like an embargo, but see they wallow in their sorrows
So they promises is empty and hollow, mahalo
Uh, live my life in the sunshine
Bust rhymes, beautiful as the sunrise
Plus side but the orchestra like I'm Sun Ra
Got with Alchemist like a wonder twin then we combine
The face of God got the finest features
And she listening if you tryna reach her
High Valyrian rap, looking for my Khaleesi
The ones that Ebro call minor league is the real fire breathers
Now let me teach you how to train your dragon
First rule they can't be tamed cause they ain't gon' have it

Help is coming but it's scary as hell but very well
Here went the fairy tale
Now Cinderella want a fella who is not so ghetto
So she follow breadcrumbs like Hansel and Gretel
Hello, that'll make her drop her underwear
Dough longer than Rapunzel hair
Everyone stare when she walk in, she like (
""What you want?""

Yo, I'm not gonna front, I'll be blunt
I'll make that ass bump, I know that's (
What they want

I don't wanna spend my time waiting for you, waiting for you

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you, waiting for you
[Verse 2: Talib Kweli & 
Outasight
]
I made you a star, your light was shining and so bright
So bright that it dwarfed the chicks like Snow White
So nice, got down with the team and now you one of us
Got me singing like Prince, you sexy motherfuck
You could be my princess bride, call you my buttercup
I love when you letting me be the man
Let me take you by the hand like Wendy in Peter Pan
If you fly by night, that's right, I'll let you make a wish
Eat you up like a favorite dish
Man I pray you not the Wicked Witch
 (
Made it through
)
A situation where I broke my promise
But now, I'm trying to be honest love (
So can you
)
Sometimes people evolve
But that involves knowing exactly (
What you want
)
And right now, I wanna compromise
By giving your partner (
What they want
)
My life is an open book
You had a chapter, but will it end happily ever after?

I don't wanna spend the night
Tryna figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time waiting for you, waiting for you
I don't wanna spend the night
Tryna figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time waiting for you, waiting for you

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you, waiting for you
[Verse 3: Talib Kweli & 
Outasight
]
Life ain't a fairy tale
Now they say sister's bitter and the brothers is grim
Time to let the story end and let another begin
I spun straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Still a hole in my soul that love won't fill in
She Sleeping Beauty cause her eyes was closed
Tried to sleep on your boy like Brian Rose
Now she wild like the coke in your nose
And I'm lying like Pinocchio
, 
gotta know when it's time to go
Gotta know when it's (
Here we are
)
We had some good times
Had some Little Red Riding Hood times but (
Once again
)
I'm the big bad wolf
Don't hit me with the sad look love (
Here I am
)
I'm still the same old me
But I don't know if we should give it (
One more chance
)
To add another chapter
Life ain't always happily ever after

I don't wanna spend the night
Tryna figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time waiting for you, waiting for you
I don't wanna spend the night
Tryna figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time waiting for you, waiting for you",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-aint-waiting-lyrics
Gutter Rainbows,Gutter Rainbows,2011.0,"Talib Kweli yeah, ay
Get with it, get with it
Here we go, here we go, c'mon, c'mon {*2X*}
Yeah; Blacksmith (Blacksmith) it's the movement
Keep it movin, keep it movin
Here we go, here we go, c'mon, c'mon {*2X*}
Yeah; Blacksmith (Blacksmith) pay attention
Gutter Rainbows, yeah

Watch me flip it like the Blacksmith logo
I shine a light through the darkness when the night is black as Yaphet Kotto
All these rappers lookin mad in photos
Saddest player braggadocio quality make up for what I lack in promo
You say you blast a fo'-fo' (nah) you don't shoot
It's more like you shot me an e-mail but forgot to attach the vocals
Call 'em a bastard like their dad a no show
I'm too fast for slowpokes, runnin on the track with Yohji Yamamoto's
This ain't fashion rap, I'm bringin the passion back
Find me where the trouble at, that's my natural habitat
(Let's go~!) I take it with me in the booth
To the livin we owe respect, to the dead we only owe the truth
So if somebody feelin disrespected
Even when his face is smilin, his heart rate escalate to violence
Look at them tremble, jugglin drugs
Using abusing beautiful strugglin, still we usually bubblin

It's the voice of the voiceless, hope for the hopeless
Spit game way too real, they don't promote it
Cause the way I approach it, from another angle
I stay in the streets and notice the gutter rainbows
It ain't no pot o' gold, it's where the product sold
It's where we lock and load, and and cop that rock then roll
So turn it up loud, and turn it up now
Turn it up loud, turn it up now

Welcome to my hood where the rainbows is in the gutters
The pain that you will discover is makin the angels shutter
There's sex in the city but we never claimed to love her
I know you heard of us, we more murderous than Cain famous brother
Living with death smokin blunts with the Grim Reaper
Snitch niggas known to blow the whistle like a gym teacher
This gum flapper, swear he a gun clapper
Nah; somethin backwards, he really a dumb rapper
He trapped on the corner with the oil spillin
Mixed with the dirt and the water collected in the gutter 'til the color's brilliant
I paint pictures so legendary; I BEEN doin this
Your history is as short as the month of February
In a leap year - what do we fear?
Dead bodies lyin on the ground, nuttin to see here
To be clear, don't ever cross me like police lines
Cause libertarians will be not invited to tea time


Now when I whip around a building it form a corner tornado
Findin nature in the city, we cover our feet in gators
Bugattis to bodegas, they sellin rotten tomatoes
Stackin chips and I don't mean potato - there go another one
Graduated from quarter waters and Butter Crunch
To tuxedo nice with a gun tucked in his cummerbund
He get it from his momma, he ain't nuttin but his mother's son
She used to get it poppin like bubblegum
Peddlin poison was often better employment
The ghetto destroyin any sense of self she was enjoyin
Survival of the fittest; by any means necessary
Got us callin drug dealers revolutionaries
You say he kill his people, he say I feed my family
And you ain't kickin in, you'll never understand me
You just stand in my way, now you an obstacle
And obstacles end up in the hospital - I'm just sayin


Hey {*8X*} turn it up now
Hey {*8X*} turn it up loud
Yeah! Ha, ha, break it down like
Woo~! Yo yo, yo yo yo-yo-yo

Phoenix,The Beautiful Mix CD,2004,"That's right bitches..
It's the beautiful mixtape
Look this shit is beautiful, it's one of the best mixtapes
You'll ever hear in your life
One of the baddest muthafuckin'
Funkiest muthafuckin' mixtapes, ever
I said it... that's right bitches Talib Kweli
You're now rockin' with the best, the best!

Yeah
When I was a young man I had stars in my eyes
You couldn't tell if it was a twinkle or if I'm starting to cry
Time is wrinkled like the hands of the elders that love us
I find a window to watch the path like ghetto grandmothers
They says eyes is the windows to ya soul
So I open the the blind to feel the breeze blowin' in from the winter chain
Surround myself with images of bravery
Cuz the soul of my people bared witness to slavery
I seen the inside of my heart it get dark
Like the flesh of my bone
And heavy like the breath of this poem
Plus, I seen lands so dry the trees cry
Tears fallin' like it's autumn the leaves die
Pre-packaged futures freeze dried, cross me by
The body count in the streets is knee high
Plus, I seen pubbles so deep the puddles speak
Ripe with stories that leap from the cluttered street
Blood'll be beet-red runnin' through the gutters cuz heat
The currency that we exchange with folks who tryin' to eat
I cried in my sleep, seen trains speedin' down the tracks of my tears
Runnin' down the face of the Earth, c'mon
I see it in the space that was the place of my birth
I play eye tag with death - she's such a flirt
That's some scary shit, I put it all in my music
Real loud makin' a scene if I seen it I use it, yeah
Beautiful strugglin' 'n' so I'm used to the bubblin'
What I be utterin' so hot it got the homeless people huddlin'
Haters mutterin' under breath, who ain't the best?
See the scavengers 'n' vultures pickin' at what's left
I rise from the ashes like a phoenix - believe it
Flow brand new like a fetus - believe it
Mean what I say if I say it, I mean it
I lived it, I breathed it, believe me, I seen it

Man I pray ya'll passionate
I swing out like a little leaguer on a Sunday ignorin' the Catholics
Rebel rap with a spine plated metal back
I never fold medal gold with a vaultin' pole
Nigga I'm better known as light let me shine on you
Mind confident rhyme dominant lines constant
Caramello color hella mellow
The fellows run up 'n' ""Hello""
Hella sorrow when I tell 'em taken ""Holla""
I got that horror vision, they say I'm masochistic
I don't think it's crazy they call me shady I'm flattered, get it?
My image is sick I'm in need of a medic
I should get a permanent residence and hospital bed it's
The way I freak shit, unique like that old rapper chick
I smack an actor in a wall 'til his back's in the brick
I rig 'em all with the mind basement 'n' trapdoors
It's me I'll clap the survivors until I see some rigor mortis
I seen the forest through the trees
But only because I cut off all the leaves
And left 'em blowin' off into the breeze
That I create whenever I speak
I'm cheap fuck it, I need to win something
Before I kick this rap bucket in
Fuck it again, fuck you if this hasn't struck you
As a genius stickin' out like a bucktooth
Uncouth, yes I know it mostly regarded as pottymouth
Dirty like the city ground you on when the shotties come out
I'm witty and plus I'm incredibly diligent
Dream of the president mac-millied I'm militant
I go along like a Philly bed I pity you
SIlly fool I know ain't nobody really feelin' you

We them breadwinning baby making, pill popping, liquor sipping, blunt smoking, gun toting, see how these niggas living
Earn, burning word for ya, curb serving
Got you hooked by the first purchase, birds chirping
Cops listening, with the gun sitting on they lap
Cuz of that, the t-shirt's on the block, like 'stop snitching'
Living by the code of the samurai
Dreams put on hold like operators standing by
What you craft with your heart or your weapon
It's a question, what you craft with, a Glock or a message in a rhyme
I teach you little savage part of a lesson and choice
Between being a gangsta and an artist, is the start of your ending
You can front like you a gangsta artist, but that ain't the smartest
Decision, niggas'll test you
Say you ain't the hardest, regardless, what you spare homey
RZA told me that the game is flipping, nobody bent for me

Haha, you already know what it is
Murda is back in the building
Division, back in the building

Free Murda, dick longer than the 
O.J. trial
Have your bitch backstage with the Colgate smile
I'm on the back Glocks where the coke ring loud
Bullets got flat tops like they stole Kane's style
Warm 'em kid, you wanna flow, drain now
Get your whole brain out, where your hoes hang out
It's killing me, everybody got cocaine nail
Stealing Free is like trying take a old stain out
Your boy's on fire, my boat stays out
It's gon' take more than a wire, to close they mouth
Got a slice of that bread, bags that you stole
You had a price on your head, now that tag's on your toe
And you know that nigga dead when the casket is closed
Off with his dreads, keep the mag' in my clothes
I'm trying, real good, the semi' got loud up
You can die in your hood, like Kenny from South Park

How many licks does it take
For me to hit the tootsie roll center of a break?
Yeah, how many hits must you make
Before a man'll get his mule and his forty ac's

Country Cousins,Eardrum,2007.0,"Down cousins.. across the border
I got cousins.. country cousins
I got cousins.. country cousins
WHOO!

Yo son, what the deal son? What's really hood son? (what's really hood?)
Word is born, shit is real, shit is real
Yo son, this block is def
Nigga need to go over here and pop off real quick
I gotta get that gwop by all means, you know what I'm sayin son

Growing up in Brooklyn, shit I thought that everybody talked this way
Raised on Rakim and Run-D.M.C., so I thought that everybody walked this way
""We fresh, we chill, we def, we ill,"" it's just some things that was taught to say
And every Saturday morning, I watched cartoons with a bowl of Frosted Flakes
Then.. the puberty came, started hitting them cuties with game and the truancy came
 (uh!)
Started cutting in not just class, I was comin all fast, I was new to the game (uh!)
Used to playin on T.V., courtesy of video music box
Plus! Knew a lot of hustlas, goin 
O.T.
, comin back with the new hip-hop
Like! E-40 holding down the yay (that yay), N.W.A. in L.A
OutKast from the A-Town, way down in Houston they play the UGK
I walk and talk kinda fast and thought of as a New York kinda rhymer (
word is born
)
But must New Yorkers got family in South and North Carolina (come on!)
L.A. is little Alabama, they walk and they talk with a country grammar
New York think everybody else sound country, so they get started, started callin 'em 'Bamas
Down south where we buy them hammers, down south where we sell them drugs
Down south where life is cheap, where they quick to fill you with them slugs

It's nothin, I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin, we stay connected by the slang we bustin
Want it simply put? You can't pin me when I spit gotta set everyone free
I'mma underground king, nigga Pimp C free
Word up to my man Bun B what?
It's nothin, I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin, we stay connected by the slang we bustin
The thing we bustin, the game we hustlin, the things we cuttin
The flame we cuppin, the lames we snuffin, your name is nothin!

Growing up in P.A.
, I knew nobody out there talked like us
Nothin but that county slang, ""What up dog? What up cuzz?""
Late night you see us guzzling 40's, menthols, wine, and weed
Sitting on the back porch, getting zooted, feeling fine indeed
Listening to Eric B. and Rakim or EPMD
Cool C and Steady B, plus that Public Enemy
Not to mention N.W.A., DJ Quik, and MC Eiht
Down south we listen to it all, we didn't discriminate
Then along came Geto Boys, Raheem, and the Royal Flush
Rap-A-Lot Records based out in Houston, represents for us
O.G. Style, The Convicts, Def IV and Too Much Trouble
Odd Squad and Ganksta NIP put it down for H-Town on the double
So I said, ""It's time to hustle,"" got down with my brother C
Put together UGK and shit the rest is history
We make hits by the dozen, put it down when they said we wasn't
Trust me it's nothin, just another day in the life of your country cousins


In Brooklyn, New York I'm down with Lord Jamar
Back in P.A.T., man we be sippin the barre
I'm down with J. from Houston and I think it should be
But when I'm out in L.A. I fuck with Ice-T
Short Dog is my O.G., we been down forever
Taught me the game, lane to lane, and keep my pimpin' together
Niggas don't understand by far back in the day
It was Mase and then my brother put me up on Black Star
Starving blacks often lose our way
Cause we isolate ourselves and give our ghetto pass away
My niggas pass away in an unreal way
They mommas depleted, I'm just tryna make sure that their kids straight
I'm on the chitlin' tour with my mic in my hand
Shittin' on these jealous niggas in the new world clan
I wouldn't trade it for nothin, only a crazy man would
I represent for the whole South, but mainly just for my hood
The pimpin's good...

I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin), down dirty 'cross the border
I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin), down dirty 'cross the border
They're my country cousins!",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-country-cousins-lyrics

Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run and there's nothin new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration

Yea, I see a place where little boys and girls
Are shells in the oceans not knowin they a pearl
No one to hold 'em while they growin
They livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world
Now, if I could help it I tell it just like it is
And I may say some things that you don't like to hear
I know this: that people lie, people kneel
People die, people heal, people steal, and people shed tears
What's real, blood spills, gun kill, the sun still—rise
Above me, trust me, it must be, morning‚time
Wake up, the stakes up
Everybody want the cake up, to break up with the crew
But when the karma come back for what you do
It's too late to make up—some excuse


I come from people who stronger than time and space
Wherever there's competition you gonna find the race
I find a place in my heart for this hip-hop
And pump blood through my vein my skin get hot
I take you very serious and make you write more
If I don't celebrate I got nothing to fight for
I'm tight raw, excite y'all like nightfall
I'm tight y'all, I walk the street like y'all
About action, talk is cheap, right y'all?
You start yappin' think about the beef you might cause
The trouble you could get into
You don't study, you not prepared and cats is testin you
What you gonna do when you gotta face
The manifestation of the words that you put in space
They already there you can't take 'em out
The studio gangsta inside you tryin' to break out


Yea, I see a place where little boys and girls
Are shells in the oceans not knowin they a pearl
No one to hold 'em while they growin
They livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world

Wack niggas get passed over so much they seem Jewish
Better leave and do it now or seem foolish
This music I bleed to it, I raise my seeds to it
I MC with the truest in the game
I stay hungry like I'm the newest in the game
And stay hot like I'm bluish with the flame

Yea

Niggas gettin caught in the trap
For the cash, it's the drugs; basketball; or the rap
There's more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
You know you best to fall back

I'm dealing with, nothing but facts, when I spit it, though
You niggas superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the pole
Candle light, flickers so bright, my silhouette can kick a sicker flow
And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
I spit the shit to make a motherfucker call it a night
I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
I play this well to win it, you go to Africa, like Dave Chappelle, you finished
Cause your prehistoric raps is boring, the number of whack rappers soaring
Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
These niggas meek, their lyrics weak, and their beats is corporate
They try snitching on records their mouths is leaking faucets
Dripping them over system than, 
Chinese water torture
Ripping a series of events, more unfortunate than Lemony Snicket


Medallions mind,
 
bless the mic for the gods
, teach the blind
Plus get a piece of mine release your minds for each design
Baby food for thought, rappers not coonin' for sport
Due to these pork eatin niggas of sort
Yo you's a fuckface, burnt out loser that's always up late
Planet Asia the revolutionary slash nut case
A witchcraft black magic, data load up computers
A spread the message wrote to you where when I show illusions
If all y'all niggas is killas then how you write your records
How'd you find the time stop lying, your minds' infected
There's only a few, and I ain't saying niggas don't put it down from you town
I'm talkin bout you
Yea the fake dude promotin propaganda
And open on some fanna, and out right, snitching on them cameras
Planet Asia, gold chain black bandanas low
Steady Gain Klick Klack rang rang, there they go


Just a high skip and a jump
Away from getting everything that I could possibly want
And prostitutes front
Get a 4 bar on the roster, scratch that
I'm talkin about a full roster of raps
Monsters that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency
Uniquely, we strong arms strategically
Easily I twist the ?? killa cali ??
Back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or
He probably with Kweli, out in BK
We make it easy for the DJ's, like instant replays
Conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch something
Straight shots of the Louis he flew me out to London
Crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
Next thing you know we kissin ya ho, without the mistletoe
Strong arm steady, agony can ???, fill the rigglies
The Big League niggas is dropping indies

Ain't even touched during making her cum

So how come then believin them is so damn hard
Could you really blame a nigga if you fucked a skate
You ain't even pay that's why you flunked the date

And your answer kept changin cause bitch you keep lyin'
Talkin bout ""he make me sick

And he only wanna fuck me when he all for that dough""

Always goin down town pullin all the stops

Knockturnal,Radio Silence,2017.0,"It's all good, do or die, man
I hear ya, before I come out and go to work and whatnot
I hear a shoot-out and whatnot (yeah right)
You know, what you hear, pop-pop-pop
Listen, and I'm like, ""Yo""
My moms'd be like, ""Yo, you ain't going out in that""
I said ""Look, yo, a brother gotta make a living""
You gotta do what you gotta do

The vampires make you fear the night
That kind of talk give them evil spirits life
She on the track like she waiting for her tears to dry
Listen real close you can hear the city cry
You hear it right?
It's like every night the city die
We the blood, we give the city life
Living the city life

The city get restless when the sun go down
The words get heated and the guns go (*pow*)
I used to joke and smile now everyone's so foul
He grab the heat before he leave out the front door now
Check the weather, what's the forecast?
Tryna make it rain, lookin' for more cash
Little man ain't got no parents, who you gon' follow
When your role models send you to the store for a cold bottle?
And you come back and see 'em in cuffs will be enough
To hate police, and define manhood as being tough
Sneakers scuffed and them toes turnt up, this shit is aggravating
It's hard to put holes in denim, this ain't a fashion statement
Yelling out ""That's my car"", so fascinated
By material gain, it's already ours in our imagination
The matri-nations of supremacy is masturbation
The master race should make you want to mash your face
And run right up in somebody gates, like ""Where the fuck the safe?""
Small, quiet dude in the back, like ""I know just the place""
He flash a toothy grin the jakes love to hate
And then he flashed the gun he had tucked in his waist
The conversations, son, I'm hearing are overbearing
Ain't no preparing for how much the hood be oversharing
(Word) The night time, always the right time
When your blood is what's flowing through the school-to-prison pipeline

The vampires make you fear the night
That kind of talk give them evil spirits life
She on the track like she waiting for her tears to dry
Listen real close you can hear the city cry
You hear it right?
It's like every night the city die
We the blood, we give the city life
Living the city life

When you ain't got a pot to piss
Everybody on the block is your competition
Police all in your pocket, you're forced to forfeit
When your espionage is corporate, that means you got an office
Instead arrested for the petty theft
Expected to apologise for every breath
A warrior stood in the face of many deaths
But since they colonized us, are there any left?
He in the streets like he ain't got a home
Writing a poem to the beat of the sobs and moans
Ran into Joan, skin chocolate as a Toblerone
Clickety-clack of stilettos on wet cobblestones
Streetlights illuminate how truly dark it is
The block is a college, you got a degree in marketing
A doctorate in swallowing, this pimping paid her scholarships
She poppin' out her tits cause they pay her to be provocative
Broke niggas tryna holla though (holla though)
But they ain't got no dollars though (dollars though)
It sound like, ""I'ma hit a lick anyday
So fuck you bitch, she don't look that good anyway""
(You don't even look good anyway) Since when is pettiness a virtue?
Cops circle the block, they went from stop and frisk to stop and merc you
Smoking dark purple in a crop circle
Fast life, this entourage is saying ""Got terfs""

The vampires make you fear the night
That kind of talk give them evil spirits life
She on the track like she waiting for her tears to dry
Listen real close you can hear the city cry
You hear it right?
It's like every night the city die
We the blood, we give the city life

Let it roll, coming in waves (wave, wave)

Yo, I love the way it feels, man, it feel good
Yeah, this track got a feel, man, it's real good
Got the ill melody but it's still hood
You know the deal
Yo, I never let up, keep it flashier than old-school get-ups
Got it crackin' like old-school leather
Reminiscent of a more wholesome era
I would ask a little girl if we could go together
Little Stevie finish, read the harmonica
Archie and Jughead, Betty and Veronica
I learned life ain't a comic though
No, put away the toys a long time ago
New name for the studio is Kweliwood
Jolly good flow, getting gnarly as the naughty would
Back and forth on the stage with Yasiin
Call our group what Garvey probably would

Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I gotta go get that paper (stay here I would)

All my language is romantic
So let in, I don't even know Spanish
All I know is I'm scorched to the Puritans
Most tyranis rapper on the whole planet
I'm the one who was never supposed to be here
Now I'm the one the haters see, let's be clear
Yeah, bet now you remember me
Give you a reminder cause you act like your memory
Lost like Dory while you off finding Nemo
Talking you a boss, you as soft as Brian Eno
Tellin' all these stories, why you lying to the people?
Why you fronting like you want it but you rhyming kinda emo?
Tryna find a needle in a haystack easier
Than tryna find a leader in the mainstream media
Never knowing where we headed
Til we're following each other off the cliff like Lemmings

Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I gotta go get that paper (stay here I would)
Let it roll, coming in waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I got to go get that paper (stay here I would)
Let it roll, coming in waves

Let it roll, get bold
Big Daddy Kane style never gonna get old
Spit flows that invented cause of skid row
Tiptoe when you enterin' the zip code
Pistols, brandish it, we never hand 'em in
Accessory to crime got 'em handling the shenanigans
And the hand God brings like the Mandarin
Ugly sense, picking Polo rugbies off the manequin
Woo, now I'm feeling like the new wave
Like I'm two days deep into my blue phase
My baby hate that I'm living out of suitcase
Like I forgot to tie the knot like the shoelace
Let me be your liberator
Get yourself together, we gon' see each other later
You could be my love or you could be another hater
Why you frontin' tryna run from all this deviant behavior like

Yeah, Whisky Boys
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)

I just wanted to say a few words about him
And you all know who he is
Talib Kweli
Please, hold your applause 'til the end
We are glad to come and hear you speak
We love it
Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this
But one time we were drivin'
Through the Mississippi Delta
And there was a brotha running up the side of the road
And he didn't have any shoes on, he didn't have a shirt on
And I started to drive right by this man; Kweli said
""Stop the car, because that brotha might be in trouble""
And I stopped the car, Kweli said to the man
He said, ""Brotha, are you okay? Do you need a ride somewhere?""
And the man looked at Kweli and said,""Shhhh, I'm escaping""
And Kweli took him by the hand and said, ""My brotha
You didn't get the memo, we have been free for some time now""
Well, I'm windin' it up
Please welcome a good friend, scholar
Ghetto philosopher, three time Nobel Peace Prize winner
First black man to pilot an air craft
The nigga that made up the Nike Swoosh
The man that made Kool Aid say, ""Oh Yeah!""

5 AM in Brooklyn,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Y’all niggas soft, b, y’all niggas soft, b, you’re spoiled
Used to be you had to go look for your hip-hop
Now it’s served to you on a silver fucking platter
Now y’all niggas overly concerned with how a nigga look
What a nigga wear, who a nigga fuck
That’s soft shit, b
What part of the game is that? Aye
But I love these niggas
I approach all my niggas with love, man
I approach all these niggas with love, man
Yeah
Why? Why?

Love never fails, fuck your fairy tales
I’m never scared, plus I do this rap shit very well
I aim to let my shit bang, turn the levels up
Party over for you niggas, time to settle up
All of a sudden y’all wanna know my opinion
But a nigga been official I’m holding down my position
Looking for the answers, ain’t no solution, there’s not a problem
They tryna turn up, my catalogue speaks volumes
When I say I’m a man of the people I really mean it
I don’t just mean the people that I agree with
Now I could probably use some tact and some proper diction
But that’s why I’m an artist, not a politician
And that’s why I’m the hardest regardless
If you think I’m a Prisoner of Conscious I illicit certain responses
To make me the poorest choice to be backed by a corporate sponsor
So I'm independent as fuck and my Company Flow gets Rawkus
Sometimes I get exhausted, there ain’t no rest for the weary
I never forfeit, I’m ill until the coffin
It’s lower than to the ground they say the lion left a pawprint
Body of work is so vast, so enormous
Y’all niggas ain’t about shit, get your mouth split
Blood dripping all out your lip, on your outfit
Talking all that loud shit, I’m thorough as you say you are
Niggas twist your words so I gotta watch what I say on blogs
These niggas leaving comments, but they scared to at me
Put in the work that I put in and then holla at me
I got love for every artist, I’m more than just a product
I’ve been a prisoner, see Mumia, I’ve been to Cuba to see Assata
Way before Mr. and Mrs. Carter went on a dinner date
I had to send the lyrics ahead of time before I hit the stage
So scrutiny is not new to me I just usually
Only respect the opinion of those suggesting unity
Love hip-hop, stop it I don’t believe you
And loving hip-hop don’t got nothing to do with either
Caught up in the gossip and rumors you not consuming
So I’m shitting on these niggas like Revenge of Montezuma
If you demand it trust the market will supply it
They complain about the music, but they never fucking buy it
I kinda get it though, we asking them to cop it
And they probably like, “Why? You waking up in a new Bugatti”
Shout to Future, this for my chicks who rocking the Scotts with the poodle
And party like Adam Scott on Hulu
Set to wake these niggas up like cock-a-doodle-doo
‘Cause my spit more ludicrous than Shaka Zulu
These pseudo-intellectual metrosexuals try to confuse you
And knock you off your schedule putting death on a pedestal
But rhyming describes the times that ricin was sent to federal buildings
By cowards capitalizing on our confusion
Now we trapped in speculation the caterpillar the butterfly
Who get blinded by the light while they stripping us of our rights
I'm not giving up on the fight or set ‘em up with the left
Then knock ‘em out with the right
I be rocking the shit for life, yeah

Going Hard,The Beautiful Struggle,2004.0,"I got a part to play, we're going hard these days
Fuck the harder way, we're doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today
I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we're doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today

You say you never scared there's kids in other countries
Making jerseys, jeans, and sneakers they could never wear
Parents never there, they're busy building homes they can't afford to buy
Cars they can't afford to drive
Working jobs that don't support their life
You busy screaming Gangsta Gangsta all that talk is trife
You already know lost the fight if you don't know the cost of life
These kids is forced to fight a war they can't outrun
Ain't got no shoes but got a gun
Now where the fuck he pulled that out from?
People ask me how we wearing diamonds
When there's little kids in Sierra Leone
Losing arms for crying while they mining
Probably an orphan who's momma died of AIDS
He built a coffin working often but he never paid
Forever slaving in the world that's forever cold
Becoming the man of the house at 11 years old
This reality rap, I get inside the mentality that...
Terrorize you like a cowardly act


I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denied history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their husbands be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Run by the river, only stoppin' to pray chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Not a name, not tradition
Religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek
Inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak
Try to run, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2004 we selling raw
Yo this ain't what I'm settling for
I want more, yo",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-going-hard-lyrics

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody who been ridin' with me so far
It's been a long journey
But they say your life's path is not about the destination, it's all about the journey
I appreciate y'all

It's my blood, sweat, tears, years of struggle, love, hate, fear
New York City, you can make it here you can make it anywhere
I came prepared for the rain, hail, sleet, snow
Whatever the weather, we ride, let my people go
To the place where knowledge is born
We walkin' in the third eye of the storm, check it out

Futuristic lyricist, straight from the renaissance
Top of the supper chain, rap's upper echelons
My people sufferin', slave to another chain
This voyage is maiden, like my mother other name
Is this your first trip to hell?
 We venture capitalists
If it's a product, then we got it for sale
When I first started to spell, my words fell into rhymes
Turned into songs, everything else fell into line
I painted pictures you could see, the people bleed in my bars
When I was a teen I was mean, about to reach for the stars
So if I fell, I fell right in the cloud, tighten the valve
Niggas is watered down, used to be no bitin' allowed
Now they gangstas, no cryin' allowed
You probably see a fight on the stage before you see a fight in the crowd
I send this out to my people facin' the storm, homey we ridin' it out
You inspire what I'm writin' about

It's my blood, sweat, tears, years of struggle, love, hate, fear

Whatever the weather, we ride, let my people go

We walk into the third eye of the storm, check it out

It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
Check it out (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Check it out (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Check it out (ha, ha, ha)
We ain't fuckin around (uh uh)

I'm not a judge, but I'm handin' out sentences
For political prisoners, and regular inmates with no visitors
Niggas in the street outside the reach of the ministers
Not those that say ""spiritual,"" but actual partitioners
Rap listeners who be openin' Black businesses
This underground shit with samples that lack clearances
Once you get past appearances, you can tell whose shit is fake
Or whose shit is based on past experience
You really been to war hand to hand like crack sales
Building man to man, they tryna kill off the black male
Females left to raise up her son, from the day he was one
Til he twenty and he raise up a gun
And get to blazin' for his place in the sun
The smoke grazin' his lung, young in his years and he facin' a ton
None of his peers wanna share the role of child care provider
But they'll hit a nigga blunt and share saliva
You ain't a rider and you hustlin' backwards
Too many equate success with imitating these crackers
So our kids lookin' up to drug dealers and rappers
We takin' all the work away from the Black actors
Revelation is first and Armageddon is after
Tsunamis and hurricanes, natural disasters
The fast food culture, speed is always a factor
Instant gratification, they want the cash faster

It's my blood, sweat, tears, years of struggle, love, hate, fear
New York City, you can make it here you can make it anywhere
I came prepared for the rain, hail, sleet, snow
Whatever the weather, we ride, let my people go

We walk into the third eye of the storm, check it out

It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the place where knowledge is born

How cats is stuck in purgatory for life
Tryin' to fight the enemy without sight
They in the dark swingin' right to left
Clingin' to the little bit of light that's left
And can't escape the room, you can't escape the tomb
You all wear a mask sometimes, I can relate to Doom
That make the whole world earthquake, shake, and move
The beat create a mood or eat your whole plate of food
You can't come close like an order of protection
That this is myself in the pack was sort of my intention
Slaughter anybody testin' my callin', my profession
Anymore questions will born 'em a lesson
A demonstration of takin' it all the way home
While you stuck at first base and
It's like havin' relations without the penetration
Basically doin' nathin'
You a waste of space and time
Always chasin' mine is how you lost your place in line

About time you heard a rhyme flow with DOOM and Kweli
To catch you with the combo, boom boom, Muhammad Ali
Versus Potsie cursin' Yahtzee at the crap table
Burstin' caps at a Nazi rap label
Oops, a pot of hot tea spilt on the cable
Evaporate an ice grill, 
read the seeds of Aesop fables
Children, come sit, gather
Face the rapid fire of the super slap shit outta liar
The end
Villain, the champ tramp
Flowin' since they had him holdin' ??? at the Kuumba camp
He cleaned his mask with a shoe mitt
And a little bit of her blue spit
She told him you so stupid
Wiped it off, got dressed and left
Everybody instigating, not just the ref

It takes heart the lyrics been replaced with the swagger
I stay sharp enough to slash your face like a dagger
The actors been replaced with the rappers
The rappers been replaced with the actors, see how they try to stay on the beat
The pig route when he's walking down the street to the beat

WOOP~! Sound of da police
What is the life of a true hip-hopper, the beats
Peace love unity livin proper with the beats
In any endeavor whatever we will prosper with our beats
Some cats are real, other are impostors with beats
We the realest, livest
The rawest, crack cocaine heroin survivors with beats
We avoided the cops, we focused on beefs
Spittin, all we saw was stacks of rhymes written, elite
Way too smart for the system of course
We know a smart, free, black man just pisses 'em off!
What they like is when we glisten and gloss
Flashin millions but still takin a loss

It's crazy and fugazi how they slaves to they release date
They try to look away, they're scared to look inside
Askin why like a guy who look for God up in the sky (that's right)
Searchin high and low, behind the do', inside the drawer
Little did he know that the beat was tryin to find a flow
Stuck in limbo, how low can you go
A punched hole through your stomach lining like Tylenol
Build all kind of rolled, metaphors and similies
That'll have you doubtin my competitor's abilities
My whole body is a spiritual facility
Where I confess after a lyrical killing spree
The illest delivery, later for the talk we need action
Silence is golden but the violence is platinum
When you rappin to the beat

Boom, bap, who's, that?
KRS-One bring the beat back
The perfect beat we seek that, knowledge of mind we speak that
We don't speak weak crap over weak tracks
MOVE, THAT; we speak boom bap live in the club
We can show and prove that

Yeah, it ain't old school or new school it's true school rap
Beat you 'til you're blue and black, true dat, it's

Better beat win again, work the street
Movin again, insert the heat
Lookin again for the perfect beat
Don't look in the book to learn to eat
Write up a hook, learn to speak
Never be shook, follow the heat
Forever they look weak
T.K. you must speak!

Teachin 'em how to eat to live
They cheap and their pimp is pleadin the fifth
Bleedin as if they goin to war
Everytime they leavin the crib
Sneakers and whips, police be peepin the strip
You see 'em walkin the beat
Hoes believin the pimps who eatin the shrimps
So John's walkin the street
Lookin for a sweet face, in each case
Tryin to get they heartbeat racin, and the dark meat be tastin
So delicious, my description so good to the beat
It's lifted right from the sounds that you hear in the hood when you sleep

Bring the beat back!
All that whackness, we don't need that
You gotta bring the beat back!
All that whack garbage, we don't need that
Bring the beat back! All that weakness we don't need that
Selector bring the beat back, bring the beat back!
Selector, listen!

Yeah, DJ Rhettmatic

Holy Moly,Eardrum,2007.0,"Yeah, as a kid growin up in Brooklyn, my pops was a DJ
He had a bunch of records - funk, jazz, rhythm and blues, soul
There was this one gospel record I liked like, like
Like holy moly, I might get some religion and leave you holy holy
Yeah, this rhyme is so fat it's roly poly
I give you intimate details so you can get to know me
These corporate rappers like ""Why this dude pickin on me?""
You rap your way to the top, but now it's gettin lonely
Kids is hungry and you lookin like a steak from Nick & Toni's
But don't nobody want your jewels, cause your shit is phony
Say word? Your shit is real? Damn, your shit is corny
My rhymes turn a new page like Mark Foley
And touch kids like when Larry Clark gave the part to Chloe
Rest in peace to Harold Hunter, the greatest from New York
Started out skatin for Zoo York
Word hangin out at The Gavin, I was very lucky
To talk to Rash' once I got past Derek Dudley
Got him on ""Respiration"", that's pre-Badu
Bet you Garnett Reid got a Matt Doo tattoo
Sometimes I feel like I'm drownin I gotta tread water
Head above the water I always remember Headquarters
Heads up, eyes open, I got my mind focused
I find hope inside a line, my rhymes define opus
Sometimes hopeless people, fill my thoughts with evil
My record so hard it broke the needle
At the Mixtape Awards niggas act like they don't give a fuck though
And disrespect the legacy of Justo
What the blood claat? No, let the blood flow
You ain't come to pay your respect, then what you come fo'?
Too many good niggas die, it's like a stop loss
Hood niggas ghetto like fried wings and hot sauce
How you hard? The cops lettin 50 shots off
Baby Jay-Z's with the knockoff Scott Storch beat
You are not Short, you are not Katt
You're not a player or a pimp, money stop that
Learn to master your speech and be eloquent
Rappers keep peddlin sweets, the beats weaker than gelatin
We used to kick up dust, now we settlin
Rest in peace to Dilla, Weldon, we can't forget you
Professor X and, Proof we miss you, word
Rest in peace to Shaka, twenty one gun salute
In the air like ""BLAKA BLAKA BLAKA""
You're still here cause you're livin through me
You're like a gift God has given to me
Uh, uh, uh, what?",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-holy-moly-lyrics
On Being Surveilled and Detained by the FBI and CIA,UnKnown,UnKnown,"When he was 
burning the flame, he said this is for the FBI
. He was maybe 
a fiery speaker
, and had 
passionate ideas
, but he was a 
calm, cool, collected person
. And so 
he’s singing about how this is for the FBI
 , but it’s just 
words
, it’s just song and words.
""A few years ago, I was listening to Stokely Carmichael speeches while I was preparing for a new record I was working on, and it was shortly after 9/11 in America. I was making a reservation on Jet Blue Airlines to fly to California. When I got to the airport, the FBI, the CIA, the TSA; they came and intercepted me, all these guys in black suits, and they took me in a back room and started questioning me about this Stokely Carmichael speech I was listening to.
They probably had 
some sort of bug or some sort of tap or something
. They were very concerned with me listening to 
this Stokely Carmichael speech from 1967
, you know, forty years ago. We have gangsta rappers who talk about shooting other people all the time, killing, but 
the FBI’s not looking for them
; 
they’re looking at me because I’m listening to this speech from forty years ago
. And it shows you the power of those words, that they resonate even to now. The FBI is still scared of this man. He doesn’t have nearly the influence over our community as he did then, but yet they still stopped me at the airport for listening to his speech...""",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-on-being-surveilled-and-detained-by-the-fbi-and-cia-annotated

I can get some chicken now, thinking couldn't when I could, son
I live above the rim and pay the full
Like my nigga what crack his ho
Niggas wish we all wish a nigga would crack a joke
Like he want to battle for the mic
This is Brooklyn, the planet
Y'all niggas is like satellites revolve around my every word
I address the crowd like Lincoln at Gettysburg
Surrounded by the heavy herb
The crowd is more or less wall to wall here's for the pure
Hip-Hop how, I'm rocking got them dropping they jaw
Fire marshall blocking the door
Does he crack like he chopping the Raw
This is the shit the cops is stopping us for
This is the rain of the tek and the motherfuckers be nuts

It's the music that you riding to
Provided to you by Kweli and Hi-Tek the livest two

I get it loose we gotta slip away the ghetto yea
More for a dollar, more fresh goods for purchase
Less liquor stores
Less churches that be looking like corner stores
More rap songs that stress purpose
With less misogyny less curses
Let's put more depth in our verses 'til they left on the surface
While we stomp through the underground
The calm don't come around
You sort of hoping for that refection, you sort of open
I'm a heathen call 'em chosen
I don't play with your emotion
Stop acting so god damn emotional
I give you these bars free like it's promotional
This ain't no marketing strategy
It had to be from the heart in order to be reality

Lover’s Peak,Gravitas,2013.0,"That's all I wanna do, baby
I mean really
I mean, I go out there, I work my whole life, baby
I put it down for you
I put it down for our kids
See, as a man I ain't got no excuse, baby
I'm the voice of the struggle
All I wanna do is write love songs about you

Love is a drug
Love is the gift, love is the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Love is so strong, take a hit, love is a drug
Love is the gift, love the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Never so strong, love is reap

Tater Tot,Gutter Rainbows,2011,"I'm just wondering what the heck is in our water supply
What the heck is in our oxygen supply
That creates a rainbow effect in sprinklers?
What is oozing out of our ground
That allows this type of effect to happen?
It's not just around our sun and our moon any more
Everywhere we look, the visible spectrum, is rainbows
This cannot be natural
We as a nation have got to ask ourselves
What the hell is going on?
What is oozing out of our ground?

The day that I enlisted
Was the result of a prior visit with Jesus Christ felt like I was lifted
Then I got injured and the hospital was like a prison
Fell out of touch with my faith I was nihilistic
They call me Cyclops, cause I was blind in one eye
I'm out the army now I'm tryin' to decide
How to properly fit in with civilians I'm used to killin'
Got me feelin' all confused, who the hero and who the villain?
Hopped in my red Camaro, shot down the street like lead in a barrel
Decked out in my veteran apparel
I drove aimlessly for miles until I saw this
Country that'd want me to kill; I took a bullet for this muh'fucker
Thousand miles later finally made a stop
Small town restaurant, God damn the waitress hot
Ordered tater tots, got her number, later that night
We was at the bar, takin' shots 'til we fell in love
I said let's go Las Vegas and do this
Knew this was the mate for my soul
Drove all night and was awakened to cold
She wanna play the slots, nicknamed her Tater Tot
Cause of how we met, ""cool I need a shower, bet""
Found a motel on the strip, I'm checkin' in
When out the blue some Mexicans came in the lobby like they 'bout to shoot
Some Asians that was runnin' down the hall with they guns brazen
Now e'rybody pullin out they shit like it's an invasion!
The Mexicans let them Asians have it; Asians had to fire back
'til they was outta bullets and the blood splattered everywhere
Deal gone bad or somebody robbin'
Either way somebody's rotten all I hear is bodies droppin'
I jump behind the front desk in the nick of time
The crook is on the floor, his blood made me slip and slide
But I'm the last man standin'
A reflex made me grab a cannon out a dyin' man's hand
Then I noticed that a car was runnin'
Sack of guns on the floor plus unmarked bills by the hundreds
Driver comin' at me gunnin'
Sirens blarin' in the distance cause the cops are comin'
I spun around and I hit the deck
Heard the bullets whiz by my ear I let off, hit him in the chest
Quicker than the bullets left the chamber
I grabbed the sack off the floor hit the door with the bangers
Lookin' for my lady at the casino, she was in the zone
I said ""We gotta go"" she like ""Why?"" and I'm like ""C'MON!""
No need to gamble baby, here the lick
Put the chips down we gotta go right now, this little shit
Now we speedin' down the I-15
First time I noticed that her eyes were green
Gave her a gun and a magazine
I made her count the loot {*count the loot baby*}
But when she saw the score she pointed the gun at me
Now she about to shoot {*blam, blam blam*}",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-tater-tot-lyrics

Yea, yea, hold it now

I gotta buzz like I’m Georgia Tech
They still cheering like I’m all that’s left
The air is toxic when you draw your breath
Resurrect the music I’m snatching it from the claws of death
The vital signs are improving I make em lay down
An idle mind is usually described as the devil’s playground
My rep established I’m rapping just for the sport of it
Been nice for a career you just barely grasping the thought of it
Indebted to the hood like a Rush card
Supported like push up bras and lumbar
Except I’m never sitting I’m ever living like Mumm-
Ra I’m the sun god
Smart as a whip, but forever ripping it dumb hard
I see you fronting with them dollar store shades on
Faker than abs that’s sprayed, artificial as rayon
My rhyming satisfying your Quest For Fire like Rae Dawn
Chong,
 
when I’m forming like Voltron
I’m young Raekwon
Mixed with a bit of KRS-ONE and Q-tip
Rakim
, some of that Ice Cube, now who’s this?
No one as gifted as this, so magnificent
Classically consistent, I’m nasty as black licorice
The coldest but I get the room hotter than bikram yoga
Seen the show you know I make the people move like an eviction notice
I’m focused I’m like Moses when the mic is on
That’s why these rappers scatter like roaches when the light is on

Hold it now
I, I, I hold it down
I’m staying where I’m at you better go around
You know the voice and you know the sound
I rip the microphone and then I throw it down",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-hold-it-now-lyrics

+The Lord Chief Rocka+ I'm colder than meatlockers
My people keep throwin it up like cheap vodka
I smack internet MC's and beat bloggers
You can see my +Black Thought+ like 'Riq Trotter
It's deep, go ahead and sleep, they know in the street
Kwe' gon flow on the beat proper composin complete operas
Longer than a cigar that's Godfather
Tappin' two heart chakras, I'm harder than Gobstoppers
People comin for the throne not knowin the seat hotter
Than fish grease, criminal names on police blotters
You convinced me, I hit targets like top shotters
Out in the mideast like Muslims takin Shahada
I'm sayin makin' a profit, a product of Reaganomics
Awake and I'm stayin conscious to radio playin garbage (yeh!)
Blacksmith Music, if you don't pay homage
I'mma show you how we break an artist
That's a threat, I'm not makin a promise
Speak to the people like Barack Obama
They worship like the black Madonna, c'mon
Niggas talk shit, but they ain't got skills
I'm the type of nigga to put lead in your grill
Number two pencil is sharper to bruise mentals, and
Beatin in my chest is the heart of a true gentleman
Still spit right in your face
Fuck a Top 8, back up, gimme my space, you're not safe

Vet vandal, niggas are brand new
Ain't knew I was bad news, look at the tattoos
Get ran through like you was fingers through Sassoon
Or a chick in the bathroom, off the backstage room
Shit you couldn't imagine, nigga I'll harass you
I'll Ras Kass you, Soul on Ice and body cast dude
Past due, Jean and Kwe' the last two action heroes
Actually had the capacity, to be the ones in a class of zeroes
Hip-hop's not dead, it was on vacation
We back, we bask in the confrontation
You can ask me, have any conversation

We not fallin' for your trick cause your image is like a gimmick
Forget it every rhyme is bitten, you like a mimic
I'm talkin' to the Lord and I'm askin' him for forgiveness
Just for kickin' niggas out the club like Michael Richards
Yeah I admit, I'm guilty, the way I spit is filthy
I keep it gritty so they get it they feel me, the flow
Is known for touchin' the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language they know I keep customers
The writin' therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin'
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin you a contact high, my name buzzin'
And I came in the game with nothin', stop frontin' nigga

The Manifesto,SpitKicker Presents: The Best of Talib Kweli,2004,"Manifesto, this is what we want to see happen
For my peoples still breakin graf writin and rappin
I rock the mic right and exact my life's my sacrifice
Take my mic and I'm like a Chinese man with no rice
Oh yeah we flippin through the pages of time, divine design
Like Vaseline on the faces of black children, we shinin
Deeper than petroleum jelly, we in the air like conversations
On celly and just appear like stretch marks on bellies
After givin birth you had to let go, you playin for life
The Manifesto, here comes the beat because I said so keep pushin
I got the cushion for the seat of your soul
Back in the day they stole our smile, so we clothe our teeth in gold
And we frontin, from nigga to kid, to Son of God
It's wild dependin on labels for man woman and child
My style just is, all that's seen and all that's heard
God gave us music so we play with our words
So when Tek be in constant meditation like a monk
While Kweli speaks in tongues to get your intellect drunk
Yo we bound to take over the 90% of your brain that you ain't usin
To us it's life or death we keep you chosin
Every shook eye ain't seen, every goodbye ain't gone
Ain't no rest for the weary yo forever it's on
The Manifesto, establishes a hip-hop order
Movin upon the face of the water, like Reflections
Aiyyo all the real MC's can meet me outside
So we can decide how we gonna change the tide
Like the moon we on the Earth takin a ride around the Sun
Now Son we only just begun, and the journey's far from done
We on mission, what your brain gone fishin like Walter Mosley?
There's an MC that can hold me, supposedly?
No one could come close to me, only, the family really know me
Hip-Hop's last hope like Obi Wan Kenobi
Through your tunnel vision I'm shinin light like a train
Comin out like earthworms when it rains, bringin it
Like the C.I.A. be bringin in crack cocaine bailin out of planes
With the George Bush connections, I push Reflection
Like I'm sellin izm, like a dealer buildin the system
Supply and the demand it's all capitalism
Niggas don't sell crack cause they like to see blacks smoke
Niggas sell crack cause they broke, my battle lyrics
Get concious minds provoked and ghetto passes revoked
Cause we surrounded by the evil, you know that the people's minds
Is feeble they believe in it, even if it don't make sense
This makin dollars shit, don't take a scholar to
See what's goin on around you, either you widdit or you ain't
Is what it comes down to, have you forgotten?
We pickin 100% designer name brand cotton
They still plottin, my Third Eye is steady watchin
Every shook eye ain't seen, every goodbye ain't gone
Ain't no rest for the weary yo forever it's on
The Manifesto, establishes a hip-hop order
Movin upon the face of the water, like Reflections
(Yeah see that's what I'm talkin about, it be the slaughter man
We need to break it down because these heads
They don't know what they talkin about
Frontin all this nonsense, yo break it down)
From open mics to solutions I got a collage of answers
And a ten point program, just like the Black Panthers
One: First respect yourself as an artist
If you don't respect yourself then your rhymes is garbage
Two: Make sure your crew is as tight as you
Cause when them niggas fallin off they gonna bring you down too
Three: Understand the meaning of MC
The power to Move the Crowd like Moses split the seas
Four: Know your shit and don't ever be blunted
If you don't know what your words mean then your rhymes mean nothin
Five: Kick facts in the raps, and curse with clarity
What's a curse when language is immersed in vulgarity
Six: We gonna fix industrial poli-tricks
Shit they made an artform out of ridin dicks
Seven: We soldiers for God needin new recruits
So if you rhymin for the loot then youse a prostitute
But Eight: Acknowledge that you need food on your plate
In order to say your grace make sure your business is straight
Nine: We buildin black minds with intelligence
And when you freestyle, keep the subject matter relevant
Ten: Every MC grab a pen
And write some concious lyrics to tell the children
I'll say it again, every MC find you a pen
And drop some concious shit for our children

Music is the air I breathe
The prayer I lead
Rippin' in the atmosphere
Up there in the breeze
Stronger then the revolution
That you wear on your sleeve

Not an idea you believe
I spit bars you can't touch
Like tits in strip bars
Get charged, man

Hit bars with my brown sugar sist-ar
The night just start, I'm waitin' ....

We all hop in the car deep
We bring Brooklyn to the city
My fellas lookin' sharp my ladies lookin' pretty
When the DJ let the needle drop
The beat'll rock, the beat'll start
Boppin' and my people got it poppin' like needle marks
3 o'clock and it's mass hysteria
I'm about to hit the cafeteria
I'm Waitin' ...

Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock (Put it down for y'all)

Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock (Put it down for y'all)
So I can show you just what I got

The club ain't the place to be findin' a queen
You all in my dream girl
Though I can't sleep on you no
You was a star tonight
Your light's showin' through
Vampires takin' a bite
I'm in the zone too
I always end up takin' the flight
Makin' a right for the fam
So tight in the jam
A fight began
Always heard bad niggas tryin' to act like a man
The DJ had the mic in his hand
Like calm down (Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock)

Yeah, it was like I was the audience at the concert
You at the converse
With the Luis Vuitton purse
Tiger's eye around the wrist
With the fly and the prints
Lookin' up your arm a blender with a tatooed gift
I had to catch a plane but you make me warm as day
I had to catch your name and I'm waitin' ...

Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock (Put it down for y'all)
So I can show you just what I got

Cuz they let me chasing (?) through the same old song
So just clap your hands together 'til they make that sound

Yeah, Hot fun in the summertime, Sly said it
Guys see the flesh catch a dyed fetish
Hunnies smellin' to sweet its like I'm diabetic
On stars and the sky in seminal, dianetic
Drop the top beat up the block
On plow, now when they smoke a tree up
As shots reach the new tunes
Dogs who lose Hollerin' at the new move
Ours, I'm like the sun, the flower in full bloom
When I come out the house we complete like the number 9
Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine
Your off the sucka rhyme
A song will sound like one of mine
I know you love it when I shine, I'm waitin' ...

Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-waitin-for-the-dj-lyrics
Echoes,Fuck the Money,2015.0,"Like that right there
It feels so African
Got a little somethin' on my chest
Gotta get it off, gotta get it off

You say the meanest fuckin' things to me
And I pretend that I don't care
But when it's said and done and the war is won
Your words are all I hear
And they echo
And they echo
And they echo
And they echo

Say what you mean, mean what you say
You the meanest girl, you my Tina Fey
Like you out for pain, like you out for shame
But you pout when I call you out your name
Your words burnin' me, you're my bird of prey
When you feed your young, you regurgitate
What I heard you say and reverberate
But I'm a man, gotta show my vertebrae
I'm the kind to wait, you can come through with
You can run to it and get numb to it
Treat you like the Autobahn, just sung to it
Treat you like my favorite song and just jump to it
Girl you waste my bluff when we makin' love
Can't take it, love, you my favorite drug
You my fleur-de-lys, you disturb the peace
Cause you hurtin' me, you turned to me and said
Love is a potion that's fluent, let's keep it movin'
The only thing that's magic is moments, I'm only human
The only thing that's tragic is futures that we can ruin
I pound for couple of hours, double influence
Need a break from the words you're usin'
My love broke my Kevin Hart
Let me explain cause I see what you're doin'
Mama said, ""You don't need to stay""
Papa said, ""Boy you need to pray"", goddamn

You say the meanest fuckin' things to me
And I pretend that I don't care
But when it's said and done and the war is won
Your words are all I hear
And they echo
And they echo
And they echo
And they echo

We can't internalize the things people say to us
But it make you sus, I need a break from us
I used to think your attitude was a major plus
Now the way you talk to me is like we breakin' up
Tryna get into my zone without you makin' a fuss
Like sticks and stones, your words breakin' stuff
They hittin' home, but I can take a punch
I'm your David Lynch, you're my naked lunch
I found space for us, found a place for us
Used to pray for love, used to pray for us
Would've gave you my blood but you gave it up
My heart a house for this love but you sprayed it up
You can't take a brush, comments is tangled up
In a web of emotion that's dangerous
I can't make this up, that shit is lame as fuck
I ain't a slave but I'm out here tryna make a buck
Stayin' on my hustle, I ride around and I spend it
Set it into motion like butterflies to defect it
Tryin' to pretend that the words are never effective
Seem to work for a second but never be worth the effort
I'm a man and they say I ain't s'posed to run on emotions
So I let you get away with more than you were supposed to
I kept it bottled up like a note to float in the ocean
Just stop myself, I'm explodin'

You say the meanest fuckin' things to me
And I pretend that I don't care
But when it's said and done and the war is won
Your words are all I hear
And they echo
And they echo
And they echo
And they echo",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-echoes-lyrics
Ocean Song,Javotti Media Presents: The Cathedral,2014,"I treat my woman like water, I play with her emotions
Got her floatin’ that’s until I get her salty like the ocean
She engrossin’, she full of mysteries and revelations
It’s ironic, sea level is the highest elevation
She be movin’ with the moon cause she move and she in tune
With the universe she bloom like bearded irises in June
She make me swoon, if you’re not careful she will suck you in
You’re piratin’ lookin’ for that booty but the treasure you discover
Is the mothership, marry for the love of it
You wonderin' why you need a licence from the government?
She the pool you jumpin’ in, your neighbours covered in the earth
Three fourths water that’s the length you wanna 
She bugging when I’m gone I’m comin’ back when I get off the tour
 but could the ocean ever divorce the shore?
I stare at her, I see the sun reflectin' cause it mirror her
I’m humble but I never feel inferior, still

Who am I to fight the ocean? The battle just begun
But the only way to win is if me and the ocean one
When I swim against the current I’m showin’ ‘em my pride
But her strength is a deterrent so I’m goin’ with the tide
I can’t fight it, no, I can’t fight it, no
I can’t fight it, no, I can’t fight it, no
I can’t fight it, no, I can’t fight it, no
I can’t fight it, no, I try to fight it

She get loud at night, way too loud to listen to me
And so I’m out at night, you know there’s other fish in the sea
Now I’m soundin’ like a stowaway, the ocean overwhelmin’
I’m so small, surprised she noticed me
Let’s go away and get a room with a spectacular view
Don’t be a basic chick, focussed on the bag and the shoes
I’m playing favourites, you labourin’ so hard that you broke the water
Got all sorts of memories and cured the remedies that you could show your daughters
Go with me so we can sow the seeds
A gem so rare that they should keep her in the booth with the Mona Lisa
My poetry lives where the sky and the ocean meet
The potency  capsizin’ 
See the ocean spray wetter than a kiss from my lover’s lips
Kiss the mothership, if God the ocean and I’m just a sip
Because of this waterless life, let’s have a baby
You so wavy, Ii’s crazy, now I’m drownin’ come and save me

 x2
No I can’t fight it
So tired it’s like 
And it’s winning when his thirst quenchin’
Don’t fight it, no
Just let it flow

Like the ocean, just let it flow
I’m the ocean, just let it flow",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-ocean-song-lyrics
No Competition,9th Wonder Presents: Jamla is the Squad,2014.0,"My nigga Khrysis be offering you some heat, yup
You other rappers I'm offering you a seat
Matter fact, take several
Park it like valet
Page is to opera to writing is ballet
If your taste is exquisite then maybe you'll make a visit
To a place where you can get, support it and make a difference
That's of course that's only if the recording remain consistent
And you make a straight line to the store, the shortest distance
To travel the globe over the rainbow, the pot of gold
My career is to the point where I've learned to enjoy the road
Taking flicks in front of famous cathedrals
Sip mojitos on the beaches of Rio with Bobbito
Mardi Gras in the streets with Phontiggalo
Stopped at Curren$y crib for some extra loud piff to blow
Hit this tree and the smoke digital
If I diss niggas no subliminals
No syllable rap
They say I'm off beat, the flow criminal
Y'all niggas just beat off but no centerfolds
Y'all niggas softer than some dinner rolls
Check
All these fake nigga been exposed

One time for your mind baby
One time for your mind
One time

I come through, geared fresher
Flow's tighter than clothes in a queer dresser
We'll have you leap from a pier, we'll call it peer pressure
You've been hoaxed tell your kinfolks
I give beats heart attacks, pen strokes, lead poison pencils
Turn anthems to lullabies and lobotomize instrumentals
You traumatized so you stop, tears stalling
Is it wrong I
Make the song cry to get the top tier falling
Doughboys say I'm swagged to death
I'm bad ass to the white kids bagging meth
I spit fire you just got the dragon breath
Your ex off the rag an F
Luckily I had a Magnum left
I pointed right where her thong at
And knocked it loose and like Dr. Seuss
I gave the cat the long hat
Shift the bed with this gift instead
Ill as pointing an infared at an infant head
That's a bad look
Like on the nights when your dad cook
Wishing he had took, culinary courses with a grad book
Fuck your sorry flows and your sad hook
I'm still glad that you mad shook

New Tiggalo, new Tiggalo, new Tiggalo
Yo, the audio controller
12 bar cardio, rap game Georgio Moroder
Tigga told ya
I soldier through the coldest winters
Now the jeans sitting right where they supposed to fit him
The battle fill ink but no beginners
Not bragging I just had to be clear
Go and grab you a chair whether she dark skin or Vanity Fair
Give me a chick rocking natural hair and red roses in 'em
And I'm an animal
Nah, I'm an onimal, oops, I mean honorable
Giving you niggas what you paid for
I lay law like Derek and the Dominos
Play your position with me? Call it an honor roll
Test me, God bless your soul
I'm bugging out call pest control
Nigga vamamos
To the west coast, eating Won Tons
With Krondon screaming ""Fuck one time for Guantanamo""
We shoulda did this shit a long time ago
Cause every single line, every rhyme I wrote
It's nothing but that scheduled two opiates
Stimulates, yeah nigga all kids of dope
I'm Langston meets Slang Ton
Don't need a track for that bottom feeder rap, you niggas is plankton
An AK to a paint gun

So Low,Gutter Rainbows,2011.0,"I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me

I always speak for the struggle my people still hurting
I'm a name brand I'm a product but still a real person
I'm still flirting with death although I'm still certain
About my commitments in life although I'm still searching
I bet I find a way if not I bet I make a path
One thats seldom traveled by the masses
I never stuck in all the traffic I cut through all the plastic
Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist
I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walking contradiction
Cause I'm breaking out of your artistic prison listen
I got my own demons what I'm supposed to do with yours
Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do It for
People I knew before celebrity swear they see the change in me
I tell em change is god you gotta let it be
How does it feel to come full circle
Still cursing still pursing my lips to pull purple but


Witness it the building of a legacy
So let us just pray cause the journey thats ahead of us
Got us facing a task that just might get the best of us
Thats why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus
No Oedipus but it's like the beat is my therapist
When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices
Of my memories what kind of treasure are you buried with
You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist
Remember this there's no one else to blame when you're solo
Establish your fan base local before you take it global
Don't be scared spend your own dough
You gotta speak up be vocal sometimes you feel so low
Ain't nowhere to go but up go with us
We just getting started why you slowing up
But know enough to know by a collective we
Even if my name is on the record sleeve I ain't into brevity
What the fuck is a celebrity",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-so-low-lyrics

They ain't got no skills son, they can't do shit

This be that, crack it must be what you're usin if you challenge me
You're sniffin on that white girl
The Valeries, the Natalies, the Mallorys
Got you sweatin like you're losin calories
Battle me? You confuse illusion with reality
Back up off me you had your glory
Man I never seen a sadder story
Blame yourself you mad at me you mad at Corey
I left the maze you still the white mice in the laboratory
Don't test the brain son, I'm quite nice at Scattergories
Metaphors and allegories speakin at your colleges
Pathologies I keep my ghetto promises, I promise this
The rhyme'll leave you bloody as.. first responders get
You hear em coming with the sirens of titans like Kurt Vonnegut
They appetite for dominance rival that of the Ottoman
Phenomenon, I'll eat you after dark like this was Ramadan
Ain't no patience for the whack emcee
This ain't WorldStar, homey this ain't Vlad TV
So stop posin for the camera, I'm showin all you amateurs
Life is a bitch, it's how you handle her
You let the chips (uh uh) drop, let 'em fall where they may
This an ""Everyday Struggle"" like Notorious say

Son {*scratched: ""YEAH!""*} c'mon son
{""YEAH!""} Yeh, yeah, I'm on one
{""YEAH!""} C'mon son
{""YEAH!""} I, I, I

I got the recipe for rest in peace
I never ran, but I'm lookin so Presidential
I still command you to arrest the chief
Rebellion is my specialty
While the mad cows convince you to invest in beef
I play this game without a referee so there ain't no official
So even Too $hort couldn't ""Blow the Whistle""
Oh yeah I flow a little! You mighta heard of me
Producers got restrainin orders.. I murder beats
State of emergency like Dudus Coke
You hate it but you love it though
We smoke and roll one up a double Dutch but I ain't jumpin rope
My gutter flow, ice cold like the love below
Bring the hood right into your bungalo
Teach you how to start, ironically bionic Lee Majors
Now you can do us a favor and stop your coonish behavior
You rude as Judas who was an intruder truly a hater
Stab your neighbor in the back, you'll do anything to be famous
Stop posin for the camera, I'm showin all you amateurs
Life is a bitch, it's how you handle her
You let the chips (uh uh) drop, let 'em fall where they may
This an ""Everyday Struggle"" like Notorious say

Son {*scratched: ""YEAH!""*} c'mon son
{""YEAH!""} Yeh, yeah, I'm on one
{""YEAH!""} C'mon son

Now where y'all at man?
This is America ain't it?
Where can I be free?
Ay, you can do what you wanna do man

Yo what the fuck happened to skills man?
Y'all, y'all ain't go no skills man

He Said She Said,Fuck the Money,2015.0,"All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care

A cautionary tale
I heard about this new artist
Somebody said he was the hardest
Seem like I gotta do the knowledge
Cause I don't go by those comments
Loving the promise of some new hot shit
And apparently this kid got it
He adored by all of them bloggers
They describe him down to his boxers
I heard last night he had problems
With some other random ass nigga
Tonight the blog is on fire
Them niggas beefing on twitter
His timeline full of depression
But his death the life of the party
They celebrating his self destruction
It make for excellent copy

All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care

The life a series of moments
And VIP he be posting
Dudes be drinking that potion
Girls all in they emotion
Thorough breads in the stable, what
Pills on his table, what
I heard he staying independent
He don't fuck with major labels
The rumors keep on swirling
Every interview is a circus
Yeah he grinding, he working
But his lack of god is disturbing
Can't wait to write about how the drugs to blame
He was numbing the pain, he was loving the fame
Plus think he going out with what's her name
With an ass so fat she won't fuck with lames

All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care

Heard your baby mama got crazy drama
Get way too violent and drunk
Couldn't make an honest woman out of her
Now he face your honor every month
Now she slandering niggas on instagram
So her followers up and her kids be down
She be giving out advice how to get a man
On the sex tape part of a business plan
Now she coming out next to plug
A new song she gets on the breakfast club
Where party promoters give extra love
All the hypebeasts saying sit next to us
I heard a bunch of these rumors
I heard it made this nigga lose it
Only thing I have yet to hear
Is any of dude music

All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-he-said-she-said-lyrics
How You Love Me,Gutter Rainbows,2011,"I hear footsteps, in the dark
Feel like I'm goin fuckin crazy

Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

When are we gonna grow up?
Why do I love you so much we so touched?
Excited by the drama we like when it show up
The fightin don't slow up, I light you like close ups
And I call you my Calamity Jane, you like my fantasy
Love cause the same chemical reaction in the brain as insanity
Holidays drinkin wit'cha family... passionate folks
Imagine if they had they own reality show - actually no
Desire's like fire; quit playin or get burned
Or give it away on camera like Montana Fishburne
Our presence is a gift, a gift is our presence
Breakup text call her a bitch under my breath
And then the makeup sex she forgive me in a session
I know she love me, she sendin a mixed message though

Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

You need a chick with some fire
I mean unless you want a wife cold as ice
Livin life with the biggest debutante
Me and you we considered the upper echelon
The only one I come out my fitted for in a restaurant
You can get it huh; remember I was takin your digits
Same night I was makin the visit
Make it the mission to make you cum
When we done sometimes you hate to admit it
You a little numb from the toys
And love the noise that you make when you run from the boys
And comfort your man, insane how we go so crazy with it
This the asylum, so we call relationships committed
You ain't a bird I ain't them others guys that get lost in the name
You the butterfly, and I'm the moth to your flame
Love is dying while the mother's cryin
Big brother eyein me imposin their reality to Shutter Island

Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

Our love is like a saga or a trilogy, the drama is killin me
I'm grown but the little boy is still in me
We discuss monogamy polygamy, the I's the probability
Your momma ain't feelin me, it stung like a killer bee
How far from the tree do the apple fall?
The things I said - was it how I felt, was it the alcohol?
Or do I really hate her after all?
I apologize for the statements that I made to her
First I swallowed my pride, then I ate my words
I tried to pass it off acted like it was nothin
The fact is I was discoverin my appetite for destruction
Everything else is bland once you tasted filet mignon
When I'm full I'm takin you home, you a plate for later on
I'll eat it up... or beat it up
Til your love runneth over, yo I need a cup

Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree

Just ride the wave
Niko, what's up

I do this shit cause I want
Man, don't need no reason
Started out at the Bodega
Now we at the Venetian
So Brazilian, but the clothes Parisian
I just do my thing and write like a king man I'm Stephen
These rappers Mr. Fantastic to me, they be reachin'
They poetically describing their gats
That they never squeezin' (pow)
Pardon me I'm starting to see it
Jobs is misleading
Even a snake infiltrated the garden of Eden
Boy stay around the time
It like Martin to Gina
They diggin' meaner than a Spartan's demeanour (Yo, keep it 3 hunnid)
Just spark it and park it
The valet be parking the beamer
Sharper than a ?
That orange indica Ha
You get it for the low
Like Forrest Whittaker's eye
Their vision ?
Don't make up for that counterfeit
Probably with that Alchemist
Free myself then I only see myself like Malcolm

I do this shit cause I want not cause I need a reason
Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian
Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian

(We need to build to destroy, you know what we about)
I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling round like fuck it
Now i pull up in a luxurious something
With nothing less than an onion
See I'm the wolf the boys cry about (fibbin')
You lyin in yo lines like the county building
Burning backwoods niggas poppin outta woodwork
Punch told me how this shit would work
That's why i just smirk
Niko let these people know b (let these people know)
While they voted
We was devoted, TDE Javotii
Felt like an activist, bumping Hi-Tek and Kweli
Now the activis gone, we sippin' high tech and Kweli (Quali')
Junius Brutus with the flow like the Ceasar
Just ask Seasick, but don't get sea sick
SOUL

Let's go
Squadin' up and the crew is tough
Cold and frozen the 
chosen, like I got Jewish blood
Commited like institutions
I'm married to my music
Women in my life are gettin' jealous, because is my truest love
Get my eyes on the prize
Cause my lyrics are like the Pulitzer
Murderer of verses
I am Like Persus to Medusa brah
Better yet King Louis the Sixteenth
Them angels are falling like Lucifer
How could see coming its disgusting
This neck is gushing with too much blood
Academic fellowship even my mellow shit is super tough
Not the fellowship of the ring with the hobbits and talking junipers
I am a follower of the Freestyle Fellowship, them niggas knew their stuff
I'm a student of Myka 9
Long pieces of Jupiter
Nowadays rappers are stupider
Swearing to God that they blew up
I soon I take the stage
Niggas take the fade like a super cut
Immediately stage my scenery
So I chew it up
And I spit it out like I was puking
That's why you threw it up",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-the-venetian-lyrics

Flip, let the beef cook like the flame on the rib tip
Goin' out in a blaze with the biscuit
Got the streets hooked like the 'caine that you sniffin'
Why? Why would you ever go against it?

It's senseless, stalkin' on my page and my mentions
Walkin' on eggs and you soundin' all defensive
Hear dogs hollerin'

For lunchtime, you ain't got the heart when it's crunch time
Soldiers gettin' shot on the front line
Not really for a cause but for they brothers they lay their lives when it come time
Trust being brave is a challenge
If every soldier was brave, there'd be no word for valor

Lord Of The Light,"Catch the Throne: The Mixtape, Vol. 2 ",UnKnown,"They're sellswords
We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground

The night is dark and it's full of terrors
Where your heart, nigga, where your courage?
I was buildin' with the older guy, he said you act like you know it all
All praise to one true God
How you know if you alive if you don't got a few scars?
These cowards in power enforcin' these new laws
No respect for the poor people fightin' they wars
When I pull out my sword, put away lemon cake cutters
Keep my blade covered with the blood of the fakes
So just take daughters and they kill fathers and they rape mothers
Sisters make lovers out of their brothers for the great other
And it's dirty on the ground
Half of Flea Bottom living on bowls of The Brown
Say it's all for the gold when the poachers come around
You can smell the dead way before the vultures come around
Soldiers comin' back after the battle
Still gotta face the fear of the unknown
Daughters and they sons grown
Then they gotta explain why they been gone
Took a man from his family just to get home

Lord of the light to ya'll
Lord of the light
Lord of the light to ya'll
Lord of the light
Let's go, let's

Shadows are created by the light
So that's when we fight for our freedom
That's the battle for our lives
We stickin' out our tongue, we never bite
This why the arguments of the day is the violence of the night
Respect and fear ain't the same so they get confused
See the vision when you're starin' in the flame
In this game of thrones, when you win you still lose
Cause your ego get insane when they cheerin' your name
And they preyin' on your weakness
Cause they playin for keepers
And they slayin' all your leaders
Now your people face disease and famine
And fuck the king cause we famished
That's why the brothers that I roll with don't be waving no banners
Warriors for the cause and we raisin' a family
And when it's time to exact revenge
Have a son, come back from the dead
Look to the light yo
The protector of the realm and the citadel
Living in squalor while the rich people livin' well
I'm seein' they enjoying they seven Heavens
Almost like they forgot about the seven Hells",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-lord-of-the-light-lyrics

Yo

It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you {*repeat first two lines 3X*}
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back...

Yeah I know a city that's surrounded by a beautiful beach
The economy boosted by the drugs they move in the street
More clearer than the crystal sky, blue as the beast
The people ain't got shoes for they feet, or food to eat
So they hurtin but what's for certain you can get you some heat
And over beef you laid to rest like you was gettin some sleep
Where the little kids get ammunition (word) you can't get no nutrition
Or any type of suitable living condition listen
They shoot you over that paper, its just survivalist human nature
To put you out of your misery like euthanasia (yeah)
Don't let them fool you we ain't different than the youth in Asia
Africa and Europe, it's a small world we truly neighbors
If they the third world then who the first to get to heaven
I know it's hard but who does God choose to go through it worst
Usually it's the prophets, ask a cat what really matters
Nowadays usually it's his pockets
 + (Talib ad libs)
We gotta get back to what really matters
We gotta search our soul to find out, what we're after
The more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
Mom and dad don't forget, to warn your sons and daughters

Drivin and typin, not payin attention, missin they next exit
Dependin on navigation they ever know where they goin
They stayin stuck in one spot they not growin
I
'm so over cryin, waitin and hopin playin the blame game
The game changed me into +A Different World+ like Dwayne Wayne
I'm gettin high just to maintain (yeah)
Take my music like a drug and drop the needle in the same vein
I get a rush like I'm tweekin off blow
Except it ain't via the nose it's from deep in my soul
The street slang I be speakin in code
Kick in the do's, freakin the flow 'til the speakers explode
We in control, the people know I speak the truth
The power of my roots is thicker than sour sop
And they so strong they bustin out the flower pot
Family tradition is to tell 'em you love 'em
While your family livin from granny in the kitchen the little man in prison



I'm just tryin to get back, to what really matters
I'm tryin to search my soul to find out, what I'm after
But the more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
So mom and dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters

Nelson Mandela,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Nelson Mandela is so much more than a man. He is a phenomenon, a force of nature, one whose true brilliance 
we can't possibly see without the benefit of hindsight
. He used his 95 years on this planet in a way that the world deemed impossible until his existence. He changed the world in a manner reserved for a very selected few—people like Gandhi, Mother Theresa, Dr. Martin Luther King. However, he was also a revolutionary in the spirit of 
Nat Turner
, 
Assata Shakur
 and Malcolm X. As every man who lives to reflect on their past eventually does, 
he came to regret some of the decisions he made when he was younger.
 For him, that he made while fighting for the freedom and rights of all South Africans. Ultimately, he is remembered for his compassion, his forgiveness, and his humanity, alongside his willingness to stand up and fight in the best way he knew how, for the rights of the oppressed. This full, complete life he led made him the greatest leader in generations.
As 
the son of activist parents
, I learned about Nelson Mandela early—it was like he was part of our family. While the news called him a ""terrorist,"" 
we called him a freedom fighter.
 By the time I was in high school I rocked a 
Keith Haring ""Free South Africa
"" button on my Nelson Mandela book bag and began going to rallies, and on graduation day I put a sticker on the top of my cap that said 
""Abolish Apartheid!""
 Just like Barack Obama said, the movement to end apartheid and free Nelson Mandela was the first movement that politicized me.
As a Black man, I related to the South African's struggle against apartheid in many ways. However, as an American there was no way I could truly say I understood the experience. As bad as we had it in America, Blacks in South Africa had it worse. These were the conditions under which Nelson Mandela transformed himself into one of the world's most powerful voices. In 1961, he was jailed for daring to stand up to one of the world's most brazenly racist police states. And then, along with others like 
Bishop Desmond Tutu
 and 
Steve Biko
, convinced millions that apartheid was wrong—
while locked up doing hard time for 27 years
. Finally, after years of pressure from humanitarians around the world, Mandela was released from prison in 1990. He went on to 
become the president of South Africa
, 
abolish apartheid from the law
, 
win the Noble Peace Prize
 and change the world's view of what a revolutionary could accomplish.
In 1999, while I was recording 
my Reflection Eternal album with Hi Tek
, Dave Chappelle dropped by the studio. This was early in our careers, and we were recording everything, trying to capture the candid moments. We decided to get drops from famous people, but we didn't know enough, so Dave began to impersonate people. While the drops from Lennox Lewis and 
Gil Scott-Heron
, rest in peace, were real, it was Dave doing everyone else from Bill Clinton to Nelson Mandela. 
Dave's Mandela impersonation wasn't spot on
. None of them were. They were great because they were funny in premise. The struggle against apartheid was something that we were all raised to respect and participate in, but the idea of Nelson Mandela ""chilling out"" in South Africa, listening to Talib Kweli and Hi Tek, was hilarious to us.
Til this day, at least once a month, I get asked about how I got Nelson Mandela to do that. Folks are shocked when I tell them it was Dave Chappelle. It's a beautiful feeling every time though, because even though it's funny, it was done in loving tribute.
We will always love Madiba.",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-nelson-mandela-annotated
Stand to the Side,Quality,2002.0,"Go right to left, left to right
Middle passage connection
Yeah, about to build
Tell you which way to go

We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, yo, here we go

I wanna write away, I wanna write here
I wanna write brave words to fight fear, write dreams and nightmares
Might scare the folks stuck in the day with nothin' to say
While I'm way ahead by light years so beware and keep the lights on
I wanna write the songs that right the wrong, right on
Ridin' the light so you see in the dark
So deep you gotta be still like your beatin' heart
My words apply the pressure to make the bleedin' stop
I see the art of livin' right, eatin' smart
I wanna right to life, a right to death
Police read your rights from right to left
But I never write to remain silent, I fight through police line
Cops walk the beat that I write to, I teach minds
Write rhymes with the right sound
Right now, journalists write up, I write down

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze 'til no man is dry
Wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin' to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin' to buy
Slow death operators is standin' by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family, why?
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide
You better get wit it, or stand to the side
Stand to the side, stand to the side
You better get wit it, or stand to the side
Stand to the side, stand to the side
You better get wit it, or stand to the side

Fuck the politics and pride, I just to try to stay alive
To witness where the battle lines are drawn
Speak my mind and I sing my song
I'm passin' on the moral y'all, this is ain't play
True, you got to know the way, it's hard now
Open eyes, see for hopeful lives, sing it now

Makin' my way through life, talkin' to elders and takin' advice
Ignorin' their words and payin' the price
Livin' in the world where false preachers got us prayin' to Christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and layin' the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable they we hatin' to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hiphop and every joint he playin' is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation, I'm like
A mason in Egypt, amazin' when I'm creatin' a site
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past
After Pac and Notorious passed, what do we have?
Niggas worth more when they dead, it's so sad
Started with the slavery we finish the plan
But I broke the cycle and became a man

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze 'till no man is dry
Wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin' to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin' to buy

My Favorite Song,The Lost and Damned EP,UnKnown,"So fresh
Ah man this is my joint 
(same as I ever been)
When I put this joint on, every time I wake up (same as I ever been)
Whatever I went through the day before or the night before (same as I ever been)
Just like wash away, you know?
It's a new day man

This the greatest city in the world
Ain't nothing easy, people is greasy as Jerry curls
Man your favorite rapper not a leader, got coke but it's not a litre
We eats the scraps like bottom feeders
Like crabs in a barrel
The road apparel get you into a battle
""Pow"" then bullet go through your head like the rockstar fame
My life is like a rockstar game
The block got flames
You jump out of the pot into the fire
When we speakin' on a higher plane
Deeper than leviathan
And it's sweeter than a violin
The music sweep you off your feet
While the system tries to keep you in the street
Even cops walk the beat, crooks face the music
Sound like the block is the perfect place to do it
Be up all night until the break of dawn
It's like I'm born again when I hear my favorite song
 x2
So fresh
Same I ever been
So fresh
When I hear my favorite song

Some folks give 'em less than good
Whole life right there they never left the hood
This city got nothin' for 'em
Out of sight, out of mind so they just ignore 'em
They sit back and they twist it backwards
Nothing guaranteed except death and taxes
That's why they get so high
Stand in one spot watch life go by
The hands on the clock go slower than the van on the block
Every plan is a scam or a plot
Every man got his hand in the pot but nobody got a pot to piss in
The preacher preaching, they don't stop and listen
Hard living, cars driven at a high speed pace in a high speed chase
You can read between the lines in my face

Baby get involved, go side to side (Supreme, Supreme)
Side to side...

'Bout to slap box with the beat
The shit I spit, it's a snapshot of the street
You can see the crack spot in the backdrop
The heat in the stash spot of the black drop
You wonder why there's more crime
Free food, or a check the only time niggas on line
Getting information from the nigga-net
The trickle-down theory guess it ain't reached niggas yet
I make a bigger bet
Kweli 'bout to be a bigger threat
'Cuz there's hardly any real niggas left
What the fuck these niggas talking 'bout
Living the movie but the audience is walking out
I fight the temptation to rip the heart from your chest
'Til there's only five hard beats left
It's like a dead man walking
I turn on the radio and I hear dead men talking


Yo'
I got my headphones up like I'm listening close
Face blank with expression, it isn't a joke
Start fire, sit back and spit at the smoke
To get it provoked, blow it back to get in your throat
Math problem, Take all the niggas you know
Add that number up with every nigga you don't
Final number, sum total of the niggas that won't
Break me down, shake me up or fade my style
What time it is?, cool you can hate me now
And ten minutes from then, you gon' love me again
Bucktown republic again
Writing on the wall trouble again
Intensify struggle and such
Killers, Sade love is deluxe
Sound garnered, for the wild hearted
Downtrodden, up-starters
Young violent, uprising
Cocaine, and gunpowder
Up north, or bus crowded
Daily rides to thug mountain
Cold caves and peaks are high
Danger present but unclear, and know how to hide
If you wonder why you got so much on your mind
'Cuz your living in a troubling time, this is a puzzling time
Fall back without recovering time, and time's up
Brooklyn, put your dimes up



I put feeling inside of my rap
Hold it down for my side of the map
No matter what north, south east or west side that I'm at
Bend the needle on the monitors back

Got a problem with that?
The holler back if the stars is black
We the New Era, you just a Starter cap
Find out what happens when the artist attack
Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that

Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think
Figure 8'n on the thin ice part of the rink
You're a vessel that's promised to sink
Terra firma ain't as hard as you think
Stare down, and you starting to blink

Like 182 this for fellas and the ladies who
Don't need to be spoon fed like baby food
I take a bite out the track like a Sabre-tooth
And spit out the truth
'Til the cops come and spray the booth


It's all right with you, it's all right with me
Do the damn thing, what you wanna be (Supreme, Supreme)
That's right, that's right that's right that's right
That's right, that's right that's right that's right (Supreme, Supreme)",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-supreme-supreme-lyrics

My homeboy in the pen lend a helping hand

Really nigga, do you hear yourself
To me you can never compare yourself
You say you got a gun
But I dare you to pop it
Clearly retarded getting daily departed
Theres fear in your heart
I'm a serious artist
And the liquor stays bloody like a period started
In the street beef, really startin in the streets
That barcode really like a mark of the beast
I might wanna jump on a flight, just to jump in the fight

I'm Pimp C in this game nigga, I'm a hard
But I'm never feasting on it, keep speaking on it God
That's what they say when I'm building, I keep my dialogue street

Follow me into a flow, we gon' land in the river
I'm Lou Diamond when I stand and deliver
I got you nervous so your hand gonna quiver
Cats shaking in they boots
On a quest for love, so I take 'em to the root
Who the best, who the worst?
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe
What can you say as the Earth get further and further away
I kill the track with murderous rage
I'm a child of Egypt like van Sertima say
I'm doing lines off the words on the page
Who the herb on the stage?
Kick him off and proceed to show him how it's done
Only thing these emcees be showing me is how to run
Cause them niggas is running like politicians
Acting like a movie with twelve dollar admission
And they still make you butter your popcorn
Since Big and Pac gone
It's hard to find a rapper that's not corn
That's why we threw the Ra on
The God MC, helped me manifest the God in me
See, '87 state of mind that I'm in
Bow to the king -- you can try, you're not him
Came to say follow the leader unless the niggas is wack
Pull the plug, kick a hole in the speaker
The Blacksmith, I spit it so hard I melt iron
My people in the streets still dying
People still trying
Duck, the bullets are still flying
Spitting the ill fire, the candle's still burning
The handle's still turning, the door half-open
Fuck getting a foot in, I'm kicking the shit open
My niggas is from Brooklyn
Innocent victims tossed like a pigskin
Niggas is forced in the system
Nigga, of course his momma miss him
You still not listening

Yo, Kweli, you see my attribute
Is Taheim Master Sameek Allah
Peace to the God
You bug on how I'm so lyrical charismatic
How I be lyrically bouncing on beats like acrobatics
And how I be applying the mathematics
Matter of fact, it's designed to stay off of the street
Create a balance and challenge
Anybody who want it we make 'em vanish
In the hood where they most thug, even the bitches act mannish
And brandish the talk that be changing your thoughts
In a couple seconds don't even have me raising my weapon
Let me talk to niggas and give you the jewel
Freeze your head in a cooler
If you follow the leader, then follow the ruler
You see me now, just know I'm redefining the future
I'm saying, spit a dart that'll pierce the back of medullas
The bassline'll romp like a nigga blowing the tuba
And talk to pretty bitches that still be chewing Bazookas
While I continue to show you how to make your stack bigger
Watch the kid create a new civilization of rap niggas
Back niggas, and watch me lay in the cut
I'm in the hood -- the way I do it, it got me fucking the pavement up
Amazing but you should know I'm craving to set it
Been the first to start a lot of this shit, appreciate the credit
Look, from here to Senegal, been a while
Since I've been stamping up a couple of passports -- you know my style
International Bus Rhymes, still a creator
Moment that'll permanently put you in a hearse
Then watch me eat you like lunchtime
See I be the maker, the owner, the cream and the God of the universe
Be clear, you need to know that when I curse
See the exposure when I apply the pressure, the pipes burst
And I'm gone",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-follow-the-leader-lyrics

You my people, but I don't need you moanin' and groanin'
I can't feed you, I already got kids
How a nigga trying to regulate some shit that’s not his?
I ain't trying to sign, I'm just an artist, nigga
I'm just trying to rhyme and go the hardest, nigga


Radio suckers never play me cause I don't let them
They like a pimp only hoes sweat them
When I do a show, I love to catch the lady's eye
Dodge the paparazzi, I don't wanna see no lady die
Sports entertainment, academics, business, or politics
The fine hoes swallow dicks for dollars quick
Young broads all up in gangs 
like the Young Lords
Jump forward, statutory rape, now you done for
What, you thought that shorty 'bout to act a her age
Right now, somebody's daughter is backstage
It's a master-slave relationship, and guess who Toby
It's the white girl in Colorado, and guess who Kobe
Tried to tell you not to fuck with these debutantes
That's more Kobe beef than Japanese restaurants
Don't need diseases or cases, trying to catch nothing
And when they throwing pussy, best believe you catching something

Stay Around,Eardrum,2007.0,"Ladies and gentlemen
Kweli!

Won't you stay around with me?...
And please say the rhyme
Cause these rappers think that I'm
In love with your state of mind
Cause you a favorite of mine
And I know you on your grind
I don't want to waste your time
But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love

Kweli you should rap about this, you should rap about that
Any more suggestions? You in the back, yeah you
You should rap more on beat, you should rap more street
And never ever get your mack on please, how bout you?
I like the way you're melodic, it's cause you capture hypnotic
Portraits and seem to make the average exotic
Kweli you nice, I know you getting some love, but you can't spit like a thug
And you a blow, you make a hit for the club, word
I don't like your voice, I don't like your choice of beats
It sounds like it's forced
, 
and what was up with ""Back Up Offa Me""?
I ain't like that, now you should get with Hi-Tek
Now he got nice tracks, them other dudes is type wack
Yeah, people keeping it coming, I keep it bubbling
Like the heat from oven boiling the water and the hate
So they light my fire...
I got a mic empire, my own label
I had to Emancipate Mimi like Mariah...
At some point I might retire, on some bullshit
My legacy, horseshit like Mariah's...
Illest flow found in the game, soothing like the sound of the rain
It's the dude profound with the fame, I refusing to be sounding the same
Keeping the verses, deleting the curses, defeating the purpose
When the people go on strike, I'm in the street with the workers
Speaking the words from a pulpit like the preachers at churches
Raise my hand, all the teachers get nervous
Cause they know I air them out
And they ain't even really gotta hear me out
Keep it dirty like Pigpen, 
voice in the warrior's head like Lynne Thigpen
Clocking like Big Ben, old school slang still find a way to innovate
Pete Rock got em feeling great, the ladies say

Won't you stay around with me?...
And please say the rhyme
Cause these rappers think that I'm
In love with your state of mind
Cause you a favorite of mine
And I know you on your grind
I don't want to waste your time
But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love

Light the tip of the L, this heavyweight rap tipping the scale
And we never let the system prevail, real picturesque, missing the sale
Never that, it's forbidden like Afghani sisters lifting the veil
I'm still leading the pack, these cats lacking
Just because you be having a dragon don't mean you got the fire...
It ain't nothing to play with, it's sacred
My pen is the paintbrush, and dipping in paint plus
Truth, love, joy, anger, hatred and anguish
That's the spectrum of colors I paint with
I don't feast at the banquet cause freedom is the set that I bang with
Listen the conditions in my Slum Village is Tainted
I grew through the pavement, like the flower the girl drew in the paper
The sky bluer and the obvious save you
The rules of engagement that they use, attitudes of a slave
Man got me stressed out losing my patience
The moves that I'm making across waters
Through contraband that I'm taking across borders
Information never lost in translation
Too many new words to be learned, I'm spitting fire giving third degree burns
Giving them heat stroke, hotter than rocking a peacote
At Venice Beach though, 
all these rappers soup like miso
, we go
Back in the days like 
reminiscing with Pete
 yo
Ladies welcome to the Kweli show
She goes...

Won't you stay around with me?...
And please say the rhyme
Cause these rappers think that I'm
In love with your state of mind
Cause you a favorite of mine
And I know you on your grind
I don't want to waste your time
But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love

Ladies and Gentleman, its Talib Kweli
Yeah, this Ear Drum y'all
B-B-B-B-Banging on your ear drum
We got the incredible Pete Rock on the track like...
I like that, I like that
I want to give an extra big shout to my man Dave Dart
Holding me down as always and as usual
And his new born son, Cannon, brand new to the world
He's now down with Blacksmith, Blacksmith is the movement
Jean Grae, Strong Arm Steady gang, Talib Kweli
It's what it is, yeah",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-stay-around-lyrics
"“Know your enemy, know yourself, that’s the politic.” (Dead Prez)",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ten years ago I wrote a lyric that went “I don’t fuck with politics, I don’t even follow it.” That same year Dead Prez was reminding us that everything is political. Were we two sides of the same coin? When I examine my past, the truth is I fucked with politics enough to know that I didn’t fuck with it.
That was ten years ago. Today I have many different types of fans, and they all claim me as their own. Some are progressively working toward revolution and actual change of the current system. some participate in politics and try to change the system for the better from the inside. And some don’t care about the state of the world at all, they just like the way I rap. I belong to all of these people and none of them at the same time. What many of these fans do not realize is that we all need each other. I need all of them to inspire me, and they need be to be a voice for the voiceless. So even when I would prefer not to align myself with politics, I must discuss it at crucial times like these. After many conversations with fans and messages from people like Russell Simmons and Michelle Obama, I feel like I should speak on how I feel about this election.
There are those that say the Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are two sides of the same coin. They say that politics on the presidential level are so corrupt that it makes no sense to participate in the process at all. They say these candidates collect money from the rich and votes from the poor while all the time playing those two groups against each other. They say that the democrats and the republicans are all in the pocket of international bankers and corporate lobbyists. These are valid arguments that cannot be ignored.
Barack Obama promised us a change we can believe in. But then he extended the Bush tax cuts and bailed out Wall Street. He signed the NDAA bill which gives the U.S. the right to illegally detain people. He has a kill list and orders drone attacks that wreak havoc on communities and kill innocent people. His record on immigration is suspect and he does not vocally address the needs of the African-American community, a community that truly supports him. When you look at these facts it is easy to come to the conclusion that he is no different from any political puppet.
But these are not the only facts to consider. Fact is, if you believed Barack Obama was going to be anything more than a politician, that’s on you. Obama never promised a revolution. He promised to try and work with his opposition and do what he could within the system, and to that extent, he has done a wonderful job. Consider the United States place in the world from 2008 until now. Politically, Obama has been the most progressive president almost ever. Imagine if he didn’t meet with the resistance from the party of no, a lot of it raced based. Imagine if the G.O.P was focused more on making the country better than winning elections they’ve already lost. They are focused on demonizing Obama. He is not a socialist, actual socialists would be quick to tell you that. You can tell by his foreign policy alone that he is not a Muslim. Based on his actual record, Barack Obama is a right of center democrat, a guy who believes in the core principles of the democratic party and who honestly believes, or believed that he could work with the other side and achieve progress.
I have no reason to make excuses for our president or to prop him up. I do not agree with many of his decisions, because they are based on politics. But when I supported Obama in 2008 I didn’t go into it thinking he would change the world and I definitely didn’t expect to agree with him on everything. That would’ve been foolish of me. Anyone who expected Obama to be their saviour in 2008 deluded themselves. I respected what he symbolized for my children, and it was the first time I saw a politician with a background that was so relatable to my experience. I expected him to be a good politician. He turned out to be a great one. While that is not necessarily a compliment, it is the truth.
If you refuse to vote because you are mad that Obama had lunch with the Bilderbergs or you realize that the electoral college is a flawed system, I can’t even be mad at you. I completely understand that sentiment, and I have voiced my disdain with our current system on many occasions. If this is you, you can stop reading right now.
If you are the type that follows politics and thinks that a change can happen from within, Barack Obama is your clear choice. As a person who tries to focus on compassion I cannot honestly say that today’s democrats and republicans are two sides of the same coin. It is true they often are, especially when it comes to war and destructive financial policies. The amount of money that both parties raise for campaigns should actually be raised to help the country. But today’s G.O.P has fully realized the batshit dream of Kevin Phillip’s emerging Republican Minority. They are so far off the deep end they make the conservatives I grew up hearing sound like left wing liberals. Ron Paul is the only candidate who ran on the republican side that represented what conservatives and tea partiers say they are really about. Ron Paul is the essence of what they say they believe. but they are so dismissive of him it’s disrespectful. The G.O.P hates Ron Paul because they are not interested in actual substance, they are interested in winning. So they picked someone who they felt was stronger politically, Mitt Romney. That was foolish. If they let Ron Paul go at Obama, maybe even Huntsman, that may have been interesting. But a robot like Romney is no competition for the beast of a politician that Obama is.
Life is complicated. If it was simple it would be boring. My view on voting and on Obama is also complicated, but I support what he is trying to do. I don’t think he is my personal saviour who is going to change the world to my liking, the limitations of political office be damned. But I also do not think he is a fraud who sold me some magic beans. I think his challenges are real, and as a black man he had to work harder than anyone who has ever been president. As evidenced by the ugly racism that reared it’s head all over America once Obama was elected, we live in the most racial society, not the post racial society.
Revolutionaries, politicians, working class, rich, poor, black, white, latino, asian, we all need each other. Instead of tearing each other down we must find common ground. That is my purpose for writing this, to stoke the fire of discussion and compassion. I am not asking you to vote. Voting without knowing the issues is just as bad as not voting. I am asking that you educate yourself and pay attention to the things in the world that affect you. And if you are going to vote, Barack Obama is who you should vote for, not Mitt Romney. In my humble opinion. I’d love to hear yours. Cheers.",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-know-your-enemy-know-yourself-thats-the-politic-dead-prez-annotated
Butterfly,Fuck the Money,2015.0,"Yeah. You know. Make it work
Summer rain is like my ad-lips???

Right Chris?
(sound like)
Extra precautions when they not needed
We do it like this like...
I'm still awake... in the middle of the night
Try to lay it down, try to close my eyes

At night I can't sleep
Cause my heart skip a beat
I can see it cause my heart on my sleeve
I can see the deceased
Tear into the flesh of the weak
Currency bear the mark of the beast
Never stand for the bull
Even when the market asleep
Anything I want is in arms reach
And the score is so sweet
But the consequence is that
I got to wear the mark of the thief
I am the man with one hand
Stranger in a foreign land
New identity cost a grand
It's the miracle worker
Serving up the offering
So make the disabled walk again
Got the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland
Like the blind man that saw again
Like el-Hajj Malik
Street cats fought for him
And they never ate pork again
Bear witness to the

Power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
Make it clap like they're giving you a standing ovation
The adulation is such a powerful high
And as sour as my transportation
When I am heading for the clouds in the sky
Stay clean as the department of sanitation
Even though we from the gutter right
That's the power of transformation

Lie a Lot,Get Familiar: The Blacksmith Mixtape Street Album,2007,"I ain't out to diss nobody
But we gon' keep it real for a second
Can we keep it real for a second
Brooklyn stand up
If you doing ya grizzly I respect that
But a lot of rappers is saying things they don't mean
People see through dat
Talib Kweli

Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot
Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot
I know you think you nice
You just nice on ya block
With these crabs in the barrel
Tryna rise to the top
Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot
Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot
I know you think you nice
You just nice on ya block
With these crabs in the barrel
Tryna to rise to the top

This is why I'm hot, this is why I'm hot
I ain't scared to die, I ain't scared of getting' shot
I got the fear of God and from all that I been through
If you fuck with the family then I gotta put it in you
Pause, now continue, I love the competition
I ain't got no issue with the battles or dissin'
But I keep it straight with you, we shootin' from the hip
I can't stand these rappers that just shootin' off they lip
Every rapper is a clapper, your producer is a shooter
Engineer gotta nine, label boss gotta ruger
Yeah, right, we ain't stupid
We don't believe these losers
Got a Mac in the booth
Tell the truth, it's a computer
So let me guess you make it that impression
I seen you on MySpace, you just wanna be friends
So let's not pretend, I respected ya block
Until I put it all together, now let's connect the dots

Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot
Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot
I know you think you nice
You just nice on ya block
With these crabs in the barrel
Tryna rise to the top
Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot
Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot
I know you think you nice
You just nice on ya block
With these crabs in the barrel
Tryna rise to the top

Ok, you say you rap
You know how I can tell you whack
It's 2007 and you still sellin' crack
Back in 1986 when we was shootin' over sneakers
Crack was king but now they slangin' and it's drastically cheaper
It ain't a real demand there ain't no short supply
Just the same old crackheads getting twice as high
These niggas like to lie on how they kill on corners
They still corny, they don't know what the real New York is
Faster than a rose in crime inner city drop
It wasn't because the mayor added forty thousand cops
You on the corner like ""Wow, my style is pretty hot""
But my style mile is equal to 20 city blocks
Most say New York is soft, it's softer with the beef shit
Niggas can't separate the music from the street shit
Man that's some weak shit, them niggas never classic
Remember, bastards, Talib Kweli forever Blacksmith

Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot
Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot
I know you think you nice
You just nice on ya block
With these crabs in the barrel
Tryna rise to the top
Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot
Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot
I know you think you nice
You just nice on ya block
With these crabs in the barrel
Tryna rise to the top

Say if you do what you do, do what you do
Do it the best; word is bond
Sex, drugs and murder, right? It's entertainment
It's very entertaining, you know what I'm sayin'?
But if you just listenin' - if you a fan, a spectator, a tourist
And you just takin' a tour through this world
Don't rep it like you really doin' it, because it could come back to haunt you, y'know?
Niggas lie a lot, man
Do 
not
 believe a word these niggas is sayin'
They are just cariacatures in the cells
It's not really real, it's just television, it's two-dimension

Wait for You,Gutter Rainbows,2011,"Yeah, hey, yeh
And who are you to be talkin 'bout, what I be doin man?
I'm the upper echelon, who is you to evaluate my performance?
How would you like it if I came to your job
And evaluated your performance? {*laughter*}
Are you the best at what you do?
Your name don't even come up in conversation man

Better get it while the gettin is good, and do what you do
No hesitation, ain't no time for playin games
Go 'head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name
While the gettin is good, you do what you do
No hesitation ain't no time for playin games
Go 'head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name

Yo, aiyyo
What are you doin wit'cha life? Your time on Earth is sacred
The time you spend at your plantation is it worth the paper?
It's like you workin for nathan, the money's circulatin
You can't pay your mortgage but you buyin bottles perpetratin
Chill with them threatening raps
You sound lame, you a snake, you made the plane with your venomous acts
They call me Gentleman Sav
Cause I back Miss Congeniality like Benjamin Bratt
Attractin chicks who like the ""Feminine Fatt""
While you only deal with the bitches, I deal with the realest women
It's ill how they feel the rhythm in they mid-section
When they blessed with the child-bearin hips
But the softest pair of lips is when they hair get flipped
I love my culture and heritage, it keep me from being derelict
Invested in myself like this was Merrill Lynch
Been waitin for my second comin like I'm heavensent
Even though I'm not your savior I'll grace you with my benevolence

Better get it while the gettin is good, and do what you do
No hesitation, ain't no time for playin games
Go 'head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name
While the gettin is good, you do what you do
No hesitation ain't no time for playin games
Go 'head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name

Yo, yo, yo
My style is unfadeable and haterproof, I'll slay the booth
I'm known to interrupt the program like late breakin news
Some say its only eggheads that I cater to
Well wait a few in order to make an omelette I gotta break a few
My plate is full, I wasn't 'sposed to be here but I made it through
My reputation grew, I left.. blood on the stage for you
How dare you say that my commitment is debatable
I'm married to the music; you rhythm then I'm a slave to you
Commercial artists so relatable
The consumer appetite is insatiable, I could do what they could do easily
But then they'd say Kweli be seemin fake to you
Record sales ain't makin you, money is motivatin you
The artist gotta lead I hope the fan base stay with you
The products shoddy if you rush it for the paper true
D'Angelo and Sade they, take a decade or two
Keep that good music comin and they'll wait for you

Better get it while the gettin is good, and do what you do
No hesitation, ain't no time for playin games
Go 'head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name
While the gettin is good, you do what you do
No hesitation ain't no time for playin games
Go 'head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-wait-for-you-lyrics

Preacher's playing foul in the system now
 listen now
It's more hate in the religious now
 ain't it foul
Gotta be a better way to figure out
How to be a self savior plus help my niggas out
These pigs playin foul in the system now listen now
Every poor person is a nigga now
There's gotta be a better way to figure out
How to get this paper cause they lockin all my niggas down

How do expect to live? Dealin with savages is damagin
Somebody gotta lose although you play to win
You know these niggas hate, despite the color of your face
When I say nigga I'm just speakin on your mental state
Life ain't a game if it is I can't participate
Maybe I've changed but my mind is in a different state
Cause now it seems more like a plan
I'm strivin for perfection, so that's where I'll begin
Your tallies and peaks and valleys can't describe who I am
This music is therapeutic, I define who I am
Through the actions I portray as a man in combination
With impressions I leave on people through things that I've said
I've had it up to here with the bullshit
So when I rap I sound like I'm in the pulpit
Yeah; they say that I be preachin too much
But I know that through the music's how you teach it to us
It's all real

Preacher's playing foul in the system now

It's more hate in the religious now

How to get this paper cause they lockin all my niggas down

True indeed Chace; they tried to get rid of me (say word)
But they can't write me off, I'm not a charity
That's a parody right? You kiddin me
There really ain't no challenge, my authenticity
Virtually guarantee me a flawless victory, you kiddin me?
I'm lethal, I'm from a people who was forced into captivity
Original man, there was often a facsimile
I give a little more than your metaphors and wack similes
Thousand yard stare, say a prayer for my enemy
I'm international
, half of these rappers laughable
It's tragic how the other half so vaginal
They put the style over substance
, they counsel bother me
My style married my substance and now they livin in harmony
But any substance can be abused
Especially when the style is so seductive
The substance consider leaving you
You gotta get back to your essence
Use your gifts and share your presence
Don't count your dollars 'til you count your blessings

Preacher's playing foul in the system now

It's more hate in the religious now
 ain't it foul

There's gotta be a better way to figure out
How to get this paper cause they lockin all my niggas down",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-self-savior-lyrics
Makes No Sense,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Real niggas say “church”, catch the Holy Spirit
You can hear ‘em testify, then I beat ‘em with the curse
This ain’t baseball, we don’t ever let it slide
Run through it like first, the tek’ll spray
Then the pepper spray like pesticides and the crowd disperse
Somebody on the floor is left to die, that’s how it go
What you expect? There’s metal detectors at the door
That’s how you know that we in a prison
Whether it’s the club, or the school, hospital or the fuckin’ airport
Take a trip when I’m on one
Gone in the head ‘til the song’s done, shit
You ain’t nothin’ but a blip on the screen
I remain the game for the long run, staying at the forefront
No blinds – we gettin’ sky high
We changing time zones, the hours fly by
The Europeans, mixing weed with their tobacco for ‘em
I got it locked like the Scots with the shackles on ‘em
Slave psychology, trade property if you want apologies
I’m a king, not in my genealogy
Origin of the word etymology
Eye of the pyramid like a Ponzi scheme
Pull my collar up, cooler than Fonzie be
And I rock, nigga, call me geology
I’m the top nigga, check the discography

Real niggas say “church, mosque, synagogue""
Fresh pine box for you and your squad
28 grams and it came out hard
So I quit my job, got blessed in the mob
Get burnt, work, left in the dirt
Last real nigga in the game, don’t perp
Gibbs be the nigga with the pounds and the work
Bet you’ll probably be the next rap nigga in a skirt
Get brake, scrape, put him in his place
Price on your head, got a dub in his face
All my dogs eat off the same plate
Shoot a nigga, get a charge, get out the same day
And I know a nigga itching to do me the same way
Really do it matter? We livin’ the same shit
Never looking forward to getting my brains lit
But it’ll probably be a nigga I hang and slang with
Yeah, enemies come with smiles, but I see their disguises
I done seen friends turn into straight frauds
So the fake shit don’t surprise me
In the lab with a spoon and a hot stove
Most of y’all niggas couldn’t survive me
.38, young goon with a snub-nosed
Born and raised on Gangsta Island

I’m not giving a fuck, which means I’m not giving an intimate touch, keeping my virginity clutched, I’m not giving it up
Spitting murder, I’m probably not somebody you want to make an enemy of
Every syllable is killin’ ‘em, death is a minimum
Outcome when you lettin’ Freddie with machetes in your living room
I’m living through the visuals, I’m giving you connect with every individual
And they’re just saying that he’s lyrical…
No, nigga, I’m the realest – raised in the jungle with gorillas
Ain’t too many heroes and there’s way too many villains
Niggas goin’ crazy over money, probably need to be committed
They commited to seeing these killings
And walking away like they don’t know who did it
Time ain’t on your side
So be happy when you see the other side of a minute
Half-aware niggas witness homicides when they chillin’
Just another day in my city – just another day in Fly City
Gonna be funny with another nigga’s money
Better make sure a motherfucker die silly, it ain’t pretty
Poverty done got to me, no you can’t take it out of me
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, it’s like I just hit the lottery
Got to be niggas spitting that comedy, not a nominee
Spitting a monopoly ‘til I’m living like Tommy Lee
Shit too real – and these niggas too fake
It’s my time – these niggas too late
My city too real – so I stay like that
And we don’t give no fuck – ‘cause we was raised like that
Gone…",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-makes-no-sense-lyrics

But sorry I have to go - one more time yo!
Meet Mr. International
On the runway more than a fashion show, y'know?
It's all love like McEnroe
But sorry I have to go

I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you
I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you

Yo, let me introduce you to the Blacksmith crew
We makin money
Go to sleep with a dream and we wakin up hungry
Its a new day stomach is rumblin - oh well
I'm like Lloyd Banks, stumblin out of the hotel
Overseas show I'm catchin the last flight
Really need to go I'm hungover from last night
Out with Gina and MeLa Machinko, we get silly
Had a ball, 'bout to call a cab like Wet Willie's
When I'm in commuter traffic I'm never worried or panicked
First class travel, I'm flyin Virgin Atlantic
I'm already checked in, I'm ready to settle in
Going places I've never been, I get my Rosetta in
Rackin up the sky miles and gettin them upgrades
And you hate the only place that you visit is upstate
Don't be mad cause I'm writin this rhyme on my iPad
Don't be sad cause tomorrow I'm catchin the flight back

I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you

I'm a travellin man, movin through places space and time
Think your life hard workin at your 9 to 5
No matter what you do you can't imitate my grind
Twenty-four/seven love ain't that rough
When your career is you're passion no that ain't enough
So when you hear me rappin it's like I'm makin love
Banging your eardrum, slingin that good uhh, takin over the planet
You follow my footprints now you rollin with the greatest
I'm gettin to know the neighbors I'm tastin the local flavors
Chicks from the ghetto were richer than portobello
My life is like a movie a novel by Paulo Coelho
Or the Steely Dan song about a bottle of Cuervo
Colombian Gold, take a hit for the road
It's given me a vision like I was lickin a toad
Consider me so blessed like momma bakin a cake
And the kids is lickin the bowl, the illest stickin to soul

I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you
I've been so many places in my life and time

Oh My Stars,Eardrum,2007.0,"I'm freestyling, for me, myself and I
I write them on the paper til it gets sky high
I say goodbye, to all the bad things I've done
I start a new beginning, and this is how it begun
From, KRS-One to Talib Kweli
Now I'm the best superstar on BET
And MTV, better yet I'm known universally
I am the key, to being the best MC
The prophecy, the one and only
A timeless masterpiece, I ain't the least
I'm the best, cause God said so
I'm just trying to express my lyrical flow

Yo, yo
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
It feel good, it feel so damn, uh
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
It feel good, yo, yo, yo
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Baby tell me how it feel when I always keep it real
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Yo, now how it feel? Yo

It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Khalil brought the fly shit, I brought the hood appeal
Notes from the piano is falling out the sky
Like angels losing their wings so they see how it feel to cry
Babies have babies for the welfare coupons
Dudes on the radio rapping, them cats is lukewarm
I get up on it, spit up on it like a new born
The family structure ruptured, there's living proof like a group home
B-Boy being a man, throw a suit on
Stepping out hotter than Tuscon when the soup's on
My son like, ""Daddy, I be missing you when you gone""
I said I gotta go so I can stack chips like Lou Corn
I ask my daughter how I look, she fixed my hat so I can wear it cool
Cause she's like ""That's what they wear in school""
Then she asked me ""Daddy, you know any superstars?""
I looked at her and said ""Stop being silly, that's what you two are""
I say it now and I've said it before
And you can trust me on this cause I've been through it, y'all
Follow your heart and you can do it dog
Baby you're a star...

All of the days...
All of the days, of my life I spent on trying to find
Yet another way to show you how, how special you are
There ain't no body, that can take that away from you
No matter what...
Even though...

Yeah, yo, yo, yo
And even though mummy and daddy might fight all through the night
Argue and fuss, you a part of us that we've got to get right
I don't love you to death, cause I love you to life
And you a teenager, you might not want my advice
You might be full of spite, think you're grown, still a tyke
And say things that cut like a patient under the knife
I say this, cause I was once a teenager too
And respect for my peers is really all that I related to
But I made it through, you gonna make it too
So much I wanna say to you...

Baby you a star, that's what you are to me

Why not, right?
Okay, 1-2

Yo I'm Brooklyn like the '90s
Brownsville and Bushel keep it grimey
When I'm from flatbush that's where you'll find me
In Brooklyn, Tek wit' Justin and Sadat
And Free and Sid from ???
Always catch me wit' Juju and Rubiks, we was truant kids
Dollar band nooseses
Jump bell, run, and never look back
Mr. Man kept the hammer in his bookbag
Rubiks introduced me to Black and Forte
DJ Enuff on Avenue K I go back a long way
Wit' Super Nat in Washington Square freestylin' everyday
Peformin' at Lyricists' Lounge who ate off Jean Grae
Fuckin' wit' Mood is how I met Hi-Tek
Black Star came in effect when Elijah gave my tape to Mos Def
Reflection Eternal was next on deck
My crew the best and we proved it
We knew our music was the Vanguard of a movement
Every Rawkus release was bangin', they on the come up
They was like fuck the radio 'til Pharoahe said ""Get the fuck up""
Flex listened, jabbin' at Bryant
The next position was right about now we need the
Radio hit written
While I hit the road
On tour to support the records since the day it was sold
Corey had me followin' the example of De La Soul
Common and The Roots to me these the sickest niggas
Get my figures wit' the Okayplayers and the Spitkickers
Rawkus got a deal with MCA, this the gray area
The letters stand for Music Cemetery of America
They tried to fool you by switchin' the name to Geffen
Now they Interscope's bitch and every artist who had a chance left 'em
Ain't no big surprise, wasn't no love there
Jimmy Iovine never signed me, I just kinda ended up there
But fuck that, literally it was my way or the highway
Hit the road with the Beastie Boys and toured Europe with Kanye
Gotta thank 'em for the love on the album
I knew out on ""Electric Circus""
He'd get it by any means necessary like Malcolm
I dropped a single, shot a video, took control of my situation
Got a label poppin', it's a celebration (bitches)
Yo boy Free I had to get out
I put you on, that's where I'm at right about now

And if you're sayin' it's my time, you right about now
This what's goin' through my mind right about now
Hey yo, hey yo, it's time to write about now
And if you lookin' you can find it right about now
I put you on, that's where I'm at right about now
This what's goin' through my mind right about now
Yo, hey yo, it's time to write about now
And if you lookin' you can find it right about now

That's right bitches, Talib Kweli
One of the baddest motherfuckers you've ever seen
That's right bitches, Talib Kweli
You're now rockin' with the best! I said it
The best! The best!

Outside the Lounge,Lyricist Lounge Volume One ,UnKnown,"Yo, freestyles, Lil Sci to the e-ventually
You might see me, kick a free
Get the tape in the Benzi box
Up in club spots
On a regular base
Anytime and place
What? Like Janet
I slam kids
Harder than Shaquille O'Neal down to the masses
I take crews back to, um, hip-hop classes
Because they didn't surpass this
We reside actually, acrobatically, yo...

Come and burn me if you spit words of flame from your brain
(What?) Rugged terrain, style insane, you's the lame
(Huh) Freestyle or written strictly shittin' on emcees
Drop these mad degrees on emcees
Everyday, every night
You fight for the mic, but you can't handle it
I dismantle it, bust you in your head with it
You know you can't spit it like I spit it
Yeah you shit it in the toilet bowl
You know I got nuff soul
Y'all control the core cipher
You know we drop this, and got emcees following like the Pied Piper
You know we hyper, so...

Yo, yo, yo; can I get a chance to drop in the cipher?
Set the shit on fire
Yo why the, beat stop?
I don't know, the beat-box is coming in
Got you counting from one to ten
And by the time you get up to nine, your ass is left behind
Cause you can't mess with the lyrical master rhymes
Slay niggas to pass the time, coming off the mind or the brain
Can't maintain, I'm type strange
And ill, in the mind of Wiseguy, that's right
I'm the baddest on the mic, I'm average height
Got a huge appetite, sorta like Iron Mike
'Cept I don't bite, I just fight, with raps I write
Use the left and the right, recite styles that's hype off the top
Pardon me but stop the beat-box
Cause yo I got beats son
(Aw word?) (Aight) My bad, I didn't mean to kill that shit. (That's alright
Man, y'know what'm sayin?)

The beats is always love, y'know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas always show love with the beats
(My little yellow box, always come in handy) Y'know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, this is like a wack emcee's nightmare, y'know what I'm sayin'?
Thats why I'm right here, y'know what I'm sayin'?
*beat comes in*
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
My name's Kweli, from the Eternally
Reflection,
 spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee
*aside* Yo, wassup y'all, wassup y'all
Im doin this
I love the rush that I get seein' a wack emcee's bottom lip quiver
He know he gettin' smacked for every wack rhyme he deliver
Whether in alleys or back streets or the stairwell to Fat Beats
I come off like the ink that be staining my hand and rap sheets
With lyrics stronger than Samson,
 to send Marilyn Manson back to Hell
The resurrection of Fred Hampton
You can tell by the way your shit swelled and lump up
Whenever punks jump up
They get beat down,
 
for thinking they Bone, creeping on a come up
Now I got one up
Are we much more than crabs in a barrel
Or fags who rap about apparel with an outlook that's mad narrow?
We civilized, so on the microphone we vilify
For proving that the niggas with skills is still alive
(Still alive) (Still alive) (Still alive)

A-yo
Freak that, I'm leavin' rappers hangin' like cave bats
Or hats on coat racks, I'm rough like porcupine backs
Smacks the emcees that lack, but, yo, they knew that
Like the flute, blew through that, with nothing but facts
DJ's cut the wax, snare sharp like ax
Mic apparatus invited to start static
From basement to attic, get smacked, act dramatic
I had it with some of these fake rhyming ass faggots
""Who Shabaam Shadeeq?"" they ask, mega blast
Storm forecast, whiplash like car crash
Black Flag for emcees that multiply
Act bad, make you dig in your rhyme bag
Got all the skills you wish you had, dreams you had
Scorch that ass and make you take the words back
To the foundation of that whack verse creation
Double S,
 who wan' test? smash your face in

Yeah, yo, yo; my shops cop ?more 'neath?
Things in caster rock
And get you open with the combination, like master lock
Let it be known, that none could ever pass the Block
And when the spot get blown, I hit you with the ?yeah, first shot?
Traffic stop when I'm jammin
, 
cause I got more back than gammon
Slammin those that oppose my flow like salmon
Foes be standing clear, cause, yo, they can't compare
The only thing that could hang in hear is a chandelier
This man could care less what them say, kick it like sensai
Then stay, on your mind like Ash on a Wednesday
He at a loss style, got no cause to smile
I toss that ass all across, kinda like a foster child

It's Mr. Metaphor, everybody gather 'round
Live in stereo sound and very profound
Deeper than a burial ground, I'm aerial bound and shuttin'
Comp down 
as I rock like Charles Dutton
From Kings to Putnam, I cut 'em from every angle
Far from a square cause I wreck when I tangle
Minds I mangle, mics I strangle in advance
In any circumstance I leave you shook like turbulence
You'll never get this, I'm up in that ass like a tetanus
Met twist 
rhymes and drop more lines than Tetris
I'm sicker than asbestos
, spraying rhymes like a pesticide
Best to step aside, realize who the best is

One two, one two
The Scienz of Life, BX to New Jeruz
One two, one two
Yeah, the Scienz of Life, BX to New Jeruz
Yo, let's go back like Gilgamesh epics
With fact-challenging methods
The rhythm stays energetic
The pen's motions kinetic
See Heaven sent styles, bless the ears of my peers
Even older heads get contacted
From bomb tactic
Exploding in your nearest tabernacle, Holy like Kadesh
HTM, bow lyricists
You feel it in your chest son, like that Nine Ether
Sound right, reasin em, pleasin em through the speaker
For years and years mad heads doubted me
Then I changed hiphop, into new-op, its best described as alchemy
The scientist, applying this throughout the global
I stays universal with the vocal
Attracting your focal points with each joint performed at live shows
While Lilsci' verbally fly with dime flows
My mind grows, being divine, strolls, by the Master
One verse could cause cataclysmic disaster
But the truth hurts to be murder with spoken words
Profound sound all in your section
No question
The Scienz of Life, don't confuse it
Aiyyo if it don't sound right than it ain't music
*indistinct chatter by emcees overlapped by security guard saying:*
Alright, alright fellas, fellas, fellas, fellas, hold on, hold on
Hold up a second
You guys, you guys can't be making this noise
With the music and everything. (Aw, come on!)
You gotta leave this area. I gotta clear this spot
(We gotta go inside right now) So get on line. (We got tickets)
So get on line (We got tickets)
Alright, alright, you gonna get, you got tickets
So get on line, and get out of this area
The line is over there. (We were just doing our thing)
Its all good, its all good. Get on line, alright

Sitting on a stoop, watching chickens fly the coup
People troop through the night in groups.  I got dice to shoot
Way too late to see this youth hanging on the ave
Plus my little man's mama just told me he skipped the class
He on the corner smoking a stog', looking broke in the blow
He opened his soul, said he came to a fork in the road.  ""Son
I’ve never seen that look in your eye.  What's wrong, kid?""  He replied
""What they’re teaching me in school ain't helping me to live
It ain't relevant to me.  Word is bond,

Is so overcrowded, they don't even notice when I'm gone""
""Hold on, shorty.  You're speeding.  Take what they got you reading
Apply it to your life and give it your own meaning

You hard already (Word).  You used to be hooking us up, cooking
For us.  It was love.  You was Brooklyn to us
I’ll remember the tragic loss of the baby’s father
Being eight-months pregnant was hard—that made it crazy harder
Plus I know he loved you, and you felt like you would lose it
That’s why it’s good you start again and focus on your music
I got your back on a plane that’s two hours away, and it’s like
Going to Queens and taking the A.  Today
You sound stressed out.  I know you’re ready to lead, ready
To be free and keep a home steady for your seeds, but you’re
There already.  If you thought it, it could happen
The hands God works with his hours.  You took action”

We’re all looking for the truth.  Now look in your eyes for proof
Or recognize no time to lie to the youth, so I slide
In the booth and provide you the soup for your soul, food
For your whole body when you feel you’re losing control
To some corporation, TV station, or occupation, another
Foreign value system that kill your sensation.  Feel the
Elation of knowing life—you got a lot to live
Stay true and focus on the positive.  Come on

For who do we aspire to reflect our own people's death
For who's entertainment shall we sing of agony? In what hopes?
That the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us will suddenly
Suffer remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success?
The last imbecile to dream that dream is dead
He was killed by the saviors of his own dream
Armah, 2000 seasons

I'm not a human being getting on some spiritual shit
A spiritual being manifested as a human that's it
When I spit I spray thoughts that's representing my life
Yo I step into the spot leave niggas open like mics
Take on em on a tour
Explore psychologies of war
Things you can't imagine if you've never seen em before
Shorties come back raw
Straight out the c- 74
I welcome them back to the world they think is run by laws
The world is run by men who use laws for tools
But I come thru war tactics like Shaka Zulu
Mcs is soft like play-doh
I shape 'em
Smash em to pieces
Volunteer
Slaves crave the words I'm painting
The masterpieces
You hear em on the radio babbling
The truth is traveling with the word
I sent flying through the air like a javelin
Unraveling like a verdict
Pound it in your chest like a gavel in the highest court
In Bablyon, let's travel on
If the world is foul, and you think foul is how you got to live
Then from the get your ass was foul
And foul just is how you is
No excuses see, life's dilemnas are set up like a mirror
Just to show you all your faces
Now your understanding is clearer
You had your chance for evolution
You let it pass you by
That's why
I'm dissing wack mc's till the day that I die
Reflection getting you high
We stand our ground with the believers
The leaning tower of Pisa and the Pyramids of Giza
No comparison
The way I flip it is embarassing
Tis the season
Ain't no caroling

All knowing
Flowing like spring water in the desert
Balling through the barren land
Where niggas take a stand, like castles made of sand
Free falling
For anything
Nothing but a plan to fail for they selves
No sense of delf, needed daily affirmations of self help
Yo it's right in front of yo grill stop looking everywhere else
Speaking of planning
Hustling and scheming
Looking for hookups
Took up too much time
Like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up
God bless the child that got his own shit
I got my team's
So the fiends now become opponents
They the opposition
Stronger from competition
Shining like a golden shower, your face I'm pissing in
Completing a genocide mission like
The Warren commission
Like fathers was supposed to be missing
While our sisters were supposed to be whoring
Save it for a rainy day, money is pouring
Under grey clouds, black butterflys still be soaring
Flying in frienldy skies
We classifying the highs
Blood be flowing in the streets like crimson tide in my eyes
The thai be having me drowsy
But I get mellow with the chronic
Intellectuals embarrased cause we discussing ebonics
I'm on a roll like sonic
In an age that the plague got bubonic proportions
Yo I call it reparations, but they call it extortion
Whatever
Just give me mine
But caution
You've been warned for the very last time
I'm not telling you again
So relay it to your crew
You gotta actually to do
Forget the drive in, driveby and drive through
You've got to
Get out the car
Humble yourself
Tilt your head back, and look at the stars
Shining over someplace very far, from where you standing
When the night is clear
You understanding just who put them there
What you know about the space you get lost in
Your peoples can't hear you in the distortion
The desert is absorption
And you sucked and you stuck off american freezing for like
2000 seasons
Upon your return from raping and crossbreeding
Your own people accuse you of deceiving and misleading
Causing mass confusion. Drug abusing
Now you all caught up in institutions
At this time you've got to break it down and be showing and proving
An A&R told me that I use too many catch phrases

Distractions,"Train of Thought: Lost Lyrics, Rare Releases & Beautiful B-Sides Vol. 1",2015.0,"You wish it was you, don't you why you asking?
Try to break the law of attraction
Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your blood if you believe in the immortals
We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder
See the water drawing away from the shore
This ain't no ordinary storm
We fighting for a humanitarian cause
But have yet to show up in Darfur
The Arab Spring is what it's called
But they looking at the pride before the fall
They say it ain't about the spoils of war
But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost
Steal the land from the Native American and make our missiles Tomahawks
Make him a mascot, dress up like him for sport
As a final assault to his beautiful culture
Scavengers, feasting on the dead like a vulture
Snacking; how you keeping up with my rapping?
You barely keeping up with Kardashian
You caught up in distraction
It's the living proof you try to make the truth elastic as Mr. Fantastic
I'm recycling these rappers
Truthfully, these dudes is plastic
Coming through the front door blasting
I ain't talking bout them e-mails
That you always send to the masses
That somehow end up in my trash bin
The game is distraction
Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin
Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in
Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters
Deep cuts way above your minor infractions
Talk to people like children cause that's how they acting
Hold their hands like minors in traffic
The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo
Have a deep-seeded fear of change
For them it's strange they wanna go
Back to the 50s, they asking for a return
But them days is much blacker, for lack of a better term
We adapted to this culture, but this culture we had to learn
Came about as as natural as a perm on a pachyderm
These fascists have had their turn
We passing them German burners, them Lugers
The next shooters waiting for Superman, they get nothing but Lex Luthor
America's nightmare, as vivid as Fred Kruger
Our heroes are dead to us
Spirit that bled through us
Endear us with the spirit but the flow is so foolish
What you hearing is precision
The people so thirsty, what they seeing is mirages
But apassion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages
Coming through like Collossus
Exposing the false prophet
Taught how to do the knowledge so I'm never off-topic
A lie is like a potion
First it gets you open
Then you swallow whole straight for the truth
Fuck the chaser, skip religion and the politics
Head straight to the compassion
Everything else is a distraction",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-distractions-lyrics
Money Good,Fuck the Money,2015.0,"It's not so much a business where you make a lot of money but if you enjoy the business then the money comes. But if you're looking for the fast, instant kind of famous and money it's going to be boring to you because it doesn't happen quite like that

Verse 1:
When the money come it's sweet as a honeybun
But when the money gone they hide like a honeycomb
They tell you get your education
Nigga, go to college
They colonizing your mind like Rhodesia
What you, a Rhodes scholar?
They never tell you that degree is just a receipt
You be paying off them loans til you're 6 feet deep
Peep
In my environment every snitch gon' have to die
You ask me why
Cuz my entitlement is American as apple pie
It's hard to get a check, it's easy to get in debt
Then get it wet
You could get a little head for a little bread
That shit is dead
Get by, get over
You gotta get ahead or be back in the shelter by 12 so you can get a bed
The conditions you raised in is preyin on your decision-making
You concentrating on that short paper
The broad paper, that hard candy, that jaw breaker
The dark side of the force pay for that Lord Vader
Chorus:
How you tell a nigga from the hood?
We on the Dirty, Sexy Money like Blair Underwood
My money good (x4)
Can't touch it
It's only human to want to look
Money talk
My shit be tellin everyone to shhh
My money good (x4)
Verse 2:
The millionaire musician a fairly recent phenomenon
Before there was  musicians performing on the street corners
Out in the deep forest
The city drop the beat, the night air sing a sweet chorus
The trees lean toward us in order to take in the CO2 that we let out and convert it into oxygen
Every time you blow a breath out you start the cycle again
Recycle the wind, spin it any way you want it
It's priceless, this life is a blessing
No matter how you slice it or dice it, you can grill it like a swordfish
A beautiful mind, the bars gorgeous
I know I'm a suspect
When I'm walking and the streets is like my office
We the working class artists
They wishin that we was porpoise
But I know my worth
Tell em to make an offer of gold first
I'm in the fight of my life and I'm taking the whole purse
Soul search
For getting paid for creating the cold verse
Got the money on my mind
Tryna escape and it don't work
Church

Knowledge is the founder of everything in existence
If you not droppin' knowledge abolish because you ig'nant
A top-notch scholar wit honors, I'm so gifted
Live is the most vicious, honest and prolific
I drop diabolical brollic wit no gimmick
Astonish the flow critics, rhyme wit the most lyrics
I paint pictures, jot it and dot it but won't print it
My ? is photogenic, I am the most vivid
Man, I got a brain the size of the most biggest
Wide as them cold rivers, wise as them old niggas
Tired of this, though, half of you rhyme it but don't live it
Watch it and go spit it, stop it, I know Physics
Breakin' yo physical, demolishin' yo spirit

Live New York rap, stay away from the pork crap
Actin' like you all that, get smacked if you talk back
Spiritual like Rakim on ice, like Kane with the females
Slick Rick and Biggie Smalls attention to detail
Political like PE, I'm spittin' fire like Ice Cube
Kweli a nice dude 'til you start fuckin' with my food
Rap 'll set the right mood, fin' to blow like a light fuse
You might lose, ya chance of winnin' slimmer than a size two
Plus, the shit you kick so wack niggas ready to fight you
Fuck rap, you better off wit spoken word kickin' Haiku
Or rhymes got teeth that'll bite you, make it clearer than white booze
You ain't special, there's a million rappers like you
Far from clumsy, but I drop lines and spill bars
Smoke more trees and be around more Black chicks than Bill Maher

The Beast is out when the police is out
They be pullin' out and really showin' you what peace/piece about
Upholdin' the law that's designed to keep my people down
Bourgeois niggas walkin' around like everything is equal now
I'm peepin' how from the beat cop to the Interstate trooper
To the Feds who put a price on Assata - head to Cuba, B
Protectin' the property value over the people life
To take action against a foul government is the people right
But not too many ready to fight
It's like you'd rather be at home watchin' a flick or a fight
Or maybe Nick-At-Nite
It's sick how I'm addicted to mics, become a flickerin' light
After I spark I'm always ready to write
Where I'm from, they be watchin' us, but we be watchin' them
And bust shots 'til the coppers bring the choppers in
The squad cars try to box me in
But I got knowledge of self and it's stronger than any cage you can lock me in

Jackin 4 Beats,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Text break where the beat changes)
-Talib Kweli-
We got the Eternalists Talib Kweli on the microphone
DJ Cipha Sounds on the turntables
This is some real hip-hop shit right here
Here I am, come on, R-A-W
Always down to keep the shit up like a ?bubble goose?
Brother who, bring trouble to the industry
With colorful metaphors and similes
I'm sunnin you, what you wanna do
Get rid of me, Cuz I take you back to history
Like when Niggas hung from a Noose
Yo I'm sucker-proof, plus I never do what others do
Thugs running loose, kickin nursery rhymes like Mother Goose
Which one of you(s) want it first
Yo I'm running through your front line
While you still tannin in my sunshine
I got pistol-whip, smack, kick and punchlines
Represent your block, muscle-shot one time
I got rhymes like the Bronx got 
?Bohequa?
Soundbombing in your speakers
Rock for the mama citas
Hate to see the party looking like the Promise-keepers
Niggas sword-fighting and shit and wanna cock the heaters
We get retarded like we on the short school bus
Let the legacies of past emcees live through us
Big Pun, Big L, Big and Pac just to name a few
I'm sure there's niggas in your crew too
Shout they name out right here true
But then we always bang out
Slang Ton,Freaky Tye, I never got a chance to hang out with these niggas
But I feel 'em in the spirit, they still here
So my death, I'm a never fear it
Even though I can't stop it
Even though I can't stop it
Even though I can't stop it
Brooklyn where y'all at
See I'm from Flatbush
Where cats rush dancehalls and blacks bust
Shots in the air for the phat cuts and black dust
Burned on the street, I-TAL is how we eat
And we ride dollar vans smoke tree from ?fantaleaf?
Whether crown height, the park slope, the nineties
The fourth green, the Bedstuy
I used to cut Tec when I was fourteen to get high at ??? party
Leavin no evidence for ma dukes
?Ilashkee?
 kid from off the President
Niggas settling in the residence
That make the ghetto mentality have relevance
Pack metal shit but never for the hell of it
Searching for heaven until we find the truth
The kind I never got from no reverend
And the truth is the Cipha Sounds get nuff props
These other DJ cats is sweet like gum drops
Some got the fly shit that keep the slums hot
Catch a fire like Bob Marley this is just one drop
In a bucket of treats, whether the club or the streets
From cats with the bucket of seeds
To the cats that got nothing to eat
We up in this piece
Fuck the Police and tuck in the heat
Niggas bucking at beast
Really fighting for love and peace
But don't know where to aim at
Mental slaves can't see where the chains at
Ignorance is pop without no entertainer
The nations economy is a situation comedy
Corporations are making money while
The people are facing poverty
I rep for the spiritual rich, lyrically rich
Y'all niggas stand for nothing and fall for anything
Cuz you really be bitch
You feeling me kid, than turn it up a bit
You think you hot I'll shut your heat down like New York Knicks
Word is Bond
Yo, I'd like to take this opportunity right now to big up my man hi-tek
Kweli and hi-tek, reflection eternal for real
But I got one more
'Bout to let this rhyme out on probation
You like a fresh fish thrown to population
Don't give a fuck if I get rocked on your station
I got many ways to spread information
From the Black Star tour I rock nations
My moms runs the whole book store operation
Even underground niggas sell they soul to satan
And I've met commercial niggas who be hating
So I don't fall for the separation
These people are gonna grow up, I got patience
When you're ready to be free, I'll be waiting
Then every hand can go up in celebration
Get 'em up, what?!
Get 'em up, what?!
Get 'em up, what?!
Get 'em up, what?!

We gonna do this one a little different
Jean Grae, trying to test the waters with this one
(Where you gonna run?)
Not far
(Where you gonna run?)
Where you gonna go? Jean...

Alright, underground climb up, this a new line up
Niggas fight your way through
If you're not ready to lose, may I suggest that you let us the fuck through
Everybody clap your hands now, tear the walls down
Dance like Rudy Huxtable scoring a touchdown, you know
Hands in the air, knees in, knees out
Drop a little cymbal on them this time, no doubt
Let's go
Alright, ten years deep and my tenure's still deep
My bad I'm sorry I don't like when phrases repeat
I meant that a decade's almost passed since Baseball was released
And I'm struggling still hustling to eat
I must be built with adamantium skin
While y'all motherfuckers where you flushed in
With your heart poking through on your arm stupid
Drop more bombs than on Saddam's house unarmed
My mouth's a weapon I shout like Armguard steppin'
Didn't mean to get loud, no disrepect
But you know the Jean is a threat to your checks
Niggas heart burning no prowl no sec to stop the attack
Ya neck back's gettin hot on every drop on the track
And now I finally got some hate it's good, let it be known
I'll still be here after all this shit is done said and gone
Can't keep running the same formula, I'm imploring ya
To quit fucking the game up, before it fucks all of ya up

Where you gonna run
Where you gonna run
Where you gonna ruuuuuun
Where you gonna ruuuuuun
Where you gonna hide
Where you gonna ruuuuuun
Where you gonna ruuuuuun
(Kweli)
Yeah come on, yeah come on

Watch these niggas start to run soon as I hit the track
What get the sack, eyes low like Friskin' cat
My flow get cap throw they gun like official Nas
I'm draftin you niggas hard quick fast like tiptonat
Diamond cut lyrics so sharp the spit split the glass
Your mouth writing a check that you ask and quick to cash
Screaming how you quick to shoot don't even know the screenplay
Niggas rappin black and white, I rap in shades of Jean Grae
Sick of niggas licking boots I pick and choose my battles when I spit the truth it's hot
Let the pride and move the cattle
Y'all don't really want no beef, that's too real you want veal
You baby sheep hanging in the air and tend to raffle me
Me? I don't like the taste this shit's gamey
Like magazines telling lies and starting wars like Dick Chaney
It sucks though they losing they flavor like Now and Laters
When I bust them niggas run for the hills like Al Queda


She lacks delivery - really, nigga?
I pack rap symmetry and send it to ya dorm
Why y'all iggin' me for sure
Jean is synonymous to chivalry
Open doors but I step through first
Test the waters and I pee in them got no network
But now everyone's a rapper and everyone'll shoot you dead
Only lead I strapped with a razor sharp pencil
That could write but it could stab you rapid
It's all ass backwards, you're all mall performers, actors
What tho?, come on let's race to where the cash is
Get mauled like Roy the alter boy
I'll jet through you like a Jet through flight, I'm unemployed
You still cared to touch me, I gotta keeps the rap level
You face screwed ugly
I'm chasing all you club bunnies
And racing you tackle you down
Take your money with your chest on the ground
I know it's foul, what you gonna do now

Nice Things,Fuck the Money,2015.0,"Violence has come, but many argue it’s also tolerated as long as Blacks and Hispanics fight each other, and as long as they do it in their own neighborhoods

Damn right, we got it
Damn right, I’m 'bout it
Police state trying to kill us
Will they succeed? I doubt it
Y'all don’t want no problems
So lame nigas be quiet
We 'bout to start the survival
We 'bout to start the survival
(Chorus)
That’s why we can’t have nice things
That’s why we can’t have nice things
(Verse 1)
Used to race home after school
Just to turn on the tube
To catch the new videos, thought I was cool
I’m talking Snoop, Dr. Dre, to Fugees, to Biggie, to Diddy, to Wu
My O.G. will come from the spot with the loot
Like, ""Kweli you nice, niga. Hop in the booth.""
Together Forever, the name of the crew
Now, I wonder is there any real rap left; is it just me yelling no justice no peace? (hands up!)
This new video full of black death, fuck rap 'cuz we dying at the hands of the police (hands up!)
Horror movies don’t get no scarier than the way cops treating nigas in America
See more videos of cops trying to bury us than ISIS, you tell me who's the terrorist
Terrorists making bomb threats ain’t got shit on the Prison Industrial Complex
Slavery to Jim Crow, now force my kinfolk into poverty, living in the projects! (trapped!)
Coming such a long way from living like kings
Now we like bling, wanna pull up in a white thing. (you trapped, niga)
This is why we can’t have nice things
Got to be prepared for the drama that it might bring
Jealousy gonna tear us apart
They say it’s all love, but what’s in their hearts?
The product in nigas, kidnapping your wife
You’re out in the desert like what’s in the box?
In your Brad Pitt voice
So what you have is a choice
You can have all of us thinking you’re moist
Or get like Chuck D and start bringing the noise
Rap life I attack like a pit bull
Let it off like a clip full
Known to stand up to all that bullshit that you sit through
Tell the world what we’ve been through, it’s pitiful
Portrait of the artist as a young man
Raised in a borough in Brooklyn in the late 80's
Rap crazy are the crack babies who act shady when snitches start singing like the fat lady
Amadeus, you know what it is

Damn right, we got it
Damn right, I’m bout it
Police state trying to kill us
Will they succeed? I doubt it
Y'all don’t want no problems
Lame niggas be quiet
We 'bout to start the survival
We 'bout to start the survival

That’s why we can’t have nice things
That’s why we can’t have nice things

Naw, it ain’t trap rap
It ain’t backpack (what’s that?)
This is what you sound like when you have facts
And you’re facing down the cops in a gas mask
Y'all be listening to lames? Well, we past that
Half-assed rap, you can have that back
All you fake deep niggas where your hashtag at?
Cut you open on the mic when I’m showing you the light
Niggas scatter like roaches, where the black flag at?
Radio solace is coming I promise you nigas I give you a preview (it’s coming)
Transparency, that’s the key
I got nothing to hide you niggas is see through
Trans parent, no Caitlyn genital
Tatted up but you faker than henna ho
Black Star with the bars that expose you
Just like you posed nude, no centerfold

And if you miss the word, don't be afraid to press rewind
But if you got to open your eyes to see the truth
Then maybe this one ain't for you
It's 7:30, 'bout to be that time
And if you miss the word, don't be afraid to press rewind
But if you got to open your eyes to see the truth
Then maybe this one ain't for you

Every night at 7:30
Men get dirty, yo I yelled so loud the Heavens heard me
The information that I drop's so hot, it's newsworthy
Cops is askin' me who told me, I said a little birdy
Dirty listen, the way the sunset glistens is so pretty
Castin' a shadow on the grave of those who die early
Tryna get it and they got it, how could it not disturb me
Make your eyes pop out your head like you were Mr. Furley
It gets crazy

Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be
And don't at the same time
Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be
And don't at the same time

Now let me run it down about this kid we call Coolie
We called him Coolie cause his hair was curly, unruly
Young mothafucka, 14, is Ghanian
Parents moved to Flatbush in the 70s, tryna get it
On 38th between J and K
White Jewish neighborhood so they thought that they was safe
Until somethin' happened that we call gentrification
That's when the niggas move in and crackers start escapin'
It's hard as racists slangin' adjacent to the police station
When crack came out the junkies thought they were just freebasin'
They made the nigga Coolie rich, runnin' with Roger Macon
VanDevere, VIP niggas, from with them Haitians
One day in the train station
Seen the main Haitian nigga waitin' for the 2 at Franklin
Knew what he had to do to prove himself, no hesitatin'
Had a .38 and caught the 5 express to Atlantic Avenue
Waited for the local and blast through like his attitude was gangsta
Dropped the gun, tried to make a break for the park
Cops hopped out the unmarked car, put the Glock in his face
Got locked upstate, it's the wrong place to be in
Thuggin' for the crew and them niggas never came to see him
Came out when he was 30, perspective different now
Hate to see kids gettin' in the game while he was gettin' out
Before he got to his mama's crib he saw the Haitian with the same .38
And thought he murked the nigga, guess he was mistaken

Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be
And don't at the same time
Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be
And don't at the same time

The streets talk to the beat that I walk
I write rhymes in chalk outlines
And toss out lines with bait to catch wind of the word on the block
Shit happens so fast, I felt the breeze like a gun blast
And a bullet been shot
Past my ear, it's sad to hear the same shit year after year
My mama cryin' tear after tear, the hereafter is here and now
You waitin' for your Heaven to appear in a cloud
So you steady tryna get high while Hell is starin' you down
Police starin' you down, silence is deadly but your spirit is loud
Your niggas die, you pourin' beer on the ground
Standin' around, talkin' that Apocalypse shit the Apostles predict
Locked up tomorrow, quick to swallow a dick
Hollerin' ""Bitch"" to the chick who raisin' your seed
You don't acknowledge the kid
Think you got knowledge, nigga your knowledge is tricked
You're followin' myths
Niggas like to ease the pain with a bottle and a spliff
'Til the truth explode in their chest like a hollow tip, word

Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be
And don't at the same time
Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be
And don't at the same time
Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be
And don't at the same time
Sometimes life's like a drug
Trippin' me out and fuckin' me up
Makin' me what I want to be

Work It Out,The Beautiful Struggle,2004.0,"The temperature got tempers flaring
People sweat when the weather hot
They argue and they fret a lot
Then set up the plot to whet up the block
Whether or not the blood is red up in the gutter
Music is my bread and butter
I got a show in Brooklyn cause the ghetto love us
Pulled up in Mtulu's truck
I'm suited up I'm cool as fuck
Security tripping on my baseball hat
Promoter knew what's up
Plus Chaps had on some denim shorts and white tee shirt and
I told the bouncer they being disrespectful cause like you we working
I ain't a custy or a patron and
Trust me no one would be paying to come in this crusty ass club if I ain't playing
He's like ""I'll put you the fuck out""
And when you put your words like that its like third strike black you struck out
His man tried to rush me from behind Chaps stuck out a size nine
Seen him trip face first into the line
Cats is cowards with no spine and they power tripping too
The next level is the violence
So what y'all niggas wanna do

Work it out
We should try to work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read a book, pray to God
Look inside to work it out
We should try to work it out
Yo what y'all ladies wanna do
Work it out
To get fly she work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read a book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
Show the love
Lose the hate
Work it out
Work it out

People placed in situations
They can't take and what they facing
Is the trials and tribulations to make them say the lords forsaken them
Their loved ones intervening but they always end up blaming them
For problems they don't realize what they part is in creating them
Like men who so insecure think they women cheating on them
And women who think the proof that they man love them is they beating on them
Keep sleeping on them soon they partner creeping on them
Committing crimes of passion they in caskets mother weeping on them
With her head in her hands there's only one thing that the dead understand
That it's better to be alive
Now what you gonna do stick your head in the sand
You probably the type to fall for anything and take that instead of a stand
Now that's a mouse instead of a man
I cherish my role as the head of my fam
And on the road I meet incredible fans
I rock with singers an a DJ instead of a band
We at a theatre near you
So what y'all niggas wanna do


Stay civilized when they try to kill my high
I try to think through problems
Bring honesty to rap like Cam'ron brought the pink to Harlem
You could be on the brink to stardom and suddenly you sink to bottom
Tell the truth about the war and suddenly you linked Saddam
Hate the topic but the closet people get to patriotic
Is red bull white vodka mixed with the straight hypnotic
Paper prophets sell the revolution so they make a profit
Trust they got it fucked up with your taxes started making rockets
Take it off the top like politicians speaking proper diction
Stuffing dollars in they britches like they do a lotta stripping
Got the top position bitching about the quality of life
All that bullshit get exposed as soon as Kweli sees the mic
They cutting down the tree of life
The sun rays is running out
The babies ain't eating right
The guns stay coming out
See how they play the streets an night slap the taste out your mouth
To show you what they work about
So what y'all niggas wanna do",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-work-it-out-lyrics

In the jungle
Yea
Right there
Yo
Yo Hi-tek (whatchu wanna do)

What's next
These chicken neck mc's get me vexed
My rhymes be blowin up chatrooms all over the internet
Then cause their collisions on the highway of information
And then i head back to my prior engagement
In the nation of brooklyn
Land of trinis, haitians, jamacains and bejans
Its amazin how lickin shots is the proper representation
Soon they gonna need whack MC reservation
Cuz i endangered the mothafuckas, they needin preservation
Carry em home on top of a truck like a trophy
Niggas still sleepin like im jay-z in a video for hawaiian sophie
Its cool i stay low key, and keep a low pro
Come out crushin shit just for fun, co flow
(ay yo yo yo yo yo yo yo) here we go
Ridin on the sound wave out ya stereo
In the procession to ya burial
Callin hi-tek, little leon the professional
I got the special flow, listenin to estero
Puffin vegetables and now im red to go
The illest rhyme animal like chuck
Burn these niggas like salt when i lay in the cut
Think you about to blow when you continue to suck
The shit i been through make me run up in ya venue like what
I snatch the mic and ask the crowd 'what chyall waitin for'
The said 'nothin but that fat shit', 'i got you say no more'
I laid the law, and all the crab rappers played the floor
I called them out, a couple of them stepped up and i ate em raw
Some more whack niggas tried to spray the door, but had no aim
Later for them corn balls
On the way out smacked them in the face with a metaphor
For better or for worse, you better call the nurse
Before i send the cleaner and he get to your hospital room first

Yo
Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line
Ya whole plan is catchin tan in my sunshine
One time cuz it's some kinda wonderful
Dont just stand there lookin stupid whatchu wanna do?
Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line
Ya whole plan is catchin tan in my sunshine
One time cuz it's some kinda wonderful
Dont just stand there lookin stupid

I take your style and embarass it
Words beautifully written like arabic
Got niggas on the run cuz i bring the fire like chariot
Introduced pen skills to ill deliveries and married it
Put it in your face like big gats and carried it like Harriet
Various crews tried to bury us, but we shot em down like sagiterious
With that watch shit money, you can't be serious
You niggas is hilarious, actresses runnin around the club
Pissy like ghetto matresses
, thats why i smack these kids back to reality, and how it be in actuality, im ready to battle mc's and skip the fuckin formalities
We spark it, at any club or meat market sweet artists dont come on the block they become street targets
If you want it i got it, come and get it I'm wit it, your career will be shorter than a midget and the whole world will know who did it
I smack up these ho ass MC's like a gorilla pimp, you comin out the box like a gimp money you still a wimp
My shit blow out filaments in light fixtures, with the right mixture, words uses color the paint the right picture
Craft masterpieces, your whole shit is smashed to pieces make you look at your man who rhyme and be like 'you not nasty like he is'
Believe this when you see this, and dont fuck with me either, cuz youll be down where my feet is, curled up in a fetus
Cryin from the kicks, watch when i flip, people gonna be buyin my shit like fiends dyin for a hit, so
Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line
Ya whole plan is catchin tan in my sunshine
One time cuz it's some kinda wonderful
Dont just stand there lookin stupid whatchu wanna do?
Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line

Yo, this is a capitalist society
Yo!
Hello world, how y'all doin?
Don't be shy, y'all can wave back, man
I know y'all can't see me
Oh you got it?

Talib Kweli ichiban in Japan is mush-mush
Yo, I'm able to keep it fresh like veggie tables and couscous
Got my comp in a catch deuce-deuce
Livin proof, you want the truth?
Nah, you can't handle the truth
I flip it like any Angelo, be it Michael- or D'
Paint the ceiling with my sounds, smoke trees with melodies
I enter the palace with no malice intended
If l's make you cough a chalice is recommended
Particularly filled with sticky that I got from Manny
I'm breakin mics like Amy Fisher breakin a family
It can be, all so simple if you let it
If you don't want to, fuck it, forget it, yo, don't sweat it
You feel little
When you let the power of the rhythm hit you
White Widow got my eyes Chinese
But sharp as leaves
Of paper cuttin your skin
Whenever I write with my pen
And make a point
Y'all be like, ""Yeah, that's the joint""
Yo Matt, got the track on they DAT
That make it easy to complete
Cause I write shit with or without a beat
See you on the hook like a fish
We knock it out, no doubt, the shit fixed
Like carols at Christmas
So bounce, come on, bounce, come on
I lock you in my sentence and the shit's a run-on
Tokyo, where you at?
Brooklyn, where you at?

Kweli next to be up, so I suggest you re-up
Or freeze up like you hear a shot
Now I can trace the tracks of all the teardrops
Of every single MC in earshot
I fear not or none, number one
Ichiban, none, number one, ichiban

I get my camouflage from Weiss/Mahoney
My rhymes are worth the price of Sony
Your light like last for one minute like Rice-A-Roni
Son, I'm nice, you're phoney
It seems all you want in life's to know me
I'm colder than when the ground's covered with ice and it's snowy
One and only Talib Kweli from Eternal Reflect
Yo, I come to Tokyo where everything is Hi-Tek
So I feel right at home, rightin poems, fightin clones
Who bite my own style cause they ain't got one
I got drive while you ride shotgun
Please stop, son
I watch _Get on the Bus_ a lot
And all this shabuya has got to stop
I'm just playin, Japanese culture is like amazin
Animation is like hair-raisin
Kick selection got no limit
Eatin seaweed, maybe one day I get with it
But when I see weed I'm smokin
Heh, I'm just jokin
Really not though
My homie Common told me, ""Arigato""
My art got no
Boundaries like Pablo Picasso
Who? You don't know, you never knew
Big up to Ru
See you in the show on the Avenue
Of the Americas
Etcetera, etcetera
You get the point, you want hot shit, I got a plethora
Classics, it's the best of
Brooklyn, New York City
So we're never comin shitty
I get more love in Japan than _Hello Kitty_
Such a pity, these MC's think they hangin with me
Catch me on Japanese MTV with Mos Diddy

Kweli is next to be up, so I suggest you re-up
Or freeze up like you hear shots
Now I can trace the tracks of all the teardrops
Of every single MC in earshot
I fear not or none, number one

Slap Niggas,The Beautiful Mixtape Vol. 2: The Struggle Continues,UnKnown,"Catalyst raps, crackers out to add to the stats
They're manufacturing gats to kill Latins and blacks
If it ain't each other it's black on Latin or Latin on black
Both get a box, one in the dirt, one up in Adirondacks
These rappers on wax, was growing up
Their mom, dad, even cat was on crack
Yeah get on and yap on a track
Call it what you want, black hating or mad rap
All that material crap ain't abstract, shit's mad wack
My flow is here to show what the difference is
Blind folks follow a book in which they don't really know the significance
Religion ain't feeding babies or curing the sicknesses
These Jehovah's Witnesses need to open some businesses
Spitting with no specificness
Blow the mischief and show prolificness
Ain't too many MCs that could go the distances
Father had it on since Matawan, fought Babylon
Sick of y'all, pick a wall for your brain to get splattered on
Whoever said bad is wrong, never slept on a pissy mattress
In a cell on the same tier there's a faggot on
Hawked cause you got ratted on
Rough said a burner is like a magic wand
Abracadabra, crackers is gone (they gone)
Outta here (motherfucker)
Wish I had a magic wand (fuck is y'all niggas talking bout)
And all y'all fake rapping niggas (hit em in the head nigga)
Answer me this:

What makes ya cool to be a gangsta?
What makes ya cool to be a thug?
What is it that's so cool about possibly
Getting hit in your head with a slug?
What makes ya cool to be hip hop?
What makes a grown man wanna crip walk?
What is the reason I swear to fucking God
That I seen George Bush with a pitchfork

I slap niggas, kicking that wack nigga shit in my ear
My vision is clear, we see the same shit every year
People still shedding tears for names said in they prayers
We need change, the evidence here, but this is never what the president hear
They stick to they lies, and peddle they fear
And so I pimp the system, watch it shed its brassiere
Hunt em down, put em up on the mantle like the head of a deer
You can feel it in your heart when your enemy near, yeah
The moment that you bought this, the route you're taking is alternate
The way I'm walking and talking they call it ultimate, ultimate
Find your girl coordinates, all up in it, we intimate
She calling cause I get her wet, you balling, but you ignorant
I'm proficient in reading the body language, you illiterate
A little bit of class wouldn't hurt, you should consider it
I'm flashy with the lyrics, a nigga funny and serious
Spectacular vernacular, all the honeys is curious
Kweli, the one I'm running and I'm shining like the sun in it
Hitting like a ton of bricks since Hulk Hogan was Thunderlips
Never with the fronting shit, draw me some blood with it
Beat you down with the belt buckle, brass knuckles shit",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-slap-niggas-lyrics
Every Ghetto Pt. 2,UnKnown,2016.0,"Here in the ghetto
Everywhere
Children are killed, children are dying
In the ghetto
Yea

Silence is prayer, prayer is love, love is faith, faith is service
When I’m cuttin’ the strings of the puppets
That live in the ghetto, Geppettos is always nervous
They love when we clutter the gutters
And never discover our truest purpose
And praying in vanity, that’s the real profanity
Not all that swears are curses
“I swear!” Play it loud like Spike Lee’s father
Bangin’ the drum, when we hang in the slums
The beat is knocking the odds are never even
It’s far from the Garden of Eden
The starving is robbin’ and theivin’
We bobbin’ and weavin’ the mark of the beast
Like Muhammad Ali, no you’re not gonna keep me here

Here in the ghetto
Everywhere
Children are killed, children are dying
In the ghetto

They only let you school ‘em when you got money, drugs and guns
All up in your backpack
Got it for days when it get darker than them Aloe Blacc naps
Respect my name, I get disrespectful as back slaps
When I shoot your dog then some alley cats gon’ sure clap back
Put holes in heads like snapbacks
But in that fact I don’t mean this right, yes, demon fight
He lean to write, bullets hit his soul, he cling to life
That’s just what I seen, but I’m tryna change it too
But stayin’ aware at the same time, see that’s what the change’ll do to you
This money done fucked me up a tad
I could blame it on life, or the fact that I was an early dad
But fuck that, that’s some cop-out shit
Sleepin’ them stereotypes on some knock-out shit
Show these marks I ain’t playin’ no games on some lock out shit
This for them niggas that keep the work movin’ when the cops out
Cause even if I’m doing right, y’all throw the tear gas up in my house
So I might as well get the bread cause the billy club gon’ hit my head anyway
War time, make me innovate, cop I emulate what you demonstrate
Cause it’s here

Here, in the ghetto
Everywhere
Children are killed, children are dying
In the ghetto
Here, in the ghetto
Everywhere
Children are killing and dying
In the ghetto

The leaders are asking what good is a rapper? (Good question)
Well what come first, the hood or the rapper? (Good question)
When factoring the nigga factories that we trapped in
The rappin’ is pretty accurate
With love, we cold-blooded assassins
In the ghettos are lingos
Children with polio sellin’ smack in the grid of traffic
Killing each other for scraps, this shit is pretty graphic
Where love resides, like This American Quilt except it’s a shitty fabric
Malcolm said “Make it plain” but still we getting’ elaborate
The labyrinth, the towers of Babylon, the road less travelled on
We tapping into the power within, the stables rattle on
We put the saddle on, but hold a pale horse
Black on black crime is a myth they make us believe with sheer force
You can change what you wear and the effects will never wear off
The cops shot the dealer to stop and got a man off
Scientists too busy trying to reverse erectile dysfunction and hair loss
To worry about these niggas who shootin’ after a stare-off

Here in the ghetto
Everywhere
Children are killed, children are dying in the ghetto
Here in the ghetto
Everywhere
Children are killing and dying in the ghetto
Everywhere
Here in the ghetto
Everywhere
Children are killing and dying in the ghetto

My Mamma Said,The Beautiful Mixtape Vol. 2: The Struggle Continues,UnKnown,"Even though these crackers hate me
They can never break me
They can only motivate me to rise
Even though these niggas judge me
They could never fade me
Because my mamma raised me with love
Even though these crackers hate me
They can never break me
They only motivate me to rise
Even though these niggas judge me
They could never fade me
They could never touch me

Yeah, although my mamma raised me with love
Snakes laid in the cut
They want me laid in the mud
Throw salt in the cuts
So when I talk I cuss
When I walk I strut
I dip it all in the dutch
When I blaze and I contemplate
Sometimes it's hard to concentrate
Tired of jake trying to stop my people right to congregate
My girl want me to quit smoking
But every door been closed only way I get open
Is putting something in the air
It's been part of my life since fifteen
I'm rolling the spliff clean
With the cigarette holder
As a nigga get older
Addiction is a chip on my shoulder
This is the shit that the soldier play before he go to battle
The song that haunt the loser dream when he throw the towel
Snitch niggas known to tattle
As bitch niggas run into official niggas who known to blast you


What I know? I'm supposed to be dead by 24
But if a nigga got that shit it in his head how can he grow?
I was raised up not to be led by any ho
Got exposed to the game from a different angle
When you young black and poor there's places you can't go
Ain't no big pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Still, I'm thankful
Even on them hungry days when my belly ain't full
I know what I came through
I was raised this way
N I double-G A
Sucka-free all day every day
From the womb to the grave
Baptized in the game
Early age
Dirty thirty-eight special in my waist
Getting paid blowing weed like it ain't no thang
Rolling blunts getting drunk and it ain't gon' change
I let my khakis bang
White tee Chuck T's on my feet
Hollering ""Fuck the Police!""
Got some fresh gold teeth - my nigga!",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-my-mamma-said-lyrics

Is nothing

Loving, loving, loving...

Ever you made love out in the rain
But your body so hot
That the water does not ??? in the flame
So arise to the brain???
??? Profanities coming out of you
And you shouting out my name
I'm the truth like I'm coming out ???
We are on the top of the world
And to reach this level had to climb a mountain of pain
But we are here now
Noting to fear now
Everything clear now
I ain't to tear down walls to your heart now
Every single stare down
Calling for sex
So emotional tear gonna fall
I applaud your agility
Should you really be deserving an encore standing ovation
Old faces, Got you feeling all flush
Cause we are touching in public places
In the studio ???
Making amateurs movies in a condo
You gonna need a toe-tag like John Doe
When I'm wilding out with my tongue like Jon Snow
Every sword need a chief
Animal attraction like I'm lord of the beast
You are the lioness
And you roar so loud
Niggas call the police

Doesn't matter
Where we get down
Ever come over us
Doesn't matter
Where we get down
Ever come over us

Well I can tell you what did not happen to you
You didn't get your ass on this Cathedral mixtape
Sissyyyyyyyyy

For not knowin' the ways you can be capped like a NBA salary
Lives taken haphazardly, them sons of bitches is bastards, G
That's why I be high B, so don't ask me why I'm not speakin' nigga
Just ain't countin' no money up wit' cha
The fuck we got to talk about?
Not seachin' for Bobby Fischer
But somethin' sticky and super official
To burn with my girls in the parkin' lot
Surrounded by 'em before I got out
Parched aren't we?
Honestly shorty, let me check make sure I ain't got no fleas up on me
From minglin' with them ol' pussy ass niggas and dog ass bitches
Old veterans get bit by the youngins
I swear to God that them puppies 'll kill ya
Field of dreams, they come true if you build it
So I made myself if y'all can dig it

Everywhere I go we roll up
Everywhere I go we pour up
I know you think you shinin' nigga, so what?
It wasn't going down til we showed up
You know it's going down-n-n
You know it's going down-n-n

Across the water or across the border
See my second line deep like I’m from New Orleans
You a snitch nigga type that’ll call the law
So before the slaughter I get my thoughts in order
Seen your rapper on stage you and your little crew
We so sick of these Thelonius dudes
Annoyance grew and the audience boo
We had enough of your corny excuse
Living in the world of my own adventure
Life a gunfight, a knife is your only weapon
You don’t really know what the fuck you stepped in
Better chill right now, life such a blessing
Save the feedback, where the weed at?
Imagine me at an intervention
You the one who need an intervention
To stop you from interruptin’ sessions
Wow that’s such a nasty habit
Wow this marijuana marriage got my wifey jealous
I get selfish when I’m making fuckin’ classics
Amsterdam or California, Washington, Oregon or Colorado
When we blaze in the club the Jamaican bud
Got me feelin’ so special, no bravado


Hey ya I emerge from the south with the mind to get paid
Cup of some drank keep it stuck in my ways
Livin’ life tryna catch me a wave
In the same state they used to wholesale slaves
Pimp tight nigga hold up
Presidential when I roll up, like a playa do
She in love put nothing above purest the drug in a day or two
That’s a playa move, in this game of life can’t cruisade or lose
You gotta be willin’ to be the villain to give it  gator shoes
I heard it from an old school kid, say I had an old school soul
Told me I was bound to be great, never fall for the fake
And never ever chase no ho, gotta make that dough
Crack my seal, pop my trunk and work my wheel
Cause every now and then, reflect on times
That I ain’t have dimes to fuck or dough to spend
So I gotta keep my mind right, forever run from the limelight
I don’t need no fame, my aura shine so bright
I’m a star in my own right, forever loyal to the game

Exploring every options while the water still trying to feed cops yeah
Everything a vibe but it's still the same
Only the real remain when i kill the game
Running over the niggers in a renter hearse
Then i erks tire marks tire marks
Wait that's a Kendrick verse
None i ain’t have to steal that
What's left when all of your layers are peeled back
Got a mind like a steel trap

The cops trying to kill us we can’t ignore that
Some rally some riot
Government selling up bull shit and we buying
Giving us all sort of drugs and we try it
I’ve never been to a court with a judge that ain’t bias
Look at the conviction rate i got the colour that the system hate
Wait face facts as they face us the racist trying to erase us
Beat us to the truth then erase us
History is a high story Knee high
Don't watch exodus no one is our story
Rearrange the past no one is our glory
Not even the colours of my brothers will ride for me


Hip hop is still evolving from stealing vaults
Some of these real life shit dont appear in blogs
Rap niggers soft this ain’t a pillow talk
At the club ain't saying nothing when they kill us all
Ah silence but you say you real ya that's how you feel huh
Ey yo fro real bro riders better watch who you steal from
A true steal gun tighter than the steel drum
We on that crazy steel drum
Smoking that B real what the fuck you feel one
Wow you niggers acting real young

Dave West is what I'm talkin' about, you know?
Yea yea yea yo yea yo yea yea yea yo yea yo Yea yea yea yooohh yooohh

Make a joy for noise until the lord people are floored
Cause the pen is mightier than the sword
Leavin' the floor
Cause my words cut deeper than a tissue massage
I got hooks and lines that sink y'all like a fisherman's rod
I'm on mission for God he blessed me to spit it this hard
A lot of niggas start shit but they don't finish the job
I'm like Minister Farrakhan or Africans who finished a marathon
The pain in my voice is like Sarah Vaughn
No matter what playin' 'em on I carry on
Even if the dawn lit overhead I carry on
Like Flash Gordon the Scar on my Face is Brad Jordan
Passports splash with blood from the battle I last fought in
I want to cash all in
Or I start breakin' like glass jaw I put The Blast on 'em like my last tourin'
Or fast forward just to catch what I said
Yo I say some shit like that just to mess with your head, come on

Grabbin' the black steel, bowh
In the hour of chaos
We ain't rappin' till they pay us, is that real?
We got babies
We got bills
Put your hands up in the air if you know how I feel
And let it out (let it out)
Get it out (get it out)
Work it up (work it up)
Sweat it out
I don't know
If you know
My history I do it big
Like Notorious did
Get on and play like this according to kid
Gangster like knock out Ned like Little Zane slayed all on his wiz
Crazy like the little hand on the seven, the big hand on the six
J-Lo, yo
Whether you all in the mix or if you stay low
Everybody say hoooo hoooo hoooo hoooo

I don't know
If you know
My history you don't know me
Choke the game till it's blue like a varicose vein
And I can't remember the last time I felt this terrible pain
And the whole shit blew up
Was it in vain?
They'll be lookin' through the rubble like they searchin' for Hussein
I'm lookin through the club I'm really searchin for who's sane
The music got everyone crazy and who to blame
Be prepared think there'll be some ugliness up in here
End up in intensive care with the vegetables there, you know?

It's the black hand bustin' the tech
Gettin' it wet without bustin' a sweat
Swingin' for the upper deck
It's the black man cuttin' a check
The nigga's the boss
The niggers want to test if they addicted to laws
I spit on the floor
The right hook will get at your jaw
Make the track my baby mama when I'm hittin' it raw
I rap through:
Wars and tours and whores on the floors I did it for force
So I spit at all the shit that I saw
I party with supermodels who wanna take of they clothes
The ones who smokin' cocaine so they don't fuck up they nose
I walked the slums of Soweto and the streets of Havana
Takin' pictures with kids who never seen a camera
From the land of the Alabama since the night in the Cali
Bumpin' gangster music like a freedoms song in the rally
Out the back of yo' Dinnali give you the skinny like Ally McBeal

I don't smoke the haze if it ain't got the crystals
Look in my eyes you can tell I would lift you
I'm in the DB nine when I'm comin' to get you
I'm with my Arab man and he holdin' the missiles
I'm sayin' fuck all y'all
If you don't understand let me make it real clear I'm sayin' what to all y'all
No more videos or them silly hoes ridin' on y'all dick when I cut all y'all
The game too pussy I think it need change
I wanna see the barrel flame 'til they brains get mushy
East Coast Ghost
Ain't no other rapper in the game that you know that plays the streets so close
Still bring pain
Fire more shots than y'all motherfuckers do in that Max Payne game
Anybody front I'm knockin' 'em out D blockin' 'em out
That mean I'mma snatch his chain

Ain't nobody fuckin' with Kweli
And the rock with a real name like a Styles P
Represent the L.O.X
Big up to all the massive rude boy on deck
Niggas yellin' out what the blood clot
Lick enough shots, finna bust a flow like buckshot
What's up Franklin Avenue?
These Brooklyn niggas runnin' wild through the jungle like caribou
Rap immaculate
I spit fire that will get tobacco lit faster than the rider on the chariot
Old school and cooler than the river watered downstream
Hit the block hotter than them grits poured on Al Green
The cops flashin' the lights, passin' them bikes
Ask for ya rights and they beat you like ""The Passion Of Christ""
They got a sicker fetish for violence than Mel Gibson
We inject it in our system through direct television
The way I'm spittin' Heaven through the Hell we living
It's like fate is a fakery style you can tell it's written
It's like a jail when you're sittin' in a cell or prison
With destiny comin' in the form of some mail or a visit
Yea opportunity's knockin'
Like the beat, cuz I got Pete Rock and Beatminerz in my hemoglobin
Premier Show and Diamond D

It’s Like That,The Beautiful Mixtape Vol. 2: The Struggle Continues,UnKnown,"(Intro)
YEAH! Ludacris in this muthafucka
What up Talib
Disturbing tha Peace Godamnit
We just getting started
Mixtape style it goes like this, look here:
Now Ludacris out the gate and damn it it's hunting season
When you shot remember everything happens for a reason
And you never hit it right: that's why I'm snatching your girl
She calls me Mr. Drummond - cause Diff'rent Strokes rule the world
I got a, thirst for knowledge and a appetite for drama
Or appetite for destruction, and a thirst for your mama
Either way I keep it going 'til that thang is empty
Been nice since Mike Tyson punched Soda Popinski
Chicks keep getting stung cause they're all in my swarm
Plus I step in they dorm and get more cheers than Norm!
It's 2004 the world needs more lesbians
And more drunk drivers, to hit drunk pedestrians
They walk around here with two left feet
But warm milk and cold gat'll put yo ass to sleep
I'm in these streets still no matter how ugly it seems
Long as I got on my bulletproof Buddy Lee jeans

Kweli and 'Cris
Niggas never heard no shit like this
Yeah, I got your chick feeling moist
You coming softer than an ad in the back of the Village Voice
You still a toy
The cops is still the boys
They trying to get me to vote by saying the lesser of two evils is still a choice
Well maybe or maybe not
Niggas rhyming like they got 80 Glocks
You home watching I Love the 80's - STOP
Picture the ocean with the panoramic view
My flow the iceberg that the Titanic ran into
Ooh I, rock like suicide victims who wear flannel
While your rhymes sound like they was written by Clear Channel
I used to, drive through 50 states and hear 50 flows
Now every city knows the same song, It's just a game of pimps and hoes
And the kids think the key to get down in the game
Is to copy the hot nigga and start sounding the same
Now you trying to be heard but your shouts is in vain
Cause you drowned out by the buzz that's surrrounding my name, you lame
The mic is something that you can't pry from me
Shout out to I-20
Sha my rhymes is good money
Whether rollin' with Achmed and Dervin swerving the street
To where Chaka Zulu, Shawnna and Luda Disturbing tha Peace
I murder the beat
I'm the nightmare that recur in your sleep
My word is the flesh like the wafer that the nun got the converted to eat
They say he's the lamb of God herded the sheep
A whole flock of followers, nigga do you believe?

Yo what's poppin' it's the kid Game
And my nigga Ludacris
My homeboy, my dawg, my brother from another mother, Talib Kweli
And this is how we do it man, hate it or love it
Yes who fresher than I?
'didas red and black lumberjack 45 in his Levi's
Yeah since knee highs
I watched Easy E rise
Put LA on illmatic but they ain't believe Nas
Now it's '96 in the Jeep high
Ta told me they don't believe you start writing rhymes after B-I-G died
Eyes puffy, some niggas saying fuck me
Cause I'm from the west, I'm fresh and I idolize Doug E
Now NY hug me still niggas want to hate
I'm embraced by 50 states and the westside love me
Bids told Dre I'm the nigga to chase
And it been that way since the beef with Jigga and Mase
And my Chuck Taylors red ones with the phat laces
Tan khakis desert eagle with the hollow tip laces
Fresh white tee, yellow rocks in my necklace
Real gangstas drink 40 ounces for breakfast
I eat Fatburgers three times a day
So fuck you if don't like the red paint on my six tre'
I was born in the hood, I be who I be
And me and Kweli is like Mack 10 and WC",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-its-like-that-lyrics

We gon' take charge, make gods out of men
We gon' raise bars, show y'all how to win

In your fridge, I keep it Brooklyn like Jamaican soda, escovitch

Baby’s locked in cages
Mamas look twice they ages
Starvation’s too much to stomach
This must be Reaganomics
These ain’t for Martin Luther
Don’t let that name dupe ya
And how he’s born violent
He’s on that younger future
On my block, boys with they hair
Walk like two miles, sell crack rock
And sell some samilia
It sound familiar?
Mi hombre, this is our familia
Addicted felons, gun stealers
And dope dealers
And I’m from where coke is captain
And you can buy whole in the back
Of your block, in a napkin
By themselves, children are left to fend
So we indulge in sin
Do what it takes to win
Push off, shoot that jump
But please check yourself, we win

Your Georgia homeboy
Killer kill
Putting it down for the ghetto)

Ride with cracked up bumpers
Do what it takes to win

We mix our fight with hands
We burn our dro slow
Only with our closest friends
We never scared
We ride and die for one another
This ain’t my boy
This boy here, he’s my brother
For him my blood’ll spill
For him I will kill
This is true, my testimony live from Dixie Hills
This is Killa Kill, live I rest from Adamsville

Before he toured school, my father was an entertainer
Traveling through the south with a band of the crackers love to hang ya
He stayed with me while I know most niggas pots is strangers
Got soo gangsta, godfather to my cousin in van
My suns is daily green
These is the roots of my family tree
My path is locked, I'll hand you the key
I ran through the streets, niggas can't advantage of me
I've seen calamities, soo much insanity, oh the humanity
From a place where niggas keep the game face of the grills
And go to the steel to make it real just to pay off some bills
While robbing and killing is just basic skills
But still niggas documented on those tapes of film
Bullets gon' hit you in your stomach, near where your spleen be
And rip you open, split six pack in half the mean three
Yeah put addicts in the order, manics, yeah the hood have it
You know the hood pack it, leave you in the wood jagged
I wish you would actin', Brooklyn don't act a fool
When apex tack only way to pack a tool
I got the flappers, you know the swagger with attitude
Nigga piss in my ear, I let 'em go like ladders do
Oh you wanna battle dude? You my challenger? I'm bad for you
Make a snappy dude become a grown ass man, dawg, this shit I have to do, bad for you
When I spatter you back up a few feet away
When niggas laugh at you, you feel like there's something you need to say?

You now rocking with the best BK MC
This is how we put it down O four
Kweli the great I be the first out this gate
I get cake stop that you making a mistake
I gives a fuck if the label can't get straight
I get paid with this mixtape like I flip weight
Yo, stay away from those state paid vacations
Nigga raw like Kane when he played Jason
From the generation of crack babies and aids patients
I go hard you niggas soft like Clay Aiken
Plus you only hard when the camera on
Soft like the foundation you standing on rhyme marathon
Sort of like when Diddy ran the city
Fuck with us and guns pop out like Janet's titty
Yo, I got niggas ready for the main event
That's why I'm still around and all those corny niggas came and went
Top shotter rocking with Trotter and got the Game on deck
Stroll through any hood and get the same respect

Comptons Kool G Rap, black All Stars
10 khakis and a red Blue Jay hat
I’m lowridin' on 100 spoke daytons
Nigga with an attitude like Nas buying jewelry from Jacob
I’m don’t play that mixtape shit
Say my name and I buck 50 ya face like Miami Haitian
I’m gangsta homie, check my verse
I’m lyrically Big Daddy Kane in Converse
And niggas think we just Boys N The Hood
And the city of angels got poisoned by Suge
I take the drama, roll it up in a swisher
Let Kweli hit it then lower the switches
I’m 3 wheelin’, through the Wilshire district
Thinking how Big and Pac both died by pistols
L.A. Times called it the Death Row conspiracy
Run up on my 6-4, i’ll take out ya misery

Straight out the frying pan into the game
If yall attention is paid no need to mention the name
I breathe the fire that can fire back drenching your brain
Velvet rope or gold chain it's all a lynching the same
You in tuned to a world of pain
It hurt like new shoes with nothing to lose
The world to gain
To yall fools to brainiacs high iqs
If you feel it ain't banging than it's not my music
Can't stagnate the haters can't stop my movement
Play this at high volume and get you shocked off stupid
Ya kiddin me, here come a taste of escapism
Tell your people there will be something left to take with em
You see me lifting mics I be steady weightlifting
I'm zoning out silhouettes get to shapeshifting
Watch me force perpetrating like they ain't slippin
Kwa we about to hit em up catch another victim

Yea check this out
Let me tell yall niggas something about shit
Cuz motherfuckers try and do it to you everyday
Try and shit on you right?
Check this out
Don't shake the shit off
Cuz when you shake the shit off
You never know where the shit is going to land
Could land on your girl could land in your food could land on your car
Man, let the shit slide off you homey and hit the ground
Cuz when you shake it off you have no idea where it lands

The way we be, shuttin down the function
I make my name end any emcee discussion (Who?)
Outta whose whips more fatter, who rock the most ice
While my subject matter shatter your whole concept of nice
You can look throughout history books to see whose liver
I'm prehistoric, got the Eye of the Sabertooth Tiger too
Rip into the flesh of the track
Counterattack before you act with insight
I see clear you blind as a bat
Dwellin in caves, tellin the slaves what'chu think they wanna hear
I swear, my aunt told me the definition of fear is
'Fuck everything and run,' that's what you did
But the party just begun and we rockin 'til we see the sun

Open letter to President Barack Obama (2008),UnKnown,UnKnown,"It is the last year of the Bush Administration and thank God. I usually rail against being described as simply ""political rapper,"" and I haven't voted since Bill Clinton first ran for president. I was following the tradition that black Americans have had of voting for Democrats since we got the right in 1964 (temporarily). Then, Clinton, as president's go, seemed better than Bush Sr., but I did not like his policies in Sudan or the constant bombing of Iraq. I also did not like the way our government dragged us through the Lewinsky Scandal. I felt betrayed by the system, and I stopped voting, no longer accepting of the lesser of two evils. I knew the two party system was designed to fail us. I knew that politicians must lie for a living, because it would be impossible to make good on their promises. I knew about the lobbyists and the PAC. I did not make it my issue, but if someone asked me, I would explain why I didn't vote. Most of the time people talked to me like I lost my mind, but every once and awhile someone understood. I knew that our ancestors fought and died for the right to vote, but I didn't feel like voting for the lesser of two evils in a broken system was the proper way to honor them. It was pageantry, and I wasn't with it. I wasn't with Vote or Die, because I knew that voting itself, with no real knowledge of who is paying these candidates to run million dollar a day campaigns, is far from a revolutionary act. I haven't even started to talk about the electoral college that they taught us about in grade school. In this republic, delegates votes are counted, and states with more land have more votes. You can technically have more votes, but lose the election. When the verdict is in question, the Supreme Court decides, as they did when Al Gore clearly won the election but lost due to bipartisan bullshit. The bankers of the world pay our politicians, and often tailor laws and regulations to line their own pockets. I have often stated that I cannot participate in a system that not only is designed to see me fail, but corrupts itself as well.
This was all before Barack Obama threw his hat in the ring. I, like many, appreciated his effort from the sidelines, watching him do the dance on the news. I found myself relating to him and enjoying hearing him speak, but I still remained distrustful of politicians in general. I felt like I could serve my community in many ways on a grassroots level that proceeded politics. I started to see the Obama campaign doing that grassroots work. I hear him speaking about poor people, the environment, things that I haven't heard from politicians who have electability. My criticism of the political system is that it siphons out rational thought because who have to be all things to all people. You can't stand for anything doing that. I remember when Obama spoke out against the war, early. I think the time he spent as a civil rights attorney on Chicago's South Side gives him a unique perspective. I often hear about his lack of experience, but his experience is one that I most closely identify with. I'm not saying I could be president, but I am saying that our government could use a new energy. In order for a revolution to happen, you need revolutionary writers, soldiers, teachers, poets, musicians, garbage-men, cab drivers, politicians, across the board. Everyone will not always agree, but the things we agree on, we should strengthen. When I was younger, none of this really mattered. Now I have two beautiful children, and Barack Obama is an incredibly positive influence on them. I want them to know they can be anything they want.
With that said, I still feel the same as I do about the political system, and one man can't change it. But this man deserves our support nonetheless. I appreciate what he's doing, and there comes a time in history when change is necessary for all of us to prosper. I can't be critical of a society that is scared of change, but be stubborn in my ways for the sake of it. I support Barack Obama and encourage others to take a real look at his campaign so they can come to their own conclusions. I am not delusional about what the office of the president represents, but my support for him is just that, support for someone speaking my language amidst an ocean of double-talk. Thank you for you time.

City Playgrounds,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What we have here
Is the alpha and the omega
I spit it, bare witness to the greatest
And the latest, they try to hate us
Witness the evolution of spitting, it's wicked and it's decadent
Revolutions per minutes, every time the record spin
Retribution for cynics, like a stick-up kid with weapons
In Brooklyn, they say I run it, the 'Natti is checking in
No matter the terminology, blood splatter artistically
It's looking like a Jackson Pollock painting, it's a mystery
Really should be brothers united against the industry
The African diaspora scatter with shattered history
The game missing me, rap is so repetitive
Although I ain't your blood or your cuz, it's all relative
I got a gang of rhymes, and Tones' beats is banging
We moving through the streets like we're slanging dimes
It's magical, how the track's so classical
The cats who got gassed up in their sweats like Plaxico
I'm back from my sabbatical, voice of the future, black radical
Keeping all the damages collateral
Listening to instrumentals
Thinking about all the things I've been through
The music is just a peek into my life, it's a window
It's so high tech and it's all so simple
And if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hey yo, I'm taking all bets and settling all debts
A giant leap for man begins with a small step
From a sword to a set, to my people on the picket line
Who's sicking of getting treated like them aliens in District 9
I juxtapose my business model with my spirit
What I'm just supposed to keep you comfortable with the lyrics?
I know the flow's disturbing, I know for certain just because
You know all about the artist don't mean you know the person
You don't know me, I run labels
These unstable rappers so phony
I try to listen but they're boring as missionary position
So I'm shitting on these niggas like dysentery conditions
I'm sitting on the throne, you dreaming that it's empty soon
Nobody feeling you, you're screaming in an empty room
The tree that fall in the forest, nobody hearing you
Even though you fall the hardest, don't get me started
Listening to instrumentals
Thinking about all the things I've been through
The music is just a peek into my life, it's a window
It's so high tech and it's all so simple
And if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Yo, I build up my defenses when I'm left to my devices
Time gets suspended, more than DMX's driver's license
My music's steady, not affected by the higher prices
People having sex in the streets like Dionysus
You know what my advice is? Fuck my advice, live your life
Stop tripping like everything amount to crisis
I make the sacrifices, my history is black as ice is
I don't think that I can trust you if you're lacking vices
I never miss a beat, the liquor make me slurred, it takes my words
Tries to twist them like a Swisher Sweet with sticky herbs
American History X, your teeth'll hit the curb
It's easy 'cause I'm ill with the wordplay, I still flip the bird
Like Jeezy, strip it down, now it's exposed
I suppose my flow is the emperor's new clothes
Although I'm always by myself, I never ride alone
The music is on then I'm right at home, zoning
Listening to instrumentals
Thinking about all the things I've been through
The music is just a peek into my life, it's a window
It's so high tech and it's all so simple
And if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Yeah, it's pavement
Don't be scared to think, man, don't be scared
I know whats in your brain
It's scary, man, you only usin' like ten percent
The other ninety percent is scary, man
But don't be scared, scary ass niggas",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-city-playgrounds-lyrics
Ghetto Love,The Beautiful Mix CD,2004,"I'm heading to the club and I'm looking for something
Ain't putting on this pink dress in here for nothing
I'm whispering in your ear, boy, I hope you're receiving
I'm 'bout to share all my secrets, tell you things I'll be needing
I'm a grown ass woman, boy
You gotta show me, let me know
Give me love, make me believe, I'm all that you need
Leave them hoes out in the street
I don't wanna have to bring the heat
If you ain't ready to roll, leave me alone
Cause all we really want is love
And all we really need is love
Ain't asking for too much
Just respect and love
All we really need is ghetto love

Friends turn into lovers after drinks
You hit it in the crib, she left her eyelash on the sink
Your girl madder than the pink I splashed on her mink
Cause you gotta bad habit of acting before you think, wow
Soon as you see them out, you know what they be about
Looking for a nigga people read about
You lead 'em out the club, let 'em see the house
Lead 'em to the couch
Now he got 'em so open all he wanna do is eat 'em out
She's way hotter than 8 shots straight vodka
You play the proper spots then you may spot her
Wisk by the velvet rope
Legs longer than Mariah held a note
Got you seeing stars without a telescope
Do she sell it? Nope, on second thought maybe she do
Go to school and got a baby or two
Now she got you wondering if your relationship's through
Listening to Curtis Mayfield's ""Make It To You""

Listen boy if you wanna act up, then listen
We can both act up
I've been tryna be real with you
But you keep coming with the drama, I can't deal with you
It's the little shit, let me know you're late
Keep the D rock hard, make sure I'm straight
I don't ask for much, got a J-O-B, my own dreams
But things ain't always what they seem
I thought you had me baby
From the back to the front thought I was your baby
But once I gave in you started acting shady
Started acting crazy, don't wanna be your lady no more
Now all you got is memories of me on all-fours
The back of me heading out of your front door

(what we gon' do? yeah)
We gon' work, we gon' play
We gon' lead the way
We gon' say everything that we need to say
Then get ghost in the breeze to blow the leaves away
MCs today, it's like they throwin' our seeds away
But that ain't for me to say, right?
It ain't got to be this way
We gon' take charge, make gods out of men
We gon' raise bars, show y'all how to win
Hit the rally, hit the riot, get the party started
Respect the words you herbs, it's the Kwelity artist
I solemnly promised the knowledge will demolish your college
Admonishes scholars, you acknowledge the dollars (yeah)
Want me to payola? Man I don't even know that boy, I'm takin' over
Keepin' it fresh like bakin' soda in your fridge
I keep Brooklyn like Jamaica so ???

That's how it is, ""C'est la vie, ooh la la oui oui""
Please, excuse my French, nigga ridin' the bench
Sayin' ""Coach, let me in, yo I know we can win""
(woman: just give me a try!)

Yeah I see y'all flossin' like you got shit on your teeth
'Til I get up on the mixtape and I shit on your beat
Well ever since I came back niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
Why beef? NayNay shit on the street
Come on, my words man hit like pure like Cain, ask Abel
I got more lines than cokeheads on a glass table
Roll with a thorough crew, everybody follow through
Brooklyn where on the street we either swallow you or hollow you
You know how my borough do
Cats'll pull the ratchet out, start blackin' out off funny style
Cats nothin' to laugh about (ha)
It's hood politics, the hood economics
You get exploited, even your +Daddy-O+ like Stetsasonic
Kweli the best alive, my words spray like pestacide
You niggas keep on buggin' me
When they gonna exercise their right to exit right now
And keep it movin'?
I'm the solution, niggas shootin' to salute


B.K. in the house, what you wan' do?
L.A. in the house, what you wan' do?
BaBOO in the house, what you wan' do?
West Coast throw your W

I'm comin' through like MCs are my students and I'm the sensai
You need to fuck with your boy, fuck what your friends say
It's like my shits are so tight, I need some Ben Gay
I like the energy right, they call me feng shui
Men pray to their false gods and lost God a while ago
And crack up like the ???
No smile, know their inner-child can grow
Go out strapped with the calico
At a party ready to set it, wetted his throat
Had him better to smoke
His eyes red and he ready to let go
Yo oh, and then the DJ threw it on
A nigga like that's my shit, word is bond


Yeah, we gon' work, we gon' play
We gon' lead the way
We gon' say everything that we need to say
Then get ghost in the breeze to blow the leaves away
MCs today, it's like they throwin' our seeds away

So Good,The Beautiful Mixtape Vol. 2: The Struggle Continues,UnKnown," *talking*:
Yeah...
As we continue on..
Yeah (We recordin' in the house)
Ladies and gentlemen
This the soundtrack (In the natural sound)
Do not be alarmed (Children playin')
Don't panic, be calm, yeah... (Crickets chirpin')
We gon' hit you with... with the words
We gon' hit you with the music (We in Fort Greene right now)
'Course we gonna hit you with that Kweli shit

One of these days a change gon' come
For you and I and our children
Where you can live and just have fun
Don't nobody trip on where you come from
Everything is good yeah it's all love
It's freedom in the hood for all to get some
It's every woman to a man
To a child to a fam
With all us on a higher level of understanding
But if it's gonna take a while I'll chill
I can bask in the glory on that day
And if I gotta chill then boy I will
It's no problem for me because yo I be
B-Boy position standing here
Anticipatin' patiently just waitin'
To grind out for my dreams
And you (you) can't stop me boy

Listen...
Ladies and gentlemen don't be alarmed
This is the soundtrack to what's goin' on
And if you want you can get it
I promise you if you let it
The rhythm'll be good to you
Yeah, let the rhythm be good to you
I promise baby it'll be so good to you
And now, you 'bout to witness the sounds
Of these Words, Musiq, and Kweli

Community blocks waitin' 'til my opportunity knocks
But the door is usually locked because it's usually cops
Most of us wish we had a car and jewelry shop
But spend my days trying to fuck or find a movie to watch
Talkin' big plans to live large and move from the block
Your only options from your moms is to move to ya pops
Cigarettes trying to hold on to the few that you got
Prices crazy high for you to give up a loosies a lot
Areas we from you scared you don't run
Don't care what you done
Be leery of tongue snitchin', hope the jury is hung
Tryin' to go from zero to one like a hero becomes
While here air in my lungs ideas I share with my sons
People down here so shady they could stare at the sun
Can't wait 'til that unemployment check clear once it comes
Daily routine, but my only theory when young
Was get money, get a job and hope her period comes, just live life


Walkin' the block at night I, stopped at a rhyme cipher
Circle of rhyme writers broken up by crime fighters
They said we loiterin' started orderin' us around
We ain't jump at the sound of they voice
They said ""Get on the ground!""
This cause we black or what?
I'm sick of cops harassin' us
Probably because we ain't degrade ourselves fast enough
The people passin' us stopped and the cops start actin' right
Somebody had my back tonight
Off they go in a flash of light
You try to see the future take a mental picture of it
City life is hard when your apartment don't fit in your budget
You need to get a room like people who kiss in public
Plus you tempted just to say ""Fuck it"" until you kick the bucket
There's more to life than appears it ain't no crystal stair
As nails'll stick out and snare you and this is crystal clear
Ain't no officials in chairs or fans that scream your name
It ain't a game but it's still a challenge just the same


But if it's gonna take a while I'll chill
I can bask in the glory on that day
And if I gotta chill then boy I will
It's no problem for me because yo I be
B-Boy position standing here
Anticipatin' patiently just waitin'
To grind out for my dream
And you (you) can't stop me boy",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-so-good-lyrics
Lunchroom Classics,Groundation,UnKnown,"Yo, fourth period, everybody meet me in the lunchroom
I'm saying, the Drum Society comin in there
You know I'm saying, Hi-Tek gonna be there
I think Makeeba gonna be there too (Yo Kwa!)
Know what I'm saying, ah man, ah man
Definitely, definitely-definitely-definitely
Yo, yo-yo-yo, yo... Reflection Eternal, Makeba Mooncycle

Yo-yo, Yo-yo, I come before ya bearing skills
Get you off like cheap thrills
Some may deny me, because of lack of faith
I bring true lyrics, straight to your face
Here's a brand new testament, written by me
Co-written by Makeba and Eternal Kweli (Kweli)
Constant meditation last longer than duration
Proper education is mind levitation
To stimulate quite simple
I clear all paths like Christ and the temple

Coming with the skills that's essential
To even mention Brooklyn as the residential
Ugh, the pictions be graphic
Cause how we be livin is tragic
So I take your imagination and I stretch it like elastic
Ugh, some people treat oppurtunity like a blunt and pass it
I see the mic as my oppurtunity and so I grab it (hold it)
Mentally I live lavishly I cherish the heredity
That's preparin me to be a revolutionary till they bury me
Carry me in your thoughts forever
The way I put words together you treasure
Ay-yo, whatever the weather instead of clever I'm better
Cause I seize the time with reason and rhyme

Sometimes I flip the different flavors
This old school mama came ta save ya
Cause I'm to old to scold, better
I like, ya know, puttin hearts on hold
But pay ya hand for the fold
Waiting to be taught, here's a whiff of holy breath
I bring pain to your chest
LET'S CIVILIZE THE PEOPLE
Hang up your petty egos
I've got a shield on my back cause people carry blades (true)
Getting caught off guard leaves you in a shallow grave
Now here comes the ruler of the night, better known as the moon
Bobbin with J-Rawls animated like a 'toon
Chorus: Kweli and Mooncycle
 This for the kids cuttin up in the lunchroom
 I pulled your card like spades
And spit with major shit
The ill pitch you afraid to hit, it's like that
 Here we go
 Here we go
 Come on
 Uh, come on
*repeat from here we go*
*repeat all*

This song is like a baby being born (yes)
It'll stay in your head long after I'm physically gone
Then the rest of the flesh is left for the vulture
Makin me the anti-hero of the counter-culture
Do you remember what you was doin when you first heard this?

I was singin to my sis, that's deeper than abyss
It took the French to kiss, German demolish
Feed the world from my breasts, a written conquest
Lyrics are like permanent stains
Now you're usin' both sides of your brain
Cause you never should go against the grain
Acting like puppets, I own the string
Addicitive like coke, is the real thing
Check out the wisdom, that I bring
Church bells are ringin
Its the truth I'm speakin
Freak it like Sodom and Gomorrah
Check my holy ora, the reflection in my order
Causes me to slaughter
Disect like biology, cover the Earth like water

It's like sometimes cats like wanna be all up in your psychology
No stoppin me or my man Hi-Teknology
Follow me through global economies, start thinkin logically
Be passionate you gotta be, your soul is your property
On that you could place a bet before I make you face your death
Make you rectrace your steps to exact place you slipped
(Right there) To battle would be a waste of breath
But see you chasin rep and you got hit so hard
They had to replace your chest
You on the floor carrowing, turn your punk ass over
You see me towering, my mic grip tighter than the boa
You microscopic like protozoa or amoebas
Slower than molasses so they call you special
Makeba, yo, what they want, a medal?
Chasin crimes like Hantzel and Gretel when the dust settle
Every one of these cats who got gas like pedals, got deflated
J-Rawls, Makeba, Kweli anticipated
New shit cause your style's so old it depreciated {*echoes*}
You lost your value, money
Chorus
 I pulled your card like spades
And spit with major shit
The ill pitch you afraid to hit, it's like that
 Here we go
 Here we go

Black star in the constellations like Andromeda
You try to start it up
But you not hard enough
That’s why your career is shorter than retarded
Club owner gave you bottles, you the shit now
This shit costing twenty dollars who the pimp now
Stop standing on the coach homie, sit down
I’m at the bar but you’re chick is getting this round
They call your girlfriend a beard, need shaving
You brag about what you spend so much you need saving
Your knees shaking cause you buckle under pressure
You can keep fronting but nobody does it better
Yeah, I hop on any track, peep how I switch lanes
This the highway of life, check the whip game
Check the side of my neck you see the big vein
Just cause you have dragon breath don’t mean you spit flames

These niggas soft man, they sweeter than glucose
Gimme fifty feet homie or you too close
Personal space nigga back it up
Beep beep, back it up
Beep beep, back it up
Wait a minute
These niggas soft man, they sweeter than glucose
Gimme fifty feet homie or you too close
Personal space nigga back it up
Beep beep, back it up
Beep beep, back it up

Ayo my penmanship fucking up your face like a bleamish do
Keep it banging like red and blue
The instrumental through
Killing shit, you ain’t got a chance
You and your man is through
Inspiration, ran into my music like xanadu
You rolling through, with a rent a crew
And a rented crew
Ten of you, way too many dudes
Soft as betty boo
Steady you, talking all that shit
In them interviews
Annie who? shit is pitiful
I had to get at you
Spit at you, like it’s 2Pac at the camera
You ain’t got no hammers bruh, talking streetsweepers
You a muthafucking janitor
I’m the realest nigga that you ran into
Can it bruh, the shit you spit faker than the tits on Pamela Anderson
Catch me in the Manderin, post it up
Ghetto’s near you, catch a close up
I walk through any hood like respect it
Cause the flow tough, grow up

Tone they don't get shit like this no more
What happen to the love?
What happen to the love?
What happen to the?
Reflex, ayyo
Welcome to my longitude and latitude
My attitude is shaping my surroundings
Skyscrapers, public housing
The sheep is running from the sun
The wolves is howling at the moon
It's tragic how you in the street
'Cause you ain't got no avenues
When it come to rapping who's the baddest dude?
(In this world)
You still don't get it, this a recession, what recession?
Dog, we been stressing
Shit been a mess and we been dealing with this depression
Since way back but you ain't got to say that
That's the greatest lesson, slave to our possessions
Greed the devil favorite weapon
Fight to the death, only the greatest left

Let's get it
Lordy, lordy, lordy, lord
I been hustling really, really hard
Get up off my ass start making some moves
Put two and two together start paying my dues

If skills sold truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Lyrically Talib Kweli, Talib Kweli

Two parts brains and hustling
Sprinkle it over Hi-Tek production

My grind miraculous, rhyme for slums to palaces
Facing all my challengers, raising the black power fist
Here to eliminate the counterfeit

Add it up it don't amount to shit
I paid my dues kept the receipt for taxes
Although we stack it we stay stuck in the bracket
It's like a straitjacket
My rebel tactics got the planet spinning off it's axis
The devil laughing when you lazy, man, get off your ass
And talent don't mean nothing without all the practice

Get familiar with that. {gun shots}
Talib Kweli, Clinton Sparks. It's Anger Management y'all
You see, the tour ain't comin' to Brooklyn
So it's my job to bring Brooklyn to the tour. Yeah

We're gon' show you how to manage your anger
Before you do damage to a neighbor or a stranger with the banger banger
Mayday mayday, danger danger
A lot of these rappers in the closet like wire hangers
It's '05, summertime, gettin' scarier and scarier
Drug dealer's business still control America
The block to the boardroom, a tomb to the courtroom
We find dope, we smoke, we shoot and snort too
Fiends, come for more coke like free refills
Around the way, they move enough white to make ski hills
Whiter than the cast of One Tree Hill, we ill
We got angels in Heaven all jealous of our free will
Look at 'em, they ain't got no respect for what He created
They live life, get to go to paradise and don't appreciate it
But they don't know this life is Hell on Earth
For what it's worth, it ain't about the ideas but who ? (Clinton Sparks)
Some will rap between a rock and a hard place
Torn between spirituality and the lifestyles to partake in
Trust, my adrenaline rush like a car chase
Flames bust out the neck when I'm speedin' up my heart rate
Tryin' to find a dark place for me to pull my songs out of
Inspiration based on things I ain't proud of
I could rap about faith and repentance
But then it's me shoutin' out, ""Message"" like I'm Keenen in Don't Be A Menace
""Ain't don't nobody wanna heart that shit.""
So said the pussy nigga at the label who be scared to go near that shit
But it's cool
I don't depend on them to make me a star
And they scared cause what I spit will expose a fake nigga's heart
Now here's a bar {crashing noise}
Let me tell you what's gangsta
When you doin' God's work cause it needs to be done, not for the thank yous
Let me tell you what's thugged out
When you show niggas how to get paid without goin' the drug route
Let me tell you what's hard
Breakin' the cycle that got our sons and brothers fillin' up the prison yards
Let me tell you what's real
When niggas say what they feel
And that'll eliminate most of these niggas with the record deals
I hurt your feelings, it took longer than you expect to heal
The beef is fake, imagine how soldiers in the desert feel
I'm like a veteran with special skill
Comin' from the home of the original gunn clapperz like Tek & Steele
Cut shit out, ? feel
Spit so hot that the flesh will peel

The walk and talk soft could cost your head
The difference you the minor we the major
No long life to be lived for the hater or the traitor
Eight out of nine of my niggas doin time for advancin
Handlin illegal finances
This the family reunion, mixed with the holy communion
You'll never win, you're too busy consumin

Protect the real niggas from the fakes so we ain't gotta do 'em
Yeah, this the church right across from the liquor sto'
Been on that hip-hop shit since Biz Mark' picked his nose
Under the mattress stack big as a fat chick

I'm considered so dangerous
The cops about to hop out with they Glocks out while you banging this
You get arrested for molesting my ears
There's no respect for that in jail, you get molested for years
Where the record in your skin permanent like tatted tears
You got tats where I spit at your face, face your fears
I'm the light facing the deer when he run out on the highway
You stuck like you in the parked gear in the driveway
Fuck why these dudes up in here looking sideways
Killed the game without rhyming or saying I'd do it my way
I fuck with the mixtapes, record deals, real estate
Tour dates, more and more flights for the family
Feel the hate, still feeling great, making fantasies
Come true; when I come through, it's insanity


Rappers is filled with hate like the spit of a bigot
They thinking smaller than a midget on Jiminy Cricket
And then I hit them with some shit that's cleverly wicked
It's an unfortunate event, like Lemony Snicket
What up, sonny? Go easy like the bees made honey
Why give you the cure when the disease make money?
The fire that forever burn
When they say your fire that burn out
They say you're turning in every dollar ever earned
Some niggas never learn; some niggas get it, though
I get in the beat like Lee Gonit parking Indigo
My record finna go like twenty-four inch rims
Or two chicks on E -- they spinning, nigga, they spinning!

I got work for you
Yo, yo, yo, ignore the amateurs, you're rolling with the glamorous
See all the clamor for the lights and the cameras?
They get scared when the glances turn amorous
Exposed to the heat, they go yellow like an amethyst
Used to be purple like the cannabis from welts and the bruises
Used to scream, help, it was useless
Escaped into the night with her life intact
A betrayal she described as a knife in the back
Stone cold killer, you'd probably shudder
At the amount of blood flowing through the Hollywood gutter
All because of the appetite for dreams that will eat you up inside
She on your mind probably keep you up at night
15 minutes, that's all she really need
Director yell cut, and we see how you really bleed
Stay in the game, stay in the frame
Say her name, fame, fame
I love you, baby

She's so fleeting, she's so deceiving, she's so misleading
She cut 'em open and bleeding, she got 'em overeating
She's so hot, soda pop, she's overheating
Her gun, American, her favorite rum, Puertorican
She's like a monkey on your back, 'till you start to crack
She'll make you famous like the stars of Strapped
The heart of the fact, to swallow that, she got a target on your back
Follow you until you drown in the sea of your sorrow
You overdose, she got you over, she got the potion
It's not a joke, how she got 'em hoping she tried the coke
And everything designer, from the kind of drugs she do
To the attitude when she get tired of loving you
I hear them swear they don't need her and throw dirt on her name
I'm out for the fortune, fuck Fame
I hear them swear they don't need her and throw dirt on her name

The mother cried, the butterfly was a caterpillar
Before he fell in love with Fame 'cause he had to feel her
The model hot, she swallowed shots, straight Tequila
The bottles pop, she love you but can't wait to kill you
She lurking in the bushes, she the paparazzi
Her sex drive way faster than a Mazarati
Every relationship is work, this is not a hobby
She make you famous like Beyonce then she got your body
How she grimy like a project lobby
But still snooty, pack Louis Vuitton and act bourgey
She like a ghost 'cause I shudder when she pass through me
She yell, cut and you stop acting, it's your last movie
She got you in the gym, she got you in the spa
Staring at the man in the mirror wondering who you are
You're a superstar 'til she pass on you
Take a picture, it will last longer, word

1st Time (feat. Consequence),"We Run This, Vol. 7",2012.0,"There’s a first time for everything
There’s a first time for everything
But don’t be afraid of what’s in the dark
Just open your eyes and see what’s in they heart
I remember the first time I left it up to you
But I learned from the first time to never trust in you

Ay yo, the first time ever I saw your face
I recall the case
Cut the grass now I see all the snakes
My lawyer man cake
Cause of you he’s been employed by the beef
And now it’s time to half court in the street
Falling asleep on your boy is not recommended
He felt the weapon in your chest because I’m well respected
So when you disrespect reflection then your health effected
I go harder than any demon that hell invented
I never felt threatened
By none of these industry motherfuckers
Cause they smucks and they blood suckers
You can come quicker than sideways or backwards
I always come straight up in your face
Your mistake is confusing me with a rapper
That interviews and a fashion
You assuming I’m passive
I’m really truly a master
Of lyrically moving masses
It’s true but if you attack us
I’m never the one to back off
Never the one to slack off
I’m making them take the mask off
It’s beautiful when I black out, it’s natural like disasters
My body is like a host for a ghost of the middle passage
You not imagining the noise you hear is laughter
They giggle behind your back you enacted your family matters
You read into what’s happening and kill it like an assassin
Looking for that applause when all you get is the clappin’
I’m serious about my craft don’t ever confuse the masses
By taking my outtakes and trying to repackage them
It’s never forgive action


You only get one chance to make a first impression
That’s why I always make sure I come the freshest
Whether I start or my words ending
I’m here to exercise my first amendment
Which gives you the right to get your verse played
I almost lost that after the third grade
Cause on the first and fifteen before I stayed
My team was the first to get paid
So why would you cross us in the first place
Unless you willing to catch a first case
You better all go on on your first date
To see if you can get past first base
This the first taste of what the pain gave me
You listen to the rumors you would think they played me
But they my juniors, my first babies
I only deal with presidents like the first lady
Who pay me on a first name basis
I don’t like you niggas I’m almost racist
That’s why I’m cursing the first person or cursing the first person who didn’t make my first purchase
But type my name in they word searches
Cause I kill the flow bring out the first hearses
And this will be the first crime you ever seen
But it’s cool cause there’s a first time for everything


Before the ink dried and the deal was finalized
And the money changed hands and the plan was monetized
We used to eat mcdonalds fries
Shop for economy size
Know when economists lie
We poor we trying to survive
Another stat-istic of a man with some kind of pride
I’m getting black listed like I’ve got a communist tie
Little did I know it was myself I was trying to find
Getting all kind of high
Crashing like vehicular homicide
But now I’m self employed and I’m chilling
I’m waking up with the millionaires
You looking for the building I’m still in there
Still in fear
Scared of the dark that don’t matter
When the lights come on the cockroaches scatter
Exposing the data
Yo get a load of these actors
They cloak and dagger
See how I broke they swagger
My spirit is rich
Yea the lyrics is sick
Get prepared lyricist of the year in this bitch",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-1st-time-feat-consequence-lyrics
To the Side,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Go right to left, left to right
Middle passage connection
Yeah, about to build
Tell you which way to go

We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
X4
Yo, here we go

I wanna write away
I wanna write here
I wanna write brave words to fight fear
Write dreams and nightmares
Might scare the folks stuck in the day
But nothing to say
Well I'm way ahead by light years
So beware we keep the lights on
I wanna write the songs from right to wrong
Right on
Riding the light so you see in the dark
So deep you gotta be still like your beating heart
My words apply the pressure to make the bleeding stop
See the art, living right, eating smart
I wanna right to life, a right to death
Police read your rights from right to left
But I never write to remain silent
I fight through police line
Cops walk the beat that I write to
I teach minds, write rhymes with the right sound
Right now, journalists write up
I write down
 :Chorus
Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide
You better get wit it, or {stand to the side X7}

And the story line goes on
Right to left, who's right who's wrong
Fuck the politics and pride
I just to try to stay alive
To witness where the battle lines are drawn
Speak my mind and sing my song
I'm passin on the moral y'all
This is ain't play
True, you got to know the way
It's hard now
Open eyes
See hopeful lives
Sing it now

Making my way through life
Talking to elders and taking advice
Ignoring their words and paying the price
Living in the world where false preachers got us praying to christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and laying the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable they we hating to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hip-hop and every joint he playing is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation of like
A maze in Egypt amazing when I'm creating a sight
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past
After Pac and Notorious passed what do we have
Niggas worth more when they dead, it's so sad
Started with the slavery we finish the plan
But I broke the cycle, and became a man
 : Chorus

Come on
I got my man Savion in the house
We about to put it down
Here we go

You ever feel like giving everything up
And buying a boat so you can sail the world?
Aiyyo, what's really hood?
He got a gift with the lyrics
The beat is lifting your spirit when you ain't feeling good
Sometimes he feel like the whole world is turning on him
The people miserable and try to place they burdens on him
He revealing the truth like he a portal
A vampire sucked his blood, now he immortal
First he ignored then he worked the applause
He thirsty for more cause they loving how he perfectly flawed
Most of these rappers softer than the allure of Juicy Couture
And from the start he put his heart in every verse he record
Caused to perform for the corporation, he made a profit with Satan
Then got with the Beat Konducta for his Liberation
And for free at last till everybody started selling it
But him, he's like I need to see a piece of that
And get right with God, he knows his gift is a phenomenon
He catch it when it strike like a lightning rod
His rhymes are the spitting image he created us in
We getting paid in wages of sin
True, it's like death in a room
Every lie we ingest and consume
Is guaranteed to make us vegetables soon
Sometimes it's so hard, can't go on
Where did he lose his focus, where did he go wrong?
He should love his life, he got a loving wife at home
But still find himself roaming through the club at night
Kiss his children and they hug him tight
Gotta prove his love in family court tomorrow
'Cause he and they mother fight
These other artists really don't know what to make of him
So they afraid if him, they ain't breaking him
It's been over ten years since he gave you the blast
The ones that counted him out, they didn't do the math
The fans tell him he under-appreciated
Underrated and hated but he thankful they debated
Thankful that he made it to glory while some faded
Thankful that he keep it surreal while some fake it
Thankful for the skills that's keeping the family stable
Thankful for the meals he put on the family table
He pay the bills when he able and spend for pleasure when he can
This the true measure of a man
Some things he'll never understand, that's okay though
He know we're molded in the image of God like Play Doh
But still he wax philosophical like Aristotle
Maybe one day they'll come up with a better model
But till then, he the best there is
More than ten-thousand hours in
So that make him the specialist
Oh yeah, it's way more than relevance
It's classic, original, you remember this",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-my-life-lyrics

The glass half full cause there's more to come
Jammin' on the 1, ja-jammin' on the 1
Take a deep breath now expand your longues
The breath is the life and it just begun
I thank God for the morning, so, now look here girl
Where you goin'? Come here girl, let me holla holla holla at ya
Yeah, and thrown a couple dollars at you, c'mon
I get paid baby doll I'm a star
You can tell by the make and the model of my car
That's the game these young niggas kicking
Dumb niggas tricking but some niggas listen, look
All that whack shit they spillin' in yo' ear
I don't need none of that, you just feel it in the air

You're making me tired, so

It's putting me to sleep, please
Hush - Haven't we heard it all before?
Damn from all of y'all, so
Hush - A motherfucker can only take so much
I wish that you'd just hush

They say it's all about your market and the best way
To reach the audience is to target and to profit from
You know I'm used to reach a higher form of consciousness
That still inspire dancers that's working for $20 tips
Rappers ain't pimps bruh, they acting like chimps
Nah, King Kong ain't got shit on me like Denzel Washington
A marijuana cocktail is the drawl mixed with the chocolate
Bubbling like bong hits from white kids at college and
You about to knowledge the strength of street knowledge kid
The fact is  spit for everything I gotta get
You ain't gonna like it if you got problems well honest shit
I don't like to break my promises so I don't fuck with politics
The classes  cause I ain't had no scholarship
Now I come to speak, they give me honorary doctorates
Could it possibly be that I got a degree at rocking this?
Stop it all, born and prosper like Dr. Spock with it

Touching it with words cause a master did
And plus, I ain't on the grabbing shit, it's like this, word
In this life every 'll find the right type
In the mix like Jack and Coke with limelight
Funny how we do wrong things to get the mind right
Vision blurry now but it's 20/20 in hindsight
I don't make the singalong shit, get the rhymes right
I'm nice, I'm sharper than any barber that get the line right
It's in the bag and I'm tagging em, getting markers

You cats can't flow but you get an ""E"" for effort
 together reign forever

Please
You think I give a fuck about your Clown Posse? You insane!
You acting like a journalist and racking my brain
Since I was tagging my name on the back of the train
Like my man in ""La Haine"", packing the same
Little Gat that put me back in the frame of mind to say ""Fuck the Five-O""
Let me explain the rhyme
Yo, cut the lights low like Bob Marley
I'm the black star they probably follow my every move
Like I'm the son of John Gotti
Escape to Paris like a jazz man round midnight
 banging like Josephine Baker raising the kids right
Attack the dreaming
Rap through the demons
See the situation and extract the meaning
Internationally known trees actually grown
Through the cracks in the sidewalk
See it in my walk
Hear it in my talk
Bet you cats feel it in my rap flow
You can throw me a spliff but you can keep your tobacco


Are y'all with me tonight?
Êtes-vous avec moi?
Y'all love the children and dance like Elegba
Say Ma where you goin with that flavor
These cats ain't in my league, this here is major
Mind state of the art
Yeah I play my part with razor-sharp words
Shot straight for the heart
Beautiful like chords played on a harp with trumpets blaring
Angels preparing for the fate we all sharing at
One time or another through sunshine or thunder
Ain't got no time for the blunders
Then bond with one another to make the classical track
*What?* The battery in my back
I'm Eveready already plus magical 
Like mushrooms from the plush womb of the sweet
The city workers pushing dust brooms in the street
We complete the cipher
Push up your lighter
Throw your vanity in the bonfire

Ask anybody that you bump into
Who got it poppin when it come to these rhymes (who got it?)
We got the sound that you jump into
You automatically pressin rewind (jump up!)

They call him Kwe' for short, really talk to the children
But too many people feel him and they might, try to kill him
Try to test me I survive, like your grandma recipe
(Survive) like a Child with a Destiny
Survive like a Cuban holdin piece of wood floatin to Miami
Like, Elian Gonzalez cause they back with the family
Survivin in the streets of Brooklyn, that's where you find me
Survivin like somebody mommy clutchin a palm tree in a tsunami
Who woulda thunk that would ever happen?
Rootin for Kweli cause he brung back clever rappin
Sister - heads wrapped in fabric of the standard music
Chicks - with their tits, made of plastic look, dancin to it
In this arena I balance, your boy stand alone
And win it cause these rappers is more annoying than camera phones
Maybe it's me, it could be hard to move me
But these niggas got me trippin like a white girl in a horror movie!

Do you like the way he jumped on it?
Take a step back, you don't want it
Do you like the way he jumped on it?
Take a step back, you don't, you don't


Yeah... this the one right here, put it on everything
Drop it heavy then get in the wind like a weather vane
Let it rain, let it pour, metaphor so let it off
Like the 38th special edition of ""Set it Off""
Yo the trap, got you blastin your heat
It's hot ones like shotguns from the passenger seat
The mic booth, the district where they be packin the meat
Cause they kept it raw as the jump off, I hop, back on the beat
Back on the street like an ex-con
With enough in his pocket for a tip at a restaurant
It's a cold world, dress warm
Cuttin through the bullshit record labels and the shady deals
Ladies feel the beat when they out clubbin like baby seals
Let me chill out cause the raw image to focus on
Get back to my point, this joint is jumpin like a circus song
Yeah, to break it down to the basic components
They don't want it so I'm runnin out of worthy opponents, whoa



Even when I be sleepin my brain it keep goin deep inside
A street poem with rhymes that keep blowin your mind
With a unique flow and heat showin
Grown men weepin in the open, tears leak into the ocean
Today is (Training Day), I passed the test like Ethan Hawk and
I'm droppin signs like Craig G, or Stephen Hawkins
Y'all don't rhyme, y'all speak in quotes of MC's that sleep in coffins
Latchin on like a leech and eatin off 'em, you weak and soft and

Good morning, good afternoon, goodnight
Whatever time zone you are listening along to this hot mellow shit
Make sure you get your ass up and go do some shit
Let this music get in your ass and make you move fast
And don’t be late to class with your late ass
This is a hot compilation called The Cathedral
By my main man, my ace, my mellow fellow, Talib Kweli Greene
Ha ha ha, speak on it God
And if you didn’t hear me the first time I said it
Muthafuckin’ speak on it God

Peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like another day
Like yesterday, we take it back to another day

The attribute Kweli, ain’t no acronym involved
It’s a blessing to be alive, God is love
So I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
That we despise because they killas of the vibe
These capitalistic rappers is plastic, obey they masters
Your hustle kill your people then your hustlin’ is backwards
You the maker not the owner of your dream and
Man it hurts the devil couldn’t have planned it better
You couldn’t have planned it worse
Call my son, son, cause he shine when he smile the sun
Distance from the Earth is like 93 millions miles
Beat up the track like a pugilist
I come correct I never sell out on the foolishness, who is tis?
Put the money in my hand, never the grown ass man in the club doin’ the new dance
I keep it grounded, stay true to my sound
They throwin’ rocks but them niggas never comin’ for the crown
Slain of those who fight for what is right
You not owed and you never promised nothin’ in this life
Married to the block but you gotta renew your vows
I see the devil smile as you walkin’ down the aisle
For the dollas now we facin’ extermination
But I have knowledge of my self-determination
Criminalisation of an entire generation
Mass incarceration’s a muthafuckin’ bad situation
The knowledge and the wisdom is your power
I see God in myself
I won’t diss the next rapper you just hafta pay your dues
Fuck a rapper, I compete with James Baldwin and a Lagston Hughes
So my baby’s born to think this is the way of us
They take the babies from the fathers so it ain’t no trust
They say they want the new self-destruction
But ask ‘em what they payin’ and they sayin nothin’
They put they people before us (murderer)
They say this land ain’t ours (murderer)
But when you focus on compassion that’ll lead to your understandin’
(Facts only, facts only)
Know your freedoms (murderer)
Try to live righteous (murderer)

You know what the struggle is? (What is it?)
It's beautiful! (Oh yeah, c'mon)
It's not an oxymoron, means the same thing
Beautiful!
Like the passion of sex when you don't have to get protection
And the seed is fertilized it's an immaculate conception
And it grow into a fetus crying like priests having confession
Baby coming out the womb packing and blasting a weapon
For the struggle to show, I let my scars keloid and bubble
Keep it popping all you toys is in trouble
I'm all city, the benjis is all gritty, my pennies is all pretty
If you believe in making change and progress then walk with me
Let me show you a bigger picture (Yeah)
Spit kicker never spit the poison like the liquor
That's filling up your nigga liver
It's more like the herbal medicine - purple lettuce and orange hair
I inhale yesterday's breath and blow out tomorrow's air
I'm taking the throne
Instead of creating a poem
I'm making a song
These niggas is happy with just making a clone
So my rhymes turn these wack emcee's faces into stone
Like they just saw Medusa with them snakes in the dome... Rashid

One man rises another falls
To discover all is one and one is all
I come to call like Jericho with the trumpets
It's wild in the hundreds
Gramps in the choir hummin'
The Lord soon cometh
From blow some grow, many stay stunted
Talks with the shorties knowing, I learn from it
Keep the dumb shit from my circumference
I run with niggas that want it and done it
The hunted and blunted (It's beautiful!)
L said it gotta come from the stomach
To me the stomach is the voice of the Lord
The revolutionary people's choice the award
Seeing souls move forward
Goals move toward new homes and new floors
For us to rise to, in the attic taping up my bible
Thinking how can I apply it to survival?
The un-American idol, seeing vital signs of the times
I put it in my rhymes it's the beautiful struggle

I came here to curse the states, like ""Fuck You!""
I kill for my sons with guns, like I'm John Q
Now get celled in hell, the Buddha-blessed smoke
Endorsed by the DLs, Crips, Bloods and Folks
If I have to, I'll throw myself on the cross
My souls lost, fuck it man, Jesus paid the cost
So I guess I'll tell a racist cracker go and lay it down
If I die, I die high, blowing on a pound
If you die, you die twice, a neck full of ice
I'm hellbound on trying to save black kids' life
But my Tribe, left a nigga on a Quest like Phife or Jerobi
White bitches scream like Kobe
But you would never know me or what I went through
That's why I'm quick to say ""Suck a dick, bitch, and fuck you!""
And I'ma tell the white kids the truth:
They dads raped mine, now what the fuck they gon' do?! (YEAH)",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-the-struggle-continues-lyrics

It's that new guy, all I do is make trouble
On some pills, now it's soundin' like the bass muffled
Just a normal dude, focused with a straight hustle
I'm down to Earth yo, Challenger space shuttle
Blue collar and cold as a Coolatta
I'm the king up in the burbs so they callin' me Mufasa
Kill it on the mic and I do what I do proper
Just watch when I'm rocking like bada-bing bada-boom mama
I'm an animal, ferocious, I don't suggest you approach it
Or provoke it, cause the last time the doctor gave a prognosis
He said I was out my fuckin' mind in case you hadn't noticed
So just pass me my bottle of Adderall so I can focus
And some bomb tree, cause it's C-Webby and Kweli
Here to drop heat, so the wack rappers they gwan leave
Baby watch me, cause until I'm on the top seat
I'ma kill em and no one can stop me, motherfucker

Y'all in trouble, I ain't even get my feet wet
You know how much sweet flesh my teeth get these beats just
Seasoning, no reasoning, primalistic defeat again
When we begin to walk leaves fall from all of the trees and then Weaker men was raised their head to peek within the valley
Pterodactyl, beat screech, leeches swim and stampede begins
Me and them, same species different creature
When I bleed this pen just know you're breathing in Joell Ortiz and em
Occupy the top of the food chain, you bottom feeder
I'm on fire, they barely warm: koala fever
I ain't even at my hottest either, y'all been lally gaggin'
Poppin molly, dressing drag, playing follow the leader
Me I've been bodying speakers, catching a body and beatin' em
Fucking buffied up bodies in Bali on holiday weekends
Your bitches do karate, they chopped and you probably eatin' em

Angels cry every time someone lie
They fall to the Earth and they lose their wings
And they worship the devils and get they kings

What they say when they speak on your memory
Confortable .. and the weed is the remedy
We get drunk and rich for the Hennessey
Speak to the Lord like speak to the Tennessee
Either walk through the valley of the shadow
Look up in the hills, you can see your enemy
Come a forth mile, come up with a smile
..in the streets, better wow!
They’re ain’t no respecting lady
There ain’t no hesitating
So where our neck is breaking and the respect is taken?
I pause cause nothing is given
We get lost in the system
Ah, ah, ... but what’s the cause you’re living?
Boys like me... to the prison
Laws are written be a pause for...
So you know the price, do you know the cause
I’m so.. the flow is nice, victorious
We gonna take ‘em laws, so glorious from Brooklyn like

It’s awful every ghetto or town
No matter black, white, red, yellow or brown
Ain’t no sign of settling down
When the guns ...every.. is a sound
..block of law, .. don’t stop the flow!
Martin Luther King Junior had a dream
That was ... streets and hospitals
Where the bodies go before they’re berried
Or already half way to the cemetery
This ..who holds the story
..the ice and the cream like...
And the murder story but the ghetto is clean
...working on a seven day lean
..just grabbing a heavenly scene ...
The point I’m making is know your colors
Before your blood run red in the ghetto
I got a flow to make you so shut up
Can you borrow that? No my brother!
Get your own, get in the zone
And tell everybody that it’s your song...
..turn your felonies into melodies
Recipes to my nigga..

Midnight Hour,UnKnown,UnKnown,"When I get home, unplug the phone
Turn out the lights, I serve this song
I'm gonna call my baby
Tell him that I'm coming
See, I been gone for way too long
He needs some lovin'
See last night on the phone
He told me that he missed me
And I listened to his song
It sounded kinda sexy
Check it out, I said, um, I said
My baby on the job, I know she's workin hard
She independent and I love that show, I swear to God
The way she get up, I know she ain't really got no fear
No, I don't make it rain, but still I'm the one that got her bed
I need her all at once, I been on tour for months
Her body like a stage, as soon as I hit, I tore it up
She love how I perform, come get a hype like her favorite song
We riders of the storm, touch me, baby, like the dawn
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the nighttime comes
And I see my baby
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the midnight hour
And I see my, I'll be home tonight, I'll be by his side
Listen, can't wait till the night begin, can't wait to let her in
Ready to handle this, the candle's lit, the light's is dim
So dark be inner vision and she might lose her and inhibitions
Hourglass figure make it last past ten
Four hours last long no intermission
I'll come every once in a while
Just to let her know her love in town
I'm here to stay so there ain't no way
I know she love the sound of that
I'll make her love come down to earth
That's worth another round
Can't take another clown, in love with the kid
'Cause he underground
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the nighttime comes
And I see my baby
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the midnight hour
And I see my, I'll be home tonight, I'll be by his side
Listen, somebody call my baby, say I'm on the way now
See, I been going crazy thinking 'bout you late nights
The way my heart reacts it lets me know I need him
See, I been getting flashbacks, I just got to see him
Hopped out the taxicab, she almost didn't pay
He let me get your bags, I got some things to say
I know you miss me, girl, you know I miss you too
We kissing taking turns, so let's go to the room
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the nighttime comes
And I see my baby
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the midnight hour
And I see my, I'll be home tonight, I'll be by his side
Listen uh, when I get home, unplug the phone
Turn out the lights, I serve this song
He said when you get home, unplug the phone
The lights is off, you know it's on, know it's on
Ooh, that I made it home, baby, lock that door
And be ready for me
Ooh, and it's been some months and we don't have long
But I'm here now

Bushonomics,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Revolutions require participation
But sometimes people be hesitating
The government must respect the will of the people
The government serve the people
The people don't serve the government
Voter registration with no scope of education
It's a waste of time with no hope
It's just frustration
It's not a choice when you're picking the voice of a nation
You're just contributing to the status quo's preservation
Plus we ain't got no universal health care
And who the hell care about crack mothers on welfare?
Listening to dead prez, hell yeah
But jay-z first
Thinking of how we was snatched
Like old ladies' purses
Dropped on american soil
For a greater purpose
Plus I know my people got layers
You gotta break the surface
The way I rap got the man nervous
Frodo failed bush
Got the ring snitching like he's got a sink (?)
Fixing elections like it's not a thing
Somebody
Please expose the fact
That it's going back
To one party
They called president bill clinton a whoremonger
Voted him out
Replaced with a warmonger
Hook
It's like a jungle sometimes
I'm at the front of the line
I ain't tripping
But I stumble sometimes
Then I get right back up
Then I get right back up
It's like a jungle sometimes
I'm at the front of the line
I ain't tripping
But I stumble sometimes
Then I get right back up
Then I get right back up
Liars and thieves
Best believe
That their record is ??
Weapons of mass destruction
The reason for catching saddam
Lack of concern for the environment affected the storm
We can predict the levees breaking
Like a zeppelin song
The president warned
But before the levees broke
The people was
They already owned the oil there
So there ain't nothing they need from us
Caught up in +the fog of war+
They let the big easy flood
You telling me that you would do what jesus does?
No, I don't believe you would
The master teacher's back here to speak with us
With the passion of a preacher
And raps that make the speakers bust
The way he tackles the topics
Will have an agnostic
Acknowledging the last prophet
Fulfilled the promise of frederick douglass
Acquainted with death
He step among us
On the blocks and corners
The people he taking steadily getting younger (?)
You ain't over or getting younger
I'm getting older, I ain't getting younger

No boundaries, no borders
We're crossing many waters
Them haters can't ignore us
The government record us
They used to take our sons
And think it's fun to rape our daughters
No, our health care system pitiful
That's how hospitals profitable
They try to put the drugs inside of you
Lie to you, say that you gonna die tomorrow
So why pay? That's not logical
See the bullshit that they try to pull
They tapping laptops like a bad plot out of a bad movie
Obama say it ain't so, in a perfect world correlation
Of the willing is coalition of the rainbow
Who the enemy? Who the friend in need?
How do you choose your target
Who you aim for, what you aim for?
Damn, still running with the race
But I'm running out of pace
So fast just the last guy to let it go
Wondering if my concentration on the race misplaced
Take your marks, set, ready, go
Evolutionary flow, ever-luminary glow
When they show but the revolution never know
Shot to make you famous, we in your face with bangers
About to face some danger, I just misplace my anger
Violence entertainers, rappers took the place of Segas
Papa said, ""Don't talk to strangers, don't talk to strangers""
Gotta let the people know from the get go
Bun B is a product of the ghetto
Good or bad man I just can't let go
No I ain't a rich man but it's been set though
And I'm still on the grind trying to get dough
Why the government wanna keep me in debt for?
They wanna keep me in debt for?
Look at AIG and the bailouts
Stepping on the fish just so you can help the whale out
Got his ass out or should I say tail out
Need another job like a paper or a mail route
We the fresh, best in take the stale out
Make it rain, they see it I'm a put a pail out
Man, I'm a put a pail out know, what I'm saying?
'Cause I'm stuck in the mud like a tractor
I ain't gotta lie plus I'm not a good actor
Bullshit laws that they enact to keep us
Locked out the big game in the back bru
I got sacked, now I gotta get a sack to
Make ends meet cause the money is a factor
Oh yeah, the money is a factor
Damn, now I'm back on the block for the hustle
Used to be hot, now your boy just cold
Gotta build my bread up and my muscle
Haters talk down, sometimes it's a tussle
But the smoke gonna clear and the dust don't settle
Now it's like def jam wit no Russell
Like def jam wit no Russell, we'll be alright though

I know what y'all goin through man (yeah, yeah)

You wanna step back and I let it roll off me

Flirtin with the fame but I let it roll off me
They love it when I'm losin but I let it roll off me
Dirt on my name but I let it roll off me
Always keep it movin and I let it roll off me
Do it for my niggas with letters, let's set it off B
Cops don't protect us, protestors just get ignored B
Played out like musical theater with best support
The investors and bankers havin sex in expensive orgies
I'm rappin on the corners like Abbey, Abdul and Common
Born when they was robbin the grave at Tutankhamun
Way before Bush the USA been bombin
Cause whether ratchets or needles know the shootin ain't stoppin
Niggas lootin, we ain't coppin a thing
And if I'm locked in the bing, a nigga not gonna sing
I got a lot of things on my mind, dollar signs, life on the line
What I write's so right for the time
The revelation like sight for the blind like when God cypher divine
Hand you lessons; or when you in the church havin confession
Or when you kneelin on the pew, catchin the Holy Ghost
Or the cult, so fanatic they think suicide's the only hope (no)
They used to ask you ""Who ya master?"" Now they ask you ""Who your pastor?""
It's your allegiance that they truly after
They used to ask you ""Who ya master?"" Now they ask you ""Who your pastor?""
It's your allegiance that they truly after

Brooklyn, New York B, ain't nothin soft G

Talk the talk but to walk the walk is costly
Niggas got on they +Game+ face like Black Wall Street
Every single move I make is ballsy
Cause the shit it used to be a, silent movie now it's a talky
The Feds cheesin like Milwaukee when shit is Brew-in
When these niggas stage a coup for the president I'm a shoo-in
But, ain't no political aspirations I'm persuin
I hate to ruin your dream but music is what I'm doin
I've touched more people in a verse than you do in 20 speeches
Whether state's blue like the water or redder than white people on sunny beaches
Sometimes I don't be understandin it
They looked at me and said that's why you the perfect candidate
Standin at the pulpit with a full clip
What I say real talk, turn around and walk away with your bullshit
I'm like breed, yo I ain't to be fucked with
Only write the realest, can't lie to the public
The sharp wick cut quick, killin 'em softly
They try to take me there but you could never force me
Brooklyn, New York B, ain't nothin soft G

Everyday block hunters by any means necessary
Out to get that money even if they on crutches
Tryna to ride foreign, coupes instead of city buses
And two times for the greens
That keep it tie and clean when they kin in the bin
Hold a nigga down like a thousand pound ankle bracelet
When that love is real look you be killing places
Nigga you fit in to the front
So you can see where I’m from before I tell you what I want
And I want it all
I spit summer heat all through the winter
‘Cause when I spring to the top I don’t wanna fall
All I’m in this bitch RIP Big L
Brooklyn in this bitch RIP BIG as well
And ride to the studio I bump life after
I walk into the booth and kill shit right after

One time for the guns , one time for the butter
We spread it like parkay
One time for the hunters , one time for the prey that’s running
One time for the prey that almost got away
Two times for the rappers, two times for the singers
Two times for the players , two times for the ringers
To string us to be dodging the wires
To share bubbles and the problems who they are to say
They say you fucking up the game , you swear it isn’t you
Ain’t no subliminals but where if it fit the shoe
It’s sorta cute of these rappers tryin’ to be a natural
My attribute, give me your type acolytes when I’m passing through
I got draft, whipping is so priceless
Don’t need your permission, a New York nigga with no license
Soon I might submit that you ackle me
Force honesty, better than force modesty

One time for my thug niggers
Is smartest then nerds, one time for my hood sub fading the ‘burbs
Two times for the motherfucker that’s hating our nerf
Tell ‘em bite on the curp
Two times for the herbs when they working my nerves
Put your money where your mouth is nigga then change your words
I be hearing with a curve it ain’t nobody skirt
Till we run into the city like rebels out in divert
Pick a side, any side it’s like the war zone
They televise beef to let you know the war zone
I see shots, numbs niggers like quarter zones
They be acting hard but your body lacks a chromosome
MJ is like I’m playing on a quarter dome
‘Cause their style’s dumb like tripping over a cordless phone
I should hang ‘em up with that same chords

First hand man with a plan stand up!
Get the fuck out your Benz
Clean your third eye lens
Got signed Carties still living in the hood
Fucked up the industry like it’s all good
Ever since I came out and rocked the party
Every blood clot rapper want 
Anyways, in many ways we display shit

Break it down everything you spit is bull, it’s pitiful to watch
I stand out in a city full of hot young spinners
Blow the spot with the best of the T. Dot, yea
Kweli and Kardinal rock with the official
We sharper when we hit and can’t stop to blow a tissue
Doing way more than an’you
What I spit is finna split you in two
It really don’t matter how vocal is you
I’m not to be confused with those who know
Provoke the issue attack, I blast back like Africans in Mogadishu
In fact, our flashback’s bringing out the Nat Turner in me
Where’s the people what’s the word in the street?

We the concept obnoxious
And let me make a promise
I'mma always keep it honest
And to portray all my people cause we put in boxes

Tryin' to make a break through
Dealin' with the hateful
Tryin' to stay faithful
Got an attitude house niggas can't relate to
Listening to music that the field niggas escape to
I plays phonetic
Over revolutionary rhetoric
Cause I'm down for action like a predicate


You can't escape
You can't escape

He felt 'Pac when he said Only God Can Judge Me
You see the  walkin' in the playground
Stalkin' like a predator, you're baby ain't safe now
Wait now, ain't it big how he talkin' like he evil
And the  never acknowledge how he could be tryin' to feed his people
Young, black and throw in a line up
Labeled as a 'gang banger' though he never signed up
Cops is tryin' to get the crime up
You get that on your record
Employers gonna check it
Fire you, so now you gotta resort to the only method
The scene will guarantee any sense of clarity
As to when the rental be paid, it's street salary

Black Statue of Liberty (Poem by Jessica Care Moore)
I stand still above an island, fist straight in the air
Scar on my face, thick braids in my hair
Battle boots tied, red blood in the tears I’ve cried
Tourists fly from all over just to swim near my tide
Or climb up my long flight of stairs
But they trip on their shoestring lies
Piece by piece they shipped my body to this country
Now that I’m here, your people don’t want me
I’m a symbol of freedom, but I’m still not free
I suffer from class, race, and gender inequality
I wear a crown of knowledge, ’cause I’m a conscious queen
My mask is one of happiness, though my history here is full of misery
Done deliberately
I am America’s true statue of liberty
You placed a bible under my arm, after you ripped me of my faith
And made me pray to a fictional imposter
So, if you were trying to maintain liberty
Too late, you just lost her
‘Cause her torch is about to serve as the night light for truth
In the slums and the ghettos that you find so uncouth
Education will be delivered not from the tree, but the root
So, little black girls and boys will check their pockets
For spirituality rather than loot
‘Cause liberty is just old mother nature
And although you don’t lover her, she’ll never hate ya
She’s earth, wind and fire, don’t tempt her to show her power
Turning all weeds to flowers
Looking into her wise eyes will make a blind man see
How can you dare name a eurocentric girl after me?
Assata Shakur Barbara Jordan Nikki Giovanni and Angela Davis
Look it up!
These are the real symbols of liberty
‘Cause that stone-faced French woman ain’t gonna save us
The same folks who enslaved us
I’m sitting at the back of the bus, ’cause I feel like it
And I play ball
Not ’cause you pay me to dunk it, dribble it or hike it
I’m taking all my people back home, and breaking them mentally free
I am the walking, talking, breathing, beautiful statue of liberty
I sweep crack pipes out of schoolyards
I nurture my man when times are hard
So, where the hell’s my statue?
What’s the liberated woman gotta do?
Place my name in wet cement
Every month I pay the rent
Put my silhouette on a stamp
I’m not a ho, slut or tramp
My children aren’t on crack, and neither am I
I want to see the words, “Go, strong Black woman,”
When the Goodyear blimp flies by
I can bake cookies, bear babies, preside over revolutions
Get rings out of tubs, wear a suit, sport baggy jeans, slick my hair back
Or tie it up in braids
My aura is unafraid
So, no statue in the big apple can mess with me
I am the walking, talking, surviving, breathing, beautiful

Ready on three
Please pour me perry
Skeptics in the residence like uh
What the hell he ya
Im on that new wave. hell yea
Its like the water from the waterboard
Now comparing to heavy on the puberty is not comparable
The taste of it is terrible
I sip the nectar of the Gods
And now i'm writing records with the gods
Anti-social but the pocket full of dead friends
And the peanut butter goes inside of the red benz
And my purata momma causing accidents
Earthquakes, meteor strikes volcanoes, eruptions and air spins
As a mastermind in my DNA
I don't got no time for no VMA
Mix the Y with the EMG and it's time for some TNA
Cause i grind til i see the day i expire
Blaze fire
No days off just just asking yulo
Great rides drink live in a glass full of
Rap cooler, and i jab like zab trooger
Be down for the count like Dracula
Im a fool for the cash mad mula
I can't put my finger on it, that's lula
Pull up with that foreign , a black bulla
Oh lord kakala Hallelujah
Gt a gold digging bitch who wanting diamonds and purses
Got my head in the clouds she got her hand in my pocket
I gave her an habitual criminal stare
She text me, not proceeding down invisible stairs
The rap game is full with pitiful imbeciles who dare
Remember was it fictional fear?
So i trip before i kick in the stairs
Spittin medical peers
Smoking medicinal like i'm living in the biblical years
Jesus!

We Out here you, shit i Hope you live a hundred years

I been a boystar call me
Stop at the indian spa order a bag of good shit
Shout out to Roger he just street talking shit
Number 23 dropping that swoosh
Cowards wanna get loud with me
Anytime brother
That shit not gonna fly with me
Do not civilize or criticize or hate

Put your hands together ladies and gentlemen
You understand, yo we also got my man
A close personal friend of mine, Talib Kweli
Blackstar, Reflection Eternal
Yo, put it down like this

I'm sayin
African blood race through my vein
You can hear it in my name
And you can feel it in my game
I'm sayin the streets is drama
Make me wanna rock my body armor
Still I'm probably calmer
Than your average Dalai Lama
I use the meditation, I stay patient
But I never deal with hesitation
I'm way blunted yo, I can give a what
If your favorite stations feelin me
These rap cats are killin me
No type of stability
My ability got more cats in New York
Running than Hilary
We be chillin, where the blood be spillin
We got the red badge of courage for bravery
Me and my man Teodross Avery
Blow away the legacy of slavery
Through any phone, sax or a micro
Hotter than a light show with the pyro-techniques
Through the speakers let the best speak
In less we forget where we come from
Blast you into next week now you got
History to run from


My work ethic, keep me deep in the cut like anti-septic
Respected in the world where people faker than prosthetics
Stay true to a certain aesthetic
Protect it like the hip-hop secret service
Cat off top lookin nervous
Wondering when we gonna set it
Anticipation will kill you if you let it in your aura
Reflect it like god's face upon the water
You can't lead a man to water
Like you can a lamb to slaughter
So I concentrate on me so I can
Keep my plans in order
I clutch like King Cobra
I rock while ya'll boulder
Chop emcees up, put em in the grinder
Like farmer of Dakota
Cuz I'm colder than a polar
Walk, talk and stand on my ancestors shoulders
Told you we at wear like sista soldier
Battle tactics, spray wars
Like gat clips, full metal jackets
That hit, BAW!
Got you lookin acrobatic doing back flips
Even if the track skips
We improv like Jazz Artists
Freestyle, hop back on the beat
And rock regardless

I'm saying, ya'll with me tonight?
I'll travel at the speed of light
When I see the mic, I get this on lock
Cuz my song is in the key of life
I roll with my ????
Cuz we be alike
Consider them family
Make sure they all eating right
See the plan is to feed the fam
Then free the land, before I get old
I can't be young forever like Peter Pan
Cats pale in comparison
So bad they need a tan
Barely see they hand
Craft they face like a seed of sand
See the ??? you got to beat the man
Understand I'm saying
The writing on the wall like a paint can
Spraying graffiti on your soul
Music completely make me whole
I'm saying, trying to keep my
Pockets on swoll
To give back to the community
Make a future for you and me
From my birth certificate to my eulogy
Usually in Brooklyn

Welcome sports fans, to where the journey begins
I can feel the fire burnin within
One team'll earn a win, the other one's headed home
So who would fare better in the dome?
A battle between New York and Indy; so we got a veteran
Against a sick D, but I brought a friend with me
(KWELI~!)

Indy's hard to stop unless you got a Bart Scott
And an island named Revis to stop Reggie receivin
 Yeah, we'll have to keep an eye on those two
 Yup, both dudes got all of pro tools

Very true; we'll see what D-Rex can do
It's win or cry, like Joseph it's live Addai

Both hopin to ""Get By"" just to take it in the mix
Create enough pressure to live it high, digits in the sky
Give it to the guy who's named after his team
 Oh you must mean 23
 Shonn Greene!

But #10 is ready to send 'em to their homes
Cause he's already owned the throne
So he know what's in it for him, sayin child should blend
To find Santonio with the dust in the wind

Well D'Brickashaw better get his paws off D3
A beast at D.E. feedin on QB's
Mathis no joke and Brackett is so stoked
Battlin toe to toe maybe after the post-show
They can be friends, but not while the Jets are seekin revenge
For last post-season's events
'Til we speak again, suppose only time will tell
Who climbed and who fell, so who wants it more?

Long as I'm on my grind
I'll know I'll make it by

Yo, money I'm down by law, we draw long arms
B-boy rock steady like Strong Arm
Shy by nature I gotta force to get my words out
But then I rock monkey bars like a ghetto work out
I ain't beefin'
But I came up on these same streets and
I be seein' these people riding the train sleeping
Policemen reaching for they guns offering help
You get arrested and your choice is rehab or off in a cell
Now let me think: gotta do what you gotta to get by
Give me a cell 'cause in rehab you can't get high
Now I can't sit by
Watch my fam just die
Roaming the street while society romanticize
We, living like roaches saluting the black flag
Thieves in the night like the Ali Babas of Baghdad
Pack your guns and shoot the black hawks down
Asking ""Who wanna back talk now?""


We pulled up and it's quarter to eight
Ordered his plate
Got the whole town on lock from border to state
Hate pouring out of his pores
Defying the laws
Had the fat Cuban cigar bite in his jaws
Jaws are sharp - always had hammerheads circling
Bitch stop tough ass niggas had 'em Urkel-ing
Indent - he just want his 20 percent
Getting bent paying his rent
Lay in his tent
Popped out five in the morn'
Getting it on
While most of ya'll still in bed and ain't even yawn
He on the block hot
Pot holders holding his rock
That he boiled in pot
Spoiled his block
Mothers out four in the morn' waiting in line
Acting like Tita Divine
Is freeing they mind
Shots came rangin'
Old ladies started sangin'
Everybody in the hood started bangin'
The world we live in: scandalous ain't it?
You could spray paint it on the wall
That's for all of ya'll
The fall of your regime
The rise of me and my team
It's all love they owe us let's redeem
Cadillac the contract
Bubble back where my mom's at
You know a son go to war and combat
Yasser Arafat in track
The steady Aromatic is back
So get your Malcom X hats
Dust it off the rack
Like a Stevie Wonder 8-track
Agony, Kweli
Chemical, Ali
They probably waiting on us we hit heavy
The beautiful struggle, the Strong Arm Steady",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-for-the-city-lyrics
You Tried It,UnKnown,2016.0,"Who steals from fans from Kickstarter, my nigga? (Whoa)
Who made a diss record about me? Who does that? (whoa)
Nah, I don’t know who that is, son (who does that?)
They say I rap too fast
I got to slow it down so these fucking troglodytes can understand me

Let me tell a little story about a fuckboy named Diabolic
Big baby, talks a lot of shit, I call him Diaperbolic
Trolling me on Twitter, this bitch is trying to get his life acknowledged
Making all them threats will get you wet, don’t be hyper, Bolic
Yeah, some of these white rappers be out of pocket
Black rappers talk oppression and here they come trying to stop it
Promise, I’m on another level, I’m way above their garbage
I’m about to show these fucking devils who the true god is
Now here come Diaperbolic on his usual ho shit (you see him)
I tried to Google one of this loser’s songs, but he got no hits (wow)
Focus, then address me properly as the legend
When you get accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression, don’t it?

Too many people focus on the little shit
Illiterate, ‘till Kweli bring the light like a 
So elegant, intelligence will make you feel irrelevant
Especially when I just begun, the story just developing (This for Brooklyn)

Yeah you tried it, but you failed though
You tried to hide it, but we can see that you’re frail though
You tried to fight it, but you’re real slow
So when you get the lightning, that shit hit you like a real blow

You’re dishonest with a stale ass delivery, you should spit harder
Give the fans their money back, you’re a homeless rapper with a Kickstarter (fucking thief)
I crowdfund for the people, you crowdfund for your ego
Your bullshit excuses about back orders is feeble, ho
What you’re nervous, man? You brought up me and Don Lemon in Ferguson
I was in the streets with the people, no media, no advertisements
The news cameras 
You say you’re hip-hop, but you never speak about the blacks the cops is murdering (crickets)
But let a black rapper try to speak on his people’s struggle
Here you go, all up in your fragile fucking feelings with your weak rebuttals (coward)
I know you’re mad that I topped so many white people’s favorite lists
I go to one of your shows, but they don’t fucking exist

Disrespect, you’re getting checked, ho, you start it, I’ma end it though
You ain’t got the heart, my intuition like a stethoscope
Be accountable for your words, make sure that shit you talk is credible
And if justice ain’t served, then never ask me to let it go

Nobody was talking to you, why you ‘reso fucking fragile, huh?
Gaggle cock, you’re just a fucking muppet, bitch, you’re Fragile Rock
You say you’re showing up to fight, but Brooklyn is kind of far
From the dash dreams of a fake R.A., rhyming in the basement of Long Island bars
Bitch, you mad you’re white? You’re about to be black and blue
Stalking me on Twitter, why so fragile? No one’s attacking you
Aw, who hurt you? Point me to the place of the doll where they touched you?
This is a safe space, stay in your fucking place
You can’t silence me, my blackness is my property
My life matters, my fist in the air’s exactly where it’s got to be
Oppression is vulgarity, but it is the violence that they’re shocked to see
Would you call my tactics terrorist if my name was fucking Cadmus?
Such hypocrisy, this a movie, is it horror or is it comedy?
I’m  of this rap shit, don’t get shot like James 
My discography is sort of like Jesus with the carpentry
Don’t ever question how I move the booth to stay on top of me
(Bitch)

Too many people focus on the little shit
Illiterate, ‘till Kweli bring the light like a 
(Wait, I got some bars for Remedy too
In case he wants to bring his bitch ass back up)

My superior ability causes inferior fragility
You had a buzz once, but you’re soft as the fuzz on a killer bee
I really don’t know about this beef with Remedy and Cilvaringz
But Remedy gon’ meet a field nigga living in the field of dreams
For real, nigga, you’re a philistine, lyrically I’m a guillotine
RZA called him a thief, he’s a good actor so he might steal the scene
I’m still a king, your respect in the game don’t amount to a fucking hill of beans
You’re still a fiend, crack is wack, I ain’t know that was still a thing

I’m done man
Man fuck these white supremas rappers, my nigga man
Ayo, Poison Pen, Immortal Technique, come get your boy
He’s embarrassing your fucking crew, man
Wu-Tang, come get this Remedy nigga, man
I’m out

Where Do We Go (Dedicated to Weldon Irvine),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Res)
Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run and there's nothin new
Where do we go for inspiration?

Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run and there's nothin new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration

Yea, I see a place where little boys and girls
Are shells in the oceans not knowin they a pearl
No one to hold 'em while they growin
They livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world
Now, if I could help it I tell it just like it is
And I may say some things that you don't like to hear
I know this: that people lie, people kneel
People die, people heal, people steal, and people shed tears
What's real, blood spills, gun kill, the sun still - rise
Above me, trust me, it must be, morning - time
Wake up, the stakes up
Everybody want the cake up, to break up with the crew
But when the karma come back for what you do
It's too late to make up - some excuse

Wherever there's competition you gonna find the race
I find a place in my heart for this hip-hop
And pump blood through my vein my skin get hot
I take you very serious and make you write more
If I don't celebrate I got nothing to fight for
I'm tight raw, excite y'all like nightfall
I'm tight y'all, I walk the street like y'all
About action, talk is cheap, right y'all?
You start yappin' think about the beef you might cause
The trouble you could get into
You don't study, you not prepared and cats is testin you
What you gonna do when you gotta face
The manifestation of the words that you put in space
They already there you can't take 'em out
The studio gangsta inside you tryin' to break out

Here we go, are you recording?
Aiyyo Tone, is it ah, ah on?
Let it bump, they love it in the red
Reflection Eternal, that other shit is dead
Yes, let me know if you alive
Put your hands in the air, let me know if bring it live
Hey, come on, hey, I love music
Music is the river, we floating, we get to live it
Like the souls of those swept away crossing the Mississippi
Honorary spokesman, my focus is so scary
Vocalist for the hopeless, I'm championing my city
Cracks in the levy, we catching the last ferry
Apply this application that's crashing your Blackberry
Rock Steady like Aretha, it's got heavy
What's that about cat and mouse, Tom and Jerry?
Commissary get commissioned, the prison no sanctuary
For the locked up, every relationship adversary
Ain't no replacement, so make a statement before you buried
With very legendary already, no need to worry
Pay attention to the music, led your hazard to bury
Mixed for transistor radio speakers, Marvin married
His daughter in sort of a quest for a father figure
The little Stevie Wonder was killing 'em at the shows
Best songwriter since Smokey and Quincy Jones
Gill Scott and Last Poets turned they poems into song
Everybody know that my favorite Nina Simone
Rest in peace Michael Jackson, I think I need a shamone
Paid attention to his lyrics, he wished we leave him alone
(Leave me alone)
Huh, leave him alone
Huh, leave him alone
James Brown and Michael Jackson was working until they gone
On tour just so they could make payments on they homes
Everybody cried when Usher sang him a song
Joe Jackson was promoting his label, he know he wrong
Shame how our heroes are broke, we call 'em stars
That's because when they falling to earth, they falling hard
Everybody balling hard but they sound wack
If you in the resistance then this your soundtrack

Move Back,The Beautiful Mix CD,2004,"Ayy, you're too close

Motherfucker, move back!
Move back, move back, I'mma bitch slap the next one
That's what I'm talking about (x3)

Ay yo, I'm married to the shit, but that's an institution
As for the love, but the money make the shit confusing
I must be why the divorce rate is through the roof and
Bitches that's just in it for the dough and make it too abusing
Motherfucker move back, or just keep it moving
I'm a problem for these niggas cause I'm the solution
The music they're doing, they're doing cause they're disillusioned
Niggas got labels, now it's time for distribution
About to organize all the real niggas too
Not them Bill O'Reilly-faced smiley face, jigga boos
Niggas who snitch on you is scared to pull the trigger too
We get at you and run up on you like the Nile River do

I know God don't like ugly
But I can take it there, trust me
I know my mama proud of me
So no, you ain't got to love me

What I Feel,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Black man ain't allowed a moment of weakness
The crew ain't got no room for those who flee when the beef hit
Cause they don't want no beef like people who only eat fish
You get the third degree like my society secret
N***ers run so much we spend a grip on them sneakers
I'd rather stand and fight there's no respect for the meek shit
I'm trying to get this cheese like a pizza that's deep dish
The sensitive shit you can keep it.. what I feel
All through the night and for when it's right, as long as it's tight
It'll demand to get performed on the mic
And hopefully become a song that you like, and it probably will
Cause what I spit is what so real, it's based on what I feel
All I did was take a lil moment, homie I'm giving you notice
Last days that they predicted upon us
N***ers stick it to be sitting on corners, n***ers do what you will
It's your life, it really don't matter what I feel
When I pick up the mic, and spit what I write
Go and sign myself so I can give you a sight
Into this tunnel of this court doing quarter to life
Until the end you finally see the light
What I feel
Don't matter trying to get what you need
When you gotta cut yourself just to see if you bleed
You need the pain in your life
Without the pain you can't tell if it's real
It's a hell of a deal
This is what I feel
All throughout my heart and my soul
Affect my memory like an actor before the start of a role
I represent my community and part of a whole
Pop your balloon mindstate, it make it harder to blow
You in the front row trying to diss, you make it part of the show
The right fist will make you part of the flow
No question I'm the answer for this
I'm harder than a n***er with a cancerous prostate tryin to pimp
I got the real version of lyrics that you tryin to kick
Yeah I'm crossing n***ers out, like what im writin to spit
But on the flip son, everything im writing is hits
Like the stick of green canabis that we twist then we stick to our lips
End your carreer with a flick of my wrist, death stroke with the pen
Then I'm flipping the bitch
Do what I want, whenever I want, never gunna front
Give it to you whether you want it or not
When I pick up the mic, and spit what I write
Go and sign myself so I can give you a sight
Into this tunnel of this court doing quarter to life
Until the end you finally see the light
What I feel
Don't matter trying to get what you need
When you gotta cut yourself just to see if you bleed
You need the pain in your life
Without the pain you can't tell if it's real
It's a hell of a deal
This is what I feel
Everybody's a critic, people be hating even talking under their breath
They got me hotter than mating season
This hater nation but the nature of the hate is changing
Like the government deciding who's our faviorite nation
You know it ain't them hations
Or anybody we call terrorist, even if the world hate americans
Our foreign policy destroy they country properly, we demostrate our power
To stimulate our economy
New york is my city
Sort of like vice city
Up all night, to to sky, pink like white titties
Making the classic rthym, I'm having visions
And when I attack the track you get dwarfed like sado-masichism
Send the voice of activism now n***ers ain't eating like ghandi
Defeating the british with pacifism
And the people love it, see what I mean haters
I got my love like radio rahim
When I pick up the mic, and spit what I write
Go and sign myself so I can give you a sight
Into this tunnel of this court doing quarter to life
Until the end you finally see the light
What I feel
Don't matter trying to get what you need
When you gotta cut yourself just to see if you bleed
You need the pain in your life
Without the pain you can't tell if it's real

So Hood,The Beautiful Mixtape Vol. 2: The Struggle Continues,UnKnown,"Beautiful Mixtape

Don't get the flow mixed up, this is uncut raw
You can cook it in your spoon, that's what your lighter is for
And the aroma are set to move the right tone up
And your girl, I really wanna ice tone her
Don't get mad if she like rappers
I'm be an MC who like Bergundy, and ?he man perty?
Look young in his face, and he over thirty
Giving out Hancocks, like my name was Herbie
Survived from a fucked up past, set my bed where the springs was out
Now they ask what my rings about
This is Ghost, God type man only, stay true
You disagree, well then fuck you
I don't gotta say jack to you
I got alot of metal that rat for you
And if I point it your way, he gon clap for you
Body something mad terrible, you know how them ratchets do
Extra caskets and church classics, blowing an ill dust joint
At your wake as I drive past it, now that's murder
2004 blood further dick, you ain't that big cus you ain't never heard of
Or brought up in any convo, Benny Blanco your style will get your face picked off
And your nose ripped off, you fake niggas don't understand
This is Theodore, we gon blow like a hundred fans

New York will test you, try to get you, don't be scared about it
It'll caress you and molest you, but don't be weird about it
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve and dare to come here without it
You bout it, then let it flow out like tears of fear shouted
Ain't no kick the can, Chutes and Ladders or Candyland
Mothers survive their sons, trying to be a family man
Out to there like hand to hand, walkers, bikers and camel stands
In order to tell a ma'am from man here, you need a mammogram
Patrol, substance for nothing to blame the manners on
Up at the crack of dawn, heard the word and your path is on
Still working for nothing, abandon your dreams
Now they tattered, torn to pieces, scattered on the ground that we walking on
Same ground around the dead body police draw chalk upon
Your name familiar on the radio police are talking on
Do what you gotta do to eat, and keep the heat from off the arms
Sometimes you gotta compromise what you was brought up on
The most exciting lyrics Kweli and Ghost is writing
Psychosis leading to excessive and hopeless biting
There's no denying your ho is eying, the flow is iron
The Vitamin C you see
By the color of the pee
The muthafucking, most gutter MC
Dropped out of school at eighteen
With a dream and started running the streets
Keep the receipts, don't need your college degree
Because my lyrics earn me honorary PHDs, yeah

People ask my why I keep it so hood
And I simply reply, it feels so good
We hit your ears in ways you ain't know the flow could
And make your momma say boy, you up to no good",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-so-hood-lyrics

We go through episodes too, like ""Attack of the Clones""
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers, spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Core bailed me out
To get by.. just to get by, just to get by, just to get by

Numbers have risen, they victim black in the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let them know we missin you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The TV got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by.. just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon, ""Imagine all the people watch""
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop, what

Long Hot Summer,UnKnown,UnKnown,"This right here go out to all the ladies
Who cannot predict when the sun will shine
Just make sure when it do, you bask in it
You embrace it, you let it hit you in the face
Huh, you know what I'm talking bout
Yo, yo, ay, ay
The sun was in the sky
I was bumping ""Sly Love"", hard to find in the summertime
You can spend a lifetime tryna predict when the sun will shine
Or simply bask in it like the flowers that come alive
Summer days always start extraordinary
Summer nights there's water in the air, wish it would storm already
I hit the corner store, I had a taste for strawberry quick
Seen the broad, very tall, very thick, licking her lips
Hips barely fit through the door
Imagine that, she bought a dutch and a lemonade out the Escalade
Bumping ""Renegade"" by Em and Jay
Symmetrical braids, incredible edible legs
Just to track her down, I went on a ghetto crusade
Serenade this angel like Cyrano de Bergerac
The lightness of her being was unbearable
So here I am at her apartment building, apart from feeling
""Heartless"" like Kanye with a talk-box
I walked four blocks out my way cause her walk had me focussed
Her scent had me open, and since we had a moment
What I'ma say? Hey, I seen you in the store?
She went into a building and I had to guess the floor
Knocking on every door, that took bout a half an hour
Till she answered ""whoa"", was still soaked from the shower
I seen some sour diesel broken up on my CD
She introduced me to her room mates, this Vanilla Dutch and this is Swisha Sweety
I got you open yet?
It ain't over yet, I love you when you're soaking wet
Been looking for you like the bounty hunter Boba Fett
I'm the one but you don't know it yet
The wettest skin, what a better beginning, she let me in
Let us begin, perfect weather for sinning, my Seraphin
We on the floor, barely made it through the door
New high score, she never came like that before, wow",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-long-hot-summer-lyrics

Lifting off
Lifting off, never been so high
I get on my plane and see planes go by
High enough to see the angels fly
Now that we back in the game, these lames gon' die
Lifting off, like the Mars rover or the weight on your shoulder
That held you down with the weight of a boulder
Whether a drug dealer baking the soda or a revolutionary soldier
We here for you yo, the waiting is over, cause we
Lifting off, off the ground, take you up in the clouds
Floating on the notes and tones
Until the condensation drip from my brow, we'll disappear in the crowd
Till I'm surrounded with sounds, count it down and we
Lifting off, five on it, used to the split the cost
Roll it up, take a hit and cough, relax
Keep reefer like a fifth of ros'
We make 'em dance like Kalashnikov, take 'em higher, we
Lifting off, light it up, take a blade, divide it up
It's not enough, grab your arms and tie 'em up
Go further, hit the pipe and fire it up
'Cause they like the rush, when they
Lifting off, light it up, take a blade, divide it up
It's not enough, grab your arms and tie 'em up
Go further, hit the pipe and fire it up
'Cause they like the rush, when they
Lifting off, I've never been so low
When I smoke, I don't wanna be dependent on the dro
For the happiness 'cause happiness should come from your soul

Lifting off, I tried to buy LSD
But a dred refused to sell it to me
He was like, well yeah, I got it, but that's a white man drug
Not for us, I said aight man, love, still I be
Lifting off, in the limelight, indication dazed
Shrooms had my mouth dry looking for the Gatorade
On a date with the high made me fade away
I left shorty at the table with a razor blade
Lifting off but see I'm getting off track
No tracks in my arms, I never fucked with the smack
Or the crack, only vice was the trees and the 'gnac
Until my man Jimmy got me onto Jack, throw it back and I'm

Coming down, looking back in the Stuy', ain't no problem they
Lifting off on the daily behind the restoration plaza
Where they got a production of Alvin Ailey
At the theater named after Billy, she struggled with it too
If she was here right now she'd probably hit it too
Lifting off but still there's no excuse
Spread the myth that if I don't get high then I don't produce
These people acting like they want the truth
But the appearance of the truth is good enough
They don't want the proof
Huh, they get to too confused
They looking too confused, the pigeon flew the coop
I stay out the bubble but they keep me in the loop
Soon as I'm in the house it's through the roof and we

Talib Kweli-Verse 1:
It's a funky sen-sa-tion ain't it?
I'm havin a conversation wit'cho imagination
It was explainin how you was waitin, for somethin amazin
Like when it come out you out the door racin to the store (*zoom*)
It took a lot of perse-verance and patience
We was preparin for our place among the ancients
Yo basically yo' take on me ain't makin me
Or breakin me and yo I hate to see a fake MC
I take out all my competition from like A to Z
Cause I get fly more frequently than a travel agency
That's what I'm made to be, hip-hop through my artery
An important part of me the soundtrack to my oddysey
It got me, rockin retardedly
Pardon me for speakin incorrect politically
Anything less would be me speakin hypocritically, and I don't do dat
You lingerie MC's I see through that
I make a point about you and your crew, go ""Tru dat""
Who dat? It's the Reflection
Remember the name, slid in the game before the ""2000 Season"" came
Breakin the chain, usin the pain as our ammunition
To blast Babylonian towers out of position
It's the Reflection and we poppin like your ears on a plane
We make you disappear like tears in the rain
The fears in your brain is clear when I appear on the terrain
And bloody your nose
I got more lines than co-CAINE that's why you sniffin' around
We diggin' for different sounds to keep it hittin'
Straight up the only way we gettin' down with the sound is provacative
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
You got a issue with that then it ain't my problem kid
Y'all niggas gotta eat, we gotta live, yo
We all gotta eat and gotta live

Talib Kweli-Verse 2:
We remain, hotter than the blue part of the flame
I got a Glock in my brain
That baffle weapons inspections like Saddam Hussein
And rocks with the impact
Gettin beat with socks filled with ten-packs of tokens
Men's backs get broken when I get open
Words more than spoken
Most of dem MC's on the first thing smokin
Leavin town at the same time causin traffic on the interstate
We stay droppin classics cause the key word is innovate
These cats is so plastic that we call 'em laminated
Tried to duplicate the style quickly got frustrated
More desperate than dudes who search people's ashtrays for clips
I burn MC's like Coca-Cola through the paint on your whip
Shit! My rhymes is like a magnifyin glass
When I shine my light through it, I burn up everything in my path
Last Dragon like Lee-roy (sho' nuff) rock for the b-boy
My rhymes are so sharp you catch cuts that key-loid
Destroyed the decoy, most of y'all d-boy, my culture
It's not that I hate, y'all just p-noid cause y'all fake
Embarassed and ashamed and don't know where to put the blame
And never hesitate to call out my name!
I ain't effected by the negative
It's the Reflection and we dealin with the positive
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's the Reflection kid
Never gotta look between the lines to get the messages
You're too sensitive, checkin out our references
The turntable and microphone specialist
It's the Reflection kid, it's the Reflection kid
It's the Reflection kid, like that like that

Teef’s Theme,The Beautiful Mixtape Vol. 2: The Struggle Continues,UnKnown,"I smoke the light bud watchin' Fight Club 'til I'm charged
Like a suicide bomber off the words of Bin Laden
My block got dark and mysterious movements
I make the rebel music that the murderous move with
Thief's theme, divine style like the Steam Team
My rhyme style got me flossin' like my teeth clean
I drop the kind of gem that make your mama eyes water
This destiny like Nas' daughter
Unfortunately, you met the predator that's stalking that's me
I do it Travis Bickle style like ""You talkin' to me?""
Walkin' with me you see the hand of God to force an MC
Put it down so hard respect is like a boss in the street
Workin' so hard that I talk in my sleep
Brain still goin' still flowin'
Watch the lyrics spill I fill with ill poems
You 'bout to do it big we do it way bigger
Razor blade spitter
In the hood let my nigga Jae get ya

In the belly of the beast came a rebel named Joshua
That always had intentions of blowin' and being popular
Know when cops get buck, chumps get shook down
With extra large shells now there go your critical breakdown
Contemplatin' on chips and your ice
But I hear pops saying ""You gotta do something positive with your life""
I ain't your typical thug
Leave you drippin' in blood
From a long clip and a slug
Hollow tips in your mug
Peddlin' drugs, I've been immune to the drama
Expressin' my persona
Always raisin' up the scama
I'm  with four strikes against me
I'm the best ya'll dudes suck you still gotta convince me
Peep your boy drop knowledge
I ain't never went to college
But I can teach how to get verbally demolished
My flow polished with greatness
My flow wear glow my hooptie got a lean
And my bars done mean
My and Talib will show you how to spit it
Anybody could get it
Spectators, broads and critics
Don't be a statistic
Of the murder rate
Run up on ya, dim all lights, park and clap at your vertibrae

In the hood we them new gangsters
Garage scientist gang
Mind walkin' with a treacherous aim
My strain potent
Alchemy outspoken
Out in the open
Spittin' flame will have my mouth smokin'
Powerful parts of osmosis
Gasses, liquids, solids, ashes
Transmute and my life flashes across
Free from disguise of falseness
But still I floss
Never see me rockin' crosses
With black heaters we rack cheetahs
Wrap cheeba
Black leaders all gathered 'round the black Jesus
It's gospel when I write it down rain hail snow
Earthquakes puts the faith back in my apostles
Revolutionary gangstas techs squeeze murder beef
K-I-N-G medallions
Most wanted come close to (speak)
Cowboys clappin' who carry no holster
Don't approach us
Cause that's when ya ending starts
Heard the truth was power without a fight might bend ya heart
Cause when the truth hurts -- that's when the cleansing starts
Once knowledge is born I hit ten men with darts
When the end is marked, I just settle the plot
And when I score I'ma make sure I'm never forgot
To every block, hood, ghetto and park
I spit it sharp
For the villains still running from Narcs",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-teefs-theme-lyrics
RIP,"We Run This, Vol. 7",2012.0,"Make your movie in HD, bet you it ain't a saga
Me, I'm a slinger; you a singer like Lady Gaga
I could see through you 'bout as clear as Ciroc Vodka
Knock out your teeth with the back of the mic proper
I don't give a fuck about a chopper
Leave you in the doctor; I-Pod filled with Big Poppa
Make sixteens I call Oscars for actors
Get in your neck and your back like chiropractors
I'm so nice I could give you a fact backwards
""Out hardest the is Ghost"", keep your kids close
Sick when I was nine years old, ask my kinfolk
My people been broke, a couple been rich
If rap was jail, I'd be running the whole pen, bitch
Ghost, Talib and Jean Grae
X-Men of hip hop, and still rock harder than Green Day
Classic like vinyl but let the machines spray

Come on peel a bill off the knot, in ya pocket
Be a super star at the bar, we 'bout to lock it down
Got green in the black sacks of chocolate
Stop it, before you say something that's out of pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket

(Get your rock out of my pocket, nigga!)
No it's not...like Charlie Brown who got a {ROCK!}
In his pocket trick or treating, I mean I'm a medium
For leaking heat, a freaking genie, Jean's a genius
You idiots, I'm mean to you, sweetie and I'm a queen
I don't swing open like Lamborghini doors do -- whores do
My job is to floor you, block you and ignore you
Pop you like a blocked call, I'm like Rockmore
You watching me like Rockwell's pop song just popped on
(Your lockjaw's a good thing) I'm glad I put the hammer to it
My handlers will handle this (Ma'am, she didn't do it)
Yeah, what they said, don't want no arraignments rocking round
That would be worse than K-Fed doing ""PopoZao""
Right in my momma's house with his little rocket out
Jesus! Wet my fingers and just stick 'em in the socket now (Please)
I'd rather be dead than watch wack shit
Color me gone, fill in the dirt, tell 'em I kicked... ten buckets
And it's all your fault, I'm rotting
Shouldn'ta done that, lied about rocking
Huh, it's all your fault I'm rotting
You shouldn'ta done that, lied about rocking


What is it? ... What, is you tryin to lose your life?
Ancient wisdom like Druids but I'm foolish on the mic
Flow the truest, undisputed cause I do it how I like
It's the crack so the fiends' lips is bluish from the pipe
Nice try, you ain't fly, you lying on the ProTools
Yeah, your vocals mighta flew but you local like Q
Applying these old rules to new dudes don't work
Even though they softer than yogurt, and covert
If you don't work you don't eat
You fuck around and get higher than a nosebleed seat, try to compete
Ya done beat yourself before ya even started
E'rybody knows you don't go full retarded, bogus artists
Rock the stage, you going off the page and making no sense
The way I do these rappers so ugly the flow is grotesque

You a foe, unidentified flying object",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-rip-lyrics

Clowning these lames you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing
Race it till your death to your holly celebration
God bless a lady if only accelerate you
Cause we're speeding when we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I'm staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same change, work in the same fields
Now we're independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I low it past the procrastinators
Well fast, is bound to going backwards
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go

Have the little boys coming fast to the speed race
Pulling cables with my team best believe I'mma see paper
With extraordinary gena, trust me to lead lay you
Highway of life faster than a car
Rick it in the trunks of the rappers that got balls
Never rat out cause we lived through the battles, we got scars
Mr. international, half of the Black Star
It's the sound that you're missing I'm here with your air glisten
Play it loud at your wind when you're gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain't screaming
Just whisper and then we're leaving

I gotta win to the fire

No, you can't stop it
Because I'm destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it's happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
On your mark, get set, when I thought the jet
Look how far I get, I'm not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don't exist, it's a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market's flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It's so ironic, it's beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don't get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you're tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That's why I'm leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it's all about the winning, it's never about the wait
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops

Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spiritual, it's been great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better

Every day I gotta
Trust the God and hustle hard
My grind is real, my hustle dope
I'm finding meals, I'm signing deals
I'm the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it's real, but I'm focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you're not in tune, no, you're not immune
No acclamation, no golden seal
You sick side, gotta flush it down
We talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain't nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you're out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you're gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That cock only think you punch him out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you're made to do
I got faith in you, you're gonna make it through
Cause you don't chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a thing to do
Won't taste no foods like they put you
No more wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vault
As long as you walk on the earth with that first got to make me proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are

Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way

It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I'm hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids right after school
Think it's hard, yeah, that's true
This is what I have to do
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
What we got is true they listen
Try to talk to gal but is real what I'm spitting
Call Christ by name but still ain't rising
Set to my lane but still ain't listening
Got ice in the vans we make so frigid
Still in the kill brain self when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don't stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain't living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanks Giving
We love that color 25% more like we like to face prison
But just because the president was black there's no racism?
Postracial? More like most racial
They hate for you disgraceful
Don't let them take you off your base, let them motivate you
Don't let it overtake you, so what another clause
Survive the storm but riding on the beach in the southern wild

It's deep, go ahead and sleep, they know in the street
Kwe' gon flow on the beat proper composin complete operas

Yeah I admit, I'm guilty, the way I spit is filthy
I keep it gritty so they get it they feel me, the flow
Is known for touchin' the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language they know I keep customers
The writin' therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin'
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin you a contact high, my name buzzin'
And I came in the game with nothin'
All these rappers sound the same with the yay
They pumpin how they spraying something
Just cuz your lips are flapping don't mean you saying something (word)
Make sure you don't get it twisted and never make assumptions (no)
I don't compete with emcees I'm way above 'em
My competition is non-condition time's running out
The clock is ticking my stock is risen
The plot just thickened
The story is reaching the climax when will he end it

Don’t let emotion control you and fuck the whole event
You gotta move your pieces and control your centre
You gotta move in peace and control your centre

I never stop no matter what the competitor’s gotta say
Chop it up like an edit, a predator’s gotta prey
Stand down, look at my city right in the face
 recognize that we caught up in yesterday
Hey, wait, I’m building castles out in Brooklyn
This chess, not checkers, watch the king switch with the rook
And then it’s checkmate nigga
The check play  then it’s  bricking up your chest plate nigga
Soul inventors never no pretenders
It’s like my borough is my co-defender
Ain’t no agenda besides control the centre
Is it the hustlers or the customers that‘s co-dependent?
If the knight takes the bishop, does he go to Heaven?
That’s the question, science versus religion
Apply it to higher living you’ll find it’s the same mission
My flow is lotus position, you’re broken up like a bedframe
You can’t advance on the board without an endgame
So what’s your endgame?


Life ain’t a game, it’s a bitch and she gonna diss you
You tryna master the game like you searching for Bobby Fischer
You fallin’ victim to the lies you be clutching on
Such a pawn to the bandwagon you jumping on
We ain’t game players, we’re game changers who spray up the train
And remain famous, my neighbours be waving flags like gang bangers
The knights and the police patrol the blocks on horses
The bishop saw the priest, they asking who to worship
Everybody claim the king, it ain’t a secret
That the king the most important but the king also the weakest
Especially when his queen is gone he be leanin’ on the other for protection
See your queen is much more than just affection, word
I need my queens to recognise their power
Got the world in your palm like Ms. Hill’s “Final Hour”
I forever stay clever, knock you out like Mayweather
For the belt cause the most difficult opponent is myself, yes",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-castles-in-bk-lyrics

Here I am...
Step out on the block to face the sun
Greet the people in the village that raised my son
As far as days go this look like an amazing one
I feel more normal in the summer the same as the Yankees won
It's like of course, what you expect less
The night about to kick off, folks is out in their best dress
Pimps and whores rising on the horizon
Ballers coppin more diamonds
Watch the ferrion looking towards Zion
What's embedded in the hardest head
It's the epic lie to me and debt to a
Country that gives us no credit
So cats stealin money cash hoes 'cause
That's what's expected
What's the bill when the original architect is kinetic
Mummies return, so dummies can learn
Just how much Hollywood got to burn
Of our money that's hard-earned
But that really ain't my concern

Trying to build a bridge so we can stay the course

Come across places were faces got tracks of tears
'cause the human race been runnin up on they backs for years
Yeah, but they don't break
They keep it movin like when I travel the land
And peep how other people do it
How other people go through it
I'm bridging the gap like the Black Eyed Peas
I'm lovin givin it back, to see them raise up
I'm living for that
To keep trying means you keep failing
But if you don't keep trying
That means you keep dying
What the hell, we gonna die anyway
Keep your soul live when you're here

Turn Down For What? Turn Up For The Dream Defenders,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I write this as I sit in the Florida office of Governor Rick Scott, live from the capitol. It is 4am and I am writing to the sound of a sleeping giant. I decided to spend the night here with the Dream Defenders, a student based activist group that organized around the George Zimmerman trial and is pushing to change Florida’s legislation to reflect racial profiling and have an impact on the school to prison pipeline. Today is Day 25, they’ve spent every night here for the last month.
When I first heard Phillip Agnew from the Dream Defenders speak about his organization, I was drawn in by the way he looked and spoke. Standing there at the podium with his snapback and tattoos explaining why the Dream Defenders were occupying the capitol until their demands are met, he looked like someone who would give me dap at one of my concerts. He was my peer, not an elder or authority figure. While the rest of the world was re-trying Zimmerman in their head and trying to figure out the best way to express outrage over something that already happened, the Dream Defenders were being proactive about the future. When Phillip Agnew said “we are not demonstrators, we are not protestors, we are not trying to change the verdict of the Zimmerman trial, we are only interested in moving forward” I was all in. They get that this is not about bitching and moaning, this is about necessary action. they have put together a program of three specific goals- repeal Stand Your Ground laws, repeal Zero Tolerance, the practice of criminalizing and arresting school kids, and better community outreach from police to help with racial profiling issues. Together, they call this Trayvon’s Law. While Stand Your Ground wasn’t used in the Zimmerman trial, the Dream Defenders believe that laws like Stand Your Ground and Zero Tolerance contribute to a culture of violence and a prison industry that plagues Florida’s youth, especially those of color.
I am not from Florida. Many have asked me why are you going to Florida when there are causes at home in NY you can support. They say we should boycott Florida. Whether we boycott Florida’s institutions or not, there are people in Florida who could use my voice and I will not boycott them. Florida is on the front line of a struggle we’ve been facing for years. I need to be in Florida now more than ever.
I love Stevie Wonder and I love that his decision to boycott Florida was championed by many other artists. Good for them. Stevie has always stepped up to the plate, and I take my cues from artists like him who I grew up admiring. He is using his status to shine light on the injustices here, I applaud that. But Mr. Wonder can afford to boycott Florida, he has achieved a certain status or level of celebrity privilege. The people who live here cannot.
I have met with backlash recently for speaking about privilege. Privilege is defined as a special right, advantage or immunity that is granted or available to only a particular person or group of people. For example, education should be a right, not a privilege. We all have privilege to some degree. As an American citizen, my passport grants me certain privileges that many in the world not born here do not have. As a man, I enjoy the privileges that come with living in a patriarchal society. As a celebrity I am privileged to travel the world and have my accommodations met. I am privileged to have a platform. As someone with privilege, I have a moral obligation to use it to shed light on those less unfortunate and expose injustice in our world. To acknowledge my privilege does not make me evil, less compassionate or indifferent to the suffering of those who don’t have it. In fact, NOT acknowledging my privilege is the worst way for me to help anybody. Although I did not ask to be born a man, I still enjoy the privilege that comes with it. White people did not ask to be born white but they damn sure enjoy white skin privilege in America. It has been maintained as an American way of life by the slave trade, Jim Crow, the prison industrial complex, the politics of hate of a racist legal system that was set up by slave owners. To recognize it is humane and compassionate.
Trayvon Martin had a right to walk home from the store without being racially profiled. George Zimmerman stripped him of his human and civil rights and decided that his own privilege and fear was worth more than the freedom Trayvon had to walk home. George Zimmerman liked to call himself protecting the neighbors. But when you are murdering your neighbors children you are doing the exact opposite.
I have heard young black people question the intentions of folks who stand up for Trayvon, saying that there are young black and brown people dying in our hoods every day that no one stands up for. They bring up Chicago’s murder rate. There have been charges of hypocrisy leveled against the movement from our own communities. They say that the problem of black on black violence in our communities is way bigger than what happened to Trayvon. To them the lost of this young man’s life is nothing new. Even right wing conservatives are in on the act, all of sudden quoting black on black crime statistics that they never cared about before they could be used to bolster an argument for why we shouldn’t care about Trayvon. I say to those people, you are right, I agree. But you aren’t talking about me, or the people I stand with. You aren’t talking about the Dream Defenders. You are talking about yourself.
If you find yourself saying these things, it would be hypocritical for YOU to jump on the Trayvon Martin bandwagon for a day then go back to making memes or watching reality TV or it is you do with your time. So don’t do that. Don’t be that hypocrite, but don’t use this an excuse to be idle either. Invest yourself in your community, invest in the movement. We are out here playing the long game, we are not interested in plugging holes. I have been doing this type of work in and outside of music for my entire adult life. Way before this is my responsibility as an artist, it’s my responsibility as a human being, as a MAN. This is why what Dream Defenders is doing is with Trayvon’s law is bigger than Trayvon. Remember, just because you don’t know about something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. The Dream Defenders started this work when Trayvon was murdered, they didn’t wait until after the fact when Zimmerman was acquitted. Harry Belafonte, who hipped me to Dream Defenders, had a meeting of like minded artists in NYC June 10th to discuss how we could create art that would shed light on the school to prison pipeline and the mass incarceration of a generation. This was a month before Magna Carta dropped AND a month before Zimmerman’s acquittal. The folks you see standing here don’t wait for the next tragedy to occur. They are constant and consistent, and that’s why I’m here.
I love Harry Belafonte and I love Jay Z. As an artist and as a man I am influenced and greatly inspired by both of them. People keep asking me which side of their feud I’m on. I am on neither of their sides, I side with the people. I know those gentleman do as well. I refuse to get caught in the distraction.
I am not an organizer. I am musician. I know how to be the voice of the struggle and direct you to those who are the frontline. But every once and awhile making songs is not enough. There are times when we have to bring our bodies to the struggle. A movement is nothing without the flesh. Online activism is only a tool for actual activism because if it doesn’t exist in real life it doesn’t really exist. This is the lesson of the Black Power and Civil Rights movement. This is the lesson of the Arab Spring. The Dream Defenders have the benefit of hindsight and the experiences of those who have done this before to study. They are cherry picking the best parts of each movement to create an unstoppable force. If you don’t get down now, you will get it later. In the meantime, we will be over here talking the talk and walking the walk. I encourage my peers who have platforms, fellow artists, celebrities, bloggers, politicians, teachers, parents, everybody, to support Dream Defenders however you can, thru donations, tweets or visits if you can make it to Tallahassee. Everybody always wanna turn up. We turn up for everything but our own self preservation. Let’s turn up for the Dream Defenders….",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-turn-down-for-what-turn-up-for-the-dream-defenders-annotated

Seen in the magazine, they used to have some love for me
Till my rhyme fucked up the editor, they never ran the story

It's mandatory I put that out there, so ya'll respect it

Struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the South
Before my ***** Core bailed me out
To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy through the red sky
With the window of the red eye

Feeling brand new and I jumped up
Feeling my highs, and my lows

Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin for parts

Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high

Cuz I'm colder than a polar
Walk, talk and stand on my ancestors shoulders
Told you we at wear like sista soldier
Battle tactics, spray wars

Got you lookin acrobatic doing back flips
Even if the track skips
We improv like Jazz Artists
Freestyle, hop back on the beat
And rock regardless

I'll travel at the speed of light
When I see the mic, I get this on lock
Cuz my song is in the key of life
I roll with my ????
Cuz we be alike
Consider them family
Make sure they all eating right
See the plan is to feed the fam
Then free the land, before I get old
I can't be young forever like Peter Pan
Cats pale in comparison
So bad they need a tan
Barely see they hand
Craft they face like a seed of sand
See the ??? you got to beat the man
Understand I'm saying
The writing on the wall like a paint can
Spraying graffiti on your soul
Music completely make me whole
I'm saying, trying to keep my
Pockets on swoll
To give back to the community
Make a future for you and me
From my birth certificate to my eulogy
Usually in Brooklyn
But my mind keep it movin
Ain't no mystery

Theme From Hi Tek,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Talib Kweli-Verse 1
Like, oh my God, what do we have here?
My man is on fire like the Ohio Players
Throw yo' hands in the air, keep 'em there if you with me
The mpc-60 is rare, but it still sound cripsy
Kicks and snares take 'em from elsewhere, samples is hard to find
We don't just act divine, we are
We walkin upright, you lack spine
I don't just write rhymes
I send force through pipelines to like minds
My light shine so bright it do be, vital like lifesigns
The night time is the right time for a battle so it's special
When cats don't just say your joint is hot, cats say ""Yo I respect you""
Put yo' fist in the air when you hear the manifesto
You had any prior doubts to my skills? Time to let go
Hi-Tek, the beats is right beside the soundgarden
Tracks get in the vein like heroin the way heads be noddin
Officially, people love our company like they was misery
I'm known to blast mc's with the cannon of history
Specifically the ones who forgot where they come from
So it's the light that they run from like roaches
Whenever the truth approaches
I attack the track ferocious, never lose my focus
Hold this true hip-hop, closest to my heart, and you know this
Nowadays it's hopeless and my diagnosis
Is to grab the microphone and be the dopest, you can quote this
Niggas sound like they injected with collagen
You followin these hollow men no honor when
You bite off more than you could chew or could be swallowin
Sorry man I ain't got no pity for you to wallow in
Quit hollerin before you get stomped out with my Solomon's
All the way from Lynn Street, to?
Always bringin you hot shit, aiyyo we promisin",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-theme-from-hi-tek-lyrics

Please, hold your applause until the end. We are GLAD to come and hear you speak. We love it! Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this but one time we were driving through the Mississippi delta and there was a brotha runnin up the side of the road and he didn't have any shoes on. He didn't have a shirt on and I started to drive right by this man. Kweli said ""Stop the car because that brotha might be in trouble"" and I stopped the car. Kweli said to the man he said ""Brotha are you ok do you need a ride somewhere?"" and the man looked at Kweli and said ""Shhhhhh... I'm escapin!"" and Kweli took him by the hand and said ""My brotha you didn't get the memo, we have been free for some time now"" well I'm wisinen up.

Get ’Em,The Beautiful Mix CD,2004,"This is more than you expected or thought
Somethin like A-Rod and Jeter at second and short
I rap now, cause you can bring a check in with thoughts
And it's the only way to get out second to sports
Who would think I would check into 'ports
Draggin' a Louis Vuitton pulley while I check in resorts
Where I'm from, the DT's checkin ya shorts
For the stuff you injectin or snort, it's real talk
And the critics still don't get it I'm flashin for mu'phuckas
That work hard but they still won't get it
This young boys still gon spit it
These are my shoes, with two pairs of socks on you still won't fit it
Even if you tighten the latch
I'm one of the few who make it look as easy as lighting a match
The dealer say I look right in the hatch
So I'm schemin on the Bentley wagon with the Breitling to match
And I'm back in the stu' writing from scratch
With an extended clip and a site on the ratch'
So it's no bystanders
Let me excuse you out the world
So they can say I showed my manners
I can call so many ho's I should go by Santa
And put them in a schedule and go by planner
I drive fast, like dude who used to blow Diana
And don't hit the breaks when I blow by scanners
Now it takes a good singer to blow on your record
And a lawyer that won't let it show on your record

Pepsi MAX NFL Audible - Ravens vs. Chiefs,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You're watchin the Pepsi Max NFL Audible

Hello sports fans, welcome to the Wild Card round
For a fame that'll be won on the ground
It's a matter of passion as opposed to a good call
B'more and K.C. in smashmouth football
J.C. from K.C.,
 
Ray and Ray from B'Mo'
Anquan and Flacco,
 
T. Jones and D. Bowe
Matt Cassel,
 
the battle with Ed Reed
Ray Rice lookin to part the Red Sea
So there's no time to be timid
The team that moves on will be the one that's controllin the line of scrimmage
So the player who penetrates can never hesitate
And the losin team will get a date
With the couch at the house the one central fear
Watchin it from home and waitin 'til next year
So while it's right here in front of you
Do whatever it takes to get a W
Otherwise it'll trouble you for months, and a stent won't fix it
Ice won't numb it, it's too deep of a sickness
It's called winless, and you don't want that
You gotta win this, handle your business
But never fall back, always attack
'til the big girl sings if you want that ring
So leave it on the field and you just might take it
As long as you gave it and didn't save it
Who wants it more?

Put your hands together ladies and gentlemen
You understand, yo we also got my man
A close personal friend of mine, Talib Kweli
Blackstar, Reflection Eternal
Yo, put it down like this
I'm sayin
African blood race through my vein
You can hear it in my name
And you can feel it in my game
I'm sayin the streets is drama
Make me wanna rock my body armor
Still I'm probably calmer
Than your average Dalai Lama
I use the meditation, I stay patient
But I never deal with hesitation
I'm way blunted yo, I can give a what
If your favorite stations feelin me
These rap cats are killin me
No type of stability
My ability got more cats in New York
Running than Hilary
We be chillin, where the blood be spillin
We got the red badge of courage for bravery
Me and my man Teodross Avery
Blow away the legacy of slavery
Through any phone, sax or a micro
Hotter than a light show with the pyro-techniques
Through the speakers let the best speak
In less we forget where we come from
Blast you into next week now you got
History to run from
Here we go, here we go, here we here we go X4

Blackstar, Reflection Eternal
Yo, put it down like this
My work ethic, keep me deep in the cut like anti-septic
Respected in the world where people faker than prosthetics
Stay true to a certain aesthetic
Protect it like the hip-hop secret service
Cat off top lookin nervous
Wondering when we gonna set it
Anticipation will kill you if you let it in your aura
Reflect it like god's face upon the water
You can't lead a man to water
Like you can a lamb to slaughter
So I concentrate on me so I can
Keep my plans in order
I clutch like King Cobra
I rock while ya'll boulder
Chop emcees up, put em in the grinder
Like farmer of Dakota
Cuz I'm colder than a polar
Walk, talk and stand on my ancestors shoulders
Told you we at wear like sista soldier
Battle tactics, spray wars
Like gat clips, full metal jackets
That hit, BAW!
Got you lookin acrobatic doing back flips
Even if the track skips
We improv like Jazz Artists
Freestyle, hop back on the beat
And rock regardless
I'm saying, ya'll with me tonight?
I'll travel at the speed of light
When I see the mic, I get this on lock
Cuz my song is in the key of life
I roll with my ????
Cuz we be alike
Consider them family
Make sure they all eating right
See the plan is to feed the fam
Then free the land, before I get old
I can't be young forever like Peter Pan
Cats pale in comparison
So bad they need a tan
Barely see they hand
Craft they face like a seed of sand
See the ??? you got to beat the man
Understand I'm saying
The writing on the wall like a paint can
Spraying graffiti on your soul
Music completely make me whole
I'm saying, trying to keep my
Pockets on swoll
To give back to the community
Make a future for you and me
From my birth certificate to my eulogy
Usually in Brooklyn
But my mind keep it movin
Ain't no mystery
Cuz we showin and provin
Here we go, here we go, here we here we go X4

Brooklyn, New York City (stand up)
A child destined for greatness is born (we goin' in)
Let's go!
Get your hands in the air (get em up!)
Put your hands in the air (put em up!)
Get your hands in the air (get em up!)
Put your hands in the air (put em up!)
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What? What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…)
Say something, say something (what was that?)
Say something (I dare you), say something

The lord chief rocker, I'm colder than meatlockers
My people keep throwin' it up like cheap vodka
I smack internet emcees and beat bloggers
You can see my black thought like ‘Riq Trotter
It's deep – go ahead and sleep
They know in the street Kwe' gon flow on the beat proper
Composin' complete operas
Longer than a cigar thats godfather
Tap into heart chakras im harder than gobstoppers
People comin' for the throne not knowin' the seat hotter
Than fish grease, criminal names on police blotters
You convinced me, I hit targets like top shottas
Out in the mideast like Muslims takin' Shahada
I'm sayin' makin' a profit a product of Reaganomics
Awake and I'm stayin' conscious to radio playin' garbage, yeah
Blacksmith Music, if you don't pay homage
I'ma show you how we break an artist
That's a threat, I'm not makin' a promise
Speak to the people like Barak Obama
They worship like a black Madonna, c'mon
Niggas talk shit, but they ain't got skills
I'm the type of nigga to put lead in your grill
Number two pencil is sharper to bruise mentals, and
Beatin' in my chest is the heart of a true gentleman
Still spit right in your face
Fuck a Top 8, back up, gimme my space, you're not safe
Yeah, they say I'm back, but I ain't go nowhere though
Been here the whole time
Where you been? You back
Matter fact, apologize
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What? What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) C'mon
Say something (g'head), say something (uh huh)
Say something (what?) (who is it?) say something (Jean Grae!)
(Jean Grae)
Yeah, open your mouth, say something, I fuckin' dare you
Chokin' you out till you can't suck any air through
Fuck with your man too, thinkin' I can't do what I plan to
Vet vandal, niggas are brand new
Ain't knew I was bad news? Look at the tattoos
Get ran through like you was fingers through Sassoon
Horror chick in the bathroom, off the backstage room
Shit you couldn't imagine, nigga I'll harass you
I'll Ras Kass you, soul on ice and body cast dude
Past due, Jean and Kwe the last two action heroes
Actually had the capacity to be the ones in a class of zeroes
Hip hop's not dead, it was on vacation
We back, we bask in the confrontation
You can ask me, have any conversation
You talk shit, Blacksmith, Jean, I'm waitin', nigga
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What? What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…)
Say something (g'head), say something (what was that?)
Say something (I dare you), say something
(Talib Kweli)
We not fallin' for your trick ‘cause your image is like a gimmick
Forget it, every rhyme is bitten, you like a mimic
I'm talkin' to the lord and I'm askin' him for forgiveness
Just for kickin' niggas out the club like Michael Richards
Yeah, I admit, I'm guilty, the way I spit is filthy
I keep it gritty, so they get it, they feel me, the flow
Is known for touchin' the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language - you know I keep customers
The writing therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin'
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin' you a contact high, my name buzzin
And I came in the game with nothin', stop frontin' nigga, talk shit now!
The year of the Blacksmith is not defined by any calendar
Just thought I'd remind all you challengers
Get the name right, Talib Kweli, BKMC, stand up!
Get your hands in the air (get em up!)
Put your hands in the air (put em up!)

You should take the cross off your neck and pray to Jesus
I'm breakin' every rapper up like eighty pieces
I done sat in the cell and stared at the wall
And I'm swearin' to God I air all y'all
I live by the sword or the pistols
Summertime I'm outside with niggas with pitbulls
I don't smoke the haze if it ain't got the crystals
Look in my eyes you can tell I would lift you
I'm in the DB nine when I'm comin' to get you
I'm with my Arab man and he holdin' the missiles
I'm sayin' fuck all y'all
If you don't understand let me make it real clear I'm sayin' what to all y'all
No more videos or them silly hoes ridin' on y'all dick when I cut all y'all
The game too pussy I think it need change
I wanna see the barrel flame 'til they brains get mushy
East Coast Ghost
Ain't no other rapper in the game that you know that plays the streets so close
Still bring pain
Fire more shots than y'all motherfuckers do in that Max Payne game
Anybody front I'm knockin' 'em out D blockin' 'em out
That mean I'ma snatch his chain

Ain't nobody fuckin' with Kweli
And the rock with a real name like a Styles P
Represent the L.O.X
Big up to all the massive rude boy on deck
Niggas yellin' out what the blood clot, lick enough shots
Finna bust a flow like buckshot
What's up Franklin Avenue?
These Brooklyn niggas runnin' wild through the jungle like caribou
Rap immaculate
I spit fire that will get tobacco lit faster than the rider on the chariot
Old school and cooler than the river watered downstream
Hit the block hotter than them grits poured in Al Green
The cops flashin' the lights, passin' them bikes
Ask for ya rights and they beat you like “The Passion Of Christ”
They got a sicker fetish for violence than Mel Gibson
We inject it in our system through direct television
The way I'm spittin' Heaven through the Hell we living
It's like fate is a fakery style you can tell it's written
It's like a jail when you're sittin' in a cell or prison
With destiny comin' in the form of some mail or a visit
Yea opportunity's knockin'
Like the beat, cuz I got Pete Rock and Beatminerz in my hemoglobin
Premier Show and Diamond D
Listen here we about to flip it on the track like nine to three",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-buck-em-down-freestyle-lyrics
Say Something (a cappella),UnKnown,UnKnown,"The year is 1975 (yeah, hahaha!)
Brooklyn, New York City (stand up)
A child destined for greatness is born (we goin' in)
Let's go!
Get your hands in the air (get em up!)
Put your hands in the air (put em up!)
Get your hands in the air (get em up!)
Put your hands in the air (put em up!)
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What? What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…)
Say something, say something (what was that?)
Say something (I dare you), say something
(Talib Kweli)
The lord chief rocker, I'm colder than meatlockers
My people keep throwin' it up like cheap vodka
I smack internet emcees and beat bloggers
You can see my black thought like ‘Riq Trotter
It's deep – go ahead and sleep
They know in the street Kwe' gon flow on the beat proper
Composin' complete operas
Longer than a cigar thats godfather
Tap into heart chakras im harder than gobstoppers
People comin' for the throne not knowin' the seat hotter
Than fish grease, criminal names on police blotters
You convinced me, I hit targets like top shottas
Out in the mideast like Muslims takin' Shahada
I'm sayin' makin' a profit a product of Reaganomics
Awake and I'm stayin' conscious to radio playin' garbage, yeah
Blacksmith Music, if you don't pay homage
I'ma show you how we break an artist
That's a threat, I'm not makin' a promise
Speak to the people like Barak Obama
They worship like a black Madonna, c'mon
Niggas talk shit, but they ain't got skills
I'm the type of nigga to put lead in your grill
Number two pencil is sharper to bruise mentals, and
Beatin' in my chest is the heart of a true gentleman
Still spit right in your face
Fuck a Top 8, back up, gimme my space, you're not safe
Yeah, they say I'm back, but I ain't go nowhere though
Been here the whole time
Where you been? You back
Matter fact, apologize
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What? What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) C'mon
Say something (g'head), say something (uh huh)
Say something (what?) (who is it?) say something (Jean Grae!)
(Jean Grae)
Yeah, open your mouth, say something, I fuckin' dare you
Chokin' you out till you can't suck any air through
Fuck with your man too, thinkin' I can't do what I plan to
Vet vandal, niggas are brand new
Ain't knew I was bad news? Look at the tattoos
Get ran through like you was fingers through Sassoon
Horror chick in the bathroom, off the backstage room
Shit you couldn't imagine, nigga I'll harass you
I'll Ras Kass you, soul on ice and body cast dude
Past due, Jean and Kwe the last two action heroes
Actually had the capacity to be the ones in a class of zeroes
Hip hop's not dead, it was on vacation
We back, we bask in the confrontation
You can ask me, have any conversation
You talk shit, Blacksmith, Jean, I'm waitin', nigga
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What? What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…) What?
Talk shit now (now…now…now…)
Say something (g'head), say something (what was that?)
Say something (I dare you), say something
(Talib Kweli)
We not fallin' for your trick ‘cause your image is like a gimmick
Forget it, every rhyme is bitten, you like a mimic
I'm talkin' to the lord and I'm askin' him for forgiveness
Just for kickin' niggas out the club like Michael Richards
Yeah, I admit, I'm guilty, the way I spit is filthy
I keep it gritty, so they get it, they feel me, the flow
Is known for touchin' the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language - you know I keep customers
The writing therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin'
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin' you a contact high, my name buzzin
And I came in the game with nothin', stop frontin' nigga, talk shit now!
The year of the Blacksmith is not defined by any calendar
Just thought I'd remind all you challengers
Get the name right, Talib Kweli, BKMC, stand up!
Get your hands in the air (get em up!)
Put your hands in the air (put em up!)
Get your hands in the air (get em up!)
Put your hands in the air (put em up!)",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-say-something-a-cappella-lyrics
Peace of Mind (Interlude Version),Peace of Mind,2004.0,"Talib Kweli - “Peace of Mind (Interlude Version)”





Uh.  I haven’t seen it.  I haven’t seen it.  Uh.  Uh, come on and, come on and
 (x2)
I haven't seen that look in such a long time
I've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind

Uh.  One, two, and uh.  One, two, and uh.  Yo.  All those shorties around my way, I see y’all.  Do y’all thang, do y’all thang, come on.  Ah.  Uh.  Come on.  Ah.  Do y’all thang, do y’all thang, come on.  Ah.  Yeah.  Let me run it down.  Yo, yo

Sitting on a stoop, watching chickens fly the coup
People troop through the night in groups.  I got dice to shoot
Way too late to see this youth hanging on the ave
Plus my little man's mama just told me he skipped the class
He on the corner smoking a stog', looking broke in the blow
He opened his soul, said he came to a fork in the road.  ""Son
I’ve never seen that look in your eye.  What's wrong, kid?""  He replied
""What they’re teaching me in school ain't helping me to live
It ain't relevant to me.  Word is bond, the class
Is so overcrowded, they don't even notice when I'm gone""
""Hold on, shorty.  You're speeding.  Take what they got you reading
Apply it to your life and give it your own meaning
There's nothing out here for you, so stop running from school
You'll only defeat yourself—that's what they want you to do.  It's that
Simple"" is what I told him.  ""No one’ll hold your hand
Count your blessings—not your problems—and stay focused, man""
 (x2)
I haven't seen that look in such a long time
I've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind


“What’s up
Keeba?  I heard you’re moving down south to
Atlanta to be with your family.  That’s what it’s about, right?
Selling your house and quitting your job, not
Wishing on a star.  Just getting with God.  I’m missing
You hard already (Word).  You used to be hooking us up, cooking
For us.  It was love.  You was Brooklyn to us
I’ll remember the tragic loss of the baby’s father
Being eight-months pregnant was hard—that made it crazy harder
Plus I know he loved you, and you felt like you would lose it
That’s why it’s good you start again and focus on your music
I got your back on a plane that’s two hours away, and it’s like
Going to Queens and taking the A.  Today
You sound stressed out.  I know you’re ready to lead, ready
To be free and keep a home steady for your seeds, but you’re
There already.  If you thought it, it could happen
The hands God works with his hours.  You took action”

Holler.  Yeah.  I haven’t seen ya, haven’t seen ya.  Uh.  What?  Come on.  Come on and, come on and.  Brooklyn, y’all.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah
 (x2)
I haven't seen that look in such a long time
I've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind

Stay focused, man.  Stay focused, uh
Stay focused, man.  Stay focused, true
Stay focused, man.  Stay focused, uh
Stay focused, man.  Stay focused, uh

Big Tobacco targets your children.  Ghetto youth marked
For killing, buildings fallings.  We’re just starting the healing
Light up the truth, make a spark in the dark that’s so appealing that it
Gives sight to the blind and sound to the hard-of-hearing
We’re all looking for the truth.  Now look in your eyes for proof
Or recognize no time to lie to the youth, so I slide
In the booth and provide you the soup for your soul, food
For your whole body when you feel you’re losing control
To some corporation, TV station, or occupation, another
Foreign value system that kill your sensation.  Feel the
Elation of knowing life—you got a lot to live
Stay true and focus on the positive.  Come on
 (x2)
I haven't seen that look in such a long time
I've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind

See, that’s what I’m talking about.  I haven’t seen it.  I haven’t seen it.  Uh.  Peace of mind.  I haven’t seen it, I haven’t seen it.  Peace of mind",https://genius.com/Talib-kweli-peace-of-mind-interlude-version-lyrics
