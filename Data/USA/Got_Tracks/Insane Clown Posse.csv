Miracles,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2010,"[Intro: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
We got a theory
You see, Mike, we got a theory
About magic, and miracles
That's right, that's right
[Verse 1: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
If magic is all we've ever known
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
And I see miracles every day
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
And a million stars way above 'em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
Look at the mountains
, trees, the seven seas
And everything chilling underwater, please!
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
Long neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs
And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equal
Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
The sun and the moon, and even Mars
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
UFOs, 
a river flows
Plant a little seed and nature grows
Niagara Falls and 
the pyramids
Everything you believed in as kids
Fucking rainbows, after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, 
he ran away
And music is magic, pure and clean
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen
[Chorus: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Music is all magic
You can't even hold it
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's just there in the air
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Pure motherfuckin' magic.
 Right?
This shit'll blow your motherfuckin' mind
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
[Verse 2: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling
I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding
Water, fire, air and dirt
Fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
Solar eclipse
, and vicious weather
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
And I love my mom, for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
Miracles ain't nothing to lie
Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
Miracles each and everywhere you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours, for you to explore
It's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
To witness that without explanation
Take a look at this fine creation
And enjoy it better with appreciation
Crows, ghosts, 
the midnight coast
The wonders of the world, 
mysteries the most
Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
To ignore the miracles of every day
And that's real
[Chorus: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Magic everywhere in this bitch
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's all around you, you don't even know it
(Are you a believer in miracles?) 
Shit's crazy
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
(So many miracles, the magic miracles)

Are you a believer in miracles?
Do you have time for the miracles?
Do you notice and recognize miracles?
So many miracles, the magic miracles

Well, we're here! We came all the way to Ash, Nevada!
Come on!
Where's the show and where's our money?
I came all the way from England! Where's me bloody 'undred thousand pounds?
What I wanna know is where in hell is my goddamn hundred thousand dollars?
And where can I get some beer in this motherfucker?
I thought this was a carnival. Where's all the sexy kids at? Don't tell me I brought all this candy for nothing!
I didn't come all this way to stand around here with all these goddamn tadpoles! Let's get a move on!
Start this shit so we can get paid!
We came a long way to see this shit! It'd better be worth it, or Imma kill somebody! Fuck that!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-miracles-lyrics

Jugular juggling juggalos
Folded, fat, floppy-tittied freaks
I C fuckin P's in the house""

Abracadabra boom shacka dae
I'm Violent J, and I'm back like a vertebrae
And I come with a hat full of tricks
Trunk full of Faygo, car full of fat chicks
Ha hahaha ha hahaha, fuck you
Wicked clowns, we'd like to say what up to
The Cobra's, X-men, and Counts
And everybody with clown love, even sets I've never heard of
Roll into town, and out with the big top
Four cards down, and two more still to drop
And when it does, I pack up and hit the road
'Cause I don't wanna see your head explode!
Toss me an axe, and I'll toss you a dead chicken
Add a buck, you get a two-liter with em
And when the genie says on with the show
It's hokus pokus, jokers, Great Milenko

Once again, the psychotic carnival creatures in the house
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Southwest slithering snakes of darkness come
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

Shazam bam, shocka locka lokey
Shaggy the clown back like scoliosis
Call me a psycho-schizo freak
And I'll call you by your name (Dick-anus)
'Cause I can give two shits and a fuck
I bounce down Verner in a popcorn clown truck
I'm a circus ninja southwest voodoo wizard
I grab your gizzard
Jump on the carpet, let's take a spin
Everybody's waiting for the show to begin
Up to the top, by the neck, and let you go
Try to land in a glass of Faygo
Uh, you suck, you missed the fuckin' glass
Broken neck, and busted your fuckin' ass
But the genie says on with the show
Hokus pokus, jokers, Great Milenko

What awaits you after death, rub the lamp and explore
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Enter Milenko's Fun House, walk right through the wretched hall
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all (C'mon!)
Clown dawg, freak dawg
Joker dawg, Milenko dawg

Fidgets of joker's cards blasting in your mother's face
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

Rude Boy and Chucky down with the clown
First time we ever went to Mexican Town
I remember, we couldn't pay the bill, they got hot
And beat us down in the fuckin' parking lot
Tall Jess, Jumpsteady, and Nate the Mack
Tagged ICP by the train tracks
And it was on, the dawn of a new day
Magical carpets grippin' down the freeway
Walked in a gypsy's tent with a food stamp
And walked out with a magical lamp, yeah
I met Milenko, he gave me 3 wishes
That night, I fucked 3 fat bitches
Can't get the fuck with it? Forget it
I'll rip your face off, and wipe my ass wid' it
When the genie says on with the show
It's hokus pokus, jokers, Great Milenko

Climb aboard our magic train and join us inside
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
City to village, hamlet to town, the show must go on
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Giant ladies, bearded ladies, midget ladies, ladies?
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Clouds of darkness, then underneath them comes the clown
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride (Fuck that!)",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-hokus-pokus-lyrics
The Neden Game,The Great Milenko,1997,"""Let's meet contestant number one
He's a schizophrenic serial killer clown
Who says, ""women love his sexy smile""
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon
Sharon, what's your question?""

""Contestant number one
I believe first impressions last forever
So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house
And have dinner with me and my family
Tell me what you would do to make
That first impression really stick""

Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it
I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do
And look your momma in the eye and tell her, ""FUCK YOU!!!""
Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti
I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, ""Get the food ready!""
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this
You know for only 13, she got some big tits
After that, your dad will try to jump again
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware
I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear

""Now, let's meet contestant number two
He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak
Who works for the Dark Carnival
He says women call him stretch nuts
Sharon, let's hear your question""

""I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions
A man who expresses himself in his own special way
Number two, if you fell in love with me
Exactly how would you let me know?""

First thing, I could never love you
You sound like a richie-bitch, yo, FUCK YOU!!!
But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care
By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here
I'd go through your phone book and whack em all
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!)
Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay
I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day
I'd grab your titties and stretch em down past your waist
Let em go, and watch em both spring up in your face
I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can
Get you naked, and hit it like a CAVEMAN!!!
When we go to the beach and walk through the sand
I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin
As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back
And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!

""Well it sounds like contestant number two
Is just over-flowing with sensitivity, Sharon
It's a tough choice so far!
Sharon, let's have your last question and
See which one is going to win the rights to your neden""

""Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the
Same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would
Your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins!""

Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar
And tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are
I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake
And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Ricki Lake!

Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick
I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick
And then to get your attention in the crowded place
I'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face

Yeah, freak with your nuts, yo, that'll get her

Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better

Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap
Shit, you don't want contestant number two. He's mad wack
I walk into a barn and there he was
Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it
It was a big fucking smelly-ass farm llama

Damn dawg! How you gonna diss your momma?!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-the-neden-game-lyrics

Slim Anus,Psychopathics from Outer Space,2000,"These stupid Earthlings cannot even get along with each other!

Eminem huh?
You wanna diss us?
You wanna diss Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid?
Well here goes a remix
From us to you
This is the truth about Slim Anus...

Hi, my name is, what? My name is who?
My name is Slim Anus
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is the fudgepacker
Hi, my name is what? (Excuse me) My name is who?
My name is the nutlicker
(Can I have the attention of your ass?)
Hi, my name is what? My name is who?
My name is the buttsniffer

Hi, kids! Do you like Anus?
I let Dr. Dre fill up my butt for one chance to be famous (Uh huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did (Yeah)
Try acid and get your butt pumped out like I did
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Backstreet Boy I wanna impregnate
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a cutie (Uh huh)
I'll give you a deal let me up in that booty"" (OK!)
Well since age 12 I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt (Yup)
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
She don't know how to do Tommy Lee, I'd suck his dick off

Hi, my anus who? My anus what?
My anus, it gets tapped on
Hi, my anus (Excuse me) My anus
My anus every now and then gets plugged up
Hi, my anus (Can I have the attention of your ass?) My anus
My anus is occasionally reamed out
Hi, my anus, who? My anus, what?
My anus really needs to be filled up

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
I told him to take his pants off, hooked him up, he let me slide
I pinched his ass, he winked at me
He chased me around the desk, I told him come and get me
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender - and I tried to feel his dick up
Extra-terestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screamin' at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99% of my life I was lied to
I just found out my Mom screws more guys than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
She met Violent J, I couldn't believe it when he slapped her
You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
And try to touch your hands but I need me a man
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, nice ass!""

Hi, my name is huh? My name is who?
My name is (They call me the pore plugger)
Hi, my name is what? My name is who?
My name is the itch itcher (Excuse me)
One of radio's wonder boys
They call me the butt itcher
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is (I've been called Dre's butt boy)

Stop the tape this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre don't just stand there operate
I feel up my balls and buttcheeks
Anal lube got my ass greasy for weeks
Stick your manhood between my cheeks (Yup)
Am I coming or going, I can barely decide
I just drank a pint of semen - dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
Dre's butt is too sexy to hide
Take your pants off Dre, I don't mind
Clothes rip like the incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll do any guy that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
Sometimes I sit and wish Dr. Dre had a set of tits
Get behind me Shady and grab me by my hips
If I do that then I can't kiss you on your lips
By the way if you see my Dad
Ask him if he seen my spread in Gay Al's porno mag

Hi, my anus, who? My anus, what?
My anus gets tapped on
Hi, my anus, who? My anus (Excuse me)
My anus it's always getting plugged up
Hi, my anus, who? My anus, what?
My anus occasionally reamed out
Hi, my anus, my anus
My anus it needs to be filled up

Your anus
Your anus
Your anus is always getting plugged
Your anus
Your anus
Your anus is always getting stuffed
You wanna diss us?
We don't even know you, you little bitch
You wanna sit there and diss us?
You little bitch I'll slap your face off
That's what happens when you go up against the Psychopathic Family trick
You little bitch (Laughs)

To Catch a Predator,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"(laughter)

I'm on the internet, posing as a little girl
I'm tryin' to lure evil into my world
I tell them that I'm curious, and I'm only 12
Mom and Dad are gone for the day; I'm by myself
Buckets of throw up are next to my computer
Hopin' that they show up, 'cause what I'm about to do to them would make the devil sick. I sharpen my blade
Frontin' to this perv like I'm only in the 7th grade
The doorbell rings, I gotta get them inside!
In my best little girls voice I'm like, ""Hi!
Come on in! I'm putting on my bikini!""
And when the door shuts, that's when I let them see me
""Hi there."" (Haha) I stab him in the neck first
'Cause it hurts. Hit him where the blood squirts
Carve his whole face off and make him eat it
Chain him up by the foot in my basement, bleeding

I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I will earn
But it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
And it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I will earn
But it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)

Soon enough, Feds will be shutting down my service
Cause people out there, think they don't deserve this
Until it's your kid an old man is finger fucking!
Titty sucking! Then you'll want the knife stuck in
I don't blame you, that's why I catch them in advance
While his dick is still in his pants, they never get the chance
I tell them I'm alone and I'm only 13
Looking for a good time. Ya know what I mean?
""Bring me some Funyuns, and a Slurpee
Promise not to hurt me, or give me herpes.""
And within 20 minutes, here comes a fucking doctor
Knocking on my door, a pedophile butt knocker
""Come in! Have a seat!"" and then I stroll in
With the all purpose hunting blade straight up his colon (Ahh!)
I cut his hands off, he ain't touching nobody
Chain him up by the foot in the basement, bloody
""Pla- pla- please Mr. Clown, sir, you don't have to do this!""
""Zip it!""
""Please! I got money! We ca-""
""Shut it, fucker!""
""Please! We can work this out!""
""Silence I say!""
Stick him next to this other fool. Both left for dead
Every time I walk by 'em, I punch them in the head
Cut they fucking dicks off, stick em in each other's mouths
""Nooow what y'all talkin about!?""

I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I will earn
But it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
And it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this

The house is getting funky, bodies in the basement, stinking
What the fuck am I thinking?
I put my face paint on, go downstairs
And beat they ass sometime, 'cause it ease my mind
Some of them are dead, some are still living
But I'ma hurt them every chance that I'm given
I hit em with the nail gun or the stun gun
They can't run! So, they both mad fun
I was sawing a head off when I heard the doorbell
I'm not expecting any predators, but oh well!
I took my spot. ""Come in! I'll be right there!""
But I left a head sitting on the living room chair!
He seen it and ran! I had to give chase!
We cut across the lawn with my knife swinging for his face!
I threw it, it stuck him in the back of the neck
Still in my drawers, I dragged him home a bloody wreck
""Ahhhh! Somebody! Anybody!""
""Zip it!""
""Stop! Please!""
""Shut it the fuck up!""
""Ahhhhhh!""
""People are looking! Silence!""
A bus for of high school kids watched it happened
He kept screaming like a pansy, despite my slapping
Plus, the neighbors seen it, and so did the mail man
But they all never said nothing bout it again

I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I will earn
But it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
And it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I will earn
But it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)

""Hey! Come on in! What kind of alcohol did you bring?'

Juggalo Homies,The Wraith: Shangri-La,2002,"I know you ain't there
That's why I just want to let you know something bro
You all know I love you
You all know you're my homies
And eh, alright we'll talk later, peace

Let me ask you this about this life we live
And let me try to swerve some of this attention you give
To them distant ass relatives over in Ham dinner
If they really miss you so much why don't they just call in? (Motherfucker!)
If you wasn't blood, would you still have love?
Or infact does the blood make you think you have to love?
Look I probably love my family more than anybody here
But my homies are family too, third cousins get outta here
Who was you with when you got tatoos?
Who was you tripping with when you did them mushrooms?
Who the fuck threw up all over your car?
And then felt worse than you about that shit in the morning? (Friends ya'll)

Who loaned ya money, homie? Who owes ya cash?
Who taught you how to use a bong for the grass?
I don't know much but I gotta assume
When ya hit ya first neden, ya homies was in the other room

We talkn' about HOMIES HOMIES!!! (Talkn' about the road dogs of mine!)
Our motherfucking HOMIES HOMIES!!! (We throwin' up Clown Love signs!)
Real juggalo HOMIES HOMIES!!! (Talk 'bout the road dogs of mine!)
HOMIES! HOMIES! (Man that's my dog)

Have you ever had a job that you truly despise?
Like, I dunno, maybe dish washing or fucking flipping fries
Then you've got this boss who thinks he's the Don Mega
Cause he the head manager chief chili fry maker?
All you could vision is ya'll beating him down
Your homies standing on his back while you kicking his head around
But responsibility is there, I can't lie, though
I'd have been plucked his fucking eyeball out with a chicken bone
Crazy as fuck I'll rip your piercings off
And now my homies are holding me back so I don't look soft

When you snuck the car out who did you get?
And when you got caught, who you blame that shit?
Who you relax around and scratch yo balls?
Homies,were talking about like you and yours!
(Chorus)
(Bridge (x2))
If ya don't like me you can...fuck off! 
(Carnival ain't for everyone)
(Verse 3: Jamie Madrox)
Me and my homies stay tight like a noose
And if you step to one of us you betta step to the whole crew
I never knew that I could depend
That I could have some friends that's down til the very end
Well that's my home boys, excuse me, my family
And when we conquer the world
We macking on the galaxy cause the skys the limit
And we ain't finished
And if my homies gonna ride ya know I'm with it

Puff it and pass it and I give it to my homies ya'll
Hit it and quit it and then I give it to my homies ya'll
I got the world around my finger with my homies ya'll
And everything is obsolete unless I hear my homies call
We worldwide, were homies across the planet
Sticking together like zippers on Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' jacket
They got my back like a tat for that, I love ya'll
Hanging till we old and grey like grandpas (Psycho)

And a few of your crew


BITCH! WHAT THE FUCK?!
What are you trying to do to me?
You wasn't true to me
When I was locked up you fucked something like 34 guys
But I let that slide
'Cuz your ass is big, and your titties is fat
I wanted to FUCK THAT
But FUCK THAT
I never gave a FUCK THAT, you put me through the courts 
And gave me genital warts
Now I stack my .9, I'm goin' for the knees
I'mma blow 'em out and give your neck a squeeze
As you're standing there, I'mma be like BITCH!
You know you done fucked up, right?

Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta die

Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta DIE

Bitch, don't talk about bitches I'm fucking them
Please no fat bitches I'm fucking slim
Unless it's one of those likes stroking my shit
I don't care 'bout how I'm fucking it
How much it costs, big fat...crackhead?
Ain't trying to hear all those words you said
Five minutes, bitch  and I came
Fuck your name, and from where you came
I don't give a fuck, bitch! I will kill you!
You Shaquita! You Belinda! You too Passion...BITCH!



One thing I can't stand is these bitches
Trying to take my riches, when I ain't even got none 
I never lied, you knew what I wanted all the while 
My dick in your vertical smile 
We kiss and hug, and snugg, and tickle
But the bitch wouldn't even buff my fucking pickle 
You fucked everybody else in the place, it's all good
Now let me head-butt your face!

This life is a blessing thank God that I chose rap
Wicked clowns in your town know that the shows packed

Fill 'em when I get it
So you better get the medic
I'm about to blow motherfuckers wig back - dig that
Breaking ya bones like a twig- crack
Put it in the box like a Big Mac run and tell the pigs that

Cause a riot, now bye Fed!

Blow up like scud missle

Your city I'mma bop hard
Then I stun a motherfucker, you ain't even gotta wonder

Fuck you, my squadrilla
Deep past that mob killa
Voodoo, Clay, Shagz, J, Lyte and that ninja Ouija

Truth when I give it, no gimmic, raw with it , all in it, y'all get it
Real fucking with the fama'!
Just cocaine and gang load of ammo is all I keep on me
Please don't sleep on me
Undergroung overlord combat is my sport, front line in a war then when your ready for it
I'm rolling deep with fam, loading up the yeapa
Niggas cover up when the Reaper start yelling like Chewbacca
Hoodoo suited up and dressed to kill I ain't nothing but a mobster
I go hard fo' the juggalo nation
Spit in the face of anyone who want to say somethin' otherwise
Ride high when I fly by with my guys
All to so hell 'boutta break loose
Show you how to make moves like a double O G from the hood
Low key everybody know me I've been getting my grind on
Detroit hit my bat with me before I signed on

It's juggalo love because that shit lasts
Every other love was shut off
You disagree? Well, fuck your bitch ass
You can fuck the fucking fuck the fuck off
You lick balls and it get soft
Ill sock your whole head bald- wig off
Rock your lid off, get head tossed get lost get kick in your lip gloss
I'll take the hit to the halls that I ripped off
When a bitch made my balls in a quick wash
With a dick payed raw, so I lipped off
Switchblade to his jaw, made his shit fall
I dipped in his rip and zipped off
I kick balls and slit pussy lip walls
You told me to get lost, 'cause I get sauce
And fuck this girl in the butt 'til my dick soft
She like dick sauce, her clit's soft, man!
So she get tossed, then shit can
Try to beat it up and lost 'cause the chick bossed
Left in my drawers backwards, criss cross!
(Jump!)
Get the wig wash, to a stick clause
Dope, black, fat, Rick Ross!
My shit (?), big costs
So cold on a room my shit frosts
Straight to the chop chop
Nope, never got pop
Juggalo love move anything you got
My brother (?)
Juggalo love everytime you hear the beat pound
Everyday we put our feet down to the street sound
From Guantanamo Bay to Greek town
Its Juggalo love but it won't turn your freak down!

Hop off in that moth coffin get you bra off of me bitch
Who in the fuck did you thought it was living the bottom of every murderer
Ouija the goblin the demon the gurgalar thought they were burglar they never heard of her
Creature like me I'm unheard of
Jump on a track like a hurdler
Foreign bitch in a chopper
Sin city baby burn it up
They found a third of the bitch that I killed in the woods but they never discovered the cabin
I got your bitch in a cabin
She off a bean and she laughing
Next thing she blowing my phone up
Asking me what the fucc happened
Sorry fell off of the wagon
Raiding into the medicine cabinet
Comet with a come up bullshit but I'm crushing any fucking thinking they fronting me
My moment has arrived
Duck and I slide
Juggalo love on my side
That shit ain't ever gon' die
Run up on me and my posse we gon' see whats poppin' when I let my chopper decide
Bullets collide
Crumble your skeleton bloody to jelly tin
Who wanna die
Better hope all y'all hear this shit
Ouija Macc came here to peel this shit
Never been shot but I drilled this shit
Zip the body bag up when I kill this shit
For the knockoff brand trying to steal that shit
For the mainstream trying to conceal that shit
Frontin' on me you a stale ass bitch
You gonna ask yourself why you did that shit
No implants this some real ass shit
The whole gang in the game bout to spill this shit
People in the back won't miss this shit like the blind dude braile you can feel this shit
Sure we need some barbed-wire to rip this shit
Fatality mode let me finish it
Never forget who the family is and the place you discovered the wicked shit

I beat the fallen angel and I wrote kkkill the fetus
I spit this wicked shit for all these heathens cause they heathens
But still its hell on earth I got three stripes on my adidas

8 ways to die bruh I'm an eight legged spider
I walk up with an A-K and light up your concert
Just killing anyone thats happy you alive
If you survive in a suit and tie you getting crucified
With a nail gun
Motherfucker my dick's so big that it look like a whale tongue
Mac-11 Lethal dropping microphones up in it and its the middle of the map its Kansas City that I hail from
Everybody fuck with me I rip so nice and fast kid
If you ever fuck with me I dip your wife in acid
I'm with that dark juggalo clique
The Incredible Hulk on some Mark Ruffalo shit
I got a big hard buffalo dick
I might start humping your chick
I'm a motherfucking lunatic I pull the skeleton up out your mattress like bunch of elephants up in a stampede
Sticking a fucking gun up in your lung and you can't breathe

Bring them raccs out
Succa brain bout to get splat now
Bring that map out Ima put my city on the map now
Sin City on blacc out
Extension cords in that trap house
We done made our own power lines turned the bando to a cat house
Talk that shit down
""Ouija got a chicc with a dicc now""
Say what?!?
30 round clip now just enough for you to get dicced down
How bout that now?
17 tat now
17 raccs now
Shawty ass clap like a pacced crowd
Let them talk that shit, won't walk that shit I bust them in they shit
I pull up on him, Kid don't want it  but you finally got some drip
You can wait to hit the lottery I'm bout to hit a licc
You can wait on your retirement I'm bout to break a bitch
Hol up' wait all my hoes exfoliate
All you broke mothafuccers you can still afford to hate
What's that beefin' to a vegan I stacc broccoli on my plate
I can be stepping on all over these rapper neccs with every mo'fuccin' step that I take
Ouija

MAFIA! DJ PAUL!
Hunnit off in a clip
Ima push (?)
Double barrel, double R on the grill
Diamond fangs in a grip
Johnny Dang got the drip
Smoke a quarter word to Eli I'm notorious word to B-I-G
Was strappin' 'fore I had a gun ID
Rubber bands on a hunnit grand layin' on my hand like I'm T.I.P
Nigga this is just a PSA
I'm dropping bones like I'm DTP
Pass the weed like a(?)
Niggas copy but I do get paid
Surf's up tryna ride this wave
I got pocket rockets and some knotted wallets keep the molly in a Gucci safe
20 bitches on a 20 gauge
20 haters thats 20 graves
Beat the case like MMA
Run the club like some (?)
(?) to this silence
I'm colorblind til' I get violent
Run your mouth you got some mileage
Feature my work to O'Reilly's nigga

Take me out the worst way
Apocalypse on my birthday
When you starving you eat shit til' I piss on all the thirsty
For your applause my mental problem out for revenge every autumn
Stimulate to get down them all innovators fend em off
And lock me up nightly go psycho when you don't like me
What's in my hands? Ain't my ID
At gunpoint make you recite me
I see some demons that might be trying to fuck me or fight me
Because I wasn't wrapped tightly at Heaven's Gate in black Nikes
I'm in that house like a home invasion because your family need a renovation
Say ho don't say Amen say 6-7-8-9 Satan
I'm a trapped ghost in a iPod and the batteries have been died off
Evil in me no antidote its boring shooting cantaloupe and I'm about what killers do so much they start to kill in school
Heroes hang with villains too
Death is here I'm feeling cruel
Burnt flesh thats brand loyal
Bullet holes your guts boil
King of nothing, Fuck royal
There will be blood, I struck oil

What I'm Freddy Kruger
Lex Luthor
Chad Kroeger
The dick in Nickleback who takes off fat nipples off cougars
Sippin' Boocha
Your boo fuck with me
Cause I'm superfly I splash her neden Jimmy Snuka
I'll slap you, spin your face round to the back of your head
You'll have to chop a hole through your wig or suffocate dead
I'll make the sunshine bright at midnight or black out at noon
Put so much heart in this every beat kicks as a sonic boom
I blow hurricanes, spit monsoons and stomp earthquakes
And me and my Ruby known to bust and murder snakes
I'll snatch right up in your earhole put your brain in your hand
You'll still be trying to comprehend when you end (Dang man)
The hatchet been chopping for years
I flex on all of my peers
So high I be poppin' your ears
You rocking a toilet career
You bust to a brush in a mirror
You flush and your fans disappear
Your stacks are like flat as a beer
Left out in the sun for a year
Traitor's scowling
Red moon howling
Decades deep stomach still growling
Elbow to eyeball I'm foulin'
Til' your Momma threw the towel in
But I caught it, she fought it and brought it I applauded
But my rocket kick out and clocked out I sock it and she bought it
With that shing-shing-shing-shing
Walla-walla bing bing

Psypher 4,Psychopathic Psyphers,2012,"Round everybody up - Twiztid, Blaze, The R.O.C
I got a letter from the goverment
The other day I opened it and read and said it was bitches
- Cold 187, Legz Diamond, Anybody Killa, Doe Dubbla and ICP
A letter to the FBI

Somebody call 911 they gangbangin at the mall
A kid 14 and his boys from Omaha
Oh lord, Oh my God hes on a skateboard
FBI guy up in the tree... snore
Spying on the juggalo clique for 8 months
Undercover, ain't got nuttin, straight punks
Waisting everybody goddamn time and money
Cause you're some old out dated cops tubs and sonnies
Shit-headed and nerdy, like it ain't even funny
And the bitch in your ass is like bees to honey
Calling juggalo a gangbanger? - Outrageous
Pulling ninjas over whipping out gages
And the judge slams down the hammers
To the big house now for you gangbanger
If we let this be, we'll be face to face
With one man as he dictates the human race
Speak outta line, they coming at a zoomin pace
Kick you when you down, boots, two to the face
We don't need that, so don't give in now
Fuck the FBI it's how I'm livin', BLOW!

Mr. FBI, Mr. Officer
Tell me why you want me in the coffin sir
Is it because I wear my hatchet tat
Or cause me and my fellas got matching chat
Is it because we like to hang out and be scrubs
Must be thugs out here peddling drugs
Well let me tell ya, all that meddling does
Is make us wanna leave you embedded in slugs
Free speech motherfucker, check this out
I want some pussy, or I'mma shot a cop in the mouth
Bang, guts hang like a wicked video game
It's all the same it's entertainment and it ain't for the lame
They can't get us so they come for those who walk wit us
Punish you for representin, make you wanna forget us
That's what we get, cause we ain't corporate
Self made and doing well so they damn us to hell
And degrade us, that’s what made us, they say the world hate us
For 20 years I've been getting paid to bust
Call me an old man, I call me long dick paid
Young sweet baby Violent J never gets played

Tensions high in new america, goddamn what's all of this?
So I walk around with mouth full of shit, spittin' shit
In the face lady liberty pushing swiftly through these days
In a black 300 looking like I'm straight up out the batcave
Government they now investigate so uptain
To windows looking too close will get you sketched, no incidental
Residential neighborhoods on high alert for the insane clowns
Anybody killing you get twisted and bound
Then set a blaze and murdered dummy
The Colds 187 don't just doubles every second
Who's the weapon? I am the R.O.C.!
A house full of skinny jeans, I'm kept in debris
I'm a disease and a cure for you sick and healthy M.C.'s
No resurrection from the clique, we gonna stay up underground
Saluting, never letting cock suckers putting us youth truth
The booth is a star, I walk the heavens keep it locked
We gon' rob the solar system on the shit until you stop

You can hurt our name
You can’t salt our game
Fuck you and your claim
We don't bang, we're family!

I'll pull a Tec' on you quick, I would say ""fuck a bitch""
I spit, gangsta shit, I've been federally indicted, uh
I'mma killa from the west, don't test
Blaow, 187, the psychopathic
I come through, shut shit down, no bitch up now
I specialize in moving big dope and lettin' off rounds
So fuck the FBI, you know why they took 41 months of my life
Uh, that's why I ride or do or die, hustle world wide
Kick your door in, get your guap and back to the west side
No witnesses, a bloody homicide
Cause believe me, when I step ain't nobody gon' be left alive
The type of gangsta that plays for keeps, up deep in the streets
I got them bowls and birds for dirt cheep
So catch me in a old school classic
Reppin' the juggalos and everybody down with the hatchet

F is for the fools, B for bringing bullshit
I is my reply so yes, I feel included
Times really ain't changed, fans - they stay deranged
Music is the devil, and the artist is to blame
Juggalo I role, underground I stroll
Family is forever so this family will grow
I’m the FBI, Full blooded Indian
Back ready to ride, native pride once again
It's official, I had to go buy a new pistol
Just in case I hear the pigs whistle
Pull me over for a fucking purpose
Not because you worthless
Feeling like a criminal because I'm spittin' verses
Doctors, lawyers, dads and moms
Representin Juggalo cause they know it's the bomb
You can't stop psychopathic, the hatchet we jump hurdles
Even if you brought Elvis from the dead is John Burroughs

Don't blame me, not buildin a Bradley, it’s sad to see
You runnin your mouth and harassing the family
Trying to burn down my tree, cuttin' off branches
Like timber if you had it your way we'd be a cinder
You're far from heroic, you can't beat the stoic look on my face
As it changed from disdain to hate
Why you're spittin' your pulpit, I want to see your pores spit
All over the place till we're covered in all it
Toxic, no cure or antibiotics
You think we are so sick, we know you're neurotic
A build of psychotics, that drink and smoke chronic
Bitch you talking all that jazz, that's so sided


Watch me blast off, laughin my ass off
Callin us a gang? Y'all high off bath salts
We hot as asphalt, they watchin us on every level
What if they told that you can't listen to heavy metal
What if they told that you had listen to the devil?
Fuck what they tell you, we some rebels so they persecute
We don't confirm the policies, so they hurt the youth
Cause we free thinkin, smokin tree, drinkin
They wanna catch us sleepin we ain't even blinkin
Fuck the feds, all my life they some suckas
I really think they mad, cause their wives wanna fuck us
The government don't wanna see me on some psycho shit
It's worse than the freeway sniper mixed with Michael Vic
Now they all fucked, wanna catch us in the twist
J Edgar Hoover you can suck the motherfuckin dick
And we ain't stopping till you take us off the fucking list

Now I've been hustlin' and gridin' since I was new to the game
Before the songs and the videos and the screamin' the name
Before the diamond crusted hatchetman is swung from the chain
Green to the business and all the tricks of the trade
Learn to live it like I spit it, it's a family affair
A million painted faces in the crowd with hands in the air
All here to love us from above, and the devil rightly beneath
But the evil stares and shit talking can never compete
They wanna take us out the game and even call it a gang
Checking for tattoos and car stickers studyin slang
Man it's amazing how ridiculous this shit has became
Hoping that pride will go away but ours is strong and insane
It’s only greater if anything the load get heav
But the goal stay the same, put the worries in the levy
People tell us everyday that we're the reason they survive
The true incentive of keepin' hope alive, we don’t die!

I been on that - fuck the law, middle finger to em all
Habitual line stepper, a criminal rhyme shredder
Put a gun to your jaw, and make the world better
But instead I just shoot for the cheddar
Now I can make you Pearl Jammin' in my waist to Eddie Vedder
Looking for more than a bad rapper, I’m forever
Like Birdman baby, I'm so cash money
And the feds wanna ruin all that, now that's funny
I'll put a 5 hole in the 5-0
And I'm liable to emulate the face of a killa for my survival
Flat line your vitals, and I'm dangerous, and labeled a psycho
That ain't even the reason, they wanna keep us from the mic tho
My freedom of speech is what I would die for
FBI's my life long rival, cross-hairs and in scope of my rifle",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-psypher-4-lyrics
Halls of Illusions,The Great Milenko,1997,"Ticket, please? Thanks, walk through the doors
Into the Halls of Illusions, visit yours
And see what could've and should've and woulda been real
But you had to fuck up the whole deal!
Let's take a walk down the hallway
It's a long way, it takes all day!
And when we get to the end, you'll find a chair
With straps and chains, we slap you in there
Lock you down tight, so ya can't move a thread
And pull your eyelids up over your head
Cause you're about to witness an illusionary dream
It's just too bad, it ain't worth seeing!

You walk in and see two kids on the floor
They're playin Nintendo and he's got the high score
And sittin behind them, chillin in the chair
Is ya wife, when ya look, oh you ain't there!
It's some other man and they're hand-to-hand
How she looks so happy, ya don't understand
See this is an Illusion, it never came true...
All because of you!

Back to reality and what you're about
Your wife can't smile cause you knocked her teeth out
And she can't see straight from gettin hit
Cause you're a fat fuckin drunk piece of shit!
But it's all good here, come have a beer
I'll break the top off it and shove it in ya ear
And ya death comes wicked, painful, and slow
At the hands of Milenko!

Great Milenko, wave your wand!
(Don't look now, your life is gone!)
This is all because of you!
(What you got yourself into!)
(2x)

Look who's next, it's Mr. Clark
The dirty old man from the trailer park
You got your ticket? Thanks, take ya coat off!
And later on, why not? I'll rip ya throat off!
Let's take a walk down the hallway
It's a long way, it takes all day!
And when ya get to the end, you'll find a chair
You see all the blood? Yeah, your boy was just here!
We get all different kinda people comin through
Richies, chickens, and bitches just like you
In the halls, everybody gets a turn
To sit and witness your illusion before ya burn

What do we have here? Oh yeah, no way
It looks like your kids and they okay
Your daughter's chillin up at college, top grade
And your son's a fuckin doctor, phat paid
They got families, and kids, and it's all good
They even coach Little League in their neighborhood
Is this true, have ya really seen the Holy Ghost?
Nah, bitch not even close!

Back to reality, your son's on crack
And your daughter's got nut stains on her back
And they both fuckin smell like shit
And live in the gutter, and sell crack to each other!
When they were kids you'd beat 'em and leave 'em home
And even whip 'em with the chord on the telephone
And that reminds me man, ey you got a call...
""Watch your step to hell, it's a long fall!""

Great Milenko, wave your wand!
(Don't look now, your life is gone!)
This is all because of you!
(What you got yourself into!)
(2x)

Ahh, it's time to pack up and move to the next town
But we forgot Mr. Bigot, okay dig it
We can't show ya an illusion cause we're all packed
But we'll still cut your neck out, how's that?

Great Milenko, wave your wand!
(Don't look now, your life is gone!)
This is all because of you!

Boogie Woogie Wu,The Great Milenko,1997,"""The beast lives out of the raging storm in the dead of night
The ravenous, blood-sick creatures searches for it's sacrifice
Through the hideous darkness, it lurches, driven by death itself
Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to
The darkness from which it came""
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu

Boys and girls, it's nighty night time
Happy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme
It's about The Boogie Woogie Man
Keep your light on as long as you can
Cuz when it cuts off, so does your head
Boogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed
With a shank, splah!, up through the bottom
Little Jimmy Jimmy?
Uh, got em
""It's the one and only Boogie Man
He creeps, he hides, he sneaks, he slides
If your little feetsies are hanging off the edge of the bed
You're running on stumps motherfucker!!!""

Well, moonlight fills the room that you sleep in
Things go bump in the night, me creepin
Ouch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe
If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor
Fuck it, you're dead anyway
And I'm gonna leave your head smack dead in the hallway
In the morning, when your daddy walks out
AAAAHHH!!! His foots in your mouth, thanks to the Boogie Man

Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (here comes the boogie man)
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (heha! heha! heha! heha!)
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (make way for the boogie man)
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (mom! dad! heha! heha!)

""Does the Boogie Man really exist?""
Well, is your mother a bald-headed freak bitch? (yes)
You fall asleep and you wake up dead
With a broken broom sticking out your forehead
I sing lullabies until you doze off
Tie you down and chew your fuckin toes off
And then spit em out back in your face
(spits) Fuck! Wash your feet, bitch!
""The world's famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you
Slumber parties, sleepovers, intimate nights
What the occasion for the midnight hour
He will gladly come and fuck that shit up""

I don't beat woman, fuck that, I'm above it (no no)
But I'll cut her fucking neck and think nothing of it
""You didn't know the Boogie Man was a clown
But when you see the Juggla, your holding your jugular""
With a swing, chop, stab, swing, chop
You're holding your neck together, but your nuts drop
And the cops do the best they can
They pull the axe out your face and say
""Was it the Boogie Man?""

Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (here comes the boogie man)
What was he wearing?
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (heha! heha! heha! heha!)
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (make way for the boogie man)
Boogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (mom! dad! heha! heha!)
""Please don't let me fall asleep
Cuz the Boogie Man will creep
Through my window in my room
Stab me with a broken broom
Please don't let me fall sleep
Cuz the Boogie Man will creep
Through my window in my room
Stahhh... Boogie Woogie Woogie!""
""It's the incredible, undeadable Boogie Man
Go ahead, pull the covers over your head
Hide under them, he don't give a fuck
It'll just make it that much more easier
For him to suffocate your face!""

There's three ways to stop me from doing what I do
What? You think Imma tell you?
""Mom, can you leave the door open a bit?""
Thanks, an easy way in, you fucking idiot
Now I stretch your neck out and play in like a banjo
Boomchicka boomchicka like that shit, yo?
Then I stretch it out more and fling your head through the wall
It's the Boogie Man y'all

Everybody's time I'm takin' up (Noo)
I got nobody, it ain't a shoulder near
I can't stay here and it's colder there (Where?)
I don't wanna look back cause it's gonna hurt
I slice my wrists and it's gonna squirt (Ooh)
For me, everybody holds a hate
I get backstabbed and everybody holds the stake
It's no roads to take, I'm in a circle drive (Ooh)
Bustin' at myself and I'm tryin' to survive
I'll disappoint you, and I will let you down
And I ain't got many home boys comin' around (No?)
You don't understand, so don't say you do (Oh yes I do)
I swear I'll put a motherfuckin' slug in you (Now now)
I'm the only one, the lonely one
At home alone, loadin' a gun thinkin' why not?

Why not? Why you wanna die?
Okay, you have feelings inside your head, okay?
I understand that, feelings lead to depression
When you have depression, you have a lonely void inside of your heart
Okay? And your heart means everything to the world, okay?

I got court comin' up, I stole'd a truck
I got a bitch pregnant and I'm broke as fuck
I wanna get high but I got piss test (Well..)
I'm always first name on top of the shit list (Noo)

It ain't no clothes that I look good in
I'm the motherfuckin' big red train that couldn't
I got no family, I stole they shit (Okay)
Restraining orders and I still won't quit
I hit rock bottom, and then I fell in a hole
And then I fell through the floor of that hole some more
I been missing for a year, nobody's lookin' (I am)
I got beat down and my shit tooken (Ooh)
I look ahead and all I see is more of the same
Or this self-inflicted bullet hole pourin' my brain

Oooookay, I understand that you're in pain, okay?
I understand everything you're going through
I've been there myself, okay?
Now, your pain is my pain, alright?
And I feel your pain, and I wanna be your friend
Just me and you, friends

I dream about cuttin' heads off with a shovel (What?)
The dreams are gettin' serious, think I'm in trouble (Oh my..)
I don't hold memory for more than an hour
I'm tired as fuck and I'm drained of power
I ain't half way there and I'm all outta time
I'm like a crushed light bulb, all outta shine (Oh no..)
I been around the world but no place is home
I wanna see the other side when I face this chrome
I'm butt naked, I been jackin' off gettin' drunk
It's my last hours alive, who gives a fuck? (Me)
It don't matter, I'm doin' this shit in the garage
Tryin' to make it easier for them to clean my head splaage
This bitch I loved, I hope she finds me
Still up in the chair with my thoughts behind me (Wait, wait..)

Piggy Pie,The Great Milenko,1997,"(pig squeal)
""Ahhh! Come and get it! Woo! We got some fresh vittles for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch! So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!""

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine
I rode into town with my axe in my holster
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy boaster
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face
And blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (hehe)
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head
Since we out west, I had a little fun
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium

Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck
He walked in the room, and everybody rose
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet
Now I see the baliff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up
Old-ass man, I let him get away
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow, anyway
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me a dime
So I whacked on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds

Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!

The last little piggy, his house is made of gold
He lives in a mansion on his own private road
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate
'Cuz this little piggy must definitely fry
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel
People in my city, they fightin' for they meals
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it
So I'ma take his money stack and stuff his face with it
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate

'Cause I need three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie

I love my Faygo, I love pills, Shaggy
I love my buddies, my hatchetman but I love my axe

My axe is my buddy, I bring him when I walk
Me and my axe will leave your head outlined in chalk
My axe is my buddy, he always makes me laugh
Me and my axe cut bigots' spinal cords in half
My axe is my buddy, and when I wind him back
Me and my axe will give your forehead a buttcrack
My axe is my buddy, I never leave without him
Me and my axe will leave your neck a bloody fountain

Chorus:
(Violent J, and Shaggy 2 Dope)
Look into the deadest tree, tell me baby what you see
Dont't you hear the branches cry? Asking for the reasons why
If they hang so many men, from the branches off of them
Why did humans make them play, with them in their evil way
Look into the moons beam, can you fathom what its seen?
Bodies draging from a truck, driven by a bigot fuck
Why you think that heavens cry, acid rain and blizzard sky
Ain't no covering tracks, and thats why I'm here, and oh yes..
(Violent J)
My axe is my buddy, he'll thump into your head
Me and my axe will make your white pony's red
My axe is my buddy, you let that ditzy wave
Me and my axe will fuck your mother on your grave

The Amazing Jeckel Brothers and The Wraith
Looks like we're all out of time brother, everybody's out of time
Fuck it, we gots to tell them, all secrets will now be told
No more hidden messages, this is it y'all, time's up
Everything be out right here, no need for the reverse talking, the truth
Now we have been told this Carnival shit has touched on many lives
People have fuckin' sworn to us they too can feel it inside
What is it that draws you in, this magic that compels you
We've been waiting six fuckin' Joker Cards to finally tell you
The messages and hints were there although most never picked up on 'em
We snuck 'em in subliminally with that wicked shit around them
We mentioned more and more of this on every Joker's Card
The bottom line, always the same, you ain't have to look hard
We wickedly kick it, inflict it, you get it, get with it and dig we don't preach it flat out
Cause some ninjas don't wanna get wit ya, they quick to forget ya without the Hatchet and gat out
So we rose the Hatchet, do or die, now Juggalos standing tall
After all six have risen, the end of time will consume us all
It ain't got nothing to do with us, it ain't Psychopathic Records
All we're doing is pointing shit out to you, we in this together
Who's behind the Dark Carnival, the Gatherings and the Hatchet
Who's behind Dark Lotus, the Circus and everybody at it
Who invented Juggalos and Juggalettes and fuckin' Faygo showers
What about that feeling you get when bumping our shit, who's behind these Juggalo powers
This ain't no fucking fan club, it ain't about making a buck
Don't buy our fuckin' action figures bitch, I don't give a fuck
It ain't about Violent J or Shaggy, the Butterfly or Seventeen
When we speak of Shangri-La, what you think we mean
Truth is we follow God, we've always been behind him
The Carnival is God and may all Juggalos find him
May the Juggalos find him, may the Juggalos find him
May the Juggalos find him, he's out there, he's out there
We're not sorry if we tricked you, we don't care what happens now
We're not sorry if we tricked you, we swing our Hatchets and we're proud

A catastrophic demise x7
Unmeasurable regrets x4

Shit builds up, fills up
Too much goes over board
(What the fuck am I doing?)
Oh lord pressure stored exploded, unloaded
(What the fuck am I doing?)
I had to, it's really too bad, too
(Went coocoo) gone mad dude
Grab at and stab fools
Who knew? Sad news
(What the fuck am I doing?)
I-I-I broke, it took some time
Slow poke
I finally gave way, went under deep
Don't float
No longer steering choosing
An autopilot cruising
Haywire, crash, virus
Pull your tongue out with pliers, CHRIS BENOIT!!

No longer steering, lost all control
Manipulation (Manipulation), it won’t let me go
The pain exploded (The pain exploded)
The pressure burst (The pressure burst)
I drop the wheel (I drop the wheel)
Heading for the worst x5

Strobelight, let go, hold tight
Wake up to this, closed eyes
You did this, this you
(What the fuck am I doing?)
You got issues
What happened, shit I’m stepping
All bloody myself I’m slapping
One day, all the sudden, it, all became too much, wasn’t it?
Yes, finally released
(What the fuck am I doing?)
Unleash the beast
Eject my controller
(What the fuck am I doing?)
Took me over
I had to, it's really too bad, too
Went coocoo, gone mad dude
Grab at and stab fools
Who knew, sad news, I'm CHRIS BENOIT!!


I can take you over, permanently
Because life is about pain
I’m the crippler, Chris Benoit!

A catastrophic demise x7

Ahem, excuse my charisma
 like an escaped prisoner
Hoes got me in some hot pursuit, 'cause I can shoot my jizzma
Like a fire hose, I suppose my glowin' shine is my
Proof from the truth, groups of hoes love my stigma
I'm aloof and gone with my ninja poof like an enigma
Suppose hoes fuck their neden holes with my action figure
Dre and Snoop stop the coupe and your toupee is flenching
With my froze on my toes King of Pop, hoes hit ya
Life is the shit, as fire brains out, Ozzy
Jump out the lights into the pit, kamikaze
Suck on a grenade, pop until your top splatter
Serve it at your funeral, appetizer platter
Headbutt a brick wall until your skull shatter
Let a whore sit on your face, 400 pounds or fatter
Don't matter, fuck your step sister, pussy drama
Hit the church of Scientology, a suicide bomber
I'll be the first to admit it gets worse
I'm a sex addict that'll stab your daughter, sister or your mama
Haha or niece, cousins, auntie, Grandma I'm going back in, okay
[Verse 2: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope

I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there, missing
Seen an elephant and a chipmunk fucking and tongue kissing
Is that statutory? Do your funk fizzle, I ain't dissing
Use to have rock guitars but no they Bobby Marls' missing
Fade into obscurity, got one chance, don't blow this
Didn't make it, fell underneath, no heart to show us
Some hate us 'cause it's ICP they hear, they know this
And downgrade they record companies like retards, Otis
Talking to myself, please commit a mass murder
Barbecue they bodies, want some cheese on your ass burger?
Get served! I'm Shaggy the Clown, bitch nerd!
I'm from Detroit Southwest, 40 miles outta Shitsburg
I flip birds, 40 bottles to your mouth
Joey, you've got your own fucking album out
So, real killer all day and forever
When will we expire or retire? Bitch, never
Every week we complete and freak a brand new endeavor
I'm tryna fuck Whitney Peyton, she always hatin' though (Whatever)
, Kreayshawn
I'm trying to hit that neden, I don't wanna do no gay song
You looking for the rub? Shit, I'm looking for a rubdown
Erotic city uptown, the psychopathic scrub clown
Popping two adderalls, three Viagras, and molly
Fucking two drunk cougars, back seat of a Denali
Everything you ninjas drop, a complete miss
But  daddy's pocket's deeper than the abyss
Nice office is a studio that everyone uses
So you must be magic, every movie I make loses
Paper chasing, tell that paper I already caught ya
Two paid off houses, two tuitions, I bought ya
Adversaries all see cemeteries when I fought ya
Told Michael Jackson's daughter fucking Janet as I watch ya
Jumpsteady taught ya we ought to support our own goals
With dicks like telephone poles, diggin' out hella blown hoes
 own clothes, no-finger gloves and white rags
Stunners like Stone Cold, we blingin' scrubs with hatchet flags
Some of us grown old, yet hotties fuckin' out pajamas
Always my load, nutted in the eyes, excuse my manners

Word to my mama, I'm hotter than lava, clean
You all wanna be, I'm bombing your team, now it's a trauma scene
I chopper it, I have you missing like 
Dr. King, I got a dream, and the vision's so proper
When it comes to cash, I'm a monster, 'cause all I do it seek 
But I got the work stuffed in the pussy, that's a g-spot
Keep sleeping on me, I'm in your dreams like Krueger
Fuck how ya feeling, I'm a villain just like Lex Luthor
And your ho, I'ma do her, she 'bout to blow like a tuba
You talkin' wrong, pow, I'm lettin' go of that Ruger
I be laughin' about your rappin' while I'm crackin' the ruler
Shout out to Psychopathic for splittin' them half of that gouda
They ain't live as I, I tear it up like a roofer
It's a small thing to a giant, and they be soft as a loofa

Chicken Huntin’,The Ringmaster,1994,"""Where's that mother fucker at, man? Damn. It's been about ten days, man""
""Ay! Ay, man! Over here, man""
""Yeah, what can I do for you, boy""
""Yeah, man, uh, let me get one of these chicken necks""
""A what?""
""A chicken neck, man. A red-ass chicken neck""
""A red what? Necked chicken? What?""
""A red-ass chicken neck like yours, man!""
""Like mine?!""
""Yeah, bitch!""

Well, I'm heading down a southern trail, I'm going chicken huntin'
Chopping redneck chicken necks I ain't saying nothing
To the hillbilly, stick my barrel in his eye
Boomshacka boomshacka hair chunks in the sky
Why, I never liked chicken pot pie
Or the chopped chicken on rye
So tell Mr. Billy Bob I'ma cut his neck up
Slice, poke, chop chop, stab, cut
What can you do with the drunken hillbilly?
Cut his fucking eyes out and feed 'em to his Aunt Nilly
Willy Willy chicken neck, chicken hunting gotta love it
Hit him with the twelve gauge bucket, chicken nuggets
Laid out all over the grass
Then his little hound dog will eat 'em up fast
Last as long as you can, my man
'Cause when that chicken head hits the fan, you got
Blood guts fingers and toes
Blood guts fingers and toes
Blood guts fingers and toes
Sittin' front row at the chicken show so...

Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Cut a motherfucking chicken up! Right!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Cut a motherfucking chicken up! Right!

Let me get a chicken sandwich with Manwich
I'm finna wreck on a chicken neck
Chopping up Hilly and Billy Bob Billy
'Cause I chop motherfucking redneck silly
Peeped in your yard, tell me, what did I see?
I seen a chicken boy fucking a sheep
I say ""Mister Mister, what the fuck you trying to do""
*Unintelligible speech*
Barrels in your mouth, bullets to your head
The back of your neck's all over the shed
Boom shocka boom chop chop bang
I'm 2 Dope and it ain't no thang
To cut a chicken, trigger's clickin'
Blow off his head but his feet still kickin'
Last as long as you can, my man
'Cause when that chicken head hits the fan, it's
Blood, guts, fingers, and toes
Blood, guts, fingers, and toes
Blood, guts, fingers and toes
Sittin' front row at the chicken show so

Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Cut a motherfucking chicken up! Right!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Cut a motherfucking chicken up! Right!

Went to Kentucky, I got lucky
Met this hog-callin' bitch named Bucky
Riding on a chicken, milking a sow
Hittin' switches in a drop top low ride tractor plow
Redneck fella, moonshine sella
Hang him by his neckbones, chicken bones
Locked in the cellar, yellow belly chicken plucker
You redneck fucker!

Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!
Who's going chicken huntin? We's goin' chicken huntin'!

If We Were a Gang,Hurricane of Diamonds,2017,"You know! Motherfuckas act like we couldn't make this shit real or something
We could make this real if you want us to hahahaha reality bitch come on
Walk with us

If we were in a gang
I'd bang on them bitches
Leaving all the snitches
Sleeping with the fishes
If we were in a gang
I'd let it be known
I'm not alone
We lurking outside your home
If we were in a gang
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd be a renegade
Walk around and regulate
If we were in a gang
I'd join the government
Try to rule the world like I was someone that the devil sent
GANGSTA GANGSTA
Everybody shout it
Labeled as a gang
Might as well be all about it
So who's the enemy
I guess we got beef
Looking like a warrior
But feeling like a chief
Nobody said it tripping
This is psychopathic
When you get your first dose
She'll be coming at it
If I'm a gang member
Than I'm a loyal one
Because I'm here to represent and get the job done
We put in overtime
Protecting what we got
So if they think they gonna shut us down I think not
Take in the underground
Just like you've never seen
If I was in a gang, my team would be a big machine
Straight record shit not giving a fuck
When I'm looking for the loot
Everybody's getting stuck
Better duck, when we come around
Bitch we united
I'm gonna keep it real
If we a gang, we bout to riot

If we were a gang
I'd do the same shit I do now
My psychopathic mind
Star soldiers ready to move out
Now who's down to move pounds
Real live shoot outs
My killers run up in your crib
I'll make that bitch my new house
Now do bounce
Before this axe meet your teeth
Psychopathic the label that runs beneath the streets
Check it I am the shady one you read it in the articles
I'm crazy with a gun I'll turn your body into particles
Everybody just limbo I'll come with the kendo
Just lean in fo'
Better lock your window
All I do is win bro, get the pencil 'n stencil
Gonna get your body shot, shot like a limo
When your twin folds got blood in my timbos
Then roll up out shit-blown in door
Never swear I'm like them crooks, always been broke
Pimp ho's any weight that I get, dope
Gang bang, I slain game
My ninjas to the same thang
And never will I change, man
You can not maintain
This lil game when I aim that thang at your brain
You get your shit blown
Maybe cells rain when I aim at your place
Blood stains when I grip that
Got a sick d'em in that savage clan
Down to them in that casket, fam
Show you the true meaning of a fucking hatchet man
Fly city representer look at what you started now
Car-jack, heart attack
This is more important town
PDF, DJ Beat bangin out that black truck
JRB, Pulla, make e'rybody back up
Strapped up, murder-mitten
And honestly it's deadly here
Ask about them juggalos, bitch
WE ARE EVERYWHERE!

If we was in a gang
I would be Shaggy Escobar
We would be the biggest the baddest and the best around
And even if you ain't an enemy
We guess you are
And slugs would enter your chest and blow the rest apart
We bout to let the squirrels get it low
Two girls hittin at once
Splittin ends like blunts
The murder mitten will punch you
Like POW I'm soon to be a bitch like OW
I dunno might show me
Your ho tonight, blow me
And got my dick right before your mama rode me
She took it in the butt
Both nuts in the hole meeting, cluck like a chicken
I fucked her with a two-liter
We can both fit our dick, is she a two-seater?
But only you eat a playa, I don't need that
Hang me up ho
But your payin on the we-est side
Call my subject matter, random
Callin juggalos a gang?
I can't fathom
Yellow taxis up a chimney skim, boiling
Flaming thunder clouds
Showers of oil and soot in the skies
We like zombies, we gang bang
Everybody knows it
Your best respect us you can't eject us
You can't reject us, you can't detect us
You want to get correct, then deflect us
As the Dark Carnival!
You get used to it
Inject us in the armies, churches, schools and cop forces
Clean bombs to your green golf courses
And of course there's, recourses
Next separate from heads, divorces
Messy wants dead, not classy for me, pussy boy
BLAST my boot up your booty ass, destroyed it
Destroyed it, can't avoid, that you knowed it
If we banged, we'd a killed everybody and enjoyed it

Fuck how you feel
We are family for real
But if we were a gang
Then murder would be my thang
You ever heard of my name
They spell it in all caps
The wicked is for all raps
I'm Juggalo to the fullest
If my HOODOO don't scare 'em
Then you catching some bullets
Gun spitting in the dark looking like lightning
Strikes leaves you twitching on the concert
Fighting for life they trying
To figure out what the fuck
You do to deserve this
The we coming for your family
At the funeral service
Now other fams nervous
Thinking ""fuck are we next?""
You don't know what you are facing
We are Juggalo nation
United we stand, divided we fall
If you come against the fam
Then we riding on y'all
Homie if this was a gang
I'd have any army of niggas
From 7 mile come to your house
Break your door down
Snatch your ass off the couch
And start stomping you in front of your wife
Then ask that bitch if she wants the gun or knife
Nigga if we were a gang you'd be scared to walk the streets
My homies is off the chains and my dogs is off the leash
We young black and reckless hatchet man we rep this
My fam is worldwide and you better not ever disrespect us
Feds trying to dissect this doctors want to correct this
My whole team deem 17 impressive, resurrect us
We will never feel, the Dark Carnival protects us!
We will never fail the dark carnival protects us

If we were a gang I'd bash yo head in nicely
Your likely to get a bit of bloodstain on your fresh white tee
I might be the rudest juggalette since the 90's
Like a wicked clown painted up so frightening
Pretty yellow teeth when I pop, see me smilin'
Piggy's wiggin' now watch it rumble we persistent
Can't fuck a juggalette she see you strolling from a distance
Wicked with the blade but we look so innocent
Are you lost?
Try to rape a juggalette cause you thinking that we're soft
Put your fucking dick up in my mouth I'll bite it off
Beautifully insane we ain't some hoes you wanna cross
Boss up psychopathic 'til I die
Fill your body up with holes
And watch the life leave from your eyes
Send your head off to your momma in a box as a surprise
Then I hide inside her bushes taking pictures while she cries
Stabs to the throat I slice that shit so swiftly
But the blade is rusty so you isn't dying quickly
Got a group of hoodlums
Holding quarters looking shifty
Have my 'lettes roll through
Leave them thugs extra crispy
Chicken bitch we be huntin' all night
Got my axe in my left and my 9. in my right
So who the fuck wanna fight me
If we was a gang, shit, fuck it! We might be

Yo if i really bang like that
You think that you would really hear me on this track?
Uhm nope! I be going all in
Squad ragged up sending shooters to your crib
Plugging everybody that be looking kind of sideways
Six in the morning
And catch your momma in the driveway
Maybe I be throwing up my signs ay
But then I wouldn't have any time for all this rhyme say
I ain’t seen a fed since 98
Now they can suck what I got
Between my legs, man
This shit is fucking with my mind state
Why I gotta rap about defending shit that I say
Clay, rappin' for the familay-say
Southwest rap but they love us out the West way
Clique runs tighter than a Bruno Mars vest ay
If we were a gang you’d already have your chest caved
Psychopathic is a crime wave
Well did you listen what the blog say
Open up your eyes do it my way
Cause if we were a gang

We ain't a gang
And I think you fuckers
Take it for granted
Cuz if we were stunting off
Our fucking turf would be the planet
Understand it out the sewers we crawl
Painted faces and all
Trading places with y'all
Any sec that we saw
We'd be on all your blocks
Taking all your spots
Taking cop for Glocks
And slingshots with rocks
It don't matter yo
Either way they forehead will shatter
Taking walls with your squalls and our axe blood splatters
What matters is we ain't
But to say we all are round up
But if it was there be
A dozen of us in a clown car
I was trying to sound hard
I'm Violent J have you forgotten
I'm harder than a dick up in Beyonce neden
Now we a gang
Hey we act like one
Ok I'll pack a gun
And fucking cap your son
Stray bullets mistaken on an innocent victim
Blood leaking out the head
Come lick some Yeah
Ass we kick some
Bellies we stick some
Shank 'em stab 'em
Gank 'em and bank 'em
Grab them hatchets
Lighter or matches
Start with his toes till
His whole body catches
We admire the fire in each other
Its evident the hatchet man is the color we represent
And is somebody lose hard and starts to flop
Them little fishes and the bitches we drop
So tell the FBI to pull a death defying stunt
Light a blunt and shotgun it up your wife's cunt
Smack her fat ass up and tweak a titty nipple
If Juggalos jumped, we'd fuck a city crippled
Your lucky we don't gang bang
Cuz if we did wouldn't be damn thing to split your wig
If it were true and our crew did what hatchets do
We cut through the neck the head attaches to
Team 17 we living a dream
We the real shit
Legit you hoes needs to quit
Cuz we the hatchet man bitch
You can't match its plan bitch
Quit dreaming jacking off
You feeble-o's wack and soft
Your whole head piece we hacking off
Look him in the eyes smack it and toss it

From here to Afghanistan
Psychopathic
The Clever Team!

*tap* *tap* Hello?
*tap* *tap* *tap* Hello?

2:45 and the bell went off
Thank God, many people think I'm odd
But I talk with no one and I walk alone
And I avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
I get home and don't say hi, it ain't no one there
I don't care I walk in and go right up the stairs
To my room, get in bed and just wait for dark
Because that's when the real show start (Tap, tap)
""Tap tap"" on the glass go the piece of ass
So young and pretty it's too bad she passed
But she comes to my room and we talk at night
She's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight
In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone
And I kiss her cold lips until the morning come
Then she gone, I can still hear her voice loom
But she only exist in the dark of my room

Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)

I try to smile a lot, but I'm always frontin'
But I do love a ghost and at least that's somethin'
She don't talk much, when she do it gets cold
Usually we just lay there and we hold each other
We're lovers, we don't need others
One of my mother's cats jumped up on the covers
And it scared my baby, guess she don't like pets
So I twisted it's fuckin' head off at the neck
Look baby, it's bloody, it's gone, it's doomed
Please come back to the room
I'll do anything for thee, don't ignore me
This is more than a sick love story
Without you I'd bring a shotgun to school
And I will if you want me to, for any reason
I hate that you leave when the lights come on
And if I had it my way the fuckin' sun'd be gone

Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)

Sometimes I kiss her, I start shakin'
She slips me the tongue, and it tastes like bacon
Uh oh, something's wrong, baby's upset
She told me she was spotted by the neighbor's kid
She can't come back now 'cause they know our secret
Unless I can make them keep it
If I do she may come to life
Now I'm in their yard with a shotgun and knife
Cut the screen, went in and found the kid
Blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head
And the daddy was next runnin' down the hall
I shredded his throat and he was quick to fall
Tossed the Mossberg and gripped the knife
Started stabbin' the shit outta his wife
Went home a bloody mess with a job well done (Tap, tap)
Wash up and wait for my baby to come (Tap, tap)

Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)

I waited two or three days, four days
Waitin' for the ""tap tap"" like always
I waited and hated this (Tap, tap)
I created a bloody mess (Tap, tap)
I waited two or three months, four months
Waitin' for the ""tap tap,"" just for once

Piggy Pie (Old School),"Forgotten Freshness, Vols. 1 & 2",1998,"Once upon a time there were three little pigs
Who went out into the big world
To build their homes and seek their fortunes
The first little piggy, his house is made of wood
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister and drink his moonshine
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my axe in my holsta
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roasta
The sheriff at the border, he tried to take me out
I drew my axe with the quickness-and cut his Adam's Apple out!
Walked in the village and to the piggy's place
He opened up his door and shot me in the face
And blew me off the porch-and blew my head in half
But I'm a Juggalo so it only made me laugh (ha ha!)
Axe in hand, I rose like the dead
And swung with all my might- made a thump noise in his head
Since we out west, I grabbed a shotgun
And blew his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium!!
CHORUS:
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (NO!)
I might choose an axe (YES!)
The Carnival's in town- come and get your piggy snacks
The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a mother fucking dick
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinking lights
I drive a Volkswagon bug 17 deep
Packed full of Juggalos, lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out- we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now they in persuit like Starsky and Hutch
But theres only two of them-the rest are out to lunch
They call up Dunkin Donuts to gather up the rest
25 piggies with they bullet-proof vests
We lead them in a chase, they bustin' off rounds
But now they all fucked cuz we at the Carney grounds
And they gettin swallowed by their very own greed
DARK CARNIVAL and wicked clowns because we need....
CHORUS 2xs
Three little piggies to make a piggy pie
There's nothin like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (NO!)
I might choose an axe (YES!)
The carnival's in town come and get your piggy snacks
The last little piggy, his house is made of gold
He lives in a mansion on his own private road
I started walking down it- the guard he told me wait
I snapped his fuckin neck in two and slammed his nuts in the gate
Cuz this little piggy must definitely die!
I'm lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil
And pull it out the sky and beat it with a shovel
People in my city, they fightin' for they meals
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundered dollar bills
A richey is the devil- he never will admit it
So I'mma cut his hand off and slap his face wit' it
Opened up his door, he sleeping in his bed
I grabbed a brick of gold and smacked it upside his head
He begged for his life, I told him its too late
And tied his neck in a knot and watch him suffocate
Cuz I need...
CHORUS 4x
Three little piggies to make a piggy pie
There's nothin like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (NO!)
I might choose an axe (YES!)

How Many Times?,The Great Milenko,1997,"How many times will I ask myself why, how many times?
How many times will I ask myself why, how many times will I cry? (2x)

How many times will you honk your horn and say fuck you?
Now what the fuck does that do?
Ya feel better now? I didn't let ya pass
How 'bout I stop my car, and beat your fuckin' ass?
How many times will my neighbor beat his wife?
Somewhere in that house there's a butcher knife
Fuckin' drunk, swingin' his fists about
Why don't she wait till he sleeps then take him out
How many times will I sit in a hot car?
Traffic jam, been sittin' for a fuckin' hour
Must be an accident, I hope nobody died
Finally get there, and the crash is on the other side
The gawkers roll and they creep slow
Hoping they can see a mangled body show
Some park, and stand there and watch it all
With their kids, they point, and fuckin stare (and just look)
I remember one time I was pulled over
Handcuffed, the cop was like, show's over
People watching, hoping that he shoots me
I just wanted to choke the fucking head

How many times will I ask myself why, how many times?
How many times will I ask myself why, how many times will I cry?

How many times will I wait in a line?
It's three-thirty, I fuckin' got here at nine
I'm finally up to the front, can't wait another minute
Why am I here? to pay a fucking parking ticket
The lady at the counter acts like a fuckin bitch
No smiles, no help, you're just a piece of shit
I'm gettin' pissed, calm down, fuck it, forget it
Back to my car, and there it is, another ticket
How many times will a crackhead smoke crack
And ask me for some money cuz he wants crack
Give him money, again, he's coming back
Walk away, and here's another, ""Gimme some crack""
How many time will a kid give a dirty look?
A little punk-ass bitch tryin to be a crook
I wrote the book, I was out robbin' liquor stores
When you were just a nut stain in your momma's drawers


How many times will you steal my car stereo?
It don't even work, ya feel like a bitch, don't you?
I vacuum all the fuckin' glass off from my seat
I sit down, and got a piece stuck in my butt cheek
How many times did I walk in, and just sit?
And have to listen, and learn all this bullshit
Learnin' history and science, fuckin' wait
Knowin' that, will that put food on my plate?
Yeah, can I walk into McDonald's, up to the counter
And tell 'em you can make limestone from gunpowder
Will they give me a cheeseburger if I know that shit?
Fuck no, fuck you, and shut your fuckin' lip
How many times will a judge decide my fate?
Who is he? A bitch, nothing great
He takes shits, and fucks his old floppy wife
Plays with his balls and judges my life!

""And who the fuck is he?
He judges my life""",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-how-many-times-lyrics
Pass Me By,The Great Milenko,1997,"""Does this excite you?
Think about it!
Does it not stagger the imagination?
No builder on earth can conceive any structure
To compare to the mansions above
Won't that be something?
When you go to live in your own mansion?
There'll be no concern about paying for it
It's already taken care of
There'll be no worry about being moved out of it
It will be yours forever.""

I got shot, ah!, the murder was heinous
The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus
And I was hit, that was it, on the spot
Flash, I woke up in a parking lot
And I'm sittin' in a '64 on Ds
With Shaggy Dope written on the car keys
I look around I can't believe that it's possible
I'm dead, and I made it to The Carnival
I walk in, it's everything I dreamed of
Everybody and they mama got Clown Luv
Japanese, Lebanese, and Chinese
Portuguese, and southwest ghetto g's. (woowoo)
Hangin' out with redneck truck drivers
Instead of always givin' each other piledrivers
I see my old homey, he died in a drag
Chillin with two bitches, ""What up, Shaggs?""
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk
I tried to hit it, but couldn't even fuck with it
And to think, I always been afraid to die
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why

We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me by, no
We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me by, no

I was born, first, they threw me in a shit pile
I dealt with it, and lived there for a while
I got dissed on, pissed on, and beat down
Mutilated, and tossed out a dead clown
Next thing ya know, I'm chillin' at the big top
Free money, and mad bitches non-stop
No water, it's Faygo on tap
I wash my hair, and my face, and my butt-crack with it
Cuz I can, cuz I'm phat paid
I got a five story funhouse with a maid
And she walks around with her titties hanging out
And when I cough, she come and dust my balls off (woowoo)
I'm headed up to the show, I'm gonna see
Jimi Hendrix, Selena, and Eazy E
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off
We got pissed off, because he sounded like butt
There's no fights, it's a perfect match
Hillbillies in the crowd tryin' to Cabbage Patch
And to think, I've always been afraid to die
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why

We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me by, no
We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me by, no

Well picture this, your nuts burnin that way
And a roman candle stickin' in your butthole
That's where the greedy stank motherfuckers go
This is our hell now, we livin' in it
But this bullshit'll be over in a minute
Then it's off to the Faygos and neden holes
New clothes, and patent leather for your toes (Whoop whoop!)
And while you sit around cryin' for your dead friend
He's chillin' up there, paid, getting mad ends
He's probably there tryin to figure out why you're sad
He's on the beach gettin' fat, you got it bad (Aww)
And for those who ain't down for the next man
Who rob from the poor, and snatch all ya can
And any chicken talkin' shit, lemme tell ya something
Hold a lighter to your balls, and you'll see what's coming

We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me by, no

I Want My Shit,The Amazing Jeckel Brothers,1999,"It was like March or April, fuckin' Libra...fuckin', um, shit...

Taurus, born in 1775
I'm like 300 and something, but I'm still alive
I used to hang with the original Billy the Kid
You prob'ly think I'm only playing but, I did
My daddies were a two headed freak show
Momma, a fortune teller, Esmarelda Zella
Anyway they had sex on a ouiji board
And I was born the next day...  Violent J
When I was 14, I tripped on the train track
And I was crushed right there on the steel rack
I'm out cold, they thought it had fucked me up
I got up and itched my butt, I'm like, ""what?""
Everybody tripped and called me the clown devil boy
Child of the witch heffer...whatever
Tied me up, burned me and threw stones
Had a few scrapes and cuts, smokey nuts
After that they started bowing and shit
Praying at me, you know how them primitives get
I said, ""Get off my dick, I ain't a savior
I'm what you call a juggalo and all I want is my flavor
Four simple things in this bitch, before I die...

So anyway...
50 years pass, all my homies are old ass fucks
I ain't even got hair on my nuts
I left the village in search of my ends
I wrestled alligators, battled terminators
Nothing ever killed me, nothing could harm me
I fought in the Civil War, Yankees army
I walked across enemy lines with a MAC-10
(Shaggy2Dope)
Man, they didn't even have that shit back then
(Violent J)
How you just gonna come in my shit and fuck it up?
(Shaggy2Dope)
Well at least make this shit sound real, man, damn!
(Violent J)
I walked across enemy lines with a...lantern
Steady taking cannon balls, to the balls
The war ended, I traveled the country horseback
Until this fool tried to horsejack
He put his gat to my head and blew my face up
 It didn't even smear the make-up
I took his gun and put a 
divot
 in his neck
Sheriff didn't like it...I got indicted
87 long years in the state pen
Until they finally forgot why they put me in
They had to let me go you know they had nothing
On the way out they're like, ""Yo, ain't you like 100 and something?""
I said, ""That's right, and I ain't gonna die
'TILL I GET MY SHIT, MOTHERFUCKER!""


And just a little sip or two...

'TILL I GET MY SHIT, IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER I WON'T NEVER DIIIIEEE!

I slept under bridges, lived in the valleys
I climbed the mountains, searched the alleys
More years passed, and I still ain't died
Now I'm in Detroit on the Southwest Side
My homie has an 
Impala, blue '67
Last night we hit the road pushing 111
I stuck my head out the window, told him floor up the most
And let 
my nugget
 ping off a light post
Ha ha ha! Hell yeah, 'cuz!
Hurts a little bit, but then you get a straight buzz
The world hates me 'cuz of shit like this
They always try to kill me but MIIIIIISSSS
I know it's odd that my face is forever painted
When I was born, the bitch-ass doctor fainted
My toungue's a little long, I choke people with it
Looks kinda nasty...but chicks dig it
And I told ya my neck can stretch for miles
I look like something from 'The X-Files'
People wanna see me die more than a little bit
But I'm a juggalo, and as a juggalo I want my SHIT!
AND I AIN'T GONNA DIE, TILL I GET IT!

Threw a Molotov cocktail and blew up the truck

I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
You get punched in your faces, reppin' the racists

Confederate Flag

The judge, grandpa, dad and three sons
All of 'em KKK, they can't run
I blew a head clean off, it rolled, still in the hood
The headless horseman fell dead in the woods
The rest of the Klansmen ran cause' they were scarey
It was Tim the banker and the barber Larry
All pussies, threw off their hoods, they cried ""please""
But they were devils, so I capped their knees

I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
That shit represents a hateful sense
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
If it's in your back pockets, I'm aimin' my rockets
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
That's what you wanna wave? I stick you in your grave
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Stick your fucking flag pole right up your fag hole

Rednecks call it pride; pride for what?
White pride for slavery, it sickens my gut
I see that flag as a challenge, that you want to fight
You don't care who it offends, you say it's your right
Well it's my right to sock you dead in your lip
Put a foot on your neck, and tell you ""eat up a dick"" (BITCH)
No matter where you live, you should hate that flag
Cause it represents evil bigots, tell em' Shaggs

One, two, three rednecks on a ladder
Hangin' up a rebel flag, it don't matter
How many of ya, because we don't love ya
Stick you in the dirt, tombstone above ya
There's juggalos all over the south that don't wave it
Proud of where they're from but that flag, they hate it
Cause they understand it's a symbol of slavery
One flag reps us all, it means bravery

I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
I'll turn a redneck into a deadneck
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Cut the head off a chicken, give 'em an ass kickin'
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
The holes in your t-shirt, fill them with pee squirt
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Redneck fuckin' meth head, tuck you in your death bed

Southwest Voodoo,The Great Milenko,1997,"Voodoo, runnin' from my magic

Branga shag, shugga wugga bah
Southwest voodoo's in the house!
Wicked voodoo, joker killer
Magic, dark magic

Met this kid named Louie Lou
He thought he could fuck with this voodoo
So I turned his head into a lima bean
And then flicked it off his shoulders

From Mookan House to Shangri-La
Egyptian Pharaoh, coompata
Follow me, and join us as we pray
To the seventeen moons of Coonga Delray

Walked in the lunchroom chantin' spells
With bamboo bitches and voodoo bells
Got my own food, who wants some?
I got possum nipples and raccoon tongue

A non-believer once started to laugh
So I launched a fireball up his punk-ass
Then everybody heard him squeal
""This voodoo shit's for real!""
It just takes...
A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo


Crypt on Verner
 on a windy night
You see voodoo scribblings in the moonlight
Painted all on the city street
It's the ancient craft of gang bangin
Hey! J! What's in the bag?

A shrunken head, and shriveled scrotum sack
Why? Ya think voodoo's fake?
Come to the graveyard, I'll make the dead wake
""Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba
Sleep no longer, raise, quick
Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba
Leave us alone, you fuckin' punk bitch!""
Well, fuck it, I ain't that good yet
But one day you can bet I'm a freak
We'll make the whole world dance with the dead
And just like my homey said
It only takes...
A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo!

Voodoo running from my magic (3x)
I'll make a voodoo doll out of ya and flick your nuts
(x2)
A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-southwest-voodoo-lyrics

On a brother or a Mexican (Fuck)
This shit may never quit
Bigots may never learn (Never learn)
I'll cut your mothafuckin' throat out, bigot!
Now it's your turn (Yeah)
Bigots in the north seem to get respect
You know I'll choke that greasy neck
Step to the left, step to the right
Aim my piece and I'll fuck your face up
Bitch, cause I don't sleep
Said, fuck you bitch, I don't sleep
In the south there's a lot of good faces
But shit, I'ma gat on a fuckin' racist

Instead of helping them poor people eating out of them garbage cans

Toy Box,Riddle Box,1995,"""Ooh, I like this toy. Watch it go. Uw...wait!"" *gunshots*
""We're sorry the person you are calling is dead""

I was like six, I used to get dissed by the chicks
And everyone would chase me and hit me with bricks
And rocks and sticks and calling me names
And fill my lunchbox with frog brains, ew!
When I left school, it was much iller
My daddy was a serial killer
And how about that, he always made me sit in the back
With all his dead bodies on my lap, move!
When I got home, enough of the static
Hammer and tools and up to the attic
Never knew any other girls or boys
Only my toys, toys, toys
Bang, clang, hammer and twist
Nobody knows I exist, and I'm pissed
But I won't be mentally scarred
Instead I make toys, toys of the graveyard
Monday, ring of the bell
It's all about show and tell, might as well
Show all these bastards just what I got
Yo, check out my toy box!
(Aah! Turn it off! Aah!)
""Nothing feels better than a good hardy-har-har, right, boys and girls?""

We got dead bodies everywhere you look
All the nerds sittin' up front got cooked
Others start screaming and making a dash
So I start handing out toys fast at last
You like slinkies? We got slinkies
Only mine like to wrap around your face
And stretch, twist, kazoom
And whip your body all over the fuckin' room
So come, one at a time
Open your gift and what you will find
Is a toy, my friend, that you'll never forget
It's not everyday that you get your skull split
You like soldiers? We got soldiers
Made with rubber and steel, they look real
But I wouldn't just toss 'em under your bed
That's how you get an axe to the forehead
Oh, and don't let 'em sit around all day
Come home and find you mom, dead in the hallway
'Cause they can be nifty
All the toys are shifty, hehe, in my toy box
(Turn it off! No! Turn it off! Aah!)
""Woowee, that sure sounds like fun!""

That's not a toy, hey, wait a minute
Don't fuck around, homie, you can lose an eye with it
That's my double blade razor whip chop Jimmy
And it's mine, mother fucker, so gimme gimme
You want toys, you come to the right place
Try my little toy, Mutilating Mental Case
Wind him up, let him go among all of ya
Then BANG! Serial slaughterer
Your turn, reach in and get lucky
Oh look, he pulled out a rubber ducky
*Squeak squeak* It make a funny sound, man
Then BANG! Blew the fingers off his fuckin' hand
Won't stop, class ain't done yet
I remember you calling me poindext
Bookworm brainy, my aggravation
Went into these little creations
Reach in, you might find something wicked

Down With the Clown,The Great Milenko,1997,"This one goes out to the ninjas
Thats been down since 
Carnival of Carnage
Nah, fuck that, since 
Dog Beats
Nah, fuck that, since 
Basement Cuts
, motherfucker

How long will the juggalos be down with me?
How long till they forget me, check it out
What if I grew another fucking head
And his name was Violent Ed
And he'd head butt me every time I cussed
I would need two microphones when I bust
Would you show me love even with another head
Or would you be like, ""Fuck you and Ed""
Or what if I sold out like a bitch
And took the make-up off and went soft, eww
Called myself Detroit Southwest Lover
And put my ugly-ass face on the album cover
Went R & B top ten hit
And we had Jodeci singing all over our shit (aaahhhh!!!!)
Fuck that, though, yo, I'm a juggalo
So don't forget me like you did with Menundo

What about when the world's like fuck us kill us
What will you be? (Down!)
What about when I'm 103?
What will you be? (Down! Down!)
What about when the world's like fuck us kill us
What will you be? (Down!)
What about when the carnival comes to your town?
(I'ma be down with the clown!)

How long will you be down with a ghetto puppet
I say I'm sick in the nugget and you love it
I ate a dead body, I ain't proud of it
I told you all about it, and you all applauded (HEY!!)
I got problems, I'm haunted by a carnival
I could run and tell a doctor, but what for (Why?)
I just put it on tape with a fat beat
And make a quick buck, I'm like fuck (Whoop whoop!)
I could of came out sportin' some Hammer pants
Kick-steppin with Shaggs, and tryin to dance
Making mom happy, keeping it soft
I'd rather grab my dick and tell your mom to fuck off!
I know then you'd probably start to trip
And swing at me, but hit Violent Ed in the lip
Look I don't even know what I'm trying to say
Just don't forget me like you did with Rob Base

What about when the world's like fuck us kill us
What will you be? (Down!)
What about when I'm 103?
What will you be? (Down! Down!)
What about when the world's like fuck us kill us
What will you be? (Down!)
What about when the carnival comes to your town?

To be blown into pieces is the reasons you came

Bang! Pow! Boom! They say the show is the bomb
I heard it's straight up explosive, some even call it napalm
Nobody battles back, this ain't no kind of war

And the winds in the sky will carry away all the ash
But for now let us enjoy the big back-splash!

Fury!,Fearless Fred Fury,2018,"Willaby Rags here, wanting to know
How much pain will you withstain
Before all your worry turns into fury?

I got in my home and I ran in my room
I cut off the lights and the pressure consumed me
Wet is my face from the tears in my eyes
I can taste them, they're salty, my life I despise
No matter how often I'm beat down, it's shocking
Tears falling upon a shotgun I'm cocking
Alone in the corner, sitting on the floor
My feelings hurt so bad, they're dead to the core
Pitch black as my room disrupted by the glow
Red 665 on the clock radio
Illuminating the shadows sprawled out on the wall
The scariest imagery I've ever saw
A symbol of anger strong as a tornado
Of toxic pollution is rocking my cradle
And shocking me is the impact of his fist
It woke me up to the simple fact that I'm pissed

(It's fury)
Fight back! (Get up) Fight back! (Get up) Fight back!
(Come on) Fight back! (Get up) Fight back! (Fury)

Fuck all that forgiving the other, bitch
Bitch, I will murder your mother, bitch
I'll store your head in the cupboard, bitch
Fuck all that dyin' and cryin' and whinin'
And I want revenge, I don't die, bitch
Murder-go-round, you gon' ride, bitch
Fuck all that, bitch, suicide, bitch
Bitch, I got you to die (Fight back)
No more complaining, 9 milli' burst
Blood will be raining, follow the hearse
Woke up a giant, too far they pushed me
Never deny I'm a scrub, but I'm no pussy
Swung a machete, tip of the skull
Split down the middle, you fitted and all
Wicked is the clown, boom, bang, and pow
Shapaw, chah, poof, plow

Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation
Napalm, it's on
Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation
Napalm, it's on

I'm sucker punchin', it's suckers I'm punchin'
Squeeze the cocksucker's throat, hear the bones crunchin'
He'll need a vegetable tube when he's lunchin'
'Cause everything neck up could no longer function
Still, I tortured him to death in my dungeon
Dumped him in the alley at Vernor and Junction
That corpse laid there rotten, became hella pungent
And perfect for Flip and his friends to be munchin'
How long can you heat me until we see fire?
Beat me 'til we see my patience expire
How long do you think you can treat me like shit?
'Til you screw up and I screw your head off your neck
How far do you think that elastic can stretch?
Til' I'm shootin' your head through my basketball net
It slaps on the pavement, all fleshy and wet
'Til I run up and punt that lunk of shit, pow!

(It's fury)
Fight back! (Get up) Fight back! (Get up) Fight back!
(Come on) Fight back! (Get up) Fight back! (Fury)

Bitch, I done ran out of tears, bitch
Fury that's spawned out of fears, bitch
I'll stab a screwdriver deep in each ear
'Til I know that you hear me and fear me and clearly
Smack me, my paint never smears, bitch
But that check your ass never clears, bitch
Fred Fury taught me revenge is the way
Payback's even worth waiting for years (Fight back)
Taking a chance again with the jab (With the jab)
Repeated offense, it would've perhaps (Would've perhaps)
This nobody snaps, and then it's too late (Then it's too late)
My will restricting me from fighting back breaks
My thinking is null, react with a bat (React with a bat)
Swing for the skull, connect with a smack (Connect with a smack)
Instant I swerve, cracking the wood (Cracking the wood)
Every face staring was freckled in blood

Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation
Napalm, it's on
Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation
Napalm, it's on
Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation
Napalm, it's on
Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation

Fred Fury is all in your feeble, fearful flaws
Formulating into one ferocious fog in the afterlife
Whose fiery fist will fuck you up
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation
Napalm, it's on (665)
Hey son, you're facin' helly retaliation

If ever I cussed as much when they bust
With the buzz in a fuss and be such
Could music even be nuts? Would they reap us?
Or style wanna keep us?
Are we dreamingers? Never sleepers?
You'd probably never beep us
Because wouldn't be cuss
Jesus thesis wouldn't reach us
Not not speakers taller than a bleachers (Bitch!)
To each his own
His only bone is to goin' in knowing they critique us
What was only on them sneakers
Now they wanna slap on speakers
Sneak ass, Rikishi ass, that flash back, trash that, I'm past that
For the freaky naked speakers beatin' blast that
You get your ass slapped
We stick our dicks in a mix of chicks all fixed to start some shit up
Soon as we parked, them markets sparkle, bitches' boxes lit up
So get up, fuck shit up, some haters' throats get slit up
They bleeding, belch, and spit up
Soon as it croaks, we tip up
Ching ching ching, shim shimmering shing
Angels bring bling for kings
The best gift they truly ever gave
Jetpack flight through the Everglades
Making fuck down with seven babes
Fresh reunion with Mr. Spade
Chance for retarded kids to get laid
Danny ""K"" at Coachella, paid

From the depths of where my heart used to be
You ain't shit (Bitch!)
Fuck yo bitch, suck my dick

Plummeting into a dungeon of nothingness
I'm 'bout to suffocate, fearless like Fred Fury
Born a legitimate, born to eliminate
Spirits around me allow me to levitate
Drugs in me sedidate, that's how I meditate
I ain't show up to my funeral, made 'em wait
I got the stain on the game that I gotta make
I know they feeling it
Ouija just killing it
Look what we did with it
Put the sauce on the wicked shit
Y'all should be fucked, shit, bitch, cunt, happy we did this shit
Handzum with a hatchet, talk to my elastics
Psycho with schematic automatic static
Tell me
Where do I start, because swearing's an art
Hatchetman on my heart means I'm wearing the part
We don't care about critics, right there on the charts
It's the spot that we bear, it's declarin' us marred
Everywhere that you go, don't be starin' your mart
They say juggalos hard, and you know that they are
And they know every Card from the second it start
They dissect every secret, they checkin' the arc
You can see my mug in the CDs that you might purchase or pluck right there coat
Or within your  was there from the start
Blarin' our music and wearin' our art
Tearin' through duckets and hearin' our heart
We there for a part
Caring the hardest is sharing them Cards
Woo! I might go love pussy like I'm on a hike
I'm lost in the pussy looking for the light
I beat up the pussy like a prison fight
I don't like fat pussy, but I do tonight
I'm fucking your butt if the pussy ain't tight
I burn through pussy like coke in a pipe
Fuckin' your girl's pussy's like rockin' the mic
Shit's pussy, simple as riding a bike
I master cuss words that you ain't even heard of yet

I mean I hear what you're saying, I mean
You got carried away in the moment
And I could forgive you
I could do that
I could do anything, if I want to
(1st Verse- Violent J)
I could buy you a Lexus truck with a white leather interior, I could
I could kill off some bears and dogs and shit just to make you a fur coat
I could love you and treat you with class
And have babies falling all out your ass
But thinking about that...
I feel I'd rather kill you

(Chorus x2- Violent J)
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch-ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homies
(2nd Verse- Violent J)
I could take all the face paint off and get a real job working for your Dad
I would rather take a ten-pound axe and stick it in your daddy's forehead
I could let you move into my house
You'd fuck the neighbors every time I'd go out
And wipe his nut on my pillow 
But I think I'd rather kill you

(Chorus)
(3rd Verse)
I'm the one that killed your precious cat
And stuffed him in your fucking mailbox
If I only hadn't cut off my hair, I'd choke you with all my dreadlocks
When I scream at the moon every night 
You should've known something just ain't right
'Cuz I'm gonna slap you
And then I'm going to kill you

(4th Verse)
I could go back to school instead and try to get my diploma
I'd much rather bang your head on the wall, until you fall into a coma
'Cuz I can't get you out of my head
I'd cut my head off but the I would be dead
And I ain't the only motherfucker that's dying!
So let's just die togetherrrrrraaaaaagghhh!!!

Ahhh!! Let's just die together
Ahhh, yeah!! Let's just die together

(Verse 1: Violent J)
I was never popular, this I'll admit, fuck school never liked me, Goo!
All the kids would always beat me, until I'm half-dead
Make fun of the size of my forehead
But that shit never bothered me, Mama and Mother
They owned a lot of property
They had a science lab in the basement
And that's where my free ti...well, all my time was spent
I made a mouse with a chicken head
It clucked three times: CLUCK, CLUCK, CLUCK!
And then it was dead
I made a lot of things though, like a frog with a turkey neck
Gobblegobblegobble, it was the shit (yeah)
But I'm still lonely, I need a homie
So I collected limbs and made a zombie
I could've made a girlie friend
But fuck that, I got my girlie right here...yeah!
(Chorus)
You can call me Mad Professor
I will make a friend for me
You can call me Mad Professor
We will rule eternity

(Verse 2: Violent J)
I used so many body parts it was crazy
I killed a whole bunch of mother fuckers , like what, eighty?
They all chipped in on my special friend
Everything helps, Even if you got a finger to lend, come on
I hear the other children playing outside
""Keep it down you little bitches, I'll skin your fucking hides!""
Stressful... this part's wack
Some how I gotta attach this nut sack
Shit! Fuck! I'm sawing off an elbow
Looking at the meter on my Quasar Ziptalo
Or better yet look out the fucking window
I see a storms coming, almost time to roll
Screw the head on, come on, come on
It's the thuggish, ruggish, bone
Okay it's time, hit the switch, turn it up a hert
Fuck! Shit! Didn't work
(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Violent J)
It wasn't always easy (Hell no!) let me tell ya
But fuck that, cause I ain't no failure
I put the shit with the veins and this with that
Wait a minute...(rrrtt) did you hear that?
It's alive! I just gotta wake it up
Hand me that Rock 'n Rye, pour it in a cup
Give it to his ass, wait, hold up, pause
I ain't cleaning his drawers man, fuck that
Get him fat, get him ready, it's almost time
Paint his ugly face up almost like mine
I see him twitching, I'm on a roll
He can help me tell the whole world about the carnival
Turn the hertz all the way up for this shit
And just wait for that lightning bolt to hit
Did it work? You make the call

Waste depositories, it's Shaggyyyyyyyyyy Tiiiiime!

Hey! How ya doin down there? I've got mice here!
Alright! What up y'all? Welcome to the show
I'm Shaggy, like you don't fuckin' know
This is my sidekick, Fat Pat
He goes ""Ha ha ha ha"", and all of that (That's right!)
Anyhow, on my way here I almost died
This bitch in front of me was like a hundred and five
They worry about drunks, and late night truckers
Old ass bitches try to kill mutherfuckers (Ha ha ha ha)
This lady's got her left blinker on for an hour or more
Then she makes a right into my side door
This comedy shit's gettin old
The game is to be sold, not to be told
Oh yeah, you can feel the excitment right?
SNOOP DOGG is with us tonight
That's what I'm sayin
On the Shaggy Show, shit we ain't playin
And that ain't it, also on the show
Another motherfucker that well, some of you know
You see him with me a lot, he's like a brother
Violent J's in this motherfucker
(I like that kid Violent J)
Hey Mike! (What's up?)
How ya doin today? (Just great Shags!)
That's great, now let's give a hand

Get your PHD and join a nation of player hation!

Ok, my first guest, he's nutty as hell
He just served a half a year in the county jail
Now he's back, for now at least
Hey Violent J's in this bitch ass piece!

What up y'all? (What up?) What's happenin'?
It's been six months and my dick ain't havin' it
If I don't hurry up and get me some ass
I might bust this nut on your TV glass!
Anyway, been workin' on my brand new shit
A brand new group with my homies Twiztid
It's called Dark Lotus, should I play some for y'all?
Hell naw

Now I been hearin' a little of this and that
About you havin' some kind of a panic attack
Tell us, uh, is it true?
And when you have one, what the fuck do you do?

Well, I'll be sittin' there enjoyin' a coffee
And then all of a sudden, I'm like GET OFF ME!
Then I start chokin' out pedestrians
Until they give me my shot of calliphilestrian
But that's all over now, it's old hat
I'm a perfectly normal necrophiliac
Just don't test me or pull strings, forget it
I might grab your neck and do bad things wit' it!

Well on that note, thank you J (Sure)

That you can cook a hog's ass in a spoonful
When a workin' man such as myself wants a little hot fixin', I reach for
That bottle of momma's God Damn Hot Chili
Smooth tender chunks with chili beans filled with momma's hot bastard
Bacon bits, and drizzled with just the right amount of thick savory sauce
Drippin' with noodle nuggets and Texas tough onions
Mmmm mmmm that's hot, God Damn Hot
Ask for it by name

Thanks fellas! Alright yo, we're back

He's come a long way from the LBC

Clowns, get down nigga, I represent the town
Ay yo Violent J let's go half on this pound

They call me Snoop Dogg and I can raise your arm
So any MC that disagree with me
Step up and watch your muthafuckin' ass meet defeat

Snoop? (What?) Now you got platinum on your walls
While other fools stare and, scratch their balls (What?)
They wanna be like you, they wanna try to steal your flow
Now (What up?) Yo, why is that so?

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
Some bitch ass nigga tryin' to steal my flow
But I don't pay 'em no attention
Oh, should I mention?
I'm all about the money and ridin' in cars with suspension
Bouncin', bankin' up corners smokin' dope
Smokin that weed, hangin out with my locs and folks
Don't give a fuck about nothin' at all
That's why I'm known to the world as big motherfuckin Snoop Dogg
Nigga

What if we had our own island, man
Let's trip in the sun (repeat)
(Verse 1: Violent J)
I got my toes in the sand, watchin hoes play volleyball
It's summer time, and I'm feeling jolly ya'll
Food on the fire, boats in the water and takin time off from my serial slaughterin
Here for the weekend, me and these friends, sunny sunshine, and blue skies never end
There's a mermaid wavin' me to come in, underwater on my balls she's hummin
Smokin on a phat one, we come to have fun, I got my dick in your hotdog bun
Pouring out shots for everybody that's sippin, let's get loose now, skinny dippin
Don't hate me cause the speedo I'm wearin, got your girlfriend starin
We out here, sky's so clear, ice cold beer, suntan, topless, BITCH, come over here
Hook:
On Juggalo island, We can be one. Let our nuts hang by the water. On Juggalo island, we can have fun. We can let go, by the water
(Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope)
Bang! Pow! Boom!, sunny like high noon, met some lettes, and they all comin over soon
Have a luau, I'm getting blew out, come over here if you ever get threw out
We gotta place for ya, never will ignore ya, gotta hot plate and a drink we gunna pour ya
Corpse on tha grill, plays on the one, two, and around here the dead have fun too
Stiffs in the water, float and we see you, doing flips in the air on a sea-doo
No cops, unless they pourin out shots, unless ur helping us smoke these crops
Surfin on the big one, havin big fun, fuckin with a big fat one under the sun
Lettin them hang, doing our thang, listen to them up and down the beach everybody sing
Hook:
On Juggalo island, We can be one. Let our nuts hang by the water. On Juggalo island, we can have fun. We can let go, by the water
(Verse 3: Violent J)
And when the sun goes down, we up all night, dance of the dead, boogie woogie in the moon light
Fuck the rules, right? The dead do bite, listen to the ouija board, we can only do right
Can't do wrong, fatty in a blue thong, everybody can't be together with you gone
Come get with this, wicked ridiculous, This world is ours every bit of this
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Get you a burger with cheese, enjoy the breeze, I'm choppin coconuts outta palm trees
And we all in, a free ballin, see me shore side, surfin on a dolphin
Grass skirt, dead hula girls, hatchets, and whatever your fishing hook catches
We don't leave without you, so lets hang, Boom Pow Bang, lets do the damn thang
Hook
On Juggalo island, We can be one. Let our nuts hang by the water. On Juggalo island, we can have fun. We can let go, by the water

Under the Moon,The Great Milenko,1997,"Under The Moon
I'm still here under the moon(2x)

I was just a child but you seemed like so much more
The way you would approach me and drift across the floor
I'd see you in the hall, and you'd kiss me with a smile
I never understood it, was I even worth your while?
The others kids at school, they would hate me and they'd spit
Cuz I was just a no one, to them I wasn't shit
But you would always help me and stand there by my side
We were only seventeen, we'd be together till we died
But then it all happened on the ever dreadful day
Somebody tried to rape you and now I'll make him pay
You pointed him out to me, my thoughts began to race
I took my daddy's forty-five and shot him in the fucking face!!!
I did it all for you, and though I'm facing years
I would do the time just to equal all your tears
The last thing that you told me when I left the courtroom
Is that we'd always be together, cuz we're both under the moon

I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together

I sit here in my cell and the walls are made of stone
I justified your pain, but now I sit alone
I write another letter, I write one every day
I never got a letter back, I write em anyway
I try to call collect, your number has been changed
I'm staring at the light bulb and I start to feel deranged
You never came to visit me, I sit facing the glass
No one's on the other side, now it's in the past
My head is always spinning, I'm pounding on the wall
I feel like I'm forgotten, no sign of you at all
You're probably getting married, you're probably getting fucked
I'll break out of this cage and try to cut that motherfucker up
I curl up in the corner, my body will corrode
My teeth are turning into dust, skin is growing mold
I'm staring at the window of my eternal doom
I know that you are out there, somewhere underneath the moon

I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together

Many, many years, many more to go
Does she still remember? God, he only knows
I now become a savage, they chain me to a wall
I still can see your body, I still can hear your call
I'm nothing but a maggot, I'm locked away and lost
The world, it doesn't want me, my dignity is tossed
And to the girl for whom I feel this doom
Look here, fuck you and the moon
Hey! Fuck you and the moon
Hey! Fuck you and the moon
Hey! Fuck you and the moon
Hey! Fuck you and the moon
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon (Fuck you and the moon)
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed (Hey!)
We'll always be together (Fuck you and the moon)
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed (Hey!)
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon (Fuck you and the moon)
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed (Oh)
We'll always be together (Fuck you and the moon)
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed (I'm still here)
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon (under the moon)
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed (I'm still here)
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon (under the moon)
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed (I'm still here)

Echo Side,The Amazing Jeckel Brothers,1999,"(Chanting)
(1st Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), , {Jamie Maddrox})
Imagine a place that exists beyond, a place that's seldom seen
{There was a soul named Damien, he was nothing heaven would save}
(Even in the Afterlife, things don't always go as planned)
{Damien earned his spot in hell right until his dying day}
So the wagons took his sorry soul and taunted him all the way
(But Damien had escaped through the back door of Satan's lair)
His hell is just a tomb, resting in the Echo Side
(Chanting x2)
Underneath the shadows on the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
Take me to the ghetto land don't bury me in black
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back
(2nd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), , {Jamie Maddrox})
Damien ran as far as he could before his legs began decaying
(A wicked man with a long black toungue saw Damien's legs were dead)
So he laid on top of Damien, and then licked the back of his neck and said...

Save me from the darkest corner
Save me from the darkest corner
Save me from the darkest corner
Save me from the darkest corner
(Chanting x2)
Underneath the shadows on the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
Take me to the ghetto land don't bury me in black
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back

Save me from the darkest corner
Save me from the darkest corner
Save me from the darkest corner
Save me from the darkest corner
(3rd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), , {Jamie Maddrox})
{Damien called for many hours, in puddles of blood he lay}
Tortured by everything he saw, yet wishing along the way
{Still trying not to look back, as if something else were in store}
(The clouds above were dark and hot yet dripping with blood rain)
{As Damien laid in Echo Side, Hell's screams could still be heard}
The blood red sky would flicker with the tourturing that occured
(Thinking that he had escaped, every scream he heard he laughed)
The headless children pointed and urinated in his path
These red gates were the front doors of hell...he never knew it. heh heh
(Chanting)
Underneath the shadows of the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
You can take me to the ghetto land move everything and back
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back (repeat till end)",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-echo-side-lyrics

Straight folks in the south won't have it
They put a round in your racist ass quick
The cool in the south team up with the north
And blow that bigot off his fucking horse

Please Don’t Hate Me,Bizaar,2000,"I gotta tell him..
I gotta be a man and handle my business..
I know he's gonna hate me..
Ahhh I gotta call him

What up dogg?
What you been up to?
Oh yeah well that's cool, check it out
Me and you we been down for while, right?
We been here and there we been pretty tight
Something happened last night that you might get upset about
But hear me out
I didn't mean nothing by it, I'mma make this quick
I gave your mama this dick
I don't know how it happened
I just know my nuts and her itch were slapping
I was over there mowing the grass
And I could feel her eyes all up on my ass
And then, I went inside to make a phone call
And there she was with her titty hanging out her bra
One thing just led to another
Next thing you know, I'm butt-fucking your mother

Please don't hate me, but I've been fucking your mom loose lately
Please don't hate me, relax I never said I loved the ho
Please don't hate me, but I've been fucking your mom loose lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trusted a Juggalo

Don't hang up, I still got more
Your momma gives head like a heroin whore
I wasn't thinking about how you was my bud
When she spreaded my butt cheeks and went for the Milk Dud
We broke out with your with grandpa's gin
Got drunk, I fucked her with a bowling pin
She's freaky
Her nipples look like peanuts
Your mama's one of my favorite sluts
She likes licking from the back of my balls
To the tip of my dick with one big lick
She calls me her big teddy bear
Roooaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
I chase her around on my underwear
I'll admit I like spanking her butt
I used your sock though to catch my nut
Don't worry
I put it back, I knew you better
That's probably why your toes been sticking together

Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your ma dukes lately
Please don't hate me, relax I never said I loved the ho
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your ma dukes lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trusted a Juggalo

Your mom's ass look like oat meal yo
It's bumpy and grainy, I like to feel though
And I ain't trying to diss her either
I'm only saying that I'd wish she'd trim her beaver some
Every hair is like a foot long
Bitch looks like a werewolf wearing a thong sometimes
It's all right with me though
I don't mind as long as I can locate the V-Hole
And your dad's so dumb he's knowing nothing
Here I'm stuffing her muffin not to mention the pickle puffing
And I'm hoping you and me are still cool
I'm spending the night so she can drive me to school tomorrow
And we plan on fucking again
All right I'll talk to you later
Peace, Eminem

Somebody just got fucked up

This kid Freddy is just as good as any other kid in the world right now
What can a kid do?
Plenty (Plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty)

So we're gonna build a wall, to keep the aliens out, huh?
The fuckin' long way home's the safer route, huh?
The kids are dyin', starvin' from the drought
They found a dead girl with her brains dug out, huh?
They executed the wrong man the other day (Again)
They checked his DNA after, it wasn't him
Another nuclear disaster mass toll, haha
Some asshole dropped his wrench off the scaffold
Not all the little kid’s body was in the grave
Her head was missin', later found in a microwave
The world's a giant battle royale of turmoil
Pillages on each other's villages and burning oil

The heat increases, the brain bakes
How much more pressure can it take?
I'm shakin', how much weight 'til it gives way and breaks?

What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

So a bullshit hooker ass-kickin', coke-sniffin' joke graduates
To throat-slittin' and committin' rapes
It escalates but they catch him 'til he escapes
He takes the bracelets off, slips 'em and breaks
Half the country are closet racists
Disgraces hidin' their demon faces
Concealin' their horns and pitchforks
Satanic bitch whores and devil dorks
The government tells you, ""Milk is good for the bones""
When all it really gives you is bones
It don't make 'em hard, it makes 'em soft
Just cut out the middle man and blow my head off

The heat increases, the brain bakes
How much more pressure can it take?
I'm shakin', how much weight 'til it gives way and breaks?

You just paid for Viagra, the preacher's boner
And he didn’t buy it for his sweet wife Judy, nah
He rather some of that little boy booty (Ha-ha)
So they can install a breathalyzer in your car
And they can have drunks up the streets tomorrow
They can have health care and cure cancer and AIDS
But fuck that shit, every one of them pays
The prisons are too crowded, huh? Fresh
Butt rapist out in two months or less, huh
And if he's on his best behavior like he oughta
He's out even quicker to slaughter your daughter

Night of the Chainsaw,The Mighty Death Pop!,2012,"PCP, meth, mad anti-depression pills
Everything spills into one pot
On top of that I smoke rock
I hear that shit, but I won’t stop
Last time on the spot choked a cop
Stopped and had a Faygo soda pop
In the back of my truck, Chuck the chainsaw
Usually chop wood, but that ain’t all
It’s a bit strange all up in your mid-range
Cut a hole in your head ‘till I hit brains
Left a cop in the pile while maybe
It’s the night of the chainsaw baby

Cut ‘em up Chuck (somebody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (get bloody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (go nutty)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up (go)
Cut 'em up
You, can’t, calm me down x4

Petroleum, inhale it, and take a swig
Heat my brains up, bake my wig
Killing time, with no shirt homie
I love it when the blood squirt on me
Walked up to a house, jabbed the door
And kicked it in, my victim hid
Stuck Chuck in the closet
And I can tell by the deposit, I got my target
French poodle, stomp it limp noodle
Rev Chuck up and stir the strudel
Guts on the lawn, fuck’s going on?
Chainsaw Chuck ‘till the break of dawn


Bloody feet, no shoes, into a party
I wasn’t invited, but that bitch ignited
I screamed and laughed, chopping fools in half
I stab and hack, a mad lumberjack
Smell that fuel, hear the machine
Chucks a demon, I must be dreamin'
Bloody showers, feel the power
We devour you fuckin' cowards
A loony loose, Chuck full of juice
Beggin’s no use, I knows no truce
It’s yo noose about to see your own produce

Yo J, kick some of that shit about the Wizard and all that
Drop a psycho beat and go on and rap, bald-headed fuck

Aw shit homeboy, you should've seen me
I was flipped at the party, drank a fifth of MD
Straight passed out on this mother's bed
Seven cans of brew going through my head
Dreaming, I was sipping on Faygo
In my dope house and here comes a tornado
Huh, I can't run nowhere
Cause the whole damn house was spinnin' through the air (""Damn""!)
And don't laugh just yet
(""Your ass landed in motherfuckin' Oz"") Bet
And here comes a three and a half foot pimp
With a blue zoot suit and a mack daddy limp
Yo, I got a grip on my weapon
Cause this midget motherfucker and his boys are stepping
""Oh my, look at the witch!""
""You crushed and killed that wicked old bitch""
And they're saying that I'm doomed
Cause I killed some ho that rides on a broom
Fuck this, I'm going back to where I stay
And I'm walking down the yellow brick alleyway

(We're off to see the Wizard)
(Sing it high, sing it low)
(We're off to see the Wizard)
Droppin' motherfuckers all the way to Delray (Yeah)
Droppin' motherfuckers all the way to Delray

""Well, go on motherfucker!""

2 Dope

Now I'm roaming just like a base-head
Everybody know just where the alley led
And don't say you don't know, which way to go
Yo, there goes the Scarecrow
I ain't playing this bullshit no more
So I whip out the 
nickel plated double-four
Best tell my ass how to get back
Or I'm going to blow the straw out your fucking head
""You wanna see the wizard?""
 Fuck yeah, I do
""Get me off this pole and I'll come with you.""
You know the Wiz? 
""Yeah, I used to roll for him
Then he ganked me out a G, now I got a bullet for him""
Now me and the crow was walking on bricks
Spitting and cussing and holding our dicks
Thinking, damn, this ain't how the movie go
I ain't seen one motherfucking rainbow
Ain't a fresh pair of kicks in the land
Just what you thought 
""There goes the Tin Man""
How to get to the wizard? 
""What the fuck?""
""I ain't saying shit 'til you oil me up.""
I don't see any motherfucking oil, bro
""Oil me up with a forty of 
Red Bull
""
 (Heh)
Just like the book said
Tin Man was stumbling like a crackhead
Old-ass rusted out metal
But we was on our way to see the Wizard of the Ghetto

(Somewhere over the rainbow)
Fuck up, bitch! *gunshots*
Damn, this ain't Kansas, ho!
This is the Southwest motherfucking Ghetto Zone, bitch! (Word)
So pick your skank ass up and you and Toto get the fuck on!
[Verse 3: Violent J and 
Kid Villain
]
Yeah, we've come a long way
(Droppin' motherfuckers all the way to Delray)
And I'm a wonderland story book tourist
Gripping that .44 we coming up to the forest
Anything could be out there
Lions, tigers, and maybe a bear
(Hoods and hoodlums and thieves, oh my)
(Hoods and hoodlums and thieves, oh my)
(Hoods and hoodlums and thieves, oh my)
I'm a kick somebody in they fucking eye
Don't fuck with me at a time like this
I'll send out a bullet, guaranteed won't miss
So I just move and the hooks are flying
""Then come and buck with the fucking Lion!""
""I want rings, chains, any kind of gold.""
Or what? 
""Or I'mma let this 9 unfold!""
Man, fuck this, come back to Delray
There you can rob motherfuckers every day
Crackheads, hoes, whatever you can name
Catch all the rich ones coming out the ball game
""Yeah""
 So finally we was at the castle
And with the guards, we got no hassle
They all just got the fuck out our way
I guess even in Oz they know of Violent J

(Sing it high, sing it low)
(We're off to see the Wizard)
Droppin' motherfuckers all the way to Delray (Fuck a Wizard)
Droppin' motherfuckers all the way to Delray

Yo, where's the motherfucking wizard stay?
""Who wants to know?"" Violent-Psychopath-J
I wanna word with him at gun point
Cause there's no place like Detroit
""Welcome to the Wizard's kingdom""
""The Wizard of the Ghetto as you say""
""Welcome to the Wizard's kingdom""
""Sorry motherfucker, this is where you'll stay""
""Scarecrow, you ain't shit to me""
""And the Lion ain't shit but a snack for three""
""Tin Man, don't take me for a sucker""
""I'll chew your ass up and spit bullets out, motherfucker""
*gunshots* We let it rain
79 slugs to his motherfucking brain
Then I stepped back cool and calm
Because the Tin Man was dropping 
cluster bombs
Everybody know about car jacking
So me and the fellas went home mackin'
Jumped in his smooth-ass ride
Drop top Geo says ""Wiz"" on the side
Gripped it back to the hood where we came from
And that shit was fun
Next thing I knew I was back at the party
Got up and was finnin' to tell everybody
But then I just let it pass
Cause I know they'll laugh at my drunk ass

(Heh heh)
(Bull shit!)
(Fuck you, man, I ain't lyin'!)

Found,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"“I- I prayed… I don’t know what I really prayed. I- I didn’t know a lot about any of that I was more focusing on… The… personal connection was me, it was just so beautiful and it was… it was really emotional; my tears were like a joy of peace if felt like this big, huge load that lifted off my shoulders like a wave. And I was real happy, I was crying but I was crying because I was so happy.”

I believe there’s magic in pyramids
Stonehenge, crop circles and black eyed kids
Ghosts? I’ve seen about 10 myself
You could attribute it all to my mental health
But I don’t want to fear death and I don’t want to fear hell
I want to sleep at night, knowing my soul is well
I’m not an Atheist, I believe in the magic
This career I believe God let me have it
I found my missing link and I’m shining
Others still trying the hill they climbing
I know my soul is content and free
How can I have worry when I hold the key?
How could I not see the planets glow?
Wild life grows and rivers flow
Whatever was missing before, it ain’t missing now
And it hit me like POW!

All of my life
I’ve been searching for the light
I’m out of the night I’m out of the dark
I’m into the light far from where we are
I’m finally found
(I came out of the dark now I'm into the light)
I'll be alright
(I came out of the dark now I'm into the light)
I'll be just fine

I slipped right up out of that quick sand
Knocked out a dragon with my quick hand
I found my link and I damn sure locked it in
It ain’t ever getting dropped again
So lift that darkness off my eyes
So much color burst through the skies
86 shades and a purple sunrise
I’m safe kid I tell no lies
Night ain’t scary when you don’t fear death
And you can’t suffocate when you don’t need breath
I’m chilling so hard the fire can’t fade me
Cause I’m good with the one who made me
I never not want to be good with God
And let the devil come and pull your card
Everything that was missing it ain’t missing now
And it hit me like POW!


“And I can tell you one thing. There was a peace that came over me like I had never known. I had searched for that peace, I had searched for it in bottles, alcohol, I searched for it in needles, I searched for it in drugs, I searched for with women, I searched for it in all types of places but there was no peace in my life. But once I accepted my savior I was no longer afraid. ”",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-found-lyrics

This is true, don't question me
I'll even send you shit for free
It's only ten bucks for the call
And I'll send a prayer, no charge at all
Put your lips up to the screen
Close your eyelids and intervene
Your lips to mine, now send the cash
And while you're there, you can kiss my ass
Take your paycheck and send me half
And I'll send you God's autograph
I'll get Allah's and Buddha's too
Even Zeus, I don't give a fuck who
Just send me that money
""Would you like to be healed, little Jonathan? (yes, Reverend)
You see brothers and sisters, this...(beep-beep beep-beep)
Excuse me. I told you never to page me on a sermon day. Yes?
Uh-huh. Hallalujah. Outty. People, that was the lord, today only
He will heal this boy, for just five thousand dollars!""
Pass the collection plate (show-show me how you give)
Pass the collection plate (g-give-give, how to live)
Pass the collection plate (show-show-show me how you give)
Pass the collection plate (show me how you give, I'll tell you how to live)

Your total's twenty-two eleven
For your set of keys to heaven
Make the checks out in my name
Me or God, it's all the same
Bring your crippled ass to me
Pay my usher the holy fee
I'll bless your legs and bless your chair
Then wheel your bitch-ass outta here
Now a special ceremony
This part don't cost any money
Drip a drop of blessed water
Now I fertilize your daughter
Even though I fucked a hooker
Took your baby girl and shook her
You still buy everything I sell
And I'm living well
See you in Hell!
""Four-thousand, eight-hundred, nine-hundred, five thousand
Hallalujah, you did it brothers and sisters. Are you ready, Jonathan?
(yes, Reverend) Lord Almighty, we've met your price, give me the
Healing power, I can feel it, Lord! Roomy loomy lama noma noomy!
This boy is healed. (really?) Now to the naked eye, it would appear
That this boy has not been healed, but I can assure you, this boy's
Spirit has been healed. Inside this tangled, mangled frame is a healed
Little boy. His spirit is healed, Hallalujah!""",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-hellalujah-lyrics

Night of Red Rum,Fearless Fred Fury,2019,"Rat-a-tat, tick tock, red rum, my dick bled some (Oh)
Flip sipped the blood spat with his red rat tongue
Then I opened the door (Yeah?), scopin' the whore (Yeah?)
Took a pen, popped it in her titty, hoping it pours
I laughed hard, yanked it out, and she was too stunned to speak (I'll bet)
I autographed the bloody titty, she punched my cheek
I split quick, but baby still chasing me, hurtin'
Titties bobbing in her face and the stab hole's squirtin'
Hurdled over a tombstone, but she couldn't clear it
She like a wounded parrot and here come a carrot
A big rock, she begged me to stop, I said sure
And spread her head into slop like it dropped from top floor
Wiping blood on my face 'cause I'm a red rummer
My eyes spit flames my heart pounds like thunder
Snuff out the sun and let the dark swell come (Yes)
The night of red rum has begun, we having dead fun

Tweedle dee and tweedle dum

Fuck, that had to be some good potent shit, homie
You were fucked up
Any left?

Rockin' a bloody hoodie, bloody skully, bloody kicks, and jeans
Bloody face, bloody fists, 'til I licks 'em clean
Walkin' down Grand River, where the chicks are seen
This little ho, I suppose, is only 16
Turn your dick green, make it spit steam, keep your shit clean
Get cream and a hip shot, hooker chick thought
I'm all bloody, could I be the Southwest Strangla?
Baby, I'm a painter and my van's parked on Chamers
How much to fuck a nut off in your butthole?
Haha, really though, what's the ticket on that dirty pussyhole?
""Twenty-five a BJ, fifty for a fuck,"" hit me
You in luck, slut, come with me to my truck
But I chucked her in the dumpster, punched her, stomped her
Puncture, ice pick, thirty time monster
Camel Clutch
, bent the bitch all the way back
Until the slut snapped, the back of her head tucked in her buttcrack

There's slimy black snakes slither in and out of my ears, it's chop time
I'm blood-soaked but fine 'cause ain't a drop mine
Like magic, my rock will transform your head
From a fat solid mass to a splash of red
I killed a cop, a jogger, and I think a neighborhood dog
They search for me, closin' in, I laugh in the fog
I'm 
Mr. Happy
, psychotic and crazy
If I could, I'd squeeze your neck and pop your head off, daisies
Found a thick liquor bottle, snuck into a titty bar
The bouncer had his back turned, I hit him hard
It shattered, he turned around like ain't nothin' happen
And then dropped, delayed reaction, haha, I stabbed him
Jumped on stage, the whore thought it was a joke and popped her ass at me
With a piece of glass I cut her throat and heard a loud pop
And then my head rocked
Behind me, brain slop
Hit the mirror, bartender's dead shot
Head shot, on spot, never saw the red dot
Everywhere spread hair and skull chips, head slop
Said the head cop (Fuck 'em), the shit was red hot
And props for that cock who shot the lead and never said stop

You can roll her up, and bounce her off the wall
We played ball, shoot hoops, she can hold steady
Then I stick my dick down in the fat patty
Just cuz no one calls your home
Don't mean that you're all alone
Just call Super Balls to the rescue
Now here's what I'm a do
I might stick my big toe in your butthole
And then tickle your neden with my other toes
Ugly bitches in need, I crash through their walls

Oh shit, yo, check it out, man
ICP back in the haugh, man
Violent J, man! 2 Dope, man!
Wicked clowns, man! Fuck off, man!

Hey, quick, hurry up, bang
Open your mouth, 'cause here comes my wang
I'm Violent J, the Southwest schizo
Born in a big top, magical majesto
Dead body disco, rapping to the hoochies
Dirty old fat hoes come up with a smoochie
Oochie coochie la la la la
I might pull your tongue out your mouth and try to hang ya
It's a full moon, and the riddles are calling
Three more cards and the skies will be falling
But don't take it from me, I'm just a clown
Wicked clown, wicked town, jugga-lugga-loco
Lick it down and up 'til my nuts start singing
Dancing, hopping, I'ma keep bringing
Riddles and tricks and dead body chicks
With the swing of my magical wand
The show must go on!

""Well it all began when I was very young
Our village was so excited about the carnival's arrival
Everyone was jolly and cheery
I waited for their wagons until well after dusk
That night, while I was sleeping
I was awoken by a cold, eerie wind
Looking out, I saw strange men, cursing and filthy
And there were clowns setting up the dreary tent""

I'm 2 Dope, and I sport tight Wranglers
Don't say a word or I'll kick ya in the neck, bitch
Everybody round make way for the clown
Been to New York and L.A., I'm Southwest down (Baby)
Walked into El Rey's almost got my ass kicked
Rather just chill in the yard in my casket
Call up the hoes, have 'em swing by the tomb
And get a little sticky stank up in this bitch (Oh yeah?)
Killer clowns kicked out the circus
Used to get live, let the midget lady work this
I was a freak show, they called me the Pogo
I could make my ballsack bob like a yo-yo
(Give it up, give it up) Southwest looney tune
Killed another redneck, found his head in Bonnie Doone
Doony Boon, toony goon, I can hear the loons
In my head as I sing my wicked song
The show must go on!

""I've never been afraid of clowns
But these clowns were different
There was nothing funny about these clowns at all
They smiled, they juggled, they laughed
Yet something was terribly, terribly wrong
I didn't like these clowns, for I could see through them
I knew what they were really like
I knew that this carnival that had come to my village
Was an evil, evil thing""

Come see the show, big top show
Walk hand in hand with the dead carnival
Dead dirty carnies, dead juggalos
Walk hand in hand with the dead carnival

You ask do we gangbang, do we bang in a gang, man
Do we bang bang, I'm a gangbanger, man
I bang in a gang, man, you can suck my wang, man
Richie boy, bitchy boy, it's a Southwest thang
Serial murderer, Southwest maniac
Slaughterer, lunatic, high school braniac
Straight-A school boy, school kid
'Til I went to school and tried to murder everyone
The show must go on!

""My neighbors and friends were fools, all of them
Totally unaware of the evilness within the clowns
Their eyes reflected stairways into Hell
Their faces painted with blood
I ran from the carnival grounds
And yet every road and every path
Led me right back to the big tent
I had no escape from the strong men
The freak shows, and the Ringmaster""

Come see the show, big top show
Walk hand in hand with the dead carnival
Dead dirty carnies, dead juggalos
Walk hand in hand with the dead carnival
Come see the show, big top show

Guess who's coming to your big town
Juggling jesters, kick it clown
Circus sound, painted frown
Carnival of Carnage creeping round
I'm Violent J and I'm sick
They try to run me down
But you know I'm too slick
And I slip and slide like a Slinky
Slip and slide with my Twinkie
Welcome to my world as it winds and it twists
I'mma kick a funky little rhyme that you missed
Boo-loo-chewy-woowie-doo-boo
And you'd be fucked up if that was really Voodoo
Come see the wonder, the show of your life
See me breathe fire and swallow a knife, right
I ain't swallowing nothing, Jack
But I can juggalo like you never thought you'd ever know
And we packing that funk
With a snap and a clap, and a jump, jump
So chicky chicky freak if you want to be down
Step on up and kiss the clown
And kiss the clown
Kiss the clown
On up, kiss the clown
Step on up and kiss the clown

Stop the bus, Violent J comes out
Barrels to your face, and blow your fucking face off
'Cause you know my mind is gone, dead, oh
Happen to catch me a Beverly show
Body fell asleep but my mind goes on
Welcome to the world of the Juggla's dome
First day I enrolled in the high school
Butt naked with a axe
(""Wow, he's so cool!"")
(""Stand up and say your name, tell us about yourself."")
My name's 2 Dope and I cut necks all to Hell
Dylan, Dylan, I'm trying to find Dylan
I'm finna cut his throat with a carnie, carnie killin'
Rich boy never seen a ghetto joker-o
Slap you in the head with a sledgehamm-o
Sorry Dylan didn't mean to knock ya
Then I stuffed his dead body in my locker
To the next class don't want to be late
Finna ask Brenda on a little date
I heard this bitch likes to fight in clubs
Took her to a mud match, threw her pair of gloves
Watched her get her ass beat by a fat dyke
And left the muddy ass bitch there for the night
Woke her in the morning, threw her in the trunk
Threw her in the trunk 'cause the dumb bitch stunk
How you doing Brenda, mind if I bend ya
Over, rover (""Do me like Bundy."")
I'm sure you'd like that, you little skank
And when I finished, I stuffed her fucking head in a fish tank
(Oh, that's a beautiful aquarium)
Yeah, hey you want to see it?
Hey uh, here bitch
(Oh wow it's lovely)
Yeah, yeah, yeah have a closer look
Hey, die bitch what's up
What are you a lung fish?
W-what's up Aquaman?
Die bitch, die
That's right, bitch
Back to the school, fat bitch in the locker
Couldn't fit her booty in, so I cut her booty off
Sometimes I feel like I'm already in Hell
Throwing up chokin' on Delray's smell
Fuck those fucking fucks up
Rich fucks, man, fuck those fucks
Beverly Hills is Beverly Kills
I'm gonna bring ghetto carnival thrills
Where's that other little rich little fag?
Looking for Brandon cause we can't stand him
I know my ottehg like boys like the bass go boom
But shh, you can hear him jacking off in the boys room
(Ugh, ugh Dylan
Ugh I want your anus
Ugh, you're so hot)
Kicked in the stall, then I kicked in his jaw
Kicked him in face, and I kicked in his balls
Punk tried to run but he couldn't, tried to wobble
Bust him in the head with a empty Faygo bottle
Took him to the staircase, jumped on his face
Rode him down the bumpy chase
Can I hear him breathe one last note
Stuffed his back down his throat
Back to the locker, boy, oh boy, oh
Back to the locker. Stuff the fuck in!
Back to the locker, boy, oh boy, oh
Back to the- Fucking stuff the fuck in!
Walking down the hall and I'm feeling like the shit
'Cause all that's left is one skank ass bitch

Funk down your legs, and up through your belly
But I'm with Delray, so funk don't fade me

You're getting ready to die anyway (No, please)
Bitch, calm down (Nuh uh)

Naw, Kelly Found Dead In Her Dad's Room

Smashed up bodies chilling in my locker
Kelly wouldn't fit, chop, chop, chop, chop her
Oh no, Principal know what I'm about
'Cause one of Dylan's sideburns was sticking out
Oh shit, they chase me 'cause they found the bodies
Now I run my ass off
Yeah they're getting mad, you can hear them cuss
Didn't look both ways, and got hit by a bus
Crunched up under, tangled in the wheels
Spit me out the muffler, you know how that feels
Lost both my legs so I'm running on my hands
Then I seen Prince so I clapped 'cause I'm a big fan
And straight busted my face on the street
And here come the police

AND THEN STRANGLE 'EM IN THE BACK SEAT! (""He-he-he!"")
Cause if you know, the Shaggs ain't soft

Halloween on Military Street,"Forgotten Freshness, Vols. 1 & 2",1996,"(Brother Theodore - Spoken Word)
We measure things by what we are
To the maggots in the cheese, the cheese is the universe
To the worms in the corpse, the corpse is the cosmos
How then can we be so cock-sure about our world?
Just because of our telescopes, microscopes and the splitting of the atom?
Certainly not
Science is but an organized system of ignorance
There are more things in Heaven and on Earth that are dreamt of in your philosophy
What do we know about the beyond?
Do we know whats behind the beyond?
I'm afraid some of us hardly know whats beyond the behind
(Chorus)
Fuck! Damnit! Another Halloween
People on Military know what this means
Houses on fire, they're blowin up cars
Creatures in the streets, and razor blades in candy bars
I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block
Spit in my face and gave my a rock
I tried to give it back and said ""I'll take nothing instead""
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head
Walked to the next house directly next door
There I saw an old lady dead on the floor
I said ""Excuse me miss, but do you have a treat?""
She lifted her leg and scraped flakes off her dead feet
I ran to the next house happy and giddy
And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty
I said, ""Trick-or-treat."" she sad ""Treat-or-trick.""
And squeezed on her titty until it... fuck it, it's too sick
Next house up was sittin back in the woods
I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back
And then I heard ""COME IN"" and yo I'm like FUCK THAT
This house belongs to Miss Cherry Spoon
She said  ""Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon""
I quickly grew a stiffy, but kept my eyes shut
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts
I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst
And chillin in the drive was a long black hearse
I rang the door bell and said ""Is anybody home?""
""Of course little boy have a sugar-coated kidney stone""
I walked through the field, and to the next crib
It's friendly Mrs. Wetherbee in her cooking bib
I said ""How bout some candy."" she said ""How bout instead
A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread?""
My bag's gettin heavy so I rest on the curb
And riding on his bike here comes little Larry Sherb
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat
I punched him in the neck, and powerbombed him in the street
Now my bag of candy has doubled in size
Up to the next house for my scary prize
I'm like trick-or-treat, trick treat tricky dick
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit
Rock through his window and ran across the street
To the big mansion I'm in for a treat
I dinged on the dong, and here comes the butler
A big gumpy tall-ass Lurch lookin motherfucker
I said ""Hello Mr. is there somethin for my sack?""
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back
It's taking him an hour, my bag is open ready
But then he finally dropped it in my sack, a fucking penny
The next house is abandoned so forget it
But wait a minute, I think somebody's livin in it
I ran up to the door ""Trick-or-treat, you can't hide""
It was a crackhead, he crawled in my bag and died
The next house is mine the last on the block
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her Glock
I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady
And we yelled ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE!""
To the whole city

Bugz On My Nutz,The Old Shit,1994,"Well, I don't understand the phenomenon
We fuckin' these hoes that look like spa-la-la-la!
Rich boys think that it's shitty
But I like fuckin' crack heads with one titty (Yeah!)
And I do it at the drop of a dime
And now I get the scabies almost every time (Every time!)
So let's talk about my nut sack
I don't front, Jack, I got bugs on my bozack

Well, I'm Violent J and I ain't no bitch
I'm always quick to tell you when my nuts itch (Ooh!)
Cause bitch, if I'm itchin' when I come home
Drop a brick in a sock, swing it on your dome
You didn't think nothin' of it, just lemme stick it!
Probly shoulda known, cuz I thought I heard crickets
In your neden
But I wasn't sayin' nuttin' though
I wasn't sayin' nuttin' till I'm done nuttin' ho!
And now I'm like, ""Bitch how can this be?""
Tryna sleep on my nuts while I'm watchin' TV!
And I try and walk to the sto' and get a 40
How'd these bugs get on me?

Somebody asked me how I got scabies
Prolly that homeless fat, redneck, bag lady
That I fucked in the shed
Then the little critters on my ding-a-ling said:

Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
We'll itch, and scratch, and bite yo' nuts
Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts
Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
We'll itch, and scratch, and bite yo' nuts
Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts
Spurs on my boots and I don't give a hoot, cause I got me a pretty woman's love!

I met this bitch and went up in it
Dropped her off, went to the clinic

Bitch, I got bizugs on my siznac
So tell me, what's up with that? (Ho!)
Shoulda said some'n 'bout your bug problem
Now I'm gonna have to sock you in your mouth bitch!
Can't keep my mo' fuckin' hands out my drawers
(Stick a roach motel up under your balls)
Nah, I'd rather stick 'em in a deep fryer
And sizzle those motherfuckers off my wang

So you wanna fuck around, always gotta buck around?
Lift up ya ding-a-ling, nuttin' but a bug ya found (Woah!)
Now they call 'ya funky nuts cause ya like funky butts
Scratchin' and bitin' 'em, now they call you monkey nuts
But, I ain't sayin' nuttin', cause 'ya ain't playin' nuttin'
Bring the track back and I get back to the nut sack track

Gotta try to rap cause the bugs is bitin'
But I ain't goin' out like a bitch, yo, fuck that!
Stick 'em in a blender and hit the switch! (NO!)
Then I hit the bitch!

Met this bum in the back of a dumpster
Fucked her in her rumpster, juggalugga humpster!
Had to take a piss, so I pulled out my wang
Then I heard my ding-a-ling sing:

Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
We'll itch, and scratch, and bite yo' nuts
Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts
Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
We'll itch, and scratch, and bite yo' nuts
Yo' nuts, we want yo' nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts

Hey, check this out, man!
I can remember back in school
Back in elementary school
Yeah, shit used to be cool then
You know what I'm sayin'?
Cause it was all about shootin' dice
And playin' dodge ball and shit, ya know?
But then somethin' happened, man
Everybody grew up
And now ain't nothin' the same!
Like this one punk motherfucker
The same motherfucker I was tradin' G.I. Joe's with
And playin' kickball
Is gonna run up on me and throw a gang sign, talkin' about
He's gettin' ready to fly my head and shit!
Well, fuck you!
Ya know?
Cause ya still the same fake-ass bitch you always was
So don't come up on me with that shit cause I know you too well
You still the same guy that me
And my six Jello-eatin' motherfucker you always was
Oh yeah, and a couple years ago
I fucked your sister at your birthday party!
So don't come up on me cause I know you too well
Bitch boooy!
Yeah, motherfuckin' bitch boooy!

The Juggla,Carnival of Carnage,1991,"Well, you know the Juggla jumped in the mix
I've been down the road and I've broke a few necks
And I'll break a few more, so what's up?
Roll by me on the corner I'ma hold my nuts up
And spit a fuck you with that (With that)
But if you're a sewer skank lemme hit that (Hit that)
Cause Violent J ain't even one to fake it
I done seen some folded up skank bitches naked
I pass out when it gets dark
And woke up naked at the 
Clark Park
Gotta go, gotta get before I get the rap
Got a 
chopped off head
 chillin' in my lap
Mr. Shrink, Mr. Shrink, I'm sick (I'm sick)
Lunatic tick, tock, it don't quit
It don't quit, it don't quit
Mr. Shrink I'm sick, a lunatic-y-tic
The doctor told me I'm a psycho
So I ate his face like I don't know
Knife to the neck and I got some mo'
The night of the axe
, 
the night of the .44
Bitch, I'm a man you can talk ta'
But after you leave I'ma stalk ya
If you're a little kid I'ma take ya
And if you're a neck I'ma break ya
If you're an old lady I'ma mug ya
Cause bitch, you can't fuck with The Juggla

Yes ladies and gentleman, he is: The Juggla
He'll cut your windpipe, eat your face
And slit your motherfuckin' heart out
You can see this freak show at the world famous Carnival of Carnage
Keep jugglin', motherfucka'

Cause you know the Juggla will throw ya up fast
And if I drop you, that's your ass
I shake and twist tryna keep calm
I might go to Hell 'cause I'm down with Esham
Got a rhyme for your uncle Willy
Then I hit him in the head with a billy
Willy, Willy, watch your mouth
And fuck the South
Runnin' with a gang of 20 street hoods, yo
What's up bitch ah, what's up ho?
Sometimes ya act like ya ain't down
With a psychotic wicked clown
Fuckin' my friends ain't healthy
Cause I grab you by the face and fuck you up
And it's like that bitch, that's the way it is
I'm allowed to fuck ho, I'm in Showbiz
Sets in the hood want me for dead
So I paint my tag on they forehead
Stick your little ""K"" by my taggin'
You can fit 20 clowns in a Volkswagen
And we comin' straight to your brick house
I'ma huff and puff and blow your fuckin' neck loose
And then I might mug ya
Cause there'll be no fuckin' with The Juggla

Jugglin' eyeballs, jugglin' heads
What you've heard about, what you've read
The jugglin' wicked clown will come to your birthday party
Wedding and bar mitzvah
And cut your back off for a small fee
The Juggla ain't takin' no shorts from nobody

Tweedle dee and tweedle dum
Let the fuckin' bass go
Tweedle dee and tweedle dum
Let the fuckin' bass go
Tweedle dee and tweedle dum
Let the fuckin' bass go
Tweedle dee and tweedle dum
Let the fuckin' bass go

And The Juggla make it last
Down with 2 Dope and 
John Kickjazz
My fellow fuckin' fellas
Southwest gangsta killas
Violent J the psychopathic
Some might say I'm schizophrenic
Others think I'm klepto-psychic
But somehow the bitches like it
What's up bitch, (Bitch) let me get the shot (The shot)
Right here and now, butt naked on the spot
Why am I like this? (Like that) Why are you like that? (Like this)
The ghetto took my brain and motherfuck I want it back
I'm that nerd in the back of the class
That went psycho and killed ya ass
I slash and cut and hack
With a ""kick me"" sign on my back
In my court-assigned therapy
They take care of me, but don't stare at me
Cause like I said, I'll mug ya
Now run on home and don't fuck with The Juggla

Finally happened, the wicked clown has come to your town
And he's got your daughter by the hand, showin' her a new land
The Southwest Ghetto Zone where all the Jugglas roam
Come one, come all and have The Juggla cut your face off
Skip to the Lou

Steve, what's up man, It's me
Listen, I'm really sorry about today man
I don't know what the hell is wrong with me but I feel like shit
I'm telling you man, my fuckin organs hurt
I don't know what the hell I'm going through
I'm gonna go home, lay down, and try to get some rest man
I hope I can come in tomorrow
Fuck man

I have a headache, my brain feels dead
I got home and sat on my bed
Kicked my shoes off, I see my toes are cracked
I tried to wiggle em and three of em snapped right off
I stood up but now my walk is crooked
I went to piss, nothing came out, I shook it
And pulled it, it snapped right off in my hand
What the fuck is happening? I don't understand
My hair is falling out, my body's sore
I threw up on the bathroom floor
What the hell is that? Looks like a kidney or one of my guts
I'm staring at it when half my vision shuts off
My eye fell out and rolled in the sink
I look in the mirror, the hole is pink
I'm trying to hold myself together, impossible task
My only question, how long will I last?

I, I, I, I, I, I'm falling apart
What's become of me?
I'm falling apart...

I was running down the stairs when my leg gave out
Snapped off at the knee, what's this about?
My fingers are breaking off, one by one
Where's all the blood? I don't see none
I'm hopping on my good leg,  I make it down to the kitchen
My other eye's coming loose, fuckin my vision
I'm thinking about stabbing myself to get it done
Something's in my mouth, I spit out my tongue
I tried to pick a knife up, my fingers are gone
I hopped outside and fell on the lawn
There goes my other leg, my left arm as well
Still throwing up guts, my personal hell
I'm laying on my back, I see the crows above me
My right arm breaks off, what's left of me?
How did this happen? I came undone
A pile of meat, baking under the sun

I, I, I, I, I, I'm falling apart
What's become of me?

Cotton Candy,Tunnel of Love,1996,"My name is Shaggy, but some call me Shaggy Balls
'Cuz you can see my ball sack hangin' out my drawls
I wear short shorts, bitches stop and stare
Later on you see me partin through the cotton hair
I meet a bitch I always gotta check and ask
""How many corn dogs been to the cotton patch?""
And when I fuck bitches that's what I'm tryin' to do
My nuts is people so I try and stuff em in there too
Cotton candy, it wasn't made for the mouth
Don't believe me? Just take a look and head south
Rotten candy is what you'll find without a doubt
I stick my wang in the cotton hole and then I'm out
Jump Steady, Rude Boy, and Nate the Mack
They huntin' Cotton and Shaggy Shaggs knows where it's at
So don't be stingy, It's more than one Wicked Clown
And bitch you got enough cotton here to go around
Now some bitches wanna go and shave they cotton off
Straight to the candy, I'm wit it, I won't get lost
That's why I bring the clippers wit me, they comin' in handy
When you fuck around wit the Cotton Candy

(Heeeey, cotton candy!) Yeah, hey hey!
Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in yo mouth, she told me
(Heeeey, cotton candy!) Yeah, hey hey!
Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in yo mouth, she told me

My name is J the kiddies call me genie pants
'Cuz I can play the flute, and make my dick start to dance
Like a snake I make it shake, rattle, and roll
And this year my balls made it to the Cotton Bowl
Unlike Shaggy, he scared of the cotton pie
I ate so much cotton candy I got pink eye
I can remember the first time I had a taste
She pulled her panties down and shoved her cotton in my face
I said ""Your daddy's home"", she said ""So fuckin' what?""
I tried to take my ding-a-ling and stick it in her butt
I tried to push it in, I couldn't turn it out
She said, ""Cotton candy don't get wet until it's in ya mouth!""
Oh shit, so what was I to do?
Run like a bitch, or have the cotton stew?
I thought for a second, then I said ""What the fuck!""
I ate so much cotton that my tongue came out her butt!
Bwbwbwbw, bitch, I'll have another bowl
My boys had to come and get me 'cause I lost control
On the way home I had a new attitude
I'm like ""Hey let's go eat some more pussy dude...""

You'll never guess what's up

My muckin' head blew up

She was lovely, long hair, short, nice booty, though
So at the funeral, it made me cry, I want to die
I cannot lie, I couldn't sleep without a wink
I only think about my lady, I miss my baby
I need her by my side, to hold me, to squeeze me
I still have pictures, but all they do is tease me
I see my therapist, she only tells me I'm in trouble
I want my baby back, so now I pack a shovel
And while I'm digging, it's awfully dark and kind of muddy
Don't dig too fast or too deep, things could get bloody
I watch my digging, I hit the top of baby's coffin
I'm thinking, well, she's better off inside if she died
Nah, she needs me, I can tell my baby wants me
'Cause every night at 2:15, my baby haunts me
I pry it open, the odor hits me, there she is
I lean down to give her a kiss because I need a

Girl that make me happy, a girl that make me cry
A girl that passed away back in 1985
A girl I plan to marry, a girl I plan to wed
A girl that I can choke because my baby is already dead
Cemetery lady, my cemetery girl
Cemetery baby, I want you in my world
Cemetery woman, we can still be down
You're more than just a corpse to a psychopathic clown
Cemetery lady, my cemetery girl
Cemetery baby, I want you in my world
Cemetery woman, we can still be down
You're more than just a corpse to a psychopathic clown

""Fuck yeah, mother fucker!
I don't want no stuck-up little sassy prassy bitch
You know what I'm saying?
I want me a cold stanky bitch
So bring it on, dead momma!""

She's as lovely as always, my baby hasn't changed
Except for the hole that's in her forehead, you can see her brains
Nevertheless, our love is still forever true
Her eyes have withered, her skin has now a tint of blue
My baby's dusty and dirty, and wrinkled clothes
And now I notice, the maggots chewed off all her toes
The earth has been rather cruel to my darling sugar
Is that a bug upon her face? Oh, it's just a booger
I lean her head back to kiss her cracking lips
And then her neck cracks, also does her hips
I must be gentle, my baby girl's a little rusty
A little dusty, but most of all, a little musty
I notice not, we lay together on the lawn
We lay 'til dawn, I notice her left eye is gone
We said goodbye and everything turned out alright
I'll see you again tomorrow night, because I need a

Girl that make me happy, a girl that make me cry
A girl that passed away back in 1985
A girl I plan to marry, a girl I plan to wed
A girl that I can choke because my baby is already dead
Cemetery lady, my cemetery girl

You're more than just a corpse to a psychopathic clown
Cemetery lady, my cemetery girl
Cemetery baby, I want you in my world
Cemetery woman, we can still be down
You're more than just a corpse to a psychopathic clown

Check it out, bitch!
If you ain't getting no stank, stank
Get your asses shoveling
And dig you up a lil' somthin' somthin'
Them clammy graveyard bitches
They down with the clown!

You'll never guess what's up
You'll never guess what's up
You'll never guess what's up
You'll never guess what's up
You'll never guess what's up

Truly Alone,The Wraith: Hell’s Pit,2004,"There ain't nobody, asking me, where I've been
There ain't nobody, that would name me, as a friend
There ain't nobody, that's droppin' by, to say hi
There ain't nobody, that's caring whether I live or die
I have nobody, to tell about, my growing angers
I have nobody, to tell about me, following strangers
There ain't nobody making sure I'm taking all of my pills
There ain't nobody, slowing me down and keeping me still
I'm truly alone

They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (truly alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (I'm so alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (truly alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone

There ain't nobody, telling me, not to jump off
There ain't nobody, telling me not to chop your block off
I get so bloody, I ruin, all of my clothes
I get so bloody, I sit in, the dark alone
I have nobody, to tell about, my dark fantasies
I have nobody, to tell about my dark realities
There ain't nobody, around me, nobody wanna be friends
I get so bloody, all on me, the mess never ends
I'm truly alone

They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (truly alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (I'm so alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (my brain is gone, completely gone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone

I walked into a Super K, and went to the back
I started askin' questions, checkin' out the chainsaw rack
They had a test model, I pulled the cord and got it runnin'
Turned the blade on the kid working and blood started gunnin'
""What the fuck am I doing?"" I dropped the shit and started crying
I made it down two aisles before some hero clotheslined me
I got up, grabbed a shovel and stabbed him in the gut
I pulled it out and hammered it across the back of his nug
I'm hearing sirens going off, it's no blue light specials
I turned murderer, caving in to daily life pressures
But fuck that, now all y'all gonna know me
Seein' me on TV, being like ""Look there go my homie""
I'm more than lonely I'm lost, lives are the cost
I just beat some bitch in the head, stabbed her twice and took off
They can't find me I'm hidin' in the flannel coat rack
I jump out and attack and put a gash in your neck
I finally made to the front door and to the parking lot
That's when I got shot a lot, I got got
Police with bullets and more bullets pluggin' me deep
I'm seeing flashes, hearing screamin' and it's all over me
I see a crowd of people being held behind the police tape
All watching me die, I think I made no mistake
I finally got some recognition, dying on my knees
Ready for Hell because compared to my life it should be an ease..
Like easy..
Cake walk..
I'm ready..",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-truly-alone-lyrics
Fonz Pond,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"Hey, I know where we can go
Where?
Let's go to Fonz Pond
What? No way dude, you know how many kids died there? No way!
I should've known you guys would be a bunch of baby pussies about it. Fuck that, I ain't afraid
You don't even know where it's at
Yes I do
Then where is it, then?

Off Lickity Trail, there's a pond where many a children died
It's a place to run to and disappear, a place where some folks hide
But they will tell you about the rumors that swim around this lake
Some say there's something in the water and that's not no mistake
The fog that rides along the top has been said to carry voices
Those of the dead who took the dare and jumped in, they made bad choices
Some have seen and others heard and they say along the bottom
Are all the bodies of the girls and boys preserved, remaining half-rotten
The water's thick with murky mud, the weeds are red like splattered blood
In this pond a spirit cries, snakes and bugs replaced his eyes
Some don't believe and dare to swim, something under will pull you in
Hidden deep in the wild brush, if you know where it is then hush

We almost there
Don't go near the water!
At Fonz Pond
Don't go near the water!
At Fonz Pond

Off Lickity Trail, there's a pond where many a children perished
The water is black, even in the sunlight, deep and dark, nightmarish
Some believe the bodies surface and bask underneath the moon
Others say they seen a headless boy stumbling around the lagoon
The loons scream all night long, sounds melodic, sings you a song
Missing children, swampy deaths, mysteries are secrets kept
Staring out are snakes and frogs, leeches living off hollow logs
Something's watching from the water, it took the missing sons and daughters

It's over there!
Don't go near the water!
At Fonz Pond
Don't go near the water!
At Fonz Pond

Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me down
Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me down

Many terrifying horror tales emulate from this one place
Several children, young boys and girls disappeared here without a trace
What you believe and what you don't is entirely up to you
But if you go up there and swim alone, you'll know exactly what's true
Something's dragging through the mud, mosquitoes attracted to the blood
They say the dark depths have no bottom, some never came back up and got 'em
Crazy kids come party here, it swallows more souls every year
They jump right in and disappear, best to stay away from up there at Fonz Pond

There it is
Don't go near the water!
At Fonz Pond
Don't go near the water!
At Fonz Pond

Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me down
Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me under, pulling me under
Fight for air!
Something strong is pulling me down

(There it is)
Don't go near the water!
At Fonz Pond
Don't go near the water!

The Tower,The Tempest,2007,"I'm dizzy walkin outta Larry's army wear used
With some black leather shoes and desert BDU's
Many boxes of ammo, I got the camo face paint
I barricaded the tower doors, safe this place ain't
Up to the top, I can see the whole planet it would seem
The sun is beatin on my head as I'm livin my horror dream
Up-chucked a couple times then I finally took aim
A man is chattin on his cell phone, I spattered his brain
A lovely couple started runnin, all the sudden she tripped
He kept right the fuck without her, like he never missed a step
I snapped one to his head, he fell dead to his knees
Then his wife was right there to retrieve the car keys
Not many notice at first, although some do start to scatter
Pluggin iron in they back, who they are it doesn't matter
There's a psychopath, way up in the tower somewhere
And when they think they outta range *gunshot* poofs they hair

And it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
So fuckin hot (shooting from the tower)
(Watch out)
And it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
(Watch out)
So fuckin hot...

I shot the lady in the ass and the kid on the grass
And the daddy on the swing through the lens in his glasses
First cop on the scene will be commended for his services
For now he holds his throat and screams ""I didn't deserve this""
The tower's too high, I'm bringin shots from above
Cuz my head's a battle royale of serpents, snails, and bugs
I'm quadrapolar, though my snipers scope I see the enemy
The world ain't never been my friend and never pretended to be
I fought in two wars, my country left me poor and sick
Leg missin, agent orange and an un-useable dick
So as I reload, my trigger finger's frozen cold
From squeezing so hard my reason is no control
Warped soul, look at that, pap-pap-krack
Three frat college boys flat, dead on they back
And the lady tryin to hide behind the dead fat guy
Just got one plucked in her eye


I'm finally at war again, only I ain't takin orders
200 yards below, I'm taggin targets small as quarters
Marksman, sniper, military precision
Spotlight on the tower, tryin' to nullify my vision
My eyeballs keep rollin in the back of my head
Practicing for any minute when I'm actually dead
They put the tape up, these people think they outta my view
But still, I'm steady pluggin sleepin pills off into them too
I see in strobe light vision and I'm way beyond a panic
My only skill is murder and I'm stuck on automatic
Sweatin profusely, bleedin outta my ears
Their shots are missing by fragments, bullets shavin my hairs
And yet my aim is remarkable, I'm peggin these ducks
One by one, jumpin out of those SWAT team trucks
I see the major activity, I'm causing a chaos
Mad... {gunshot} my life went out with a flash


And it was hot that day, so fuckin hot
It shouldn't get that hot, humid and hot
Beatin down on us, so fuckin hot
Too fuckin hot that day, just too fuckin hot
How can it get that hot, how can it be that hot?
Too hot, too hot, too hot, it was just too fuckin hot",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-the-tower-lyrics

La di da day, di da

Now I've woken, been reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple, push and smother
'Til my fingers touch each other
Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the missus, leave the room
'Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirmy, filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat
I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalpel and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown
Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
'Nother wicked life to grab
Screaming that he thought I died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The steering wheel becomes his meal
This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station 44
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle, watch me dance
In 3D, watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(La di da day, di da) You're gonna die. You're gonna die

Time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Even though, there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wander endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run
Quickly grab him from behind
'Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bob-ba-ling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all of y'all

You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(And I'll be back for all of y'all) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(And I'll be back for all of y'all) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die
(And I'll be back for all y'all) You're gonna die. You're gonna die
You're gonna die. You're gonna die

Bowling Balls,The Wraith: Hell’s Pit,2004,"Friends don't come easily and this I know
And every time I make one they always say they gotta go
I wanna talk with people and look 'em in the face
I wanna take 'em home and they can stay at my place
All the talking I could do, I would never lie to you
We take a quick ride, homicide, then I confide in you
And I can love you and technically even though you're dead
You'll always be around me 'cause I'm keeping your head
I keep heads on shelves everywhere in my cellar
I even the melon of a dead fortune teller
The rotted ones I keep 'em up in fat pickle jars
And the new ones we lay on the lawn and look at the stars
It's illegal, I know, but so is smoking weed
And who the fuck give a fuck when you have a need?
I collect human heads fresh up off the neck
Face, lips, hair, nose, ears, gimme that

Your head would mean so much to me
I won't dis you, you wanna wear a hat? What?
How you want your eyelids, open or shut?
Your head would mean so much to me
Your head would mean so much to me

Sometimes I put 'em in my bowling bag and bring 'em to work
Play with their hair under my desk, with my bare foot
They're like, stuffed animals all over the bed
Human heads: Pam, Jennifer, Hubert and Ted
I even put one in the shower, water comes out the mouth
I kick a few around the yard when I feel like going out
I blow air in the mouth piece and duct tape it shut
Bring 'em in the pool, and the heads will float up
I'm not a sicko, yo, though I've had girlfriends
I even put their makeup on and take 'em for a spin
I'm ain't a murderer like that, not really
Only every Halloween the house do look kind of silly
You know the homeless people that be botherin' you for change?
Almost all of my collection, from them is where they came
I'm not insane about it, it's just the world is too crowded
And maybe I'ma do something a motherfuckin' 'bout it

I need some therapy to help me deal with this shit
Dr. Wigglefarmer, I need to make a visit
He told me heads are normal but I gotta brush their teeth
So now I'm brushing four mouths at a time using my feet
He also told me to keep them from the dog
But I already knew that, she chew their faces off
And then Dr. Wigglefarmer asked me for a couple
I went into my bag and gave him two like ""no trouble""
Now I got some therapy, I'm feeling much better
I'm happy forever, me and my craniums together
They all over the house and they roll around the floor
And if it's got an afro, I use it for a pillow
I'm ill though, I never should've worried anyway
I shoot head hoops and don't care what people say
You can ask Dr. Wigglefarmer for yourself
He's the third head down, top row, third shelf

Your shit sucked then, and sucks now, more hard
You sucked dick your whole career, fuckin' old porn star

Hoo-hoo-hoo, good thing we just a dumb hoax
A dead punk bitch bloody, haha, it's just work

Innocent... folks
Folks...
Innocent... folks
Innocent... folks
Folks...

Innocent folks wrong place at the wrong time
Doing bids or drawn in a chalk line
Little kids crossing the bridge too young
Some tortured before they come, (damn)
Evil is here, the boogie man too
You don't own a gun, man you should plan to
Am I looking at shit negatively
Crib death mom ain't got shit left
How the fuck is shit fair out here
Homeless family froze on the stairs
Where's God? Bumping his iPod?
It's odd, I'll be the lightning rod
I wanna know

Where's God? (we don't know that)
Where's God?
Where's God, when shit goes down? (I wanna know)
Where's God? (we don't know that)
Where's God?
Where's God, when shit goes down? (it ain't right)

Are we all be tested fail me then
So much fucked up shit where to begin
Some kids are born with a silver spoon
Others born with a needle & a world of doom
Little girl found duct taped and raped
And the killer escaped God give me a break
I want to keep believing but it's a struggle
Let Jake and Jack Jeckel juggle
Drunk drivers killing Iraq survivors
He can't interfere, then why's he here?
After years of feeling like nobody cares
Most of us switch gears on him, cheers!


Church on fire, everybody dies
As a preacher explains & I roll my eyes
This game tryin' to make sense of madness
For a ray of hope in a world of sadness
I get it, we all need hope to cope
But collection plate money goes to dope
I cling by a finger & I'll admit it
Most of it is bullshit, & I don't get it
If he was up there chillin', lettin' this happen
Doin' nothin', he'd be in need of a slappin'
But we're all clueless to how it works
There are no experts & that's what hurts


""there's not an individual who's ever confessed Christ, who has not but
One time or another, said the wrong thing, thought the wrong thing, done
The wrong thing, & I don't care how saved you are""

Bugz on My Nugz,The Ringmaster,1994,"Oh
Fuck

Well, I don't understand the phenonemon
We fuckin' these hoes that look like splalalala
Rich boys think that it's shitty
But I like fucking crackheads with one titty (Fuck yeah!)
And I do it at the drop of a dime
And I get the scabies almost every time (Every time!)
So let's talk about my nutsack
I don't front, Jack, I got bugs on my ballzack
Well I'm Violent J, and I ain't no bitch
I'm always quick to tell you when my nuts itch
'Cause, bitch, if I'm itchin' when I come home
Drop a brick in a sock, swing it on your dome
You didn't think nothin' of it, just let me stick it
Probably should of known, 'cause I thought I heard crickets
In your neden, but I wasn't sayin' nuttin' though
I wasn't sayin' nuttin' til I'm done nuttin', ho
And know I'm like, ""Bitch, how can this be?
I'm tryin' to sleep, and my nuts are up watchin' TV
And try to walk to the store and get a 40
How'd these bugs get on me?""
Somebody asked me how I got scabies
Probably that homeless fat redneck bag lady
That I fucked in the shed
Then the little critters on my ding-a-ling said

Your nuts we want your nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Your nuts we want your nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts
Your nuts we want your nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Your nuts we want your nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts

Spurs on my boots and I don't give a hoot, 'cause I got me a pretty woman's love

I met this bitch and went up in it
Dropped her off, went to the clinic
Bitch, I got bizugs on my siznack
So tell me what's up with that (Ho)
Should've said something 'bout your bug problem
Now I'm gonna have to sock you in your mouth, bitch!
Can't keep my motherfucking hands out my drawers
Stick a roach motel up under your balls
Nah, I'd rather stick em in a deep fryer
And sizzle those motherfuckers off my wang
So you wanna fuck around, always gotta buck around
Lift up your ding-a-ling, nothing but a bug ya found (Oh!)
Now they call you funky nuts 'cause you like funky butts
Scratching and biting 'em, then they call you monkey nuts
But I ain't sayin nothin', 'cause you ain't playin nothin'
Bring the track back and I get back to the nutsack track
Better try to rap 'cause the bugs is biting'
But I ain't going out like a bitch, yo, fuck that
Stick 'em in a blender and hit the switch (No!)
Then I hit the bitch
Met this bum in the back of a dumpster
Fucked her in the rumpster, juggalugga humpster
Had to take a piss, so I pulled out my wang
Then I heard my ding-a-ling sing

Your nuts we want your nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Your nuts we want your nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts
Your nuts we want your nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Your nuts we want your nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts
Your nuts we want your nuts (Anyway, dog, man)
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts (You know what I'm saying?)
Your nuts we want your nuts (Bitches have nuts in their neden)
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts (And then you get bugs on that mother fucking shit)
Your nuts we want your nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts (What up, man?)
Your nuts we want your nuts (Hey, bitch, fuck you! Scabies?)
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts (Check it out, man)
Your nuts we want your nuts (Look, man)
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts (We love all these hoes, you know)
Your nuts we want your nuts ( around)
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts (But you know, we can't be gettin' bugs on our shit)
Your nuts we want your nuts (You know what I'm sayin'?)
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts (Maybe it's the rabies and the mother fucking scabies)
Your nuts we want your nuts (I can't be having centipedes on my dick, man)
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Your nuts we want your nuts (The lobsters, no way)
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts (You know, I like  man, one of these bitches )
Your nuts we want your nuts (We Southwest down)
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts (And you know bitches be jocking that shit, man)
Your nuts we want your nuts (You know what I'm saying?)

Hey

I can remember back in school
Back in elementary school
Yeah, shit used to be cool then, you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause it was all about shootin' dice and playin' dogeball and shit
You know?
But then somethin' happened, man
Everybody grew up
And now ain't nothin' the same
Like this one punk mother fucker
The same mother fucker I was tradin' G.I. Joes with and playin' kickball
Is gonna run up on me and throw a gang sign, talkin' about
He's gettin' ready to fly my head and shit
Well, fuck you, you know
'Cause you're still the same fake-ass bitch you always was
So don't come up on me with that shit, 'cause I know you too well
You still the same gotta be (Get back, man) and my six Jell-O eating mother fucker you always was
Oh yeah, and a couple years ago, I fucked your sister at your birthday party

I hit it so quick, I made her butt-cheeks clap, ha
Why wait around 'til she gets married?

Tootsie-tootsie pumpkin pie
Oops. Looks like ya got nut in your eye
My fault, I didn't notice you was still there
Now go and wash that shit out your hair, bitch
I want a girl not afraid to bone
Even if her mommas and pops is still home
And if her daddy suddenly walks in
He just might see me my nuts on his daughter's chin
Everybody in the hood says that you're easy
You look a little cracked out, a little sleazy

Well let me try to steer you up here, Sabu

You got kids that love you and if not? (No)
You got a roof above you and if not? (No)
You got two legs beneath you and if not? (No)
At least you ain't getting beat down and shot (Yup)
You still got a lot, a lil' spot, a lil' cot, a lil' pot
Tube socks, the dude on the block is sleepin' on two rocks
And you got more than him in that shoebox
You got a best friend and dude rocks
And it's you your crew jocks
So load the jukebox and do a few shots
'Cause you ain't got a tombstone like 2Pac

Bless me with the sight of a satellite
I can't always see from here
Can't always see clear from down here
Bless me with the sight of a satellite

In your rectal hole and another in your cocksucker
'Cause you a cocksucker, motherfucker
Motherfucker, motherfuckers like you
Ain't motherfuckin' right, dude, I'll fuckin' fight you
Shit, you can fall in love at any time
It don't cost a dime, but being locked up is lost time

The worst punishment for crime is when they fuck off your time
It's worth more than anything, money, sex, love
All of the fuckin' above
The Dirtball's a playground all the way around
Explore it and clown, and pray you stay around
So quit yelling, ""Life sucks,"" adore this
You'll understand when you're full of rigor mortis

Can't always see clear from down here

Out here, we all Pac-Mans in a maze runnin' from ghouls (
Every day I'm hustlin'

But like fools, we tend to overlook the privilege and the right
To be given this life
We focus on the bullshit and the strife
Shit ain't always right, but what's wrong? A car line long
Much worse, a hearse
We ain't better off in a coffin in some church
Or with Lurch in the morgue filleted like perch
(Life sucks), we've all sang that song 'til we heard the fat gong
Buried in a dirt nap lawn, like
Boy, was I wrong, that wasn't that long
Let me go again and get my mack on
Realize the prize, recognize game and peep
And don't be a lame sheep and don't sleep
You got a lot to live for, think not and get more
Love life, it's what the shit for

Santa Claus, suck my balls
Drunk as hell ringing bells at the malls
Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, and Cupid
I'm a get stupid, ha ha ha, eh
I sat around all night under the chimney
Holdin' my sack like ""Gimme gimme""
I know that he's comin', he's comin' he must
Lookin' up nuthin but rust, dust
Turn on my TV the very next day
I see you're gettin payed, leadin' the parade
I'm that sniper on the building
Listen to my nine go click, Santa's a fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch

Another year and I ain't get shit
(Another year I ain't get shit)
If I hear him land on my roof
(Ooh my undertaker)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

Yeah I got somthin' to say about St. Nick
Fuck that ho, he never brought Shaggs shit
No toys, candy canes, just a lump of coal
So I eat it, 'cause there ain't nuttin in the cupboards
So I'll be quick, quick and brief
Alls I need for Christmas is my two front teeth
I got mine kicked, kicked out my mouth
I need a few new ones, could you help me out?
Should've known I'd get the short end of the stick
No kind of gift, I didn't get shit
Some say I was bad, but that wasn't it
It's all because Santa was a fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch

Ho-ho, those boys and girls don't deserve anything.""

Santa Claus, Santa Claus where you been?
I see you got cookies and milk on your chin
I guess you had time to collect your ends
You always been down for your rich friends
But Rudolph, he don't bring his sleigh my way
Nothing but coal and dirt for little J
I guess you couldn't fit down my chimney shaft
You need to lose some of that fat ass, uh
All the little rich boys, they gettin' paid
Counting the toys and ducats they made
Me? I got a little half little chunk of dog shit
I'm a kill that fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch

Another year and I ain't get shit
(Mrs. Claus )
If I hear him land on my roof
(Fat fat bitch in the big red coat)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

T'was the night before Christmas, and everything's wack
Not a creature stirring but a fucking rat
I ain't hearin' jingle bells, I ain't hearin' nothin'
Ain't smelling no turkey, sure as hell ain't no stuffing
All night I prayed, wished and prayed
That fat motherfucker would swing my way
And drop off soldiers and rubber balls
But I woke up and found some crusty old drawers
Yep, yep I knew it! The shaft again
And again, and again, and again
Every year I wake up to the same old shit
House empty, no sign of the fat bitch!

Burning Up,The Wraith: Hell’s Pit,2004,"All walks of life up in here tonight baby!

This bitch Rashell fucked on her boyfriend in her boyfriend's bed
And Crazy Carlos smacked his baby mama off in the head
And Jonathan beat his son like his daddy beat him
But swore he'd never do nobody like his daddy did him
And then Sandra used her pussyhole to get to the top
And Baby D, he shot somebody, it went bad from the drop
And then Diane worked at a hospital, took care of old souls
She was abusive, her afterlife sees no gold roads
And Mr. Richards was a richie fella, born with every penny
Everyone around him hungry but he never gave 'em any
And then Steven was a businessman, an educated citizen At the top, pornography of children in his laptop
Take your spot and hang on 'cause it's crowded in Hell
You in the belly of the beast now, it was Heaven in jail
And don't try to make no friends cause don't nobody got no tongues
If the Witch look your way, somehow it crushes your lungs

Playa Playa was a boss man, callin' out shots
'Til he caught one, then everything stops, the floor drops
As he's screamin' and fallin', we see how pointless was the ballin'
When eternity is callin', agony will be appallin'
Don't cry for the dead 'cause they cry for you
Because we laugh about an aftermath but they know how true
And listen, ain't no-fuckin'-body gettin' it worse than you and me
And ain't nobody gettin' it worse than you and me and we will see
A pterodactyl swoop through the caverns of Hell
And carry two unfortunates off to the Ogre's cell
It ain't no guards playin' cards, ain't no uniforms needed
You the only one around butt-naked, bloody and bleedin'
With seven demons in your ear got you believin' you're heathen
Talk you into pulling out your own intestines to get even
You were born with the shine but you lost it down the line
You fucked life up and you can't rewind

Fuck what you're tellin' me! (We burnin' up)
The witch keeps sellin' me! (We burnin' up)
Sins, we earn em' up! (They keep turnin' up)
And we turn corrupt! ('Til we burnin' lovely)

Judge Shaw was a judge, snake holes are his eyes
There go another judge, another judge, somebody despise
And there go so many judges, the judges in Hell
So many fuckin' judges in Hell, they bludgeon 'em well
Fat Pat like his daddy was a bigot pullin' duty
He can tell it to them gargoyles fuckin' on his booty
And Shawna liked money but mistook it for love
Now when the Witch's wings spread, she give him head and look above
Black Sundays, Armageddon, maggots and rape
Hell's Pit got some fire for you faggots with hate
Eddie Burrow hit his wife and put her tooth in his knuckle
Later on he lost his life in a scuffle, now he in trouble
You was a rebel, you nobody no mo'
To the Devil on the double you go
Ain't no level to the trouble you know
And eternity goes, and eternity goes and goes

Fuck what you're tellin' me! (We burnin' up!)
The witch keeps sellin' me! (We burnin' up!)
Sins, we earn em' up! (They keep turnin' up!)
And we turn corrupt! ('Til we burnin' lovely!)
Fuck what you're tellin' me! (We burnin' up!)

My bumps pop fake titties and melt ice grills
Relocate your piercings (dissolve your pills)
Police wail on they sirens but I blow they tweeters
Illuminated liquid leaking outta my speakers
Each drop burns all the way down to the earth's core
(Dust devils) sweep across the earth's floor
Crows and ravens don't flap they wing
They just float on the waves that the humdrum brings
Those that have heard can't descibe my bump

Shimmer,Fearless Fred Fury,2019,"Dear God
I don't know if you're really real
Because mom and stepdad say that you're total hogwash
But, if you're real, and I believe you are
I could really use your help
Every night, something awful comes to my closet
It's a woman, but she's dead
I don't know why she's here
I don't know what she wants
Most of all
I don't know how to make her go away
And I'm really, really scared
I get the feeling that she wants me dead

Shimmer's not in Heaven, Shimmer's not in Hell
Shimmer's in the Echoside as far as I can tell
I feel her presence when I'm standing at the mirror in the dark
I hear her voice within the wind, vibrating my heart
It terrifies me, in my class I feel I'm free, but too quickly it pass
Before I'm headed back to our sickly house on Cass
Shimmer hates laughter and juveniles
Throughout my day I'd hear her say, ""I'll make you pay for every smile""
She was a bad girl who liked to cause agony
I guarantee, and now she wants to terrify and bury me
I'm used to sodomy, my dad's a demon and
Mama's drunk and good for nothin' but somethin' to stuff his semen in
Red light illuminates my closet when Shimmer comes
With a wretched stench, and underneath the door, blood runs
I stay in bed, under covers, but fear forces me
To see the closet doors open and Shimmer pointin' at me

Eyes black, she's bloody, and she likes that
A child dead in her arms, she takes a bite of his neck
And then chews it, pointin' at me, blood drippin' down her chin
Cocks her head, then she does it again
Eyes black, she's bloody, and she likes that
A child dead in her arms, she takes a bite of his neck
And then chews it, pointin' at me, blood drippin' down her chin
Cocks her head, then she does it again

At school they laugh, I've lost so much hair
But I don't care, our souls are just orbs in the air
I hate our house, but have nowhere to go to
And when we moved in, Mama said, ""This is so cool""
I have no brothers or sisters, no fuckin' pets
And my anxiety grows the darker it gets
Why's the sun always leave me? Shimmer's a guarantee
Scarin' me into insanity and no one's hearin' me
I did tell my favorite teacher, Mr. Bowdock
I said, ""There's a wicked ghost houndin' me around the clock""
He said, ""Pray, little man, God's bliss is always there""
Yet when Shimmer shows up, that bliss disappears
My stepdad just smacks me, sends me to my room
Somethin' happened in that closet, some untold doom
Because it reeks of death in there, I won't pretend
Then it illuminates, and bloody Shimmer's back again

Eyes black, she's bloody, and she likes that
A child dead in her arms, she takes a bite of his neck
And then chews it, pointin' at me, blood drippin' down her chin
Cocks her head, then she does it again
Eyes black, she's bloody, and she likes that
A child dead in her arms, she takes a bite of his neck
And then chews it, pointin' at me, blood drippin' down her chin
Cocks her head, then she does it again

I left a Bible in that closet, but found it bloody
I just want the world to know I need some help, somebody
When she comes, the temperature drops, I see my breath
My clock light dies out and the room smells of death
I get the sense she's angrier every time she's here
Despite how many times I'm left paralyzed in fear
Always holdin' a child about my age
Pointin' at me, why all the frustration and rage?
What if she's just an energy, just pretend to me?
But I believe she's real and wants the end of me
Fuck it, I'll do it, she'll never stop 'til it's correct
I'll walk right into her arms, let her have my neck
That night Shimmer came, I was engulfed in fear
But death don't sound so bad, I've had enough, it's clear
I'd rather die than be her toy to terrify
No more nights of bein' pegged by her starin' eyes

Eyes black, she's bloody, and she likes that (By her starin' eyes)
A child dead in her arms, she takes a bite of his neck (By her starin' eyes)
And then chews it, pointin' at me, blood drippin' down her chin (By her starin' eyes)
Cocks her head, then she does it again (By her starin' eyes)
Eyes black, she's bloody, and she likes that (By her starin' eyes)
A child dead in her arms, she takes a bite of his neck
And then chews it, pointin' at me, blood drippin' down her chin
Cocks her head, then she does it again

Her touch stunned me, like sleep paralysis
I couldn't move, but saw all the hell of this
Her mouth up close, it was a black pit
Her teeth sunk in well, and I felt the rip
Total darkness, but suddenly, pain
'Til I almost went deaf when she screamed my name
Still paralyzed, I opened my eyes
And found myself alive in my closet, sound of health
The fear poured out of my body, released its clutch
The first thing I felt was leather's touch
In my hands, The Bible, the one I left in there
It was no longer bloody, and all the pages were clear
Her wretched smell gone, the air was warm
And for the first time in years, I felt a calm
From that night forward, Shimmer was aborted
I can't help but feel my bravery was rewarded

You wanna be rewarded, too?
Then quit bein' a pussy, queef, and let your nuts hang
Do like your boy, Willaby
Slap a condom on a pipe bomb and slide it right up that punk ass (Oh!)
And before that bitch bomb explodes (Brother)
Give 'em two quick slaps in the chops and tell 'em
""I ain't your bitch, bitch, bye-bye, boom!

I caught up wit Nate and said, ""I think it's worth a grand!""
He smiled, and he giggled and he shook my hand
The jam was goin down, I need the money so I'm giddy
That fuckin snake mogul only gave us $750 (What?)
My mamma threw me out, I called my sister a whore (Bitch!)
Now my house is abandoned, my bed is the floor
It's been a week, I haven't eaten, I starve and I crawl
Saw my teacher Ms. Elena up in 
Wellington Mall
I broke into her 
Datsun
 and jumped in the back
And waited for the bitch and put my shank to her neck!
She offered her car keys, cried and said ""Please!""
She promised not to tell and gimmie A's and B's
I said, ""I want your money bitch and all I can sell!"" (Now!)
I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell
I knew she was a snitch so I cut off her tongue (Yes!)
Got happy wit the trigger, now I'm on the run
AN ASSASSIN!!!

Wicked clown, wicked clown!
Wicked clown, wicked clown!
(Don't fuck wit me!)

Ya know who ya fuckin wit?
W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-Wicked clowns!

My father was a priest, cold blooded, he's dead
Hypocrite, he was a bigot, so I cut off his head
Poured on the holy water, ""Bless the dead"" is what I said
And heard the demons screamin as his body bled
Now I'm drunk on the freeway, just the other day
I saw a fine hitch hiker and I wanted to play
Pulled up to the curb so I can offer a ride
She said, ""Thanks!"" I said, ""No thang!"" and she got inside
Peepin as I'm creepin, I'm packin an erection
I'm steerin wit my dick, I'm like look, which direction! (Ha ha!)
Made it to her Ave., she got out and said, ""See ya!""
Yo babe like why'nt ya chill and help me kill this two liter? (Baby)
Went into my trailer, I filled up a glass
Before she took a sip I had my dick in her ass
I banged it and banged it, the shit was absurd
Like she was Sporty Spice and I was some fuckin nerd!
Then she rolled over, and gave me a kiss
And said, ""So when am I gettin paid?"" WHAT BITCH?!
First I tried to choke her, she went for the door
And said, ""Welcome to the disease there's no cure for!""
Bitch I love you, but now you gotta die
I chased her through the door but she slammed it in my eye
She passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Billy
 pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back!
Still wanting booty, I went for the hatchet
And screamed at the moon like a sick psychopathic!
Chopping and chopping, they said ""J, what the fuck?""
On the news they found her head stuffed up her butt, what!
I'm an assassin!
Ha huh ha!
A muthafuckin assassin!
Huuu!
An assassin!

Wicked clown, wicked clown!
Wicked clown, wicked clown!

Keystone copper try to get me
But I pack a French curler with me
And the officer let me off quick

Detroit's air is toxic
My eyeballs popped out they sockets
And fried in the street like a Steak Umm
*Pop* *Pop* (Shake 'em, bake 'em)
Break em off something from the smoke stack
I've been breathing all my life so I'm dying anyway
I'm nothing but a radiation freak show
My arm fell off and it bounced on the floor
Carnival left out the alley (Alley, alley)
And we stoppin' in Sunny Valley
(Jumpin up and down on a richie's head)
And now I'm gonna jump till he's finally dead
(Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump)

Before my nuts go soft juggle 'em around
Bitch, wanna join the carnival circus
Grab my ding-a-ling and jerk and jerk this
I gotta catch these carnival thrills
New born (seibab) heads I drill
Chills, thrills, bigots writing wills
An axe to the forehead usually kills
If this ain't hell, I can't tell
Hang my body on a cross with some rusty nails
If I juggle ya, call me a juggala
I'm a nap burgala, voodoo smuggla
See I got the symptoms of insanity
I'm down with J from the ICP
I'm down with him and he's down with me
So if we gotta chop, C-H-O-P
Running down the block someone hit me with a rock
And my brains all over the street
But I'm a wicked clown and I'm up and down
All over this Esham beat
So, so, so if I gotta chop, then I guess I gotta chop
If I chop, then I gotta chop, chop
But you could never stop sucker, you could never drop

Dead Body Man,Riddle Box,1995,"""This is a Channel 7 news brief, because the news is happening now.""
""Hello, Mort Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight, police and
Investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody
Stole 4 dead bodies from the Wayne County morgue late Monday night
Police say the apparent body theif entered through the basement
Window, but how he eluded the security and alarm system is still a
Mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering, what kind of sick
Fuck would steal 4 dead bodies, anyway? Details at 11.""

Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street
Fifty-five, sixty-five bodies at least
I hang with the stiffs 'til the break of dawn
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn
Drag em in the house, throw em in the oven
Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'
Tastes like chicken finger lickin' deep fried
I ate a dead body, but don't tell, I lied
I just ate my first dead body last week
Still gots a finger nail caught in my teeth
Before you start yelling and cursing my name
Remember something's wrong with my brain, insane
Second I was born, doctor threw me 'gainst the wall
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall
I'm sliding and I'm bouncing off shit like a hockey puck
And my mother's like ""What the fuck?!""
He said I was born of an alien race
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand
I'm just the dead body man

""We got bodies, dead bodies
We got fat ones, skinny ones
Males, females, hermaphrodites
We got somebodies, we got nobodies
Bodies, bodies, bodies, woo!""

Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van
All the little kiddies love the dead body man
I drive through my neighborhood ringing my bell
Some people run 'cause they don't like the smell
Others line up just as quick as they can
To try and catch a glimpse of the dead body man
It's all good, if you can stand the funk, but, uh...
Just don't look in the trunk
I drive down Central kicking the bass
Chillin' with my freaks and I'm picking her face
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head
'Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead
Than a ho you can't trust, always diggin' a nut
A dead body bitch learn to keep her mouth shut
Riding in the back is my dead body crew
Only they can never think of nothing to do
If you think I'm sick take a look at yourself
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand
I'm just the dead body man

""We also collect dead bodies
So, if you know any dead people
Or you yourself are planning on dying soon
We'll be happy to come to your house
And pay cash for it
We appreciate good healthy stiff
For our dinner
Woohoo!""

Call me the dead body man (some one give em to me)
Call me the dead body man (just sell em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can mail em to me)
Call me the dead body man (burnt? bring em to me)
Call me the dead body man (won't ya give em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can sell em to me)
Call me the dead body man (just mail em to me)
Call me the dead body man (burnt? bring em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can give em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can sell em to me)
Call me the dead body man (won't ya mail em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can bring em to me)
Call me the dead body man, call me the dead body man",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-dead-body-man-lyrics
If I Was a Serial Killer,The Tempest,2007,"If I was a serial killer
They would find all my victims heads
In funky-ass gas station toilets
And if I was a serial killer
I would be strange and deranged
And I would never change
If I was a serial killer
I'd be known as ""The Smoker""
Cuz I would cut off and smoke all of they hair
And if I was a serial killer
I would sleep on broken glass and thumb tacks
And I would smoke mad crack

First thing I would do would be to kill a couple hotties
That always get 'em mustered up; decapitated bodies
Dumped on state police lawn just before dawn
To let 'em know my ritual had begun
I'd crack a 40 with the devil, tell him dig me a hole
Cuz I'm comin when I die, until that I'm in control
This is if I was a serial killer, and though I ain't
But if I was I'd do my walls up blood red with blood paint
This is if I was a serial killer, and though I ain't
But if I was I'd never stop because I'd know that I can't

If I was a serial killer
I would drive a back van
And I would ride around the college campus
And if I was a serial killer
I would walk among us and gain trust
Until I needed that rush

I park outside these bitches homes then drive away
Then come back with my light off, this time I'm here to stay
I'd wear human bones around my neck and have my ceremonies
Then go back upstairs and microwave some macaronis
You know what's all up in my trunk, so don't ask me to pop it
Once I get out to my cabin then I'll finally unlock it
This is if I was a serial killer, and though I'm not
If was I'd snap a photo once they die on the spot
This is if I was serial killer, and though I'm not
But if I was I'd know that I can't, so I would never stop

And I don't know myself anymore
And I don't know who I am anymore
And I don't know who to be anymore
And I don't know who I am anymore
And I don't know what to think anymore
And I don't know who I am anymore
Except that I am strange and deranged
And I don't know who I am anymore
And I will never change

Forever,The Mighty Death Pop!,2012,"Forever...

This life is tricky, mean, and strange
You can only be sure about one thing: change
For worse or for better... Maintain
Catch wisdom, try to gain brains
In my life I've seen a lot come and go
Like a non-stop fashion show
Very little shit lasts forever
And just because shit's new, it ain't better
I wanna be with Shaggy and Billy, my dogs for life
And I pray that'll never change every night
I said never again and then I did it
And did it again... I can't pretend
I won't lie, yo, I've lost control
And it's a scary endeavor; I got it together
But it took forever, now I want forever
To be just like this, the shit I wish...

Forever...

Truth is, happiness is in your own head
How you perceive shit, believe it is
It's all you, some of us sad fools
Can't help it, living in a bad mood
Shit hurts, then it only gets worse
They don't get it, not even the experts
But trust me, it won't last forever...
You hit bottom, shit finally gets better!
Some don't need bank to laugh
And live on the bright side whatever the path
When you hit 40 or 50, that's just half
Enjoy youth, cause that you don't get back!
Forever revolves around you
That's your time, I'm living in mine too
How much positivity are you blind to?
You only live once I'll remind you!

Forever...

None of that good shit lasts forever
But you just might like the new changes better
It's funny how we adapt and keep it together
As the months roll by, seasons and weather

But when it all shuts off: (Wooh!) THE DEATH POP!
And that'll be the day your forever will stop
Until then we experience these emotions
With peaks sky high and lows deep as oceans

I wanna see you and me last forever
Loop this life up and end it never
And live through the ages, the lows, the stages
And never let them close the pages

To find peace of mind is impossible
Forever is plagued with obstacles
So we make the best of good times
We stuck on play, we can't rewind!

Forever...

We just wanna see us all together
(After forever)
Off in Shangri-La!

Off in Shangri-La...
We just wanna see us all together
(After forever)
Off in Shangri-La!

Off in Shangri-La...

She lifted her belly, (Bush) wack surprise
Pussy had fro like the Jackson 5
Just then, rounds, rounds, get down
They wanna nix this wicked clown
I took a look, the girl was cooked, her head exploded
Reached for the Uzi at my foot, and I unloaded
But them hoes got away in time
And my bitch headless, but she’ll be fine
I shot back in the passion's heat
Killed somebody grandma across the street (Damn)
They all gon' die, no, they can't hide
As soon as we find out who

We gonna ride down to West Vernor Avenue (Hey)
And open fuckin' fire (Clowns, bitch)
We gonna ride down to West Vernor Avenue (Hey)

People get killed for a gang rag, yeah
If you're my enemy, I'll make your brain hang, yeah
Out the side of your head, big game of tag, huh

And it was a basehead chick who said
Her brother’s boys, The Murder Rats
Was who tried to kill me, I heard that

Searching the ghetto zone, all sides of it
Like pussy holes, they're rarely seen in public
We asked Big Red and Meth Head Sally
Yeah, I took a sec and got head in the alley
We went back home, almost got inside
But J called, he found ’em

Shaggy, yo, them cocksuckers tried to kill you (To kill you)
Dumping hot slugs through your home, what the fuck?

Four scrubs in a bucket, pullin' up dumpin'
Empty the full clip, quickly bust 'em

See a clown that wit ya
First you see him next second he's gone
That can only mean that it won't be long

Put triple dog dates on ferris wheels
Strap my coffin up to em and roll
You can tell I'm comin cuz I shake the floor!
(Shaggy 2 Dope)- Tell your bitch ass mama that she can suck my dick
You see it got so crazy up wit my shit

3 Rings,Riddle Box,1995,"Phone rings ""Hello?""
""You have a collect call from, 'Fook oof.' Please answer the following question Yes or No: Will you pay for the call?""

""Is this on?
Gather 'round my wealthy friends
And endure the horrifying sights
Only your worst nightmares can produce
Actual human beings of a deformed nature
Come at once
And come and indulge yourself
In our own twisted amusement of
Another's misfortune
Yes, ladies and gentlemen
Enter our three ring show of freaks""

Ring one, a dung a dung dung
My name's Violent J and I staple my tongue
To the desk in school then I run down the hall
Scaring the shit out of all y'all, bitches
Which is fine, you don't invite mine to your party
Just cause I don't look like everybody
I guess you're bunch of rich boys, bitch boys
Scary, brrrahhhh!
And what's the big deal about my neck
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch
Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, now how ya gon' act?
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back
I guess I'm just another freak show thing
And now they got me in the three ri-i-i-ing

Three ring a ding a ding ding
People love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding
It's the same as everywhere

Ring two, how do you do?
I'm Shaggy 2 Dope, chicken-faced bitch (Who?)
You, don't try to front ho
Try to play me out just cause I'm running with the sideshow
So maybe it's the leg growing out my neck
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet
Popped out the neden like a pound of lead
Doctor blew his back swole' and dropped me on my head
Oh shit, I knew It had to fuck up my circuits
'Cause when I was two my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bat boy, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone!
So don't be stickin your finger in my face stank
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the three ring...
Freak

Three ring a ding a ding ding
People love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding
It's the same as everywhere

""I certainly hope you're enjoy yourselves
Here at our three ring exhibit
But to be honest I really don't see
What's so fuckin' funny about it
These fucking people are real!""

Ring three, the ICP
Look if you want but I wouldn't lay a hand on me
That's how you get fucked up
We'll squeeze your windpipe shut
Yo, I'm a nerd word, I drink Thunderbird
Half Snake woman kicked my love to the curb
She busted into my tent, now I'm fucked
Had the fat bearded lady in the buck, uh!
Fuck that, bitch, suck that
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sack
It's two balls hanging with no protection so
I move real careful and slow
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak
Call me Don Knotts cuz I'm gettin' knotted every week, uh
So come see the carnival and throw me your change, bitch
I chill with the three rings

Three ring a ding a ding ding
People love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding
It's the same as everywhere

""Well, that's it
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you had a good time
You fuckin' heartless bastards
You saw what you wanted
So grab your fucking kids
And that fat flop of shit wife of yours
And get the fuck out of our circus tent
You cold-hearted sons of bitches
You think they look fucked up?
Just wait till I kick your
Fuckin' lips in a couple times
You'll be sittin' up here like a bitch
And we'll laughin' at your folded ass
They'll call you lumpy
After I'm done puttin' knots
All over your fuckin' forehead
Yeah, hey, hey little boy, come here
How'd you like it if I tied your neck in a knot
You fucking little bitch
Come here, I'll shove that
Fucking corn dog up your ass
Get the fuck out of here
Show's fucking over""
Get the fuck out of here!
You fucking heartless bastards!""",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-3-rings-lyrics
I Found A Body,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"I just wanted somebody there
Somebody to agree or disagree with
Tell me I'm right or wrong
Somebody to talk to, eat with, be with...
Somebody who cares whether I'm alive or not
Somebody who knows whether I'm alive or not

I was walking home through an alleyway
Paying no attention, tripped over a leg
It was a dead body, hid off to the side
He looked like a crack-head, maybe twenty-five
He looked rather lonely, both his eyes were open
Threw him on my shoulder, took him to the homestead
Sat him on my couch, cooked him pizza rolls
Opened up his mouth, stuffed 'em down his throat
Then we went to Target, I pushed him in the cart and
People stopped and stared, they thought he was retarded
I put him in some shades and sprayed him down with axe
We rented a movie, just chilled and relaxed

I found a body
I sure as hell could use a buddy
I'm lonely, I could use a homie
Ever since I got out, stress has been on me
(Stress has been on me...)

I just...
Don't wanna be alone any more
I just wanna be around somebody
I mean anybody!
I just don't wanna be alone

We went to Clark Park, it's my favorite place
Had to shoot the birds off, picking at his face
Then we took a bike ride, he rode the handlebars
Stopped and had some ice cream, he started acting hard
First he wasn't talking, then he wouldn't eat
Then it fucking hit me: I found him in the street!
He's fucking dead, I almost forgot
He has a hole in his head from where he must've got shot


I can't stand any more loneliness
I just don't wanna be alone
Fuck...

I took him to my mom's house, she called him a user
Cuz he had my shoes on, she thinks he's a loser
He don't have a job yet, got nothing on rent
Pretty much everything about him is spent
I got into a fist fight, two thugs jumped me
He stayed in the car, chilling in the front seat
Come to think about it he ain't really my friend
But whatever we got, I don't want it to end, cause...


We will fight for you in a court of law, and we will win! Because if we don't win, we'll suck your dick!
Specializing in slip and fall and on-the-job injuries, we'll win you cash!
If McLewen, Davis and Davis take your case on, you can't lose!
Either you win a nice settlement for your personal injury or you'll bust a nut in our mouth! That's our guarantee!
Call us at 1-800-BLOWJOB now, and let's get this loot, together!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-i-found-a-body-lyrics

Murder Go Round,The Ringmaster,1994,"What can I say, man, I hit him with the brick
Killed the little prick, him and his chick
Tried to be slick but you ain't no Slinky
You're rinky, you're dinky, you suck my Twinkie
I don't give a fuck if you call me a clown
Break it on down, it's murder go round
What'cha dishing out, I catch, it comes back to ya
If you're trying to creep, I'd hate to say I never knew ya

Once upon a time in the ghetto zone
A ten-foot lead pipe slapped on my dome
I'm laying in the street with blood oozing out my head
Excuse me, motherfucker, was it something I said
Forks up, forks down, man, forks sideways
Then he grabbed my Faygo and he said crime pays
Swung on his pipe once again for the road
""Hold up, dawg,"" Uh! this shit gets old
Now I walk the streets with a shattered skull
I'm gonna swing my axe through his jaw
Where the motherfucker at? Where the motherfuckers hang?
How ya gonna fuck with the juggla J-ay-ay?
There he sits so I knock on the door
Pops opened up *Pop* Pops hit the floor
Then I chop chop pops twice in his nugget
But he didn't do shit, fuck it
It's the murder go round

Hey!
""I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
Hey! Hey!
""I don't wanna die! Stop! Please!""
Hey! Hey!
""Oh no! Stop! Stop!""

Well, it's me and my mellow mellow roll on Military
Gangbangers gangbangers, big bang theory, kinda scary
Tags up all on the bricks
Latin Counts, X-Men, CFP and all that shit
We love gangbangers and we hope they love us back
We just some wicked clowns and it's been like that
I don't understand why some beefin' in town
We went nation-wide and still Southwest down
But this motherfucker gonna try and clown me
But I'm the juggalugalocoro, G
Took a shot and he missed, 2 Dope bit the dust
""What?! I ain't got shot, bitch!"" So now you must
Take your ticket for the murder go round
Can't nobody kill a clack-clack clown
Seen him and his boys smoking blunt in a bucket
Pulled out the dagger, creeped up and I stuck it
Into his head, into his boy's head
Into his boy's head, his boy's head, his boy's head
Five dead fucks in the trunk I deliver
Push that old piece of shit in the river
They capped my boys, so if I go down
And ya get a free ride (""No, not again"") On the murder go round

""No!""
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
""Help me! Ah, it hurts!""
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
""Get if off! Get it off!""
Hey!
""Stop!""

Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?
Murder go round, murder go round
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?

Now I'm in a street gang, 55 strong
Everybody singing that southwest song!
What can go wrong I mean I'm fuckin' in the haugh?
Popping that shit, I'm finna bust you in the mouth
Nobody fucks with a jokero juggalo
I don't give a fuck ya know, bitches I'm a fuck you, though
But you know the shit had to hit the fan
Some gangbanger shot me, man
Twice in the forehead, twice in the back
Twice in the eye and I'm feeling kinda wack
Stumbling along it's becoming entwined
That I'm next in line for the murder go round

Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Wicked wicked clown, wicked clown, wicked clown, dig it

Murder go round, murder go round

Game Over,Fearless Fred Fury,2019,"Someone said there was a time when it costed a quarter
Maybe it still should sorta, instill some kind of order
'Cause it's been weeks now since I put my balls to any water
Trash hoarder style, mildly, I'm caught up in the slaughter
Fuck Judy and her fat booty, Call of Duty hooked me
I beat the game and ain't cheat once, in just three months, it took me
Eyes open wide, they thought I died, at the TV, they shook me
Mom cooked for me, took a look, mistook me for a Wookie
I stayed and put the poop and pee and snot, whatnot
In jars and screwed the top tight
Go through a lot, it's not right, in sight
Last night, Mom learned it wasn't right to fuckin' interrupt me
She ran back upstairs, I took a butterknife, punctured her butt cheek
My life is the monitor, my body's the remote
Do I leave this chair? Nope, don't own a pair of shoes or coat
I go through thousands of friends, they all live in my headset
Reset, how many lives do I get? Am I dead yet?

""You put your mother so far in debt, she had to sell your grandmother's jewelry""
Start the fuckin' game
""You have zero pigmentation in your skin, when's the last time you got some sunlight?""
Let's get a game goin'
""You can be heard cursing all the way down the block, those are elementary students you're arguing with""

""Don't you have any desire at all to at least fuck some pussy once in your life?""
Who wanna game?

Another year, another day spent in mama's basement
So much hair, don't know where my face went, and mama pays rent
Damn, wasted, aced it, erase and chase it
So close, I can taste it, fuck out of my face, kid
Windows, spray-painted red, chair, blew the fuck back
Button tappin', nothin' happened, damn, I'm fuckin' nappin'
Kill the captain, chill or zap him, trap him and slap him
Eight twenty-three or three to noon, so I ain't leavin' soon
Tell the bitch eat a dick, talkin' shit in my earhole
He fuckin' called me fat, though, how the fuck he know?
Is it some kind of camera on me, is this so?
'Cause I was jackin' off only minutes ago
For me it's nothin' to tell a 9-year-old fuck off fast
And if he was standing right here, I'd choke his ass
A warrior on the screen, but don't pull my plug
Or you'll find me stuck in my chair, a worthless slug

""How is that chair even comfortable? It looks like it was crushed by a monster truck""
Start the fuckin' game
""Oh my, Jesus Christ, what the hell is in all them nasty jars?""

Put a fuckin' game in
""Look at your fuckin' toenails, they look like prehistoric elephant tusks""
Who wanna game?

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, only three fingers left working
But still enough for me to claim I'm an expert in my profession
And my profession is fictional
I don't get paid, I earn lives in digital
I ain't been out in four years, doubt I'd fit up the stairs
Dreadlocks grown out of my nose, I've grown out my clothes
I'm naked, rockin' a blanket, my cock I spank, my cocker spaniel
I smothered wide under my thunder thighs
Hope I ain't do it too much pain, I'm too into my game
Can't wait to see my girl again, next time I'm playin' Sims
I'm aloof, not a total goof, I got time
Truth, I'm only 34, Mom, what's the hurry for?
I had a cat a while back, don't understand it though
It must've died, thought I smelled a dead animal
Big scary world out there, cold, inside, I'm tight
And every game I download is a brand new life

 What?
Sucha cool dude, man
Ah thanks
Why the fuck are you down here?
I can chalk that up to one night, hah
What happened?
Me and my girl, we used to hang out and get drunk in this old cemetery
And I'm fuckin' around and here's one those little mausoleum buildings that people are buried in
And I'm fuckin' with the door and it opens
So I go in there and it slams shut behind me and I'm lookin' at all this shit this guy's buried with
One thing was this old bottle, it just said 'Red Rum' on it
And there was actually some still in there, you know?
And the girl I'm with's kind of a dog-faced gremlin so I thought hell, maybe a swig of this and she'll be a little hotter, hahaha
So I pull the cork off it and holy shit, what an odor
But you know what? I fuckin' slammed it
And aw man, my head started spinnin'

Nate it's good to see you back
People we have a new member today
I'd like you to meet him
He's gonna stand up and tell us
What's going on with him and
What he wants to change about himself
If you will
Ummm hello everybody
My name is Violent J
And I'm an axe murderer
(Hi Violent J)
Ok now remember we all have similar problems
And that's why we're all here
To help each other work them out
Well I just hope you guys don't think I'm crazy but uh
(Tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us)
Ok I will tell you if you don't tell no one else
Think I have a problem and I probably could use help
You know the midnight killer that's been all over TV
I'm not totally sure but I think it could be me
Something happens to me when I'm sleeping in the night
Wake up in my backyard with a shovel and a knife
Filling up a hole again I've dug up 32
I know all my dreams of murder probably all are true
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)

And sleep right through the night
I walk around my neighborhood in my slippers and my sweats
Snoring loud and mumbling steady squeezin necks
Never have to worry about traffic or the cops
All I have to do is stay away from doughnut shops
I remember napping time in kindegarten class
Wasn't quite a killer yet, I'd only beat some ass
Never very popular most kids would point and stare
That's why I bring the NyQuil and drink that shit right there
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)

Choke 'em (choke 'em)

I think, well I hope it's like
All bigots and richies that I'm killing but
Probably an occasional innocent bystander every now and then
That's ok we all make mistakes
But are you absoutely sure that
It's even you doing these killings?
The more I think about it all I see that it could be
Everytime I meet a girl and bring her home with me
Wake up in the morning there's no sign of my sweetheart
Yet I see another hole is dug up in my yard
Denny's all night murders, and the Kinko's killing spree
Missing Sunday paper boys I can't believe it's me
I'm the only one from summer camp that made it home
Could this really be what's goin on?
Let me sleep on it
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)

And sleep right through the night
Ride around on possum back and eat with the racoons
Chirpin with the crickets naked underneath the moon
Every morning I wake up and check if I've been gone
Muddy boots, and Steak 'n Shake food wrappers on my lawn
I cannot imagine just to think what I have done
Sat there eating chili fries and slaughtered everyone
Tried to see a hypnotist to get inside my head

Nobody’s Fault,Fearless Fred Fury,2019,"Man, you don't wanna be no weak lame
You got that street game
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
Who wants to be a love wimp?
You a motherfuckin' triple OG scrub pimp

Mama, I can't seem to make a fuckin' friend
It always seems to end up just pretend
They always fuckin' suck in the end
Fuckin' bit my hand, same fuckin' shit again
It don't quit or end (Fuck 'em)
Can't go a day without me getting high
I call it gettin' by
Fuck you, won't even try
No shit, I'd rather die
I'd rather stick a fuckin' chicken skewer through my eye
It's true, then lick it dry, no lie
Can't be right how bad I wanna nut
I'm fantasizin' tough and I just might combust
Trip on a slut's lust, shit's a must
At night I grip my nuts and flick the tip 'til it erupts
Then wipe it up

(Don't be mad, be glad)
I'm all alone when I get the bone
All alone when the chips are blown
The bullshit's my own
It's nobody's fault but mine
(Don't diss yourself, kid, kiss yourself, shit)
It's all on me when the shit ain't fair
All on me when nobody cares
How the fuck I get here?
It's nobody's fault but mine
(Anybody shit talkin' needs to get walkin')

I swear to God, it's like I never learn
I take turn after turn after turn, and fuckin' crash and burn
Nobody's that concerned
They say they're glad they ain't me
Too bad I'll never earn, the court's adjourned (Fuck 'em)
Tell me why I'm always fuckin' up
I take it hard to the gut
It fuckin' hurts and it sucks
I suck it up, my luck ran up
I fuckin' chalk it up
To the simple fact, I'm dumb as fuck (What?), what? (Nah)
I try my hardest but I can't fit in
Even them who never win won't let me in
And when the rest about to finish, I just begin
They headed out, I'm headed in
They fat, I'm thin
They yang, I'm yin (Don't need 'em)
From this day forth, I'll be a faithful man
It was a great soundin' plan, but it was built on qucksand
That shit was over before it began, blam
Left with my dick in my hand, don't understand
(Don't be ashamed, that's game)

I'm all alone when I get the bone
All alone when the chips are blown
The bullshit's my own
It's nobody's fault but mine
(Yeah, you kickin' that truth shit, they spittin' that poop dick)
It's all on me when the shit ain't fair
All on me when nobody cares
How the fuck I get here?
It's nobody's fault but mine
(Anybody tryna ho you, they better fuckin' blow you, stud)

I'm always hurtin' people out and about
Just 'cause someone shoves too hard in the crowd, what's that about?
I'm always quick with my foot in they mouth, screamin' loud
If they bleedin' bad, I'm even proud, hmm
Why is it that I'm always tellin' lies?
Why don't I know my shit, no one buys?
Or know they roll their eyes?
Why can't I ever hear their sighs?
My shit never flies, believe me, no one tries, surprise
The doctors tell me that my head is sick
My brain is mad jacked up thanks to Fred and Flip
And in fact, a fuck, I will never give
I fight back, a scrub will forever live

I'm all alone when I get the bone
All alone when the chips are blown
The bullshit's my own
It's nobody's fault but mine
(You don't like it, you can hike it, bitch boy)
It's all on me when the shit ain't fair
All on me when nobody cares
How the fuck I get here?
It's nobody's fault but mine
(Yeah, ghetto genius, penis)
I'm all alone when I get the bone
All alone when the chips are blown
The bullshit's my own
It's nobody's fault but mine
(Hey, hey, how the fuck I get here?)
It's all on me when the shit ain't fair
All on me when nobody cares
How the fuck I get here?
It's nobody's fault but mine
(Wicked Clowns, you hatin' the group, come here and wait for the boot, lil' bitch)
It's nobody's fault but mine

Homies,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I know you ain't there
That's why I just want to let you know something bro
You all know I love you
You all know you're my homies
And eh, alright we'll talk later, peace
Let me ask you this about this life we live
And let me try to swerve some of this attention you give
To them distant ass relatives over ham dinner
If they really missed you so much
Why don't they just call in 
If you wasn't blood, would you still have love?
Or infact does the blood make you think you have to love?
Look, I probably love my family more than anybody here
But my homies are family too, 3rd cousins' get outta here
Who was you with when you got tattooed?
And who was you trippin' with when you did them mushrooms?
And who the fuck threw up all over your car?
And then felt worse than you about that shit in the morning?
(Friends ya'll)
Who loaned you money, homie?
Who owes you cash?
(Who?)
Who taught you how to use the bong for the grass?
(Who?)
I don't know much but I gotta assume
When ya hit ya first neden, ya homies was in the next room

And you got this boss who thinks he's the Don Mega
Because he the head manager
(Chief Chili Fry Maker)
All you can vision is ya'll beating him down
Your homies standing on his back
While you kicking his head around
But responsibility is there, I can't lie tho'
I'd of been plucked his fucking eye ball out with a chicken bone
I'm crazy as fuck, I'll rip your piercings off
And now my homies are holding me back so I don't look soft
When you snuck the car out who did you get?
(Who?)
And when you got caught, who you blame the shit?
(Who?)
Who can you relax around and scratch your balls?

Carnival ain't for everyone
Me and my homies stay tight like a noose
And if you step to one of us you better step to the whole crew
I never knew that I could depend
That I could have some friends that's down to the very end
Well, that's my homeboys, excuse me, my family
And when we conquer the world, we mackin' on the galaxy
'Cuz sky's the limit and we ain't finished
And if my homies gonna ride, ya know I'm with it
Puff it and pass it and I give it to my homies ya'll
Hit it and quit it and then I give it to my homies ya'll
I got the world around my finger with my homies ya'll
And everything is obsolete unless I hear my homies call
We world wide were homies across the planet
Sticking together like zippers on a Michael Jackson

Wind it back, whack your cheekbones
Stomp your nose in until it's gone
Pick you back up and punch your gut (Ooh!)
Double you over and fold you shut
Let you drop then invite the crew
To kick your face in too (Ooh!)
Racist bigot, you dirty demon! (No!)
Dig your eyes out while you screamin' (Aaah!)
Drive your head into the concrete
Use your forehead to paint the street
Child abusin' piece of crap (Look out!)
A couple knee-drops across your back
Rip your pants down for the cause
Take two bricks and clap your balls

Bang, pow, boom, and your mouth's a mess
Somehow, your tongue's hangin' outta your neck
And I ain't even barely got started yet
Throwin' stars stickin' outta your fo' head
Keep you alive to make you feel mo' dead
Down your throat with a broken bottle
Kick to the neck, then make 'ya swallow
Stomp each and every rib till it breaks

Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
Cuz it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
Guarenteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I wanna let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
Cuz I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I wanna buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts
Here they come, nope, wasn't them
Seems like the same car's driving by again
It pulls up, ""hey man, you're outta luck""

I was thinkin' about you
So I wrote this song (Yeah)
I'd like to dedicate this
To the love that is expressed
From you and I
So please sit back
And enjoy

Ey yo bitch, come over here and lemme kick it to ya
Try to stick my nuts in ya, then I never knew ya
'Cause you're ugly and ya know ya can't hide that
So what ya look like a chicken with a hunchback?
Oh, it doesn't matter that you're from down South
If ya talk like it I'mma smack you in your mouth
Bitch, I admit it, I'm quick to hit a woman, hey
But that's okay 'cause, bitch, I'm Violent J!
And I'm a Southwest Mack Daddy Juggalo
And you're nothin' but a two bit stankin ho
But I love you and I hope you realize that
I don't care about the hair growin' out your back
Smoke a nice blunt, drink some Mad Dog through the night
And your ugly bitch turns into Karyn White
And I stick my wing-wang in the middle
I like a filthy ass ho, the kind to make your nuts shrivel!

Bitch, I'm knockin' at yo do'
Lemme get some neden, ho
Bitch, yo ugly, that's okay
I'm finna hit it anyway
Bitch, I'm knockin' at yo do'
Lemme get some neden, ho
Bitch, yo ugly, that's okay

I guess you want me to take you on a big date
But what you're sayin don't sound all that straight
All I wanna do is feel ya butt and squeeze ya titties
'Cause I can't feed your fat ass on a buck fifty
Let's make love, my sweet little dove
I wouldn't get near that neden without a glove
'Cause it's rats and spiders up in there
Hittin' that'll take the curl out your nut hairs
I smack your titty and it claps when it hits the other
But I don't want 'em clappin' too loud; it'll wake a mother
Bitches always front like they don't wanna let ya hit it
But then they always screamin' banshees when ya gettin' with it
So don't fake the funk, I'm nothin' but a ghetto punk
All I'm tryna do is stick ya in your fat rump
So get the fuck out them dirty ass drawers
And come and twist my balls
'Cause I love you

Bitch, I'm knockin' at yo do'
Lemme get some neden, ho

I'm finna hit it anyway

The Amazing Maze,The Pendulum Tome,2000,"Ferris wheels and bumper cars are fun
But those rides just aren't for everyone
Bought my ticket I'ma have a run
In the maze (WHOOOO!)
If I don't come back or right away
Give me time at least a half a day
Don't just leave me lost and blown away
In the maze (WHOOOO!)

Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm Jeff Nipple
And I'm Jimbo Jizm
Welcome to the Dark Carnival's amazing maze
Over 5000 ways to get in, and no way out
Let's meet today's volunteer
This is Rick
We like to call him Rick the Dick
Dickface here is a wealthy entrepreneur
Who smacks his wife around
And buys his way in and out of everything
Let's see how Mr. Toughguy fares up in the amazing maze

What up bitch? I'm Violent J
I'll be your guide for today, k?
Good, got mad doors and mad floors
Hallways, crawlways, walls for days
Make a left just before you make a right
And your left should be to your right
If your lefts right, right?
Good, begin the show
Go on ahead boy and open up the first door

Welcome to a theatrical thriller
Meet Jack Doobie a serial killer
With a chainsaw, he takes your arm at the elbow
You get it back if you make it out though
Fuck ain't no use crying all day
You need to take your bitch ass back down the hallway
You gotta be a man at least you learned
Everything you get in the maze you've earned

Keep runnin times a tickin on the clock
You might wanna tie that stump up with a sock
Turn right it might look the same
But you makin tracks through the room of thumbtacks
This really ain't shit
About a million tacks and the room spins a bit
If you stay on your feet you'll be okay
Oh let me get out of your way

Oh boy Rick the Dick is in a bit of a jam there Jeff
That's right Jimbo
He looks like a ragdoll flippin and spinnin like that
You can always witness spectacles truly amazing
Within the amazing maze
Let's see where else Rick's adventures
Will lead the little dickwipe

Hahaha, so you got a few tacks in your balls
Pick 'em all out and head right back down the halls
What's this? Dead end, doors locked
It's a long way back, just knock
Oh should've turned around no doubt
Ain't nuthin' that we got to sit and argue about
Keep going make a left, right left
Now run straight ahead some more
Open up the door
Slide in the sheets, nice breeze
Relax ninja take it with ease
The maze is a place of magic
Many surprises, your dick rises
Lay down expect the best
In comes your lover with a hairy chest
Hello sexy I'm Grim Love
Let me have a look at your uhh milk dud

Aww shit you fell for that
I ain't gonna tell you got your o-ring tapped
All that dissin of the opposite sex
And look who just got they butthole flexed
Wait! What's that?
The walls are closing in, fuck that
Hurry run for your life
Ohh he'll be alright

How's that sit with you Jimbo?
First he gets plugged with bullets
Then he gets his butt plugged
I think he's a fucking idiot, Jeff
I mean what kind of asshole
Can't find his way out of this maze?
You gotta be a real dickbuffer
To wind up here in the first place
Right you are Jimbo
Let's watch the big dick fuck up some more

Alrighty ain't no need to fear
If there's a way out it's gotta be near
Hey yo look a phone
You still got one good arm so it's on
Can you hear? Ahh tongue in your ear
Drop it the phones got a life of it's own
Kiss me man hey come on
Slip down the slide go faster
Bed of nails, disaster
Quit screaming yo, hurry the fuck up and open the door

Woods, trees you're outside
Lots of places for creeps to hide
Watch your step, AHHHH, backdraft
Caught your foot and the ankle snapped
Creepin off with your stump
Feel something in the rump
Holla's, yeah they gonna get you
How does it feel bitch get the picture

Back indoors hey at last
Look at your family behind the glass
They look weird, they're sayin something
Listen up...
""You fucked up! you fucked up!""
Oooh they're laughin and they're pointing at you
At least you know what they're sayin's true
It's one last door you made it home, or
Or what? Once again it's on
Ferris wheels and bumper cars are fun
But those rides just aren't for everyone
Bought my ticket I'ma have a run
In the maze (WHOOOO!)
If I don't come back or right away (Hey)

Hey man cut that shit
What the fuck man, happy friendly shit man

Maybe I would rather fuck a Macy Grey
Before a Janet... ""Jackson""
Maybe I don't' have no self esteem
SO I like to pick on everybody else
Maybe when I was a boy, underneath my shirt
I had bruises and welts ""Oh"" (It's OK)
Maybe I was hungry, bottom barrel poor
And my mom was always sick
Maybe I'm lyin, I'm just tryna find and excuse to be a dick
I'm a dick-dick
Maybe i'm upset that you left me
I'll hang myself right above your bed (YOu Should Try Suicide)
From the ceiling fan, so i'll be swingin when you walk
I, I might kick you in the head
Maybe I got 7 therapists, I been committed
But my manager got me free (Double A Y'all)

I think you should come up here
Never
Mr. Pizer, I think you should come up here
Never
I think you should come up here

Yet another day of all the suffering it gave
I was just a little boy, ever so naive
Amy was my best friend, I never want to hurt her
I never wanna ever wanna think about her murder
On the playground, I chase her down the slide
I chase her cross the monkey bars, and she would run and hide
Giggling and tumbling, I pushed her off the sled
Amy coincidentally hit her head
 down came the rain
Amy isn't answering, who would get the blame?
Amy isn't laughing, Amy isn't crying
Amy isn't really breathing, panic, God, I think she's dying
Suddenly, the air is cold, I must get her inside
Even though she died, Amy has to hide
Nobody must ever know that I made Amy sick
Lock her up forever in the attic

Many years have passed me by
I'm thinking ""Did she really die?""
I'm thinking, if it's really true
Then how come I am telling you?
And if I really meant to do it
Should I be a victim to it?
Should I walk the terror stairs
And see if all my terror fairs? No

Mr. Pizer, I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone estatic
I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone estatic
Mr. Pizer, I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone estatic
I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone estatic

Every day I suffer, but 11 years have passed
All I've witnessed it, and the nightmares last
Sitting in my living room, another strange feeling
I think I'm hearing tiny footsteps on the ceiling
Looking in my mirror, the image isn't clear
I feel as if a little girl is standing at my rear
Then I awake at the blink of an eye
Voices from the attic yelling, ""Why?""
What if Amy wasn't dead, living in the box
Banging on the walls, rattling the locks
Feeding on the roaches, rodents, and filth
And when there's nothing left, she feeds off herself
Why do I think of Amy in this way?
She was once a lovely girl running out to play
Maybe it's all a dream, insane fanatic
Maybe there's no Amy in the attic after all

Many years have passed me by
I'm thinking ""Did she really die?""
I'm thinking, if it's really true
Then how come I am telling you?
And if I really meant to do it
Should I be a victim to it?
Should I walk the terror stairs
And see if all my terror fairs? No

Mr. Pizer, I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone estatic

Mr. Pizer, I think you should come up here

I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone estatic

Many years have passed me by
I'm thinking ""Did she really die?"" (She's not dead)
I'm thinking, if it's really true
Then how come I am telling you? (Never)
And if I really meant to do it
Should I be a victim to it? (She's not dead!)
Should I walk the terror stairs
And see if all my terror fairs?
Many years have passed me by (Amy isn't dead)
I'm thinking ""Did she really die?"" (Amy isn't dead)
I'm thinking, if it's really true (Amy isn't dead)
Then how come I am telling you? (Amy isn't dead)
And if I really meant to do it (Amy isn't dead)
Should I be a victim to it? (Amy isn't dead)
Should I walk the terror stairs (Amy isn't dead)
And see if all my terror fairs? (Amy never, Amy never, Amy never)

Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone estatic
Barrel's to my dome, my semi Glock is automatic
Should I pull the trigger? Would this break the chains
That keeps Amy locked in my brain?
No, I must be starting to pray that I'm wrong
I pray it's just a fantasy that's carried on too long
Amy isn't dead, I never knew an Amy
I was just a boy, how can you blame me?
Many nights of feeling as if tapping at the wall
I see a darling little girl is floating down the hall
Slowly coming toward me, her arms are spreading wide
Opens up her mouth to show the maggots inside
Crying, dying, rotting is the feeling
Tiny drips of blood dropping from the ceiling
Landing on my head, I'm psycho-sick, I've finally had it
Amy, now I'm coming to the attic!

Many years have passed me by
I'm thinking ""Did she really die?""
I'm thinking, if it's really true
Then how come I am telling you?
And if I really meant to do it
Should I be a victim to it?

The Night of the 44,The Wraith: Hell’s Pit,2004,"It's one of those nights (Another one of those nights!)
The night of the 44
2:30 in the morning, and I'm fully loaded
Fully fuckin' loaded, bitch!
Full caliber

I ran into a gas station, and blew somebody head off they neck (*gunshot*)
I thought it was a dream, but then I look and see that I'm a bloody wreck (Oh my God)
I can't run to my mama house, I know that she would never understand (She would never understand)
I might as well be a man and finish what the fuck I began (Fuck it. It's on)
I walked out and started walking away like I ain't seen a fuckin' thing (Like I ain't seen a fuckin' thing)
I went across the street and walked up to the drive-thru window at a Burger King (At a Burger King)
I knocked on the glass and the kid leaned out to tell me they were closed (Close this!) (*gunshot*)
I blew a hole in his face and his boy was like ""Damn, you got hosed, Tommy, you got hosed""

I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
(Night of the forty-forty-forty)
Shoot they bitch asses!
(Forty-forty-forty)
Thinkin' they ain't about to get shot!
(Forty-forty-forty-four)
Man, fuck that!

I started hopping through backyards and ran into a 7-11 (Ran into a 7-11)
Jumped up on the counter, aimed my shit and blew a hole in his melon (Blew a hole in his melon)
I dragged his body in the back and did the same to everybody again (Did the same to everybody again)
'Til the walls and the windows got so bloody, wasn't nobody comin' in (Wasn't nobody comin' in)
(""Come out with your hands up"")
Police started surrounding the building and I ain't got no hostages
But I fronted like I did, holdin' up some dead kid
I said I'm comin' out, they said ""don't bother"" and started shootin' (Damn)
The corpse I'm holding up ain't got no head and they ain't stupid
I ran into the back and started drinkin' Drano bottles
Gettin' high as fuck, I'm going out in a hail of bullets full throttle
I loaded my shit again, but I never had a chance to shoot
Somebody blew my head off, all I heard was ""Whoooff!""
On the night of the 44

I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)

Who hasn't gone on a PCP binge
And shot at a couple of cops?
I mean, c'mon!

I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I feel ready to die but it's taking so long

Fuck My Dad (Richard Bruce),"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"(Intro)
Jumpsteady:
You left our mom with 3 little kids without a dime of child support she worked 3 jobs for mad years too provide for us while you just bounced without never looking back you aren't even worth the anger but if I ever seen you again I would just start punching you in your face until your teeth caved in just out of respect for our moms

Dear dead beat dad, suck a fat dick coward
We turned out dangerous, and high powered
I thank god, you wasn't around
To instill your bitchness, in our business
Faint memories, yeah I have some
A clear conscious, you don't have one
What kind of heartless fool takes off on three kids and a wife
(You soft)
Sorry rick, hope you like dick
Cause you'll be sucking 'em in hell, you prick
Don't feel like you forgot some people
Look in the mirror, don't you see evil?
Left us for dead, never looked back
All that having a father, you took that
Well fuck you, cause I never understood that
And if we ever cross paths imma react
(Hook)
Fuck my dad, fuck my dead beat dad
Punk bitch couldn't hang, and I'm glad
If your dad's like Richard bruce, and you got something to say scream, thanks for nothing bitch
(repeat)
(Verse 2)
Your own brother tried to pick up the pieces
But saw nothing but doom for these kids
And in the void you left, stepped in a satan
That has affected our family now for generations
We still feel that pain to this day
And I'm blaming it on you, for laming us away
No child support no help no care, where the fuck was you in our lives
(Nowhere)
That fucking blows my mind, I can't fathom the bitch in you
I hope you hear this and it sickens you pig, no thanks to you, bitch
I got a hottie-ass wife and two beautiful kids
A family worldwide I ain't doing bad, I hope you're broke, alone, and sad
I swear to god I'll be glad
Eat a fist up you gutless bastard of a man
And if I meet you, I'm socking you, its always been the plan
(Hook x2)
(Verse 3)
My dead beat dad, my dead beat dad
Mr. Richard Bruce is a dead beat dad
Somewhere in Arizona, a prison guard
It figures, you'd be a fucking pig in the yard (Bitch)
Whoever you are, wherever you go
My family tree will always know, what a ho Richard Bruce was and is, or is it Rick?
You ain't worth this beat, bitch, you make me sick
(Hook x2)
(Outro)
He ain't shit
Rick Bruce
He ain't shit

He ain't shit

Thanks for nothing, bitch
He ain't shit

Alright, is Eddy around?
Can I hear from Eddy today?
Eddy, do you wanna tell me what's on your mind

Bloody red, bloodshed, gutted hoes, and death
Hatin' women, I kill 'em 'til it ain't none left
Call me Machete Eddy, tell Betty be ready
Slice her titties off and chop 'em into slops of spaghetti

Not good
Okay, how about Hank?
Hank, what's up with you today?
How's the diet going?

I wanna fuck a fat lady, have fat babies
And love 'em and shove 'em in a fat microwave oven
And eat 'em naked in my backyard at midnight grubbin'
Run to the toilet, guts bubblin', and blow it up

Jesus Christ
And what about Dan?
Is my friend Dan around today?

Dan man, here
I had three sisters, four brothers
I killed all of them fother muckers
A sacrifice for the girl I loved, who cares if she's a he? Listen
I was born a she, why do we keep missing?

Eddy, are you there?
You're not planning to harm any women, right?
Remember, we talked about self control

Fuck that, I'm gonna fuckin' murder Khloe Kardashian
Run straight through her front door and crash it in
Headbutt her motherfuckin' forehead and bash it in
Snap pics of the dead bitch and cash 'em in

Yeah, okay, and Hank?
How 'bout you, buddy?
How are you doing with self control?

It's Fat Hank again
Uh, look here, I chewed off my own toe
The pain was vicious but the shit was delicious
I ate my left hand too, you think it's dumb shit
But I don't know though, yo, 'cause it was scrumptious

Dan, are you in there?
Dan, you've got someone at home who loves you very much
Somebody special, right?

I guess, but I kind of turned her head backwards
I heard a snap, her skin wrinkled, I whacked her silly
And I shaved all the hair off the back of her melon
And painted Love's face there, ""Welcome back,"" I tell him or her

Obviously I need to increase your medication

Eddy, do you remember the exercises to calm your anger?
How you feeling buddy?

I feel like I'm sick of killing hookers, it's too easy
Cops say, ""So what?"" and yawn
Unless you leave the bloody, naked slut on they lawn
They don't give a shit, I need to off a bitch cop
A bitch judge, I need to... Say, Doc, what's your wife do?

Let's keep the focus on you, Eddy
So Hank, we talked about living a healthy lifestyle
What have you done to improve your health?

Uh, I shot an athlete in the head and ate his heart for a start
I shot a scholar in the heart and ate his brain for the smarts
I shot a porn star and ate his junk to be dick strong
But caught full blown AIDS, I'll be gone before the song

Dan, have you been avoiding stress?
We talked about you relaxing and maybe having some fun

My buddy Dustin, lately (Hey Dustin)
We've been gagging each other (Oops)
So I've been shaggin' his 83-year-old mother
He was asleep, I cut his head off with a sword, classic
When he went to comb his hair, it wasn't there, fantastic

Walk into the Darkness,The Wraith: Hell’s Pit,2004,"In the name of the Witch, I cut the head off a mule
I gutted it out, put it on and then I wore it to school
That ain't the only thing I wore, I wore a clip and some rounds
A fuckin' killa with this mule head and I'm clippin' 'em down
Because I'm all out of choices and my voice is unheard
You and your boys get the worst, I aim your forehead and burst
I'm evil, fires in my sky, I see no diamonds it's true
Aim for your guts and blow your breakfast out behind you
I'm one with the darkness...

Walk into the darkness

Wicked, dark and heartless
(We keep it nutty and bloody for everybody here)

I'm goin' to hell
And I'm knowin' it well
And I got no problem showin' it
And goin' to jail

I see the Witch is preaching every night on channel 13
He wants some money with the number on the screen
, I hit the scene
I'm shootin' up somebody's funeral, someone I don't know
My thoughts are fraught with homicide, I fire out of control
The preacher tried to reach his Caddy in his mink white robe
But now he's like a sheep slaughtered on the side of the road
As for that crooked choir, I set that place up on fire
As they came out, batted their heads like I was Mark McGwire
I'm in the darkness...


I'm goin' to Hell, and I'm knowin' it well
And I got no problem showin' it and goin' to jail

Walk 'til you fall into the darkness of Hell
You gettin' raped in Hell, by Satan's tail
And all you bitches with them pussies, believe you gettin' fucked
By a 27 foot dragon while chewin' your face up
It ain't pretty in Hell, and the only light
Be the fire that you squirm in while you burnin' all night
And when the Wraith take you, his grip is hard as a nail
He'll turn your world upside down and make it rain Hell...

Walk into the darkness
(He'll turn your world upside down and make it rain Hell)
Wicked, dark and heartless
(He'll turn your world upside down and make it rain Hell)

I'm goin' to Hell, and I'm knowin' it well

Southwest Song,The Ringmaster,1994,"Good people sometimes think bad things
Good people dream bad things. Don't you?
Good people even do bad things
Once in a while, we do

Factory smoke and choke in pain
'Cause Delray funk is in my brain
So I break the law, but I'm not to blame
You only know my place, you don't know my name
Well, I grip the fence and bend the steal
And I steal a car and I grip the wheel
And I park the car then I steal it again
'Cause I really don't know what's happening
I wait for night to fall, and then I walk outside
And then I run back in, 'cause I don't wanna die
You see, the air alone, it can corrupt your brain
As smoke fills the sky enough to block the rain
And I pray to God to help and justify
Look over me 'cause my brain is fried
And I don't have a name, I don't have a home
I just lay alone on my bed of stone
You see, death awaits me on my narrow path
And when I stop to think, I can only laugh
Because I'm not alone, it didn't take me long
To see everybody singing that southwest song

Oh, oh we-oh (Come on now)
Everybody singin' that southwest song
Oh, oh we-oh (It's alright)
Everybody singin' that southwest song

Some say I'm real, and some say I'm fake
But I really don't care, 'cause it's all too late
You see, my mind is weak and I'm losing breath
As I crawl along, I can feel the death
Everywhere I go I bring with me pride
And then I pay the carny and I take a ride
But see, the wheel is wicked and it spins me death
So I try it again with what pride is left
If we have to go then you can take me fast
You see, I started under and I'm sinking fast
And when the joker's card is missing from your deck
Then you know the road has finally caught my neck
Eh, yo, don't look, now that there we go again
It's me and the grim reaper, best of friends
He's always hanging 'round waiting for me to die
We shot a game of pool, he's not a bad guy
I feel him in the corner of a circled room
At about thirteen in the afternoon
And then I see the strain as I walk along
I notice everybody singing that southwest song

Oh, oh we-oh (Watch out now)
Everybody singin' that southwest song
Oh, oh we-oh (Come on)
Everybody singin' that southwest song

What does seem bad to you?
I'm angry, I'm angry
What does seem bad to you?
I'm angry, I'm angry
(Everybody singing that southwest song)

If my time has come, then I'm ready to go
Shoot me in the face with your forty-four
And when I'm falling down to my sorry death
I'll laugh with my very last breath (Ha ha ha!)
Lose some, win some, it's how it goes
I've been down and out, I took many blows
And theres nothing here I ain't seen before
I'm just a jugglin' juggla jugglin' more
You wanna see the world, you wanna run the town
You wanna meet a girl and wanna settle down
You wanna start a family and ya own a home
I wanna run with a set from the ghetto zone
You see the forks up, see the forks down
But I'm a wicked clown, so don't fuck around
'Cause my brain is gone and it's on it's way
Of exploding, so get off me, dog!
Well, I could be right and I could be wrong
And if I ain't dead now then it won't be long
But it does not matter what set you on
Tonight everybody sings that southwest song

Oh, oh we-oh (Watch out now)
Everybody singin' that southwest song
Oh, oh we-oh (It's wicked)
Everybody singin' that southwest song
Oh, oh we-oh (Will you be long?)
Everybody singin' that southwest song
Oh, oh we-oh (Go on now)
Everybody singin' that southwest song
Oh, oh we-oh (Come on, yeah)
Everybody singin' that southwest song

What seems bad to you?
Is hitting other kids?

""Daddy, Daddy! Look, it's a clown! A clown! Make him do something funny, Daddy, please?
""Ok, God damn it. Hey, Bozo! Come here and do something funny for the boy!""

First Day Out,Carnival of Carnage,1991,"Got another funky rhyme
Another funky, funky rhyme
Got another funky rhyme
Another funky rhyme
Another funky, funky rhyme

Aw shit, man, that's ICP
This is my jam
They were my psychedelic, funkity fuck, intergalactic boys, G
Aw shit

Well they let the gate up so I bail
It's been six months, pick me up from the county jail
With a smart mouth, I paid my dues
Steel toilets, worn blankets and rubber shoes
But I ain't naggin'
Here come the fellas, I can hear the muffler draggin'
Ain't been in the car long
And the Faygo is almost gone
My nuts are kinda hard so I need a mate
So my homeboy's cousin set me up with a blind date
She said, ""Pick me up at 3?""
""Can't bitch, the bus don't ride ya street!"" (Ho)
We gonna eat at Mexican Village
Take a cab and I'll pay the tab
And when she showed up, well I'll be damned
Left my wallet at home on the TV stand
(""Oh shit, well I uh left it at home, it's on the TV stand..."")
Have her payin' and for dinner too
The knot in my sock, it don't fit you
She's all prettied up for nothin'
I'm smellin' like shit and my chin is scruffin'
And I'm chewin' on my food like a pit bull
'Cause I won't front for the ho
Stuck my face in the bowl of soup
And just sucked it all up through my missin' tooth
The bitch jumped up with a boom
""I have to fix my hair"", and broke to the bathroom
She got the tab so I go for mine
And order up some '52 vintage wine
Hey Louie, bring a fuckin' steak with that
Motherfuckers like J will say, ""Fuck that!""
She's back now and her hair ain't fixed
Probably took a long, greasy ass, smelly shit, huh
I ain't sayin' nothin' though
I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout the fuckin' ho
What's up bitch? I'm ready to break
How long can one fat bitch take
Quit snackin' and pay these saps
'Cause we going home to watch tube with Paps

""So Joe uh, what is it that you do for a living?""
""Aw, come on pops""
You seen me sellin' rocks on Vernor and Springwells
Matter of fact, I think I sold to that fat bitch in the kitchen""

Your dad's really cool sweetheart
I mean him lettin' me use his car
And he slipped me a fifty
""Violent J's kinda nifty""
If I'd of hit it, you'd of been home free
But now you're comin' home with me
""Dad I got a bitch in the bedroom
Take your ass to the bar and don't come home soon""
Now The Juggla's known to smack hoes
But I need the shot too, so I switch to the mack mode

Now woman, you know I love you
So why don't you just let me fuck you
Now bitch, I know you's a freak
So lemme get a little kiss on your cheek (What's up)
And a fuck to go with that
Come on nympho, lemme hit that
Tell ya what, ya let me stick it
And I got a leftover piece of chicken for ya (Ho)
Ya little sewer skank (Sewer skank)
Ya nasty little pipe smokin, sack chasin' ho
And that was that
A little smooth talkin', she was on her back (Ha)
And I'm finally stickin'
Dump ya and I'm keepin' my chicken (Bitch)
You'll never guess what

I need a bitch who pussy poppin' booty switch
I need a bitch, felatio
On the freeway with my pedal to the flo'
I need a bitch, like cheery pie
I need a bitch like Bushwick Bill need a eye
I need a bitch, an alcoholic
I need a bitch pukin', bent over my toilet
The bitchy bitch, bitchin' about nothin'
I need a bitch to jizm in her bellybutton
I need a bitch, a prostitute
She'd fuck my homies and we could split the loot

I need my cheery pie
Baby I want you, baby I want my cherry pie
Baby I want you, baby I need my cherry pie
Baby I want you, baby gimme my cherry pie
Baby I want you, my cherry cherry pie

I need a bitch, fresh out the pen
I need a bitch like Harland Williams need a chin
I need a bitch, a mental case
She cuts me cheap and shoots us both in the face
I need a ho, to use me for my money
I need a bitch like Chris Candido needed Sunny
I need a freak like cherry pie
Like whipped cream and lemon che-che-cherry pie
I need a woman , to let me hit it
In the bushes raw at the herpes clinic
I need a bitch, who like to fight
And get her nose ring pulled out every night
(Ow bitch!)


I need a bitch in a cheap hotel
So I don't know which one to blame for the smell
I need a bitch, that doesn't care
She like to finger fuck her booty in the mirror
Cherry pie, my cherry pie
Cherry pie with lemon jell-o cherry pie
I need a bitch huracanrana
A bitch who suck on dick like Eminem mama

I need a bitch who like bananas in her butt

The Mom Song,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 3",2001,"This is for mom
Miss Linda Harwood
Miss Cathy Hill
This is for you
I respect my mother
With every step I take
She was there for my first step
In the first place
Everybody wants out on their own
Now that I'm grown
I wanna be back home
In a world full of vipers
Only my mother's love was righteous
I feel I've been to hell and back three times
I could never sum it up with these rhymes
Looking for a story to share
With somebody, but they never seem to care
While I'm looking for this person everywhere
I'm slippin', cause my mom is right here
Life moves along so fast
When I see real love at last it's past
That ain't gonna happen to me
I can hear my conscience rapping to me
It's like ""Hey, you've only got one real friend
From the cradle, to the grave, and back again.""
With unconditional love
That's my mother I'm speakin' of
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
My love will never change (My love will never change)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
(Mamma)
And I know it's true
Even in my darkest time
In my darkest hour
When my heart is blind
And I'm giving nobody respect
My mother's there to put my ass in check
And she don't play that mister famous trash
She was putting them diapers on my ass
She's seen every side of me
It don't matter how thuggish I'd try to be
NAW every week in the back yard
Now I'm in the big time, trying to act hard
What mattered when I looked a years back
Was mamma, bringing the chairs back
Supportin' every dream I got
You best believe, man, I dreamed a lot
Me and Rude Boy, I'm trying to tell ya
Not a day goes by in life, we don't feel ya
We ain't taking nothing for granted
Mom's lasagna is so good I can't stand it!
Mrs. Hill always greets me with a hug
Now I see where Rudy got all his love
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
My love will never change (My love will never change)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
(Mamma)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
My love will never change (My love will never change)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
(Mamma)
Everybody around me, they use me, and go for self
They want cash, equity, bank and wealth
Mom puts that on the shelf
All she cares about is my health
It all seems too good to be
As I'm battling life, mamma's backin' me
And she only really wants one thing of mine
Just a little time
Mother, in this world of scars
Money and snakes and labeled wars
Whatever else life puts me through
It's all #2
When it comes to you
And your love is all I treasure
My real father just didn't measure
He was gone, without a thing to say!
I know he would have failed in comparison anyway
You gave me 3 times the love
Enough for you, him, and the God above
Rude Boy, his daddy was strong
Stayed holding on when the ease was gone
Now a days, everything's all right
Millionaire rocking these microphones all night
Makin' all of our dreams come true
And we're full of love, mamma, thanks to you.!
I'm still sorry about the china cabinet
Wish I could bring it all back now, dammit!
Linda, Ron, Cathy and Ryo
We want you to know that we love you
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
My love will never change (My love will never change)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
(Mamma)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is)
My love will never change (My love will never change)

Don't look for a job 'cause there's no jobs looking for me

We in the balcony bustin, gone off PCP and Smirnoff)
Shot again, I missed and hit somebody in the choir
They fell back into the candle rack and caught the place on fire
(I shot again, I finally caught the preacher in his dome
Then we put our barrells to each other's heads and took it home!)

Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas (I gotta bloody 'em up!)
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)
Crooked preacher killas (Leave the fuckin kids alone!)
Crooked preacher killas (Faggots!)
Crooked preacher killas (I gotta bloody 'em up!)
Crooked preacher killas (Stop it!)

It’s All Over,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"The end is coming, repent now or forever burn!
The end of the world is here, the signs are everywhere, it's all over!

Holy fuck it's hot outside, extra hot
The sun is closer then it's ever got
The sky's polluted, it's raining crud
Pandemonium throughout the hood
Every hour the planet shakes
Buildings collapse from the earthquakes
Freeways are packed, horns are blowing
Nobody really knowing where the fuck they're going
Tidal waves swallowing the shores
Coffins pushing up through your floors
It's suddenly freezing, we fall to pieces
Pray for Allah, and call to Jesus
Some stay home and hold their wives
Others flip out and end their lives
Me, I climb the roof of my house
Spread my arms out, and sing:

It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)

Huh, walking along my path
The city has morphed into a blood bath
Some are looting, others shooting
The devil's in the sky and he's recruiting
Tornados twisting through downtown
Throwing buses and trucks around
It's snowing, hailing, and burning up
I rock my headphones and turn 'em up
Folks dying, crying, dead and crawlin'
Run to the church, can't fit 'em all in
Watch the groundscape crack in half
A bottomless pit down Gratiot Ave
Some stay home and welcome death
Appreciating each additional breath
Me, I climb the roof of my house
Spread my arms out, and sing:

It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)

Fire, ice, lava, winds
Hurricanes, Earthquakes
Taking it all in (wow)
Taking it all in (wow)
Acid rain, lighting, sin
Earth shattering
Taking it all in (wow)
Taking it all in (wow)

Boulders fuckin' fall from the sky
Death with no clue when or why
The sun explodes and we absorb it
Our planet spins right out of orbit
Aliens show up and eat mankind
A virus spreads with no cure to find
God has had enough of our shit
A nuclear war breaks out and that's it
To be on this planet living your life
To see it all end would be alright
You can't complain, you wouldn't die alone
You can die with loved ones and die at home
And you're not missing anything when you're gone
Plus seeing it all end and what goes on
To see this great world come to an end
Would be the next best to seeing it begin

It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)

Implosions!
Explosions!
Corrosion!
Burnt up and frozen!
The sky is falling!
The gods are calling!
It's all appalling!
This shit we all in!

It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go, here we come and there we go)

Parked in a spot good enough to hawk her

And you know a Joker caught ya

And I ain't even got a fucking kiss on the cheek!
She's with some fuck face
I'ma put that college boy in a neck brace!
I gotta just chill
She loves me lots and that's for real!
That night, I snuck in her back do'
With a bucket of chicken and a bottle of Faygo
Tip toe, tip top creeping
Cos I know my baby's sleeping
Snuck to the bedroom, looked through
""Ahhhh!"" She stuck me in the eye with a broom!
Shoowhup! Pulled it out
Popped my eye back in, I can't find her
Ran through the bedroom, ran through the living room
Ran for the bathroom, got to take a dune
Now I stress, pulling out my hair
I think I heard that bitch upstairs!
Up the steps, wicked clown
Then I hear a clicking sound
Honey, is that you?
How's about a kissy smoochie poo?
*Gunshots* Her daddy's gun to my nugget
Never liked the bitch anyway, fuck it!

""So what'd you do?""
""I tried to run
But he was always right there
Just ahead of me
He would always catch me and...
Hurt me""

What About Now?,The Tempest,2007,"[Verse 1: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
I remember beatin down the block was the thing to do
In my fisherman hat with the kangaroo
Everybody rap, thought they hood was Compton
And the wolves yelled (oww) with 6 x 9's rockin
I remember the Doors, I remember Live-Aid
And I remember every year Jerry Lewis got paid
I remember shit live back when nobody missed it
Like Mike first doin the moonwalk and spinnin'
I remember the hippies smokin grass and fuckin
Disco dancin floor lights I'm cuttin
I remember Beatlemania sweepin the planet
All that screamin from hoes, I couldn't stand it
I remember Bruce Lee, PS3 to Pong
Spandex, hair metal, rock love songs
But everything's came and gone somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

Nothin, let me know
Sure feel like nothin, let me know what
Might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good
[Verse 2: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
I remember when the twist was the thing to do
Slap grease on your head and hoes hang with you
I remember punk rock when it wasn't for sale
And death metal scarin people straight to hell
So many different cliques and crews to belong to
All identified by the music they drawn to
Check the status of your apparatus and then go
Nowaday, it ain't that clear though
I remember when jazz was born in New Orleans
Mom-and-pop record stores, I'd explore these
I remember when you handed in a newer 8-track
You got three old ones back, dope
I was at the first Woodstock, backstage
I smoked a joint and dropped acid with Jimmy Page
I can't believe it's all over somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

Nothin, let me know
Sure feel like nothin, let me know what
Might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?
[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope & 
Violent J
]
I remember Led Zeppelin laid Stairway to Heaven
I delivered a pizza to they studio session
I was there when Beethoven went deaf and blind
He just kept playin like he ain't even mind it
I sold pills to Elvis, he let me backstage
I stole his guitar, later sold it on eBay
I cannot believe it's all over somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

Nothin, let me know
Sure feel like nothin, let me know what
Might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

Mr. Happy,Bizzar,2000,"Rub baby oil on your buttcheeks and slide on the top of the table
Boys and girls, everybody gather around, all in together now
Wheeeeee!
I love you, I love you, (dance with me, dance with me) I love you (shake ya little butt, shake ya butt, come on)
I love you
I must kill you, must kill you, must kill you, must kill you
I'm kind of fat and I sweat a lot
But that's the only bad quirky things that I got
That, and maybe the whole murdering aspect
But we ain't even really got to that yet
I love people, (yes) I love everything about them
And that's why I gotta live life without them. (huh?)
I know it don't make any sense to you, but fuck you
This song is about me, exclusively
Murder, Murderous, Murderation
A murdering mentality without an explanation
I'm Mr. Happy and I ride a bike (ching!)
I ain't got a seat, I just sit on the pipe thing
I'll whistle, I sing, I'll pet your poodle
(Come here) I'll twist and squeeze your neck like a wet noodle
Cause I'm so happy I'll stab your ass
And lay down next to you, dead on the grass
And say: ""Oh it feels so good, every time I murder I get happy!!""
Happy happy happy, it's gone
Happy happy happy, it's gone
Happy happy happy, it's gone
Happy happy happy, it's gone
Murder murder murder, you are
Murder murder murder, you are
Murder murder murder, you are
Murder murder murder, you are
I love you, so hand me your neck (come on)
Let me teach you about love and respect
Respect the fact that I love to kill!
Wait a minute ya'll I gotta take my pill
Zanoff's, it works, I'm down to only 3 people a day
My victims, I give them love and care
I don't wanna get blood everywhere
I don't use a chainsaw, or a butcher knife
That's so 90's, get it right
I never mutilate or chop my loves
All I really need is a pair of gloves
Or maybe a car, I'll run 'em down with it
I know that can be messy, but the birds will get it
Don't you see that I love you idiots
I'm Mr. Happy, I'm all about fun
Now get in the pit and try to kill someone!
""Oh it feels so good, every time I murder I get happy!!""
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
My bike has a basket full of strawberries, I picked them myself
Along with apples and cherries and lemons
And oranges and boogers and limes
Plus thers's a Faygo in there, but that's mine
Red flowers, like after your dead
I plant seeds and grow them out the side of your head
I got flowers all over the backyard
In the form of a Jokers Card (uh-oh)
Feels good, I'm like the Choko of my neighborhood
I'm one of them midnight creeps at Denny's
Talking to myself and licking my pennies
I got a french fry hanging out of my beard
Don't go near that guy, he's weird
You know I'm all good and everythings all right
When you hear this scream in the middle of the night, like this:
""Oh it feels so good, everytime I murder I get happy!!""
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
Murder murder murder, you are (Must kill you)
I'll fucking kill you, Wooo! Come here you little bitch!
Come on! Everybody, let me cut your neck in half
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)
Happy happy happy, it's gone (I love you)

Taste,Carnival of Carnage,1991,"Heard thoughts going on in the free world
Broke out the asylum and killed a girl
Just a warm-up, just to get it on
'Cause I'ma be cutting throats 'til the break of dawn
Can't nobody get me
I've always been a psycho, but now they coming with me
That's straight, could we team up?
'Cause I believe every throat deserves a good cut
Look in my brain, it's fucking insane
Roll around naked in the acid rain
Rich bitch fucker took me for a sucker
Now we killing you instead of killing each other
Walked in your house, shot him in the mouth
Lean back the head and pour the brains out
My lyrics are strong, it's only a song
The government front like they don't know what's going on
Fuck it, I'll take the matter in my own hands
Cut you down cat, cut you down
'Cause I know the rich go joggin'
And I'm waiting in the bushes, axe to the noggin
(""Come on, come on now, bitch, come on"")
About 30, 40 times
Psychedelic sick with the psycho, psycho rhymes
But you keep the killin' in one place
But I'm at your door, motherfucker, have a taste

Fucking you up, won't let you pass
Fucking you up, shot you in the ass
Jumped out the alleyway with a motherfucking battle axe
12 dead bodies on the motherfucking train tracks
I'm sick of this shit on my TV
They showing psychopathics and I see me
And you're calling me a homeless hobo
While I'm laying on my suede couch listening to Mojo
Snipe you in the head from a tower
Or chase your naked ass clean out the shower
Finally catch you down the block
Take this here gat, shoot you in the cock
Who you fucking with Governor E?
Don't you know I'll hang your dead ass from a tree
Yup, then swing you by the foot
Mr. Drummond looking, bald headed, punk bitch
Strolled to the banquet party
Drank all their brew, then shot everybody
They set it up wrong
Created the ghetto and thought it wouldn't last long
Thought we'd kill each other off
Didn't think we'd come to the suburbs, jackoff
The clown'll stick his knife in your face
Motherfucker, have a taste

In Detroit, do or die, die and be done with
Another wild solution 'cause it's nothing but a wicked man
How many motherfuckers have I known through the years
Got their necks blown out or crippled, living in fear
Now I'ma tell you 'cause I  how many  but they missed
'Cause I'm drawn  from the vision of the Iron Fist
Raised with the crime, with nothing to eat
So my natural instinct's to kill in the street
But I'm above that, a sense of caution
Jumpsteady stepping over the government's brainwashing
(Take it, take it further, take it further, take it far)
Don't let them even judge you 'cause you know who you are
Seems they don't even know about the inner city crime war
Money on the troops in the desert, what the fuck for
Damn they're stupid, their minds must be failing
Think I'd rather pay a little extra to a gallon
To save a human life, or two
End this ghetto war for the homies that I once knew
You're peeping out the barn with your closed eyes
(You're peeping out the barn with your closed eyes, ho)
I got a mind killing rage waiting for change
In the folds of my jacket I cradle my gauge
What you gonna do when I show up at your place
Try to ignore it this time, motherfucker, have a taste

You need a spoonful, in other words, a little taste
So let me feed you the city life at a steady pace
Wake up to gunfire thinking it was a dream
'Til you hear neighbors holler and a young child scream
Everyday thing, think you can take it
Just wait 'til you see that crackhead at your front door naked
Begging for money, acting like he know ya
You slam the door in fear, but some day he'll show ya
Catch you at blank point range, you getting jacked
(""Come up with it, bitch!"") Now you don't know how to act
But that's life and experience is a mother
Happens everyday, one after the other
But the suburb living is high class
Well, High Class, let the city trade with your ass
And show you the rough times
Hungry homeless people committing crime after crime
And bitches roaming the pipes for dough
Then they run to the rock sto' and to buy some rock snow
And I hear you making fun of that
ICP, (""What's up, E?"") Get your bats
It's time for you to crack some necks
And if they don't know now, show them what to expect
'Cause it doesn't matter the race or the place
Capital E, giving the inner city taste

Yeah, we headed for Birmingham, Grosse Pointe, and Beverly Hills
I thought you knew, 'cause we in a devilish mood

Guess who's rolling with the ICP
The Black Devil coming straight from the D
I'm headed out to Birmingham
My temperature is burnin', man
Looking for the governor to kill him and I think I can
Violent J know the way so I'm gonna get you
If you're standing in my way I'm getting with ya
The Black Devil, that devil you don't know
Getting more pussy than Bel Biv DeVoe
Hey man do you know my name?
(Esham) I'm down with NATAS, not Soul Train
So give me mine 'cause it ain't about black or white
It ain't about wrong or right on Devil's Night
I'll burn a cross in your fucking face
Now homicide's got a new case
So give me a taste (So give me a taste) (So give me a taste) (So give me a taste) (So give me a taste)

Just, just a little taste, just a little taste
Just, just, have a little taste, have a little taste
Just, just, just a little taste, just a little taste
Just, just, have a little taste, have a little taste
Just, just, just a little taste, just a little taste

Mr. Johnson’s Head,The Ringmaster,1994,"""Hello, class. My name's Mr. Felcher""
(""Dude, I'm sick of all these substitutes, dog. Where the fuck is Mr. Johnson at?"")
""Mr. Johnson seems to be out today with a virus, so I'll be your substitute teacher this afternoon.""
(""Dude, I don't know, dude,  at fucking home, jacking off, man"")
""Now children, I don't want any shenanigans or horseplay""
(""Naw, dog"")
""There'll be no gum chewing, and please raise your hand if you wish to speak""
(""You think so, man?"" ""No way, he's a fucking dork"")
""If any of these rules are broken, I'll write your name down, and Mr. Johnson will punish you as he sees fit""
(""Naw dog, guess what I heard, man. I heard he's dead"" ""No way!"")

Sitting in the class with my head on the desk
Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit
Nobody even notices I'm here 'cause I ain't shit
I'm hearing voices but I don't know what they saying
Sweat is on my forehead 'cause my brain's inside decaying
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea
She's talking to her friends, I'm in the corner and I see her
Something's happening but it isn't very clear
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall
Some are yelling ""sick"" and the others stop and stare
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere
See, my head is spinning 'cause I'm lonely and I'm twisted
But I have a secret, everybody missed it
I'm just a nobody, and I think it's a drag
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag

I wish somebody knew me, 'cause then they could say I'm wrong
But since nobody knows me, I got it going on
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock
I guess I'm just a ghost 'cause everybody walks through me
If I died in class, they would probably say they knew me
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move
A dead body rotting in the back of the room
For weeks and months, stinking up the class
Until somebody notice, then they'd throw me in the trash
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud
I don't give a fuck to learn you're all going to hell
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell
But I have a key, it's called insanity
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag

""Okay, today we're gonna learn about our great freedom. If you'll turn your textbooks to chapter four, we'll get started. America is the land of the free, all races live together in harmony, and we are all treated equal, we all live together in the same wealthy community... Yes?""
""Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?""
""Uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now, but, uh""

No, they can sit and front about it all day
But I left his fucking body in the hallway
And in the morning they opened up the door
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard
I could chop my arms off and run around the class
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast
'Cause they'd rather learn about redneck chicker
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter
Fuck Washington, Benjamin, fuck em all out
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out
And the class wanna know who could it be
But I'm like Dewey , you ain't never heard of me
I'm just a nobody, and I think it's a drag
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag

I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day

I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway (Not another day)
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag (Day)
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag (Not another day)
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day (Couldn't stand the pressure)
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway (Couldn't stand the pressure)
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag (Not another day)
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day (Where ya gonna go?)
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway (Where ya gonna go?)
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag (Where ya gonna go?)
I cut the bigot's head off and I stuffed it in my bag (I couldn't stand the pressure, not another mother fucking day)
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day (I couldn't stand the pressure)
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway (I couldn't stand the pressure)
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag (No! No! No! No!)

I’m Coming Home,Riddle Box,1995,"I live my life in the gutter
And this gutter is who I am
Take me back home to my gutter
And I swear I won't ever leave again!

Hey, I'm coming home
Home to the criminals and crooks
Home to the gangbangers shooting dirty looks
Home to the killer cops beating on my ass
Home to my '72 Volaré, praying it will last
Past all the rich bitches trying to play me out
Doggin' on my neighborhood, don't know what it's about
So now I'm clockin' ducats, never hang out with the rich
I'd rather hang out with the crackheads at the party store, bitch
Give me Coney, dog, with a little smog
Nothin' tastes better than the poisonous fog
Seeping from the sewers in my slummy neighborhood
But the ghetto got love and the love is all good
So I don't give a fuck about your mansion by the lake
You can suck my dingaling until your neck breaks
Cuz all I wanna do is hang with the zombies in the zone
Break out with the Faygo, I'm coming home

Home to the creatures, home to the crooks
Home to the fools readin' witchcraft books
Home to the monsters roaming the land
I wanna come home but ya don't understand
(Won't you be there?)

Bitch, I'm coming home and I'm not alone
Jokers and freaks, and their dead body bones
Every single thing that you never wanna see
Add it all together and you got me
I know nobody gives a fuck about your punk ass rules
Keystone coppers and your hypocrite schools
I'd much rather lay around the streets of the gutter
And make dirty phone calls to your rich mother
A quarter-past midnight and I'm waking up the dead
Then we playin' kickball with somebody's head
We go skinny dipping in the barrels of toxic waste
After that I pour myself a little taste
So tell your daughter that she's nothing but a fat bitch
And all my homies don't care if the hoe's rich
Somebody out here, please, let me know where there's a phone
I need to call my mother and tell her I'm coming home

Home to the creatures, home to the crooks
Home to the fools readin' witchcraft books
Home to the monsters roaming the land
I wanna come home but ya don't understand

Won't you be there?
Won't you be there?
Won't you be there?
Won't you be there?

And I'm coming home, chicken chicken bones
Sugar plumb bushes, and ice cream cones
All these fake people sayin' hi to one another
Then they sit around and talk shit about each other
Watering they grass, digging in they ass
Trying to make sure they didn't lose any cash
Working hard, all your life, and now you're finally rich
But look at you, you're just another whack bitch

Call it a slum that's where I'm from
Murderers and slaughterers, so that's what I've become
Spare a little change cuz I just ran out of gas
Reach for your quarter and I'll stick your fuckin' ass

Nobody wants to be around the ghetto breed
The ghetto got each other and that's all we really need

So what the fuck I'm doing down here? I got a land of my own

Eh yo, dawg, fuck it, huh, we going home",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-im-coming-home-lyrics
Night of the Axe,Carnival of Carnage,1991,"Showed up at your high school prom
With a axe in my mother fuckin' palm
And I jumped out the first date, swingin'
Necks and backs went flingin', and a toe
I went psychopathic
Choppin' throats with a hatchet
'Cause they tryna get me
So I took a head with me
Ran down the hall butt naked
If you gotta life, I'ma take it
Hah, 'cause I got it goin' on
And I broke to the female John (Scream)
Motherfuckers think I'm sick
You ever seen a bitch take a shit? Fuck that!
Let her dookie ass be
'Cause females shittin' is news to me
Climbed down the fire escape
How many lives can one motherfucker take?
One life, two life, three life, four
Throw me a MAC-10, I'm bound to take more
Fifty lives, comin' on eighty
Fuck this, I'm finna whoop this lady!
Tied the bitch up to a light post
Slap her in the face 'cause I'm psycho
Beat her down, and beat her up
(Whup, whup, whup, whup) Fuckin' slut!
Some bitches make me wonder
Kicked her gut and left my number
Call me, fuckin' nympho
Then I threw her through a window (CRASH)
Broke and I climbed up a tree, guy
Came back down, I don't know why
Straight up insanity
Damn, if it ain't a family
Hope they come home soon
Hah, 'cause I'm waitin' in the bedroom

(Unlocks door) Sparky?
We're home, Sparky! (Whistling)
Watch your foot, honey. (Knocking)
Honey, where's Sparky? (Whistling)
Mom, Dad, Lisa's in the bathroom, and I've gotta go really bad!
Don't worry little Joey, I'll get the bitch out! (Screaming)
Mom, Dad!
(Chopping sounds)
Like it? Have another!

Diced up all cinco
Then I threw 'em in the Pinto
Now I'm on Verner, bumpin' the funk
With five dead bodies in the trunk!
And I'm doin' about 90
To the blue and red's behind me (Sirens)
You can pull me over, Jack!
Just don't look in the back

Hey what's your fuckin' hurry son?
Just don't look in the trunk
We got a wild one here, and he's naked
Just don't look in the trunk
He's got blood on his hands and face
Just don't look in the trunk
(Be advised, the car is registered to a Wilson family)
Just don't look in the trunk
Oh, the trunk you say, huh?
Oh okay, what do you say we just have a look-see here
OH SHIT! DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY!!

I'm gone, and I ditched the ride
And left the dead Wilsons inside
Jettin' and I'm hoppin' fences
Finna do like my man in Killeen, Texas
'Cause I'm psycholystic
You look once and you missed it
Look twice and it caught your eye:
Me beatin' the shit outta some guy
With a bag of bricks
Impressin' them dirty-ass sewer chicks
A klepto you can't trust
Shoulda known when I jacked a bus
14 passengers ridin' it
One naked psycho drivin' it
And we goin', grippin
And there'll be no slippin'
'Cause I'm thinkin' the worst
Shit like women and children die first
Make you shiver
When I drove that bitch in the river
Everybody dies
Only me survives
Innocent folks is what I want
So I'm headed for the restaurant

(*Singing* Burritos por favor...)
Ohh, shit, Padro, I'm fuckin' full man
Fuckin' burritos, man
That burrito fucked me up, man. (Screaming)
Ah, shit! Duck, man, fuck!
C'mon motherfuckers! (Screaming)

It's always gotta be a hero
But I can't be stopped with silver bullets
Or a wooden stake
It's your life I quickly take
Don't talk shit, I take 'em
Take your life, take your life
Coppers in choppers pursue
The boys in blue, the whole crew
Do what they never think
So I'm headed for the 18th precinct
'Cause when then finally call it quits
I'll be there to cut their necks
And that's what I did
I hate a fuckin' pig!
I'll get a job at the Doughnut Shop
Just to poison a cop
Hah! Klepto-pathic
And I'll fuck you up in a strait jacket
'Cause they finally got me
Broke my legs and shot me
But I'm still laughin'
'Cause of what happened
On the night of the axe

On the night of the axe
'Cause of what happened, on the night of the axe
On the night of the axe
What happened, what happened
Just psycho, on the night of the axe
Just psycho, just psycho
Just psycho, on the night of the axe (Clunk) (Screaming)

The ghettos of America are breading grounds for the criminal minded
As for years they've killed one another off, and America has enjoyed its creation
Well now those ghetto-minded criminals have crossed the line into your neighborhood, and will soon give you a taste of the hell that they have lived for so long
So, Pops, this time it's your son who gets shot
Deal with your own creation",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-night-of-the-axe-lyrics
Boing Boing,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"[Verse 1: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Bitches get sprung when I walk by
I dunno if it's my ass, or maybe cause I talk fly
But no lie, as soon as I speak to 'em
They all want me to screw em
I introduce myself, and panties start falling
No dinner-dates, fuck stalling
Your girl, his wife, it don't matter
They all want this dick, whole platter
It's dangerous for any chick on my arm
Other hoes wanna cause em bodily harm
Maybe cause I wear my jeans so tight
But they all fight for the right to fuck me all night
These hoes wanna get us, any time, any place
And have clown paint smudged all over their face
They steal my number, catch me on the internet
And tell me all how their nedens are dripping wet
Bitches hang around my home like stray cats
Trying to catch a motherfucker shirtless
Could be my profile, or my haircut (what)
But I turn sweetie boos into sluts
I take it in in the butt is what the lady at the store said
Chick up at Walgreens offering head
I'm like ""Whoa"", and I'm getting free food up at Subway
Every bitch and her mama love J

I can't help but spring these hoes
And they all wanna fuck me
They come to me
And I'm quick to leave a bitch sprung
Boing, boing
And I'm quick to leave a bitch sprung
Boing, boing (Fuck these bitches!)
[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope & 
Violent J
]
Your old lady's got eyes for me
And I know when you're fucking her, she cries for me
Female judges sentence me to do time
I tell them all, make a singe-file dick-line
Ugly ducklings, and beautiful angels
They all dropping their thongs to they ankles
Maybe it's my cologne, RightGuard
I dunno, but for this dick, yo, they fight hard
Hoes love throwing they panties at me
Poop-stains and all, my brain's in awe
Is it my swagger? Or is it my juice? Why?
They want a piece of this wang-nut pie
I could be itching my athlete's feet
And hoes be like ""Awww, that's so sweet!""
And everything translates to sex
Bitches begging me to flex my pecs
Slipping me digits, turn around and goose me
Fighting off ten at a time like fucking Jet Li
Shit's ridiculous, I'm like ""Slow down""
I got plenty of pipe to go around
Two are in the kitchen, three in the bathtub
I'm with somebody fat wife making mad love
Real women of the worldwide Juggalos
You can ask my bitch, yo mama knows!


Oh, it's been so cocksucking long since I've tasted a big prick like yours!


Man, fuck all these fucking sprung-ass hoes
Yo, this bitch ain't gettin' no dick
 ain't gettin' no dick!
Fuck it!
 ain't gettin' no dick!
Look, I don't give a fuck who the fuck you are!
Unless you're on my dick, you ain't gettin' none!
And fuck you too, bitch!

Yo, the ICP has got the Dog Beats
Inner City Posse and we're playing for keeps
And I know that you're liking this funk
Cause I can hear my voice coming out the trunk of your ride
Don't take me for a sucker
You leave it unattended I'm going to take the motherfucker

2 to the D to the O-P-E
Hitting on three with the ICP
I like bass, treble, and the test up
Girl, kick it in the back of a SEMTA bus
With that Forty-O of that strong Bull
Shooting Craps in the back of the liquor store
And I'm hitting, and we'll keep it at that

You love, Joe?

Nah, I'm 2 Dope for that

Rolling and I'm headed for the Clark Park
Just finished shooting 8 with the Dark Shark
Seen the freak with a bright white tank top
Keep rolling cause I know I'll see my bank drop
Homeboy, if you want to keep your riches
Stay the hell away from them mo' money (censored)
Trucks to the bikes to the Jeeps

Street lights glaring off the windshield
 out of General Wheel
6-pack in the back and 
To keep the sounds up, Fosgate 1000

2 Dope got to keep his own style

Homemade kicker box, four 10-inch Pyles
ICP make the whole car hop
When we let the bass drop

Inner City Posse's got a bad rep
Like my man on the crutches took a big step
And I can't stand the neighborhood menace
So I swell his chin like Rocky Dennis
Bass in the car, something stacked
I know you hear me booming in Pontiac
Everyone's braver when the bass rocks
So I got a little something in the glovebox

Long black hair with a white rag
40-cent Faygo in a brown bag
Jump Steady, Rude Boy, and Nate The Mack
Chilling by my side cause my posse's stacked
I know I'm getting famous, just think for a minute
Stole a car radio and my tape was in it
Sounds bringing life to the streets
The ICP got the Dog Beats

Inner City Posse got the Dog Beats (3x)

Waiting at the light as my bass thumps
And I'm getting jocked by these local chumps
They point, they wave, they stare, they look
I've been jocked so hard I could write a book

Violent J down with the pimp daddies (3x)
Smooth plush rides in a velvet Caddy

All the way live down to Jefferson
Inner City Posse's got the best of them
Will the tape and your system meet

She got up took a shower and hooked me up
And said goodbye and didn't even kiss my cheek
She was polite as fuck cause on her lips was skeet
I got dressed walked out on the lawn it's going on
Block party bitches twerkin' under the sun
Mailman backflippin' does the splits when he land
Hands me a couple checks for $800,000
I slap him a high five then I'm off to get live
Two Bentley's two Bugatti's which one do I drive
My favorite song came on woo I turn up the beat
All my people quick to follow convoy in the street
It's juggalos behind me up front and on the side
Hangin' out the windows sprayin' Faygo as we ride

Fuckin' a hottie in a sleeping bag in the dark park
Behind a tree priests droppin' off kegs of beer
Mike E. Clark, AMB, the homie Legz is here
They set a ring up lucha libre it's jumpin' off
Ain't nobody alone they all humpin' somethin' soft
Sing along with Zug Izland playin' an acoustic set
Everybody's gettin' liver than they use to get
This is somethin' brand new take it to another level
Everybody bum rush we all stompin' the devil
This is too much fun I'm fuckin' blew back some
I crack Beelzebub's head with the butt of my gun
Cops are havin' a ball shit they all gettin' naked
Bustin' shots and screamin' ""fuck the law, let's break it""
Everybody back to my house so the shit don't end
Bright and early tomorrow, we fuckin' do it again

I See the Devil,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"I see the devil
Everytime I fuck a bitch
Tell her I will call her
Throw her number in a ditch
Lie to her face
Just to get my dick blowed
15 minutes later
Tell her hit the road

I see the devil
Everytime I stomp somebody
Run from the scene
With my fists all bloody
Me and my boys
Beating them down in the street
The devil was right there
Watching like sweet

I see the devil
Everytime I lie to my mom
Whenever we argue
I go off like a bomb
Tell her she don't
Understand shit about me
Get in the car
With my homies and flee

I see the devil
Everytime I score some meth
He's standing
Right behind me like death
Every hit that I take
He claps his claws
Just like he does
Everytime another soul falls

Running outta time
Looking for the light
Something isn't right
The devils grip is tight
Cause I'm Running outta time
Leave it all behind
Cause my souls on the line (ooh ooh oh)
Can't nobody hide
From the devil inside

I see the devil
Everytime I take what ain't mine
Whether big or something small
He tells me its fine
He tells me to snatch it
Cause its so apeling
When I lay down at night
I see the devil on the celling

I see the devil
In every bag of dope I sell
Every dollar I make
Brings me closer to hell
I got bitches on my dick
And money to spend
But every road that I take
I see the devil at the end

I see the devil
Every time I drink and drive
I see him right beside me
Telling me to get live
He tells me to floor it
I try to ignore it
He laughs when we crash
And everyone's bloods pouring


I can't run
I can't hide
He's outdoors
He's inside
He's right here
And I swear
He's claiming my soul to bare

I see the devil
Everytime I look in the sky
I see the devil
In the sun and the moon I won't lie
I see the devil
In my own face looking in the mirror
I see the devil
In my crew like he's standing right here

I see the devil in the walls
The devil in trees
The devil on my back
I hear I'm in the breeze
I seen the devil
Bealzabub with horns and a tail
But I'm looking for god
I don't wanna go to hell


Can't find it
From the devil inside
I said I'm sorry
From the devil inside
No! No!
From the devil inside
Noooooooooooooooooo!
Can't find it
I don't wanna go to hell
Can't see hell
I don't wanna go to hell!
Where to go Where yo go
Noooooooooooooooooo!


What have I, what have I found
What have I, what have I found
I see new sights. I hear new sounds
I feel my, my heartbeat pound
What have I, what have I found
What have I, what have I found
I see new sights. I hear new sounds

The World Is Yours,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand
You get your plan together, put your mind to it
Stand up, brush your shoulders off, and do it
You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand
You get your plan together, put your mind to it
Stand up, brush your shoulders off, and do it

I know the world’s fucked up in a lotta ways
Shit's gloomy outside a whole lotta days
You never win shit and play a gang of lotteries
Feel like you're always getting the bone, a lot of sodomies
But when you rise above it all
Open your eyes you’ll love it all
Devil tells you lies, you shove 'em all
And realize you're fly with doves and all
You can't have it 'til you take a stab at it
Until you reach for it, you can't grab it
You might realize you ain't bad at it
And if you fall down your ass is padded
This planet's green or blue for you
There's no limit what you can do
Dive off a tower, fly through a Froot Loop
Land posing in a Troop suit like
Whoop whoop!

You never been up so high
You're living on your own cloud nine
You ain't ever felt so free
Shine bright, let 'em all see
The world is yours
The world is yours

You can have it all it's out there for the takin'
The world is yours like a pig gots bacon
You can be a rock star, homie, I ain't faking
If you think you couldn't pull it off, you're mistaken
You can be a brain surgeon, splurgin' on  bank
You can be a scuba diver, swimming in a fishtank
You can be a fuckin' prisoner, carving out a shank
Alls it takes it nuts and guts to start pulling rank
You can be an astronaut, an ass or not
You can be the kingpin of hash and pot
You can pack a gat and you can blast a lot
You can even run a marathon, fast or not
You can be a cannibal, a vegan, or slob
You can be a cocksucker, go slob a knob
You can be a lazy bum, fuck havin' a job
The world is yours, in or out of the mob


Don't let 'em call you shit for brains
Even the president's got shit stains
We're just squirrels chasing a nut, tryna get brains
I say the cool kids are legitly lame
At some point, bitch, I will surpass you
On my way to my dreams I’ll be glad to
And you don't have any, so I'll have to
Leave your ass in the dust, too bad, dude
I’m headed straight up out of this stratosphere
You wouldn't know it now but I’m the baddest here
I’m a portrait of art and you a splattered smear
My destiny for you? Too bad, it's here
I found my missing link and I’m incredible
Unstoppable and undebtable
Hit me with the tiger claws, I’m unshreddable
Don't live in the darkness, instead I glow


You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand
You get your plan together, put your mind to it
Stand up, brush your shoulders off, and do it
You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand

Ol’ Evil Eye,Riddle Box,1995,"""Start the movie.""

""I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult, for his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye. Yes, it was this. One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture. A pale, blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold. And so, by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever.""

So I'm headed door to door
With my grandmother's cookie jar
I'm sellin' cookies, 12 for a dollar
I ring the doorbell, nobody wants any
I resort to goin' cheaper - 2 for a penny
Anybody, everybody, they hate me
I can tell when they spit and degrade me
There's only one house left, the last on the block
Old Man Willie on the hilltop
I ring the doorbell, the door creeps open
And there it was starin' and scopin'
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin'
I was trippin'. ""Ahh, seeya!""
I ran home. I couldn't stop thinking
About his eyeball winking and blinking
And that looked not a damn thing like the other Ugh!
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker
It hypnotized me, mesmerized me
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me
Creepers, where'd you get that ball
And tell me how it even fits in your skull

I want a big long knife to stick it in
I wanna lift up the eyelid and kick it in
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye!

Evil eye...
Oh-Oh-Eye (The bitch gon' die! The bitch gon' die!
Die-die-diggy-die- knife in his eye)
Evil eye...
Oh-Oh

""Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should've seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded, with what caution, with what foresight, with what dissimulation I went to work. I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.""

A day gone past since I heard about J
Old man I'm finna slay, 'cause I don't fuckin' play
Anyway, I gotta do him in
Got a rusty revolver, put the silver bullets in
I'm plannin' on plantin' one right to his nugget
Down my drawers with the bucket. It's time to go, fuck it
I stuck it... up to his neck when he came to the door
I really didn't know what I was in for
First a cold ass stare, no a gaze, no a stare
Kinda like there was no one there
How weird, my body froze with the blink of his eye
Evil eye, sendin' chills up my spine
What to do? What to do? I gotta try to break
I gotta try to make.. my way to the gate
Wait. I can't move, I'm stuck to the ground
W-What the fuck was that? I think I heard a sound
Turned around, there it was, starin' at my face
This little old man's eye's making me a mental case
That's when I felt the pain deep inside
Deep inside, now his eye's open wide

I want a big long knife to stick it in
I wanna lift up his eyelid and kick it in
He's gonna die. I want his eye buried in my backyard
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye!

Evil eye...
Oh-Oh-Eye (The bitch gon' die! The bitch gon' die!
Die-die-diggy-die- knife in his eye)
Evil eye...
Oh-Oh

""That night it ceased. The old man was dead. I placed my hand on the heart and there for many minutes there was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye will trouble me no longer. His eye will trouble me no longer.""",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-ol-evil-eye-lyrics

Out,The Terror Wheel,1994,"""Please, Willaby, let me off the terror wheel""
""Shut up, bitch! *Slap*
Looks like it's nighty night time""
*Gunshots*
""Only some of you won't be waking up
Ah ha ha ha ha!
As for the rest of you
Sit back, put on your PJ's and nighties
While you hear the story entitled 'Out'
Ah ha ha ha ha!""

What the fuck is up?
I'm in the haugh!
And Violent J's finna tell a story
So sit your ass down
Shut the fuck up
And get schooled, motherfucker

Well I'm waking up so early 'cause I knew this day would come (Yeah)
My daddy's passed out with an empty bottle of rum (Say it, baby)
Although she's been gone long, I do not miss my mother (Come on)
And he's a sorry fuck so there's nothin' in the cupboard (Now)
My little brother's starving, hungry, and sick
Cause ain't nobody coming by the house giving free shit
So we gettin' kinda skinny and my brother's almost dead
Got no other choice but for milk and bread
Stepped out the house for the first time in two years
'Cause my neighborhood it ain't really good
Lay up in my bedroom night after night
I hear screams, zombies shootin' and lootin'
But now here I am, and I'm walkin' down Jefferson
With a bag of moneybacks I don't understand
How the world can be full of so many evildoers
I can hear 'em underneath me, in the sewers
Keep seeing shit out the corners of my eyes
Steady lookin over my back I didn't realize
Where I was goin', I didn't wanna bother anybody
Accidentally stepped on a dead body
""
Hey motherfucker watch where the fuck you're goin'
"" (Sorry)
(Uh oh) ""
I might be dead, but I'll kick your ass
"" ()
Now I apologized, but he still had to talk shit
So I stepped over his face and kept walkin'
And here's the part of my story that get's really scary
Had to walk alone down Military
I can see the crackheads hiding in the trees
Lookin' for some change, lookin' for some brains
Everything seemed too quiet as I walked down the block
Until I got hit with a rock
Can't really tell, I must've been out for quite awhile
'Cause when I woke up, my Nannycoat was outta style
And the crackheads took my moneybacks in a dash
And ripped off my arm in the process
But fuck that shit, I still gots another hand
So I can still get the shit for my little man
And I'ma walk with my nuts hangin out, I ain't scared
But this is where it gets weird
Factories, toxic waste, and chemicals
They have strange effects on the animals
In my neighborhood, and some get a lot bigger
Like the giant rat that jumped on my back
I'm runnin' like a maniac all through the ghetto zone
And it's steady takin bites out my nug bone
Wrestling around, found its tail, so I straight bit it
Then it ripped off my leg and broke with it (Ah! Shit!)
Tried to catch up, but I couldn't move quick enough
This little trip to the store's straight fuckin' me up
But that's ok cause the store's just down the block
So I hop
And it seems all wrong as I look up in the sky
I see the vultures waitin' on me to die
But I made it to the store, so fuck all you hoes
Peep out the sign: 
Hmmm, closed
Picked up a mailbox, threw it through the wall
Cause I'ma get my shit, so fuck all of y'all
Took a loaf of bread and a carton off the shelf
Even took a Faygo two-liter for myself
Walked out the store like a G, that's when I heard
The click-click sound of a Mossberg
The store owner, he didn't like a B&E
That's why he didn't see a problem with buckin' me
Blew my motherfuckin' head off my shoulders
Didn't say nothin', kept buck buckin'
But I gotta say I made it home in a heart beat
Nobody fucks with a head rollin' down the street
Now I think about it, was a full man when leavin' out
Now I'm a head with a loaf of bread in my mouth
Bouncin' up the stairs, I knock on the door with my chin
""Hey yo, little man, won't you let me in?""
And best believe it was good to see my little brother
""
Hey! You forgot the milk, you dumb mother fucker!
""
Lock the door behind me 'cause I'm back on route
Back to the store, and I'm out

""Uh, uh, uh, who's pussy is this, bitch?""
""
Willaby's!
""
""Uh, who's pussy?""
""
It's Willaby's!

""Yeah. Hey, what the fuck are you looking at? Ain't you ever seen pussy before, stupid ass?""
""
Willaby. Willaby, look.

""Slap that ass, bitch! Bitch.""

They're here, Willaby.

""Oh, uh, oh, hey. How's it happenin' again? Hey, this song right here: we're ready to slow it down and get a little sexy, ya know?

Time,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"Time, time, time, time, time, time, time
X2

This life is incredible, a gift from above
But only one thing will last; true love
Time is a beast, it's always breathing
For every morning will have its evening
Time will change everything around you
Time will take away whatever you're bound to
You and your homies enjoying the years
Soon enough everybody disappears
And then new friends will come and go as well
How long will they last? Only time will tell
You might keep a few, but you will grow distant
Look back and it all flew by in an instant
Brand new cars grow old and rusty
Towns abandoned, decayed and dusty
Time, time is a truth, God, believe it
It all becomes a memory once you achieve it

And we say
Time's like an endless road, I know
Where will this road lead me?
Time keeps ticking
Time's like an endless road, I know
Where will this road lead me?

This song is scary but we speak the truth
You can only be new once; that's my proof
Beautiful girls grow withered and wired
Rookies on the job all become retired
A family man who truly loves his life
With three little kids and a loving wife
Better enjoy it now, because time is strong
The kids will grow up, it won't be long
And they'll lead the home, just like you did
Start a family and have they own kids
You can be the coolest dude, getting laid
And one day, be alone, lonely and afraid
In the home tucked away so we don't see 'em
If we live that long, one day we'll be 'em
Time don't slow down, the speed is pace
You can see the time sinking into your face


Time is a monster, bigger than anything
Time will bring down rulers and kings
Time will knock down buildings once new
Time will destroy all of us and you
Even newborn babies, their clock is tickin'
We all have a time limit we were given
Make the best of time, and leave your legacy
And live on in your family's memories
Hope there's an afterlife with all you got
And enjoy it all while we're on the clock
Love your kids, and love your parents
As the world spins on, we just make an appearance
So make it happen, make that shit count
Have faith and believe by the time you're out
What else can you really do with time
Except love life, because the world's divine

Once we're gone, the world spins on
Another day with another dawn
Pray there's an afterlife to gain
And enjoy your time while it all remains",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-time-lyrics
Pineapple Pizza,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"Hey J, It's Cindy, I had a great time the other night! Listen, I wanted to see if you wanted to come over tonight, maybe we can get a pizza and listen to some records!

I met a girl named Cindy, she was fine
She liked to get drunk on red wine
She had cinnamon flavored lipstick
When she blew me it burned my dip stick
But she was funny and she was nice
I hit it the first day and fucked her twice
She took me home and locked the door
And played old shit from Al B. Sure!
Pineapple pizza and Faygo Redpop
She shut the shades and checked the deadlock
Somebody knocked on the door all night
But we laid low and killed the light
They kept knocking and firmly split
She broke out with her own sex kit
Freaky toys, but I was straight
'Cause i can make my own dick vibrate

'Cindy'? What? Wait a fuckin' minute!

You should know, yo
A hoe is a hoe
And then you go burn
And now you know
But baby, whoa, this ain't the end of the show
I'm coming back for more
Cause I’m a juggalo

Hey Shag, it's Cindy, I miss you! You need to call me, okay?

Look here J, I’m talking to you
I know a bitch named cindy too
My bitch works at the party store
Right off the bat, she was a naughty whore
I hit it quickly just like you
We fucked so hard my dick was blue
She also likes to get drunk on wine
Let's just hope it's your bitch, ain't mine
My bitch too has cinnamon lips
Plus she's a little bit fat in the hips
Pineapple pizza, my bitch loves it
And Al B. Sure!? Fuck you, that does it
I knocked on the door the other night
Somebody else had cut the light
I can’t believe it, I been deceived
I even paid for that bitch's weave

Wait a minute, man! I'm getting played too!


Baby, what are you talking about? Like, I don't even know him! O.M.G.!

How the fuck was I supposed to know?
I don't blame you, I blame the hoe
She got me too, I can't believe she cheats us
I don't even like pineapple pizza
Fuck Al B Sure!; one hit wonder
Fuck that spell she had us under
She said she loved me and I believed her
Fuck that shit, I want my weave back
And all them fucking sex toys for what
I don't want none of that near my butt
She's at work, let's grab some gas
And burn her house down in a flash
Douse the signs and douse the porch
It's my pleasure to light the torch
We set it ablaze and drove off laughing
Play some juggalos, see what happens

I can't believe my fucking house is on fire! My Al B. Sure! records are in there!

Get you and get me, we can be bloody
If I'm gonna fly, I'm gonna succeed

Just wanna fade to black
Don't wanna turn to faith
I wanna burn at stakes

Don't wanna grab the phone
Don't wanna leave this room
I don't wanna talk with you

Just wanna fry my brains
Don't wanna slow shit down
I wanna throw shit around

Don't want no one to care
Don't want another crack at it

Damn Tina you look mighty comfortable laying there naked
You mind if I go ahead and pull my dick out
Oh no, hell no
You like that?
I like to have my face fucked
That really gets me going
And I like what he's doing to me right now
He's stroking my pussy really lightly
Man there's all types of pussy rubbing and shit goin on
What the fuck I'm supposed to do
Fuck my face
Man come on man
This my hook up
Come on man let me get that shit
This is my hook up man get your ass away
Come on man let me fuck her first
This my shit
Shut up, what I need is his cock in my ass
Uhh uhh uhh you like it don't you?
Let's get high and just fuck
I'll hit you till you bleed
And we could just blame it on the weed
Little freak
Sucking me off making my knees weak
Rubbing my nuts when I cum making my voice tweak
She makes me feel like a champion
Late night when I call
She knows what's happening
I got a box of condoms and a mind full of tricks
A freak just for fucking with my balls and my dick
Get started
Legs parted
I hit it so hard the pussy farted
And now it's time to depart it
She took the rubber off
And then she shoved it in her mouth
It felt like I came from down South
Know about it
Pussy pleasing's just a part of the game
You gotta bang it till it falls right off
I do the same
Rub my dick in cocaine
And freak some nasty shit
It ain't the same without the pain
Bring the flavor bitch
2 on 1's not a problem
So you can bring your girl
And I can get the best of both worlds
Fuck until I hurl
Toes fell off, fuck a curl
She kept nibbling my nuts like a squirrel
I hit the weed and flicked the ash on her back
Fuckin her friend in the face until her jaw snapped
Oh shit, I can see her sucking on her tits
And I can't help but notice 4 fingers in her clit
She's a pro
I thought I saw her pussy glow
It could've been the sweat in my eyes
I don't know for sure
This freaks the shit for loving dick
It's sick, but man I love that fat bitch
(Chorus x2)
She ain't afraid to admit she likes dick and
She ain't afraid to admit she likes her pussy licked
She ain't afraid to let me fuck her in the ass
And always got her mouth open for the cum splash
Excuse me lady did you say you liked to fuck
Drop my drawers to my ankles, give my dick a suck
You like it rough?
I can feel my shit swelling and expanding
A one way trip down south, a crash landing
Right in your pink fun
I get the job done
Daddy was a pistol and I'm a son of a gun
As I shoot my load on your chest and titties
Gotta get my shit, we off to the next city
Go a long way just so I can grind you
Got enough dick for Ms. McCarthy
And the 50 single hoes behind her
A side winder
Never like the old timer
Keeping hoes properly worked like Jane Fonda (Uh)
My anaconda's got a mushroom cap
An immense craving for your pussy cat
Keep it moving like that
My dick is hard as steel
And I'ma freak that ass with some more sex appeal
Tell me how it feel when I push it all in
Eyes roll in the back of your head and you start to grin
If sex was a sin then a wicked bitch you'd be
With creepy ass titties and an eerie ass pussy
So ride my broom stick until you hear me cum
And school me on your methods of pink fun
Yeah
(Chorus x2)
She ain't afraid to admit she likes dick
She ain't afraid to admit she likes her pussy licked
She ain't afraid to let me fuck her in the ass
And always got her mouth open for the cum splash
Yeah, know what I am saying
Yo, this be the Shaggy
Down with the Psychopathic Phamly
Down with Twiztid G
Know what I'm saying?
And yo check it out, I don't give a fuck
I like to get skins
I don't know about you muthafuckas
But yo I like em big
I don't give a fuck what
I like em skinny,bald,retarded,crippled
Spines on their backs
I don't give no fuck
800 pound-bitch come here sweetie
I'm gonna fucking tie your shit in a knot
And tap that shit
Know what I am saying?
Cause I love me some skins
I ain't going nothing about it
I'll hit a fucking 900 pound bitches neden from the back
Know what I am saying?
I'll wrap her legs backwards into a Boston crab
And go to work
Know what I am saying?
Fuck that shit I ain't no fucking fag like that
I like em stubbly so their whiskers tickles my balls
When they suck my dick
Know what I am saying?
I don't give a fuck
What, bring it on

17 Dead,Mutilation Mix: Greatest Hits (That Never Were Hits),1993,"Why must my visions be so clear?
The truth?
The truth, I've got work to do

I got shot with a buck shot, shot me down
But you know you can't paint a frown on a clown
Sewer gutter blood runs through my system
Death stopped by, but I must have just missed him
Am I in a Southwest street gang?
Do I bang, do I slang, do I let my motherfuckin' nuts hang
But do you care?
I got stabbed in the eye and you wasn't no where
And what about the time I got fucked
When I got shot in the throat... fuckin' sucked
But your news wasn't on that
You could give a fuck less nevertheless, unless
Something happened in your suburbs
I'ma cut your daddy's neck, you little fuckin' nerd
I don't give a fuck where you're from, boy
So don't tell me 'cause I don't give a fuck
It's all about what's going on in your head
Do or don't you care about the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Do or don't you care about the seventeen dead?
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
You could give a fuck less about the seventeen dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
(And the seventeenth boyfriend lost his erection)

I woke up next to a dead body
Roll it out the way and jump out of bed
Strap on my kicks and step out my room
'Cause somehow there's another stiff in the bathroom
Dead fucks all over the grass
I'ma kick somebody in they dead ass
Quick to make a left on Jefferson
And I noticed there's another stiff riding shotgun
Am I just seeing things, no
Is your mother a soggy ho
I like to drink Faygo, out in front of Scottie's
But then one by one of my homeboys turned into dead bodies
But I'm straight with that
Just don't be leaving your guts in my car n' shit
(Yo, wait a minute, wait, get your head on straight)
I drop seventeen tears from eyes every fucking day
I got to wonder if they do
Should I burn the rebel flag or the red white and blue too
I can't do much, but they can
But those motherfuckers got a death wish, man
I'm gonna swim in their bloodshed
Just to justify the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Do or don't you care about the seventeen dead?
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
You could give a fuck less about the seventeen dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead

Yeah, dead bodies man
They ain't so bad
I mean uh, they're all over the neighboorhood n shit you know
But they don't be fuckin' with you
They just lay there dead as shit
I mean they tasted kind of straight
With a little mustard, man
Yeah, much you know what I'm sayin...

Seventeen dead bodies hanging from a telephone wire
All seventeen on fire
Lighting up the sky with the smell of death
Rich bigot fucker, take a deep breath
Looking at you makes me go batty
Motherfucker don't be nothing like your daddy
'Cause he's nothing but a redneck ho
Him and his kind created this ghetto
They can't deal with their own creation
Move out farther, suburb vacation, heh
But it don't work like that
Knock at your door and it's me with a slug bat
I'mma stick it to your fuckin' nugget
About seventeen times and you're gonna love it, motherfucker
Drive down my street
And stare at the folks who can't make ends meet
You don't know now, but that's the plan
Most people in Hell were rich when they died, man
Take that to your golden bed
'Cause I'mma cut your ass up for the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)
Seventeen dead, in mi barrio (And the seventeenth)

And stomp my boots on your nut sack

You don't think so, I'll put a brick in your mouth
Can't nobody flex on a nutty clown
I got boys downriver, straight Inktown
Well, ya know I'm coming straight from the trailer park
That's me out front working on the Skylark
I'm waiting on a check, I don't cut the grass
And my woman's got babies falling all out her ass
I'll be running with the carnival until I'm eighty
'Cause tonight I'm going out with the fat lady
I strip the bitch down to the nitty-gritty
But I ain't saying shit about her one titty

Walk into thy Light,The Wraith: Shangri-La,2002,"A presence can be felt...
A presence can be felt....
A presence can be felt by those who have followed the epic saga
As told by the Insane Clown Posse;
It is a presence that is synonymous
With the crumbling of time itself
Thus emerges, a being so powerful that
He can exist between both the land of the living
And that of the dead
He goes by many names
But is known to the living only as: The Wraith
He walks upon worlds forgotten
And descends from Heaven's faded to gray
To witness the death of all mortal things
So that He may guide the departed upon the path that they have chosen
(Shangri-La)
Here is the story of the path to Shangri-La
The 6th Joker's card (The Wraith)
Only now will we truly understand the meaning of the saga
For this saga all along
Each Joker's Card is actually none other than:
'The Echo of Our Lives!'

""Hurry up, the shows startin'!
I can't believe they're still havin' it
I better get my butt in there right now!""

""Ladies and gentleman!
*Clapping and cheering*
Welcome to the sensational and amazing: 'Carnival of Carnage!'
They said, ""It couldn't happen!""; they said, ""It wouldn't last!""
But, boys and girls and everyone we've got a carnival for their ass!
Tens of thousands of freaks, sideshows, and fools
A carnival who together, lives by their own rules!


We look into the stars; foretold everyone:
""Somethin' dark and wicked this way comes"" (This way comes...)
We told of oddities, crawlin' from the dark
And a carnival which we can all belong
I dwell upon the streets, and I can tell you this:
""I see some circus Juggalo shit goin' on"" (Shit goin' on...)
People drawn together by rare and scrubby music
And we even gather once a year to PUT IT DOWN!

With Tilt-a-Whirl's and Merry Go's, and carnivals of Faygo
We're just tryna tell you all about the light, right
Now all the Joker Cards have fallen with spectacular array
So when The Wraith is calling, walk into The Light, right


I hold a bloody Axe, dress in hatchet red
We speak languages people don't understand (Don't understand...)
I send Fargo’s via punted clear across the stadium
In fashion only fuckin' Juggalos could ever demand
I got ninjas in my backyard wearin' Anybody Killa paint (Whoop whoop!)
I'm thinkin' what the fuck is goin' on? (Thinkin' what the fuck is goin' on...)
Then I see the platinum on the wall
And I realize the carnival’s been right here all along
So, let's bring it on!

With Tilt-a-Whirl's and Merry Go's, and carnivals of Faygo
We're just tryna tell you all about the light, right
Now all the Joker Cards have fallen with spectacular array
So when The Wraith is calling, walk into The Light, right


The crows have overlooked, (Overlooked...)
We gave you all they gave. (They gave...)
The carousel will spin on through the night (Through the night...)
In Oz, I'd be the Wizard cause I'm overwhelmed
But we just hoped The Joker Cards would point you out to the light
So you'll be tight, right

With Tilt-a-Whirl's and Merry Go's, and carnivals of Faygo
We're just tryna tell you all about the light, right
Now all the Joker Cards have fallen with spectacular array
So when The Wraith is calling, walk into The Light, right

I Fucked a Cop,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"*Police talking on radio*

I was starving so I walked to the doughnut shop
Cause that would hit the spot
I ordered two french crullers and a crispy cream
Then I heard someone order the same as me
I turned around to look and we connected eyes
She was a cop, I tell no lies
At first I was terrified indeed
Cause in my bag was a pound of weed
But she just smiled, I smiled back
And then she asked me where I'm sitting at
And could she join me, and then it clicked
This bitch is on my dick
We ate together, talked and giggled
My dick was harder than a pickle
My heart was beating like crazy fast
Non-stop, I'm about to fuck this cop

I fucked a cop, I fucked a cop (hey!)
Who can say that they fucked a cop (hey!)
All I gotta do is call 9-1-1 (hey!)
And I get some neden son (hey!)
I fucked a cop, I fucked a cop (hey!)
Who can say that they fucked a cop (hey!)
She don't arrest me or beat my head in
Nah kid I just tap the neden

That night she picked me up in the squad car
The whole time my meat was hard
Plus I didn't have to ride in the back
I sat up front next to the gun rack
She pulled cars over as my heart raced
And I put the spotlight in they face
One kid had meth in his car and got arrested
As we drove to jail I got molested
She jacked me off and I almost nutted
As the kid locked up in the back head-butted
The glass, I took her mace and sprayed the guy
And we both laughed as he started to cry
I was having stupid oodles of fun
When she took him in, I played with her gun
I'm telling you now I couldn't wait to hit it
The officer biscuit I was dying to split it


She came back out, we tongue kissed and jetted
And as she drove I fingered the neden
She had a bush like the one in my front yard
Plus my hand stunk, my dick was still hard
She said we have to raid a drug dealers home
I asked if I could help and she said ""Come on!""
We rolled to the house with four more units
Look at that I'm starting to sound like the bitch
They broke the door down, we ran inside
I found the money and dope and now they're mine
Finally her long ass shift was over
She took me home and she had a Doberman
Pinscher dog who didn't like me at all
She put him away and then she called me
Into her bedroom and we finally fucked
That's why I'm the man though, the neden sucked

We got our own class and y'all ain't got ta pass
You might see us through window if ya cut across the grass
But that's all you will get we on some high level shit
Get back to your class with the masses where you’re easy to forget

Oblivious to the wicked world outside and what's happenin'


Lights flash when we grippin' by cause we in here whillin'
We livin' on our own shit while y'all worry 'bout stylin'
We ridin' on past sometimes haters try to diss us

We mix ourselves.

Who cried on themselves, and inside they dyin'
And fuck all the words from all the nerds who say we absurd
We ignorin'. You sheep herds so borin'
They keep firin', secretly admirin'
We sirens. They keep on expirin'
We feed cocks to bitches, mountaintops to smidgens
Oceans to Dixie cups. We dig these sluts
And should-be cousins, brothers, mothers, lovers, and others
Only need a little weed, indeed we bleed for each other
Get home in one piece, homie.

Thy Staleness,The Wraith: Shangri-La,2002,"Let me see ya throat thing there buddy, I'mma chop it
See the idea is to make you die (Stop it)
I don't know why but your heart beat offends me
I need to cut you off at the windpipe desperately
(Like, how but cuttin your own neck) I did
17 times
 why you think I talk like this?
Before I cut myself THIS WAS MY VOICE
Now gimme your neck pipe, you don't have no fuckin choice
(I'm not ready to die) Neither was Eazy-E
What makes you so fuckin special you can escape the Wreath
(You mean Wraith) I said Wraith, now shut the fuck up
And give me you windpipe so I can cut the motherfucker
(Pick somebody else) I'm pickin anybody I can find
And you happen to be the next motherfucker in like
(Ok let's do it) Keep still, right there
And about 1, 2, 3 of those motherfuckers, I'm outta here

Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to YEAH YEAH YEAH
Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to
(Ah ha... What kind of circus is this?)

How you gonna give me a straight jacket when I'm crooked
Took it and shook it, ripped it and unzipped it
And waited for the nurse guy to bring me my tray
Jumped him from behind and turned his head backwards my way
Took all his keys and a crate of Methadone
Masturbated on myself and leaped out the window
Then I turned around and went right back inside
Once I realized I could've grabbed a gang of Formeldahyde
Suddenly another fuckin guard shot me
I played the whole movie shits off like ""You got me""
Laid there playin dead and when he checked my pockets
I jabbed my fuckin thumb knuckle deep in his eye socket
By now there was guards everywhere
I'm steady cuttin heads off, surfin on a wheelchair
And too many bullets finally put me away
But was it the real Violent J?

Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to YEAH YEAH YEAH
Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to YEAH YEAH YEAH
(It kills the pain... it's the only thing that kills the pain, I'm sorry)

I'm so sorry that I'm so stale... I'm so sorry I'm stale

I’m Sweet,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"Let me tell you something, brother
I’m a motherfucker
I’m a fucking beast the opposite of a sucker
If you my homie and we out and you get into a fight
I’m jumping in that motherfucker, fucking kicking and biting
I don't care if it's 21 on one
I got your back, son, with a punch like a gatling gun
Because I'm sweeter than a sugar lemon lollipop
Hanging out with me I get you higher than a molly pop
I got bitches of every nationality and color
That will do anything for me I never tell 'em I love her
I catch a bullet in my fist, Dark Lotus on my wrist
I’m a killer in the mist, homie, you get the gist
I'll take that bully that fucks with you, and break his damn back
DDT him on the sidewalk, make the cement crack
I do a dance and make the sun come out and shine on us
I’m a gump but my aura makes me some kind of adonis
Cause I'm sweet

I’m sweet
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet)
I'm sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet (so fucking sweet!)

I take a five to the casino and leave a millionaire
I be at two places at once, at home and still be here
I can ride a tiger through the jungles of Peru
Squeeze a coal into a diamond and give it to you
I know important people all over the globe
Walk into the club a stud with slow motion strobe
Bitches scream when they see me, I look better than a TV
I do the chicken dance and they all follow to be me
I built a shelter for the homeless, a five-star resort
With swimming pools, hot tubs, basketballs and tennis courts
I'm sweeter than a cotton candy Faygo two liter
I broke down the door and stomped the fucking wife beater
And now she’s on my arm completely out of harm
I’m smoother than a baby's butt and softer than charm
I bought my mom and dad a yacht so they can travel the seas
Fucking money blows out my ass everytime i sneeze
Cause I’m sweet

I’m sweet
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet (so fucking sweet!)
I'm sweet (I'm sweet)
I'm sweet (so fucking sweet!)

I got a shoulder you can lean on
Solutions to your problems
I slayed a fucking dragon, plus I killed a hundred goblins
I rescued three babies from a burning inferno
It was a walk in the park, ain’t even write it in my journal
I can scale up the side of a wall like spider man
Just place my palms on the brick and simply tighten my hands
And like a ninja, I know 17 styles of kung fu
And all the kids they love me cause I'm a lot of fun too
Testarossas all around for all of my boys
Smash 'em right into a tree; who cares? They're just toys
I throw a party every night, gangbangers come together
For a time, they forget what set they out for the better
I get people out of prison, the governor's my dude
Fresh out they cell and back home to mama’s food
I'm like that: sweeter than a birthday cake and ice cream
Yes, motherfucka, ain’t that a nice dream

I’m sweet (I'm sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet
I'm sweet (I'm sweet)
I'm sweet (so fucking sweet!)
I'm sweet (oh yeah)
I'm sweet (sweet)
I'm sweet (woohoo!)
I'm sweet (so fucking sweet!)

Let's take our time, we've got time

Hot Head,Fearless Fred Fury,2019,"665 (Fight back)
Hot head (Hot head)

Here I go again
Crawling through the endless tunnels throughout my polluted mind
All three walls of my bedroom are bleeding 'cause I'm a poison cancer
Up steps I found in the woods, above trees into moonlit skies
A flare melts off my balls as ordered by my secret fairy dancers
Blood streams down my cheeks from my swelled up big ass red grapefruit eyes
In my basement, wrapped in intestines, waiting for answers
Mouth maggots grow too quick to spit or swallow, so why bother try?
Mom's headless but her windpipe says I'm good to romance her

Everything in between my two ears feels like it's burning
(In there burning)
Can't help but headbutt the cement floor 'cause it fuckin' hurts
('Cause it fuckin' hurts)
I can feel my brain crackle and pop like it's in there burning
(In there burning)
And so I don't want to be anymore 'cause it fuckin' hurts
('Cause it fuckin' hurts)
Really fuckin' hurts, it really fuckin' hurts
I punch myself as I'm thinking
One, two, fire on you
Three, four, burnin', what for?
Five, six, no fire wicks
Seven, eight, burnin' at the stake
Nine, ten, burnin' that skin
11, 12, big fire swells
13, 14, burning up scorchin'
15, 16, fire licks sting
17

Oh so cute, I love watching
Bloodworms burrow their way through my stomach deep into my gut
Duck in dark shadows downtown, in search of freshly pissed-on corners
In the woods behind Walmart, now I'm jacking off on a big fat dead slut
A moss-covered old stick in my mouth I put there because I'm horny
A ten foot red hell snake broke up through my floor, I'd feed it, but what?
Two four pound snapping turtles live in my toilet bowl, drunk on Corona
I play harp for a baby centaur as he rips cats' heads off and drinks their blood
Had lots of big beauties, sure, but after sex with a corpse, living women are boring

Everything in between my two ears feels like it's burning
(In there burning)
Can't help but headbutt the cement floor 'cause it fuckin' hurts
('Cause it fuckin' hurts)
I can feel my brain crackle and pop like it's in there burning
(In there burning)
And so I don't want to be anymore 'cause it fuckin' hurts
('Cause it fuckin' hurts)
Really fuckin' hurts, it really fuckin' hurts
My gun's to my head, I'm thinking
One, two, burning right through
Three, four, burn to the core
Five, six, burn up in the mix
Seven, eight, brain incinerate
Nine, ten, the fire don't end
11, 12, burning in hell
13, 14, blue fire scorching
15, 16, charred up and crispy
17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17
17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17

Folded like a, like a stop sign
Fuck dog, ey, we gotta go get that motherfuckin' ball of brains
You know what I'm sayin', fuck that, yeah
What, you wanna make a song about death
Squeezing on a neck until it's all outta breath
You wanna hear me rap about being the hardest
Well fuck that, from now on I'm an artist
I carve pumpkins
, chop, chewy
Slice, swing twice, stab, screwy, ooh-ee
Chewy, dooey, gooey, slop
It all starts with a quick chop, drop
Pumpkin rolls on the floor
Almost out the front door, oh, we can't have that
Cut along the hairline, bowl cut
Hold the pumpkin between your legs and lift up
Boing, brains, snippity snip all the veins
Snip, cut, what, what the matter, you don't wanna do it
Well fuck it then, screw it, you'll never be a pumpkin carver
Pumpkin carvers that be the hobby
So Cal, Motown, collecting bodies
Twiztid, Clowns and the Kottonmouth Kings
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Pumpkin carvers that be the hobby
So Cal, Motown, collecting bodies

Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
What, you don't like this rhyme
I can't be on point all the time
Fuck, it's Halloween, I gotta make a living somehow
I'm a professional pumpkin sculptor, alright motherfucker
Now, first, hollow the container
Strike that bitch with a hanger
Whatever just get something, just get the motherfucker all hollowed out
Like you could fill it up with lemonade and pour it out the mouth if you wanted to
Never leave the eyes intact
They'll turn all blue and puff out and shit, wack
Always remove 'em but keep 'em handy
Cause they taste like candy
Psych, I'm only playing, okay now, get the scalpel
Slowly cut around the mouth, be careful
What the fuck! We needed the lip!
Here, let me give you a little tip, slow the fuck down!
Pumpkin carvers that be the hobby

Take a closer look you scary motherfuckers
Don't my jack-o-lantern look like your little brother
Neck nuggets what we bring, terror start to fling
Twiztid, ICP and the Kottonmouth Kings
Pumpkins are for bitches, I like my shit instead
Cause every devil's night we carving somebody else's head
When my meatcleaver chops, heads fall to the floor
Fuck buying pumpkins at the grocery store
Yeah, yeah alright, you done flexed some skills on the mic
This is my motherfuckin' little song here, right
Right, let's get back to the subject
Now hold steady, steady, steady, ready
Insert the blade along the outer eyelid
Very, slowly, I don't wanna look! Ah, you did
Okay, gently count twenty-five specmetre outer diameters, huh? A square!
I know it's hard, you'd probably rather just stab and chop
But you'll end up with a pile of slop
I've done it before, and them ain't, them ain't pumpkin seeds
Those are fragments of skull, oh, crunchy
Hey, never mind that, get back to work
Eating on the fuckin' job, you'll never be an expert
What you wanna be, a mailman, a plumber or a barber, no
Or do you wanna be like your uncle Violent J, a pumpkin carver

Make these motherfuckers sing fool
Kick 'em to the spleen, happy Halloween
I be burnin' Cali, southern voters always bring
Pletto from the ghetto dumping bodies in the meadow
When it comes to carvin', bitch, I'm sharper than Gepetto
I'm lovin' that stiletto, ask your trick or fuckin' treaters
More than thirty, why I beat and greet the homies with the Chiba

Little Miss Muffet, oh, she never had a clue
Of the psychopathic wicked clown was finna do
Creeping through the backyards underneath the moon
Only three blocks away, the joker looney toon
Listen to the loon, listen to the pain
Listen to the one they call the Violent J Insane
Watch me as I duck and I dash through the night
I can see the shadows of the moon in my butcher knife
Pretty little world has created this monster
See me living with a dead body in a dumpster
Laughing in your castle but I can't cross your moat
But then I take a boat and cut your fucking throat
Well, now I'm getting closer so I crawl under a house
I'm waiting for the car to pass and then I crawl back out
Another block down, just a little ways to go
*Phone ring* ""Hello?""

I'm the neck cutter and I'm three blocks away
I'm the neck cutter and I'm three blocks away

You can hear me drag my foot and scrape my butcher knife
I can hear the owl as it chirps a wicked tune
You can hear the loons, the loons, the loons
Listen to the little pitter-patter of my feet
As I howl like a dog and I'm running down the street
Hiding in the trees, hiding in the bushes
You're sitting on your couch, and I'm underneath your cushions
Stab you in the back of the head, why not?
Your little governor has taken everything I got
I can't feed a family, I can't feed a dog
So I cut your fucking head off, hey
Wickey, wickey jokers and you know we show improve
Jumping over roof tops, juggalugga move
Tell me, have you ever seen a ghetto freak show?

I, I have to kill her
I'm, I'm gonna kill her
I'm gonna kill her
I'm gonna kill her

You can think I'm choking on my joker while you laugh
I'm coming to your house, I'm finna cut your neck in half
Everywhere I go, the Grim Reaper stays on me
'Cause the fucker knows I'm always leavin' dead bodies
I can see him standing at the end of the block
'Cause somebody's clock is running out of tock
Slip through the cracks in the walls of the eave
All is justified, as every punishment received
Everything you've ever done to me is out of hate
I'm beggin' on my knees, and you slam your golden gate
So I pick myself up and I snuck around the back
And took your money stack then snapped your fucking neck
Slowly only go as the night air is calm
I might stop and chill and drink a 40 on the lawn
Right before I take the final step to the front door

Mr. White Suit,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"For ages, the local legend of a man known only as ""Mr. White Suit"" has loomed throughout Detroit's most poverty-stricken neighborhoods
Who is this wonderful man?
Have you any faith in this mythical magician?
Listen, and decide

Damn, feels good outside
Mr. White Suit takes a drive
Nowhere to be, just riding local
Smell the food from Xochimilco
Big white Caddy, white wall wheels
He pass the hungry, they get meals
He pass the sick, they feel better
He pass the poor, they get cheddar
Mr. White Suit cures your cancer
He has the antidote, knows the answer
Missing kids, been gone for years
He takes 'em home and the parents cheer
He got a hundred spokes; corners, he bends 'em
With his face on a fat hood emblem
He hits the car wash closed for business
And leaves it thriving, alive; what is this?

If you need something, if your life ain't right
Keep your eyes open for the man in white
If you're lost and alone, looking for the truth
You can find the way home, follow the white suit

Mr. White Suit shine, never spills his wine
He keeps his whole shit clean, it's Mr. White Suit
You can catch the beams, you can catch the rays
It's brighter every day, it's Mr. White Suit

Mr. White Suit parks his Caddy
Kids run up and call him ""daddy""
He takes a quick walk across the street
'Cause there's somebody he'd like to meet
Terry Ross can't see a thing
Until he kiss Mr. White Suit's ring
Now he sees the whole world outside
When Mr. White Suit walk, he glide
People cheer, he leads a parade
Of down and out folk, gettin' paid
His rims, they gleam so bright and shiny
The nuggets in his watch are blinding
His shoes are white, even the bottoms
He's so damn tall, easy to spot him
White flamingos fly above him
All the people 'round here, we love him

He's so clean and he's not a dream
He's the realest I've ever seen
His rings are so blingy that they beam
Be thankful he's on our team
Looking out for us


Mr. White Suit touch the old
And leave 'em young and rich with gold
Miss Bency is in a wheelchair
She rolled up to him, in need of real care
He placed his hands upon her hips
She did the moonwalk and then the splits
Through the neighborhood we go
With Mr. White Suit, riding slow
His teeth are dime and his smile shines
And everything he says, it rhymes
His suit's so bright without a stain
His white kangol hat, quite the same
Gems and rubies line his cane
They say on him it never rain
He talks with the crazy and makes 'em sane
It's true; he'll take away your pain

The world's about to get me again
Shit ain't pretend!
I'm safer in the Madhouse, clinging to the ceiling like a spider
I'm out of your mind, like frozen fire
Razor blade fingernails scratching my neck
Lost in a maze, I found a dragon barbequeing the back
An arm came up out the toilet, and scrotched my balls
That shit hurt, got me headbutting holes in the walls
I want to see you
I hear you
I catch spirits and ghosts by their invisible throats and then tear through
Never scary boo bitch, I'm a Kamakazi
Swimming through the living room watching Joany and Johnn
And then I realized I'm potsy trapped in the TV
Sombody changed the channel and got the better of me

You ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Your ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

So many dimensions in my encephal
These levels of diss and devil
Ain't been alright since the ghetto
Better wait till my temper settle
Cause my mind is a madhouse
The Nine finna spaz out
Player haters don't throw stones if you grind in a glass house
Sometimes when I lash out
I pass out
How sick and insanse and vain can this be
Want to fly your little head like a frisbee
Six six triple eight forty six ninety-nine thrisde
This Strange and Psychopathic homie this is not Disney
The Madhouse continues
To pin you
Send you
Psycho bitches to the back of the venue
Then you slitther when I come hither off up in you
Then my homies 2 dope and Jay do you up somthin real Ginsu
Level of madness
Ecstasy, shrooms, and acid
Beast released but you can't find me in lake placid
Finally in Missouri Dizzily struttin with a bad bitch
Her last kiss disastrous ICP on some Mad Shit!

You ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
My...House... Mad House
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Peekaboo anybody home? where you at?
Tryin to be sneaky creeping behind me motherfucker I saw that rail
Maybe its a mirror but bullshit I seen a different person
He was grabbing his nuts and spitting and cursin at me fag!
There's some things in this life that I fail to understand
Even as a grown man, man, I still don't comprehend
Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs
And some fucking how I ended up down here
Well laughing and giggleing like a little school girl
With my homies Jay and Tech ain't even there Hmmm
(Tickle Ticke Tickle! Hahaha!) What the fuck
Not a damn single bitch in this place but some how one is fidgeting my nuts
(Skeet! Skeet! Skeet! Ahhhh) I got it done
Well sitting with my pants around my ankles dry humping my hand
A lot of mother fuckers claim the insanity plea
But not me
It's this house that's gone mad I'm as sane as can be!

You ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

See yourself in all the weird shapes and sizes

""Well, okay
Have a good time, son
And good luck finding your way out""
""Wait a minute, I don't like it in here
Hey, wait a minute, let me out of here
Let- there's dead bodies in-
There's dead bodies in here!
I don't like it in here!""

Step inside, come my way
This here is your fatal day
You have lied, they have cried
Now your life has been denied
Look into the big mirror
Your reflection is so clear
Devil's head, rotting flesh
With the snakes inside your chest
In the mirror, you can't hide
You've been granted Jacob's ride
Whipping fear, spinning pain
All you crying is in vain
You're the beast you never knew
This reflects the things you do
Others starving down the block
Richie's heart is like a rock
How can I make a law?
I'm just here to break your jaw
House of Glass, down and up
You might get your ass cut
Mirror of Life, Mirror of Pain
Death, I wave my magic cane
Your last words are those of fear
But they go unheard in the House of Mirrors

Mirror Mirror, on the wall (House of Mirrors)
Who's the wickedest of all? (House of Mirrors)
Three blind mice, deepest fear (House of Mirrors)
Welcome to the House of Mirrors (House of Mirrors)
Mirror Mirror, on the wall (House of Mirrors)
Who's the wickedest of all? (House of Mirrors)
Three blind mice, deepest fear (House of Mirrors)
Welcome to the House of Mirrors (House of Mirrors)

Magic wand, magic mirror
Timeless clock says death is near
Death is here, death is on
My king bishop takes your pawn
You can't break House of Mirrors
That's bad luck for seven years
Only in my wicked realm
Of thee untold, now unfold
Thinking back, what you do
Buy a richie home or two
Even though some down and out
You keep what you could live without
You're the beast you never knew
This reflects the things you do
Others starving down the block
Richie's heart is like a rock
First I grab, then I stab
Cut you up into a slab
Grind and twist, flick my wrist
Toss you in the magic mist
Look into Halls of Glass
Every mirror shows the past
With no love, you kicked us in the face
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors

Mirror Mirror, on the wall (House of Mirrors)
Who's the wickedest of all? (House of Mirrors)
Three blind mice, deepest fear (House of Mirrors)
Welcome to the House of Mirrors (House of Mirrors)

Who's the wickedest of all? (House of Mirrors)
Three blind mice, deepest fear (House of Mirrors)
Welcome to the House of Mirrors (House of Mirrors)

Three blind mice, your worst fear
Look into the deadly mirror
Three blind mice, your worst fear
Look into the deadly mirror

Welcome to the House of Mirrors, Mr. Executive
Explain to E why ICP should let you live
As you look on, I see this image in your reflection
A bigot under cover, showing no affections
To the ghettos and the hoods
Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow
And when that shit happens, there's no pity and no sorrow
'Cause you refuse to lift a hand
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand
And if I were you, I'd fear myself
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth
You just gotta let em fall
Yo Violent J, (What up?) bash that head against the wall
And don't let him run for the door (Where you goin, bitch?)
Make him detour to the sewer
And let's wash away his bigot sins
While we welcome in some more of his bigot-ass friends
And let 'em see what they really like
Head high, ridin' a Benz, and I'm a clown-riding a bike
So look closely in the mirror
You're the beast you never knew, so be the next to volunteer
To live in the hood with the ICP
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors

Mirror Mirror, on the wall (House of Mirrors)
Who's the wickedest of all? (House of Mirrors)
Three blind mice, deepest fear (House of Mirrors)
Welcome to the House of Mirrors (House of Mirrors)

Three blind mice, your worst fear
Look into the deadly mirror
Three blind mice, your worst fear
Look into the deadly mirror

Look into the deadly mirror
Three blind mice, your worst fear

""Who's next for the one and the only House of Mirrors?
This carnival will only be in your town until our job is done
So get it over with and step into the House of Mirrors
You, young lady. Come this way
Step into the House of Mirros
And see the spineless, heartless, stingy rich little skank that you are
Or maybe you'd be interested in the Murder-Go-Round
Or the Wax Museum
Or maybe the bearded man, Jumpsteady, will supply your thrills
Or how about the juggling trio of Nate the Mack, Rude Boy, and Chucky?

Wicked clowns
Don't fuck with me
Wicked clowns
Don't fuck with me
Wicked clowns

As I walked through River Rouge, I saw this man
He was covered he was buttered snatched his jewelry and ran
I caught up with Nate and said, ""I think It's worth a grand""
He smiled and he giggled and he shook my hand
The jam was going down handed me money so I'm giddy
The fucking snake McGoul, all they gave was $7.50 
My mamma threw me out I called my sister a whore
Now my house is abandoned, my bed is the floor
It's been a week I haven't eaten, I starve and I call
Saw my teacher Miss Elena up in Wellington Mall
I broke into her Datsun, and jumped in the back
And waited for the bitch them put my shank to her neck
She offered her car keys, cried and said, ""Please!""
She promised not to tell and give me A's and B's
I said, ""I want your money, bitch, and all I can sell"" 
I looked into her eyes and she was SCARED AS HELL!
I new she was a snitch, so I cut off her tongue
Got happy with the trigger now I'm on the run, an assassin!


My father was a priest, cold-blooded, he's dead
Hypocrite, he was a bigot so I cut off his head
Poured on the holy water, ""Bless the dead"" is what I said
And heard the demon screaming as his body bled
Now I'm drunk on the freeway, just the other day
I saw a fine hitchhiker and I wanted to play
Pulled up to the curb so I can offer a ride
She said, ""Thanks,"" I said, ""No thang,"" and she got inside
Peepin' as I'm creepin', I'm packing an erection
I'm staring with my dick I'm like 'look,' which direction
Made it to her ave she got out and said, ""See ya""
""Yo babe like why don't you chill and help me kill this 2-liter?""
Went into my trailer, I filled up a glass
Before she took a sip I had my dick in her ass
I banged it and banged it, this shit was absurd!
Like she was Sporty Spice and I was some fucking nerd
Then she rolled over and gave me a kiss, and said
""So when am I getting paid?"" WHAT BITCH?!?!
First I tried to choke her, she went for the door
And said, ""Welcome to the disease there's no cure for""
Bitch, I love you, but now you gotta die
I chased her through the door but she slammed it in my eye
She passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Billy pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back
Still wanting booty, I went for the hatchet
And screamed at the moon like a sick psychopathic
Choppin' and choppin' they said, ""J, WHAT THE FUCK?!""
On the news they found her head stuffed up her butt, what?
I'm an assassin, hahahaha, a motherfucking assassin, eeeaahhhh, AN ASSASSIN!

A fucking assassin
Ah, an assassin
A motherfucking assassin
An assassin

Intro (Carnival of Carnage),Carnival of Carnage,1991,"It was a soft, gentle night
In the little town of, of...
Well, your town
The gentle breeze swept the streets
Creating that pleasant howl
That these kind town folks have enjoyed
For so many, many years
The wind chimes sent their peaceful melodies
Into the ears of the sleeping residents
But the unusual was approaching in the distance
Something evil headed toward this small town
As the residents slept
Something crept, slithered
And crawled its way through the quiet streets
Guided by the moonlight
These frightening strangers set up tents and rides
Shows and games
There were savage jesters and wicked ringmasters
There were horrid freak shows
And sights only the impending doom will witness
They brung with them
The carnage that they had lived with for eternity
The morning is a new day
The people of this town will unwillingly witness
The show of their lives, only rumored to exist
They will be the next to die helplessly

Ghetto Rainbows,The Mighty Death Pop!,2012,"Chorus:
{Legz Diamond}
How the fuck could this be?
Up in the sky?
There is a rainbow over the hood!

Verse 1:
{Violent J}
Let's see, we got homes abandoned, fires flare
Don't dare walk down over there
Hookers, pimps, 
Oxi80's
Trailer park meth labs, crack babies
In the spot, workin' cook up
Walk outside, take a look up
It's a rainbow over the city
Look back down around you, shitty!
{Shaggy 2 Dope}
Gun shots heard, killers are lurkin'
Yet still I hear the birds are chirpin'!
This world ain't meant for this
So much bliss, but easy to miss!
Rubbers on the sidewalk, used syringes
Stuck in a hotel, two week binges
Look high in the sky to remind you
Even if you're lost, rainbows will find you!
Chorus:
{Legz Diamond}
How the fuck could this be? (There's a rainbow!)
Up in the sky? (Over the ghetto!)
There is a rainbow over the hood! (There's a rainbow... Over the hood!)

Verse 2:
{Violent J}
Built with AIDS, Hep C, coke
I ain't talkin' Pepsi, crack smoke
All in the rain, down the drain
Mom’s in pain, need that boy in her veins
It's so hard, so many distractions
So much 
negative action
Keeps your attention placed
Off the magic and on the waste
{Shaggy 2 Dope}
If you see a rainbow, look quick
Potholes will wreck yo' shit!
Don't get caught dreamin' I hope, *Gun cocking*
Ya head might get locked in a scope! *Gun Shot*
If you standin' there, lookin' at a rainbow
You might wonder, ""Where'd your brains go?""
For everyone that wanna see you succeed
A hundred mo' wanna see you bleed!
Chorus:
{Legz Diamond}
How the fuck could this be? (There's a rainbow!)
Up in the sky? (Over the ghetto!)
There is a rainbow over the hood! (There's a rainbow... Over the hood!)

Bridge:
{Violent J}
Cars on blocks, little dumb glow
Skies above, where'd our wind go?
Body in the alley wit' blew out brains
There'll still be a rainbow after it rains!
Verse 3:
{Violent J}
Rainbows don't hate or discriminate
It's mankind’s fate to create mistakes
Just look at the skies, above the gutter
Above the warzones, above each other
Rainbow's stretch over lands of ruin
Over troubles brewin', whatever we doin'
Don't live blind, a sheep in line
Find it, make the best of yo' time!
{Shaggy 2 Dope}
G Codes, street laws, rules I drop
We only get this one chance, I won't 
throp
I want mo' than I got, 
I'mma find the pot
At the end of the rainbow,
 like it or not
I'm not gon' rot, stop on the block
Shot by a cop in the parkin' lot
When my feet stop least I gave it a shot
No regrets
 when my death goes pop!
Interlude:
Look! (There's a rainbow!)
Where? (Over the ghetto!)
Right there! (There's a rainbow... Over the hood!)

Posse, yeah!
Me and Shaggy 2 Dope in the home away from home
In the black bucket hearse with the rusty grill a chrome
Pickin' up the homies, we get em one by one
If you ain't psychopathic ryda boy you cannot dump (bump)
Everybody's lookin' if you jealous turn around
Fuckin' with them leathers got us hoppin' off the ground {*Honk*}
We getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The alpines bumpin' but I need the volume higher
'Cause the 808 kick drum make you want to get some
I got a scrodum full a balls I let your girlie lick them
Every time we rollin' Twiztid's gotta roll a joint
I almost died from inhalation comin' back from Cedar's Point
Hookers and zombies in every direction
Lookin' for the wavin' for some action
The wagons kinda crowded though
????????
Jamie tryin' to keep it steady with the greeny on his lap
Rude Boy wasn't lookin', we hit a crack head
Flippin' off the windshield, the motherfucker's dead
Zombie cut in half, 
look out of regret
Insane Clown Posse rippin' up shit
Woo! Woo!

Psychopathic Sodiers Roll
The posses's on Vernor! (Yeah, come on)
Down riverside that's how we ride
The posse's on Vernor! (ICP!)

Runnin' down baseheads, seven more scored
Half an hour later we was getting kinda bored
Jumpsteady's dangerous, Dougy is 4 Rilla
My homie Shaggy 2 Dope is the bitch hater killa
Billy's on the left side coughin' helly
Leavin' haters lady crawlin' pickin' up they teeth
Tom Dub is the skinny guy
People think he's funny
But he didn't even know tonight he comin' back bloody
Cruisin' Del Ray boy these streets is cold
Cigarette lighter broken window stuck unrolled
Rippin' Michigan we saw thugs
Me muggin' hoes shoppin'
Distributin' drugs
Hittin' 3 and 7 and that ass just dropped
Squeekin and we
But the wagon don't stop
Michigan
Rudy broke left, Jamie shot a Verner
It's time to get wrecked
Junky on the corner, need a box of shoots
With a rebel flag and some cowboy boots
The closer that we get, the clearer it became
It was Kid Rock yellin' ""What's my Name!?""

The posse's on Vernor!(Yeah, Come on)
Back down to Southwest
The posse's on Vernor! (What you got?)

Now cruisin' down Verner
My wheels spin slow
Runnin' with the hatchet is the only way to go
Some girlies by the Carnival was lookin' for a ride
We tried to pick 'em up
But we had no room inside
We put em in the trunk, we put em on the hoods
Some sat up with the Rude Boy and puffed on his wood
Our crew is gettin' bigger, and there's way to many freaks
The muffler's draggin' and the tailpipes weak
Now these hoes are gettin' hungry
Monoxide's treatin'
We stopped at Xochimilco for some Mexican eatin'
The restaurant was closed, this ho was like ""Damn it.""
She said ""Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Seven.""
Now I finally see the place, it's a little run down
But they got the best Chilly Cheesy in town
Faygo on tap, any kind you choose
After midnight though the place is bad news
And didn't even
This ho from another crew she picked it up and used it
Her boyfriend's trippin' and jumpin' on her case
My homie Billy Bill had to bust him in the face
We never like a fuck, who beats on his girl
If ya don't have a game, then .. leave our world
Ain't nothin' to discuss, the bitch slept with us
She fucked everybody now I hard she lives with Russ
Now I'm runnin' with a hatchet, and you walkin' with some dudes
The Psychopathic Family is givin' you the blues
Hate us all you want, 'cause we don't get upset

The Witch,The Wraith: Hell’s Pit,2004,"...hctiW ehT
(Daeh dereves)
(Sbmil ydoolb)

The Witch jumped on my back last night
I couldn't breathe in it's clutch, I was frozen with fright
It went on for what seemed like hours of terror
To see the Witch's face stare in the dark at the mirror
The Witch told me my girlfriend was a demon
And all this fallin' in love shit, I'm dreamin'
And it's pain to the angels if I don't deliver
I sealed her off in a barrel and rolled her in the river
The Witch told me my left arm is possessed
So I broke it at first and then I went and confessed
But they put me in a home, the arm still wouldn't leave me alone
Finally had to chew it off at the bone (Daeh dereves)
The Witch told me to crawl under my house and just wait
Don't panic if I suffocate
I bit the tail off a possum down there at one point
It's so boring and it's dark but the Witch is my life

Something is standing in between me and my sanity
They say my Witch is just a dream, morbid fantasy
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)

The Witch taught me how to cut up a body (Daeh dereves)
It's nasty and wretched and helluva bloody
But it's gotta get done and somebody's gotta do it (Sbmil ydoolb)
I kicked the fuckin' face in and put my knife through it
The Witch jumped on me again, here we go
Layin' in my bed, I can't breathe anymo'
Layin' in my bed, I can't move anymo'
There's a demon floating in my face, clampin' my jaw
The Witch told me I gotta murder this one kid
'Kay well maybe the witch didn't then, but I did
With a ninja suit, crept through like a black widow
With a crossbow, stuck him in the neck like ditto
The Witch told me about blood that rains
Out of the neck and what particular veins
And about murder, witnessin' death settin' in
And it ain't no Heaven that's lettin' me in (Sbmil ydoolb)

Something is standing in between me and my sanity
They say my Witch is just a dream, morbid fantasy
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)

The Witch told me to put my feet in the fire and hold on
Until everything below the knees gone
Now I'm in a wheelchair with only an arm but don't care
I can still throw my hatchet in the air
The Witch got me in a predicament, it ain't good
I got somebody head posted on my hood
4:30 a.m. and we rollin' through the ghetto (Daeh dereves)
Shaggy ridin' shotgun and the Witch is in the middle

Something is standing in between me and my sanity
They say my Witch is just a dream, morbid fantasy (Sbmil ydoolb)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!) (Sbmil ydoolb)

I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(""Does she really exist?"")
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(""Is it all in my head?"")
(Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
(""Is it really a witch there?"")
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!

Ghetto Zone,Forgotten Freshness,1991,"They got Uzis, they got shotguns, they got explosives
They got access to any kind of weapon they want within 24 hours
We got over 50,000 gangbangers out there

Violent J serving ghetto hard street shit
You know it's potent when the funky-ass beat hits
Rolling the dice and we's hitting point
(""ICP!"") out of Southwest Detroit
Running with a gang of 20 street hoods
Hookers on my back cause I'm selling them cheap goods
Looking through the motherfucking alleyway
They can't catch Violent-Crazy-Ass-Psychopath J
But I guess I wasn't so crazy this time
Now I'm chilling in the back of Car 49
You ask why I'm gripping that metal
They put a man on the moon, but can't do shit for the ghetto
I look at all that and it makes me sick
I wanna grab them motherfuckers, make them swallow a brick
So I grab anybody I can find
Beat a fiend in the head with a goddamn stop sign
Flex one of us and I'ma find you
Bullet rips through your chest and hits a bitch behind you
Killed two birds with one stone
You're laying in the street with a bullet in your dome
And to them hillbillies listening down South
Talk shit about the city, with my nuts in your wife's mouth
And keep stringing on your banjo
Cause we don't like that shit where I come from, bro
Now the ICP stands alone
In the Southwest Ghetto Zone

Southwest Detroit, is the demented one's home
""Ah, for Christ's sake!""
""Ah, you don't talk about that garbage out here.""
""That's for the hell-hole where you come from.""
Southwest Detroit, is the demented one's home
""This is the good part of town.""
""We let you deal with that type of bullshit.""
""Your problems don't concern us.""
""Go home now, well go on!""

Southwest Detroit, is the demented one's home's home
The cops just don't know what to do
Southwest Detroit, is the demented one's home's home
The cops just don't know what to do
Southwest Detroit, is the demented one's home's home

The cops just don't know what to do

Jumpsteady, Rude Boy, and the BSR
They got my back, O.G., you won't make it far
I got my nine in my gut and it's starting to hurt
Where can you keep a gat wearing Skidz and a t-shirt?
Now I'm roaming like a true ghetto thug
Fiends on the sack cause I'm booming that crack
""I know you heard aloud what J said""
When I told you that I sold to your bitch, that basehead
No, you can't argue with the truth
If I hit you in your mouth, you're gonna spit out a tooth
And I laugh at a motherfucking cop
Sitting with his fat ass in a donut shop
At the party, when the ICP shows their face
Billy clubs and handcuffs all over the place
""We're here to protect and protect we do""
Then I ask who the fuck protects us from you
Cops always beating on someone
Shot a mute in the back, he told him not to run
And the motherfucking Black Panthers know it
That's why it's cops now that are catching a bullet
I'm running, I'm running, we'll end the chase
When Jumpsteady puts his gauge in your motherfucking face
Mind your own
In the Southwest Ghetto Zone

""Hey yo, G!""
""Man who the fuck you think you are, man?""
""You know who you're fucking with?""
""The I-C motherfucking P, G!""
""So if I was you I'd step the fuck off before you get shot, boy!""
""Keep running your lips, see what happens motherfuckers!""
""Yeah, G! See what I'm saying, though?""
""Now what's up with that shit?""

Come to Del Ray, a driveby ain't shit
The cops just don't know what to do

Come to Del Ray, a driveby ain't shit
The cops just don't know what to do

""These are my homeboys, vato.""
""See, our homies here is all we have, man.""
""I love them.""
""They love me back, man.""
""We barrio.""

So I guess I'm a bad guy
Cause I cuss a lot, I say ""fuck"" a lot
And I rap to tell you how I'm feeling
When I'm in the old spot, sit up and we wheeling
Through Delray, call it Hellray
It's where the ICP stay (""Yo J!"")
And the forces that always talk shit get beat
And if I'm outnumbered, I gots a gauge in the backseat
'Cause when I'm feeling like a mack dad
In the trunk of my ride, I got weapons I'd never had
A thousand motherfuckers in the back make the car sag
Ronny's fat ass makes the whole damn muffler drag
Rapping to a sack chasing hottie
I told the bitch I ain't never even seen a Maserati
Ever sell out to a freak (""Fuck no!"")
That why I'll tell you that I love to box with a ho
When the check comes I ignore it
And the bitch is gonna ask me to fucking pay for it
I gave the ho an empty 12-pack
Take your ass to the store and bring some Faygo back
That's all I'll pay for bitch, now get the fuck on, ho
Stick around I got something you can suck on, ho
Violent J won't be ganked
By no nappy headed, barefooted, crackheaded sewer skank
You gotta handle your own

Intro (Fearless Fred Fury),Fearless Fred Fury,2019,"Pride, dignity, and an appreciation for life
Do you possess these traits, or do you let others walk all over you?
Do you cry and complain about the conditions of your very existence?
If so, there are some who are angered by your constant lack of self respect
Your low motivation, and your missing drive to make the most of your beating heart
Who out there feels this way about you?
The dead
Those without opportunity, whose time has been spent
The dead cry foul, and they're pointing at you
They are not alone
There is a powerful being from The Dark Carnival
His fury towards you is measured by your own lack of self-respect
His fast-approaching fist will be among the first things you see when you are dead
His pet rat, Flip, feeds only off the fear instilled within you by Red Fred
Fighter for the dead

Six Pedophiles,The Marvelous Missing Link (The Outtakes),2015,"Okay, tomorrow we're gonna take a look at chapters 34 and 35, alright?
And don't forget this Friday, test papers are due
No, no, I told you last week that they would be due on Friday, okay?
So, make sure that's taken care of, and we'll see you tomorrow

The first pedophile, he was teacher
I waited for school to end, under the bleachers
I walked down the halls, dragging my axe
He was pinning papers to the board with tacks
I slipped in the room and raised my weapon
And whistled as he turned around for a second
I buried the blade deep into his scalp
He never even had a chance to cry for help

The next pedophile, he drove a cab
I held him down on 13th Ave
We made some small talk about the weather
All while I got my wire together
He stopped at the light, eyes on the road
I slipped my cord right around his throat
With my knees up, I yanked it back
His head fell forward into his lap

The third pedophile, he worked at home
He probably considered it his safety zone
But he was wrong. I walked right in the door
His chihuahua was barking, but not anymore
He came around the corner. I blasted him flat
And beat him horrendous with a baseball bat
Caved his skull in and left it there
In a pile of blood, brains, bones, and hair

The next pedophile, he did construction
Showed up on the site looking for destruction
Picked up a nail gun, as soon as I spot him
He asked who the fuck I was. I shot him
Three or four more times, all in the neck
And then picked up a sledge hammer and broke his back
Hit him again in the back of the head
His whole skull exploded into a spread

The fifth pedophile was a children's doctor
I grabbed my hatchet, the predator chopper
Walked in his office, the nurse tried to stop me
I gave her a choice: Leave or be chopped meat
She was out of there. I kicked the door in
There he was, website kiddie porn exploring
One swift swing straight down was fatal
His whole head split like a tomato

The last pedophile, he had no job
He was a fuckin' bum who lived with his mom
The lady was old. I waited for her to leave
Simple, with a .38 up my sleeve
I knocked on the door. This shit is gonna be fun
I shot him in the belly. He tried to run
I shot him in both legs, and finally the head
And like that, left him on the front lawn dead

The Killing Fields,Riddle Box,1995,"Laying in my bed, I think of many horror tales
Yet I barely move, my bed is made of nails
I try to roll off, my skin slowly tears away
My flesh is stuck to my bed as I begin my day
Walking out the house, this morning, the sky is red
The streets are crowded with the bodies of the living dead
They're trying to die, they're leaping off of rooftops
Uh, they only scream in pain as their body flops
I'd rather stay inside my home and only pray to die
But my house is been on fire since like '85
I can only stand a night of the fatal smoke
But see you never die, you only burn and choke
And so I leave out the house and walk the land
Wild pigs run and feed off the dying man
And look around you, there's bodies hanging from the trees
But they're not dying, they're only crying ""please""
I hear the thunder in the sky, so I run and hide
The deadly rain may soon come down, you've got to get inside
The lunatics see the lightning, they're screaming, yes
It's raining blood, the streets are a bloody mess
About once or twice a week though it thunder storms
That's when giant heavy red and black clouds form
It's raining blood, and kidneys, and livers from the sky
Prepare cuz when you die, you're coming to the killing fields
""What shall that be? What shall that be? When that final moment comes. When the curtains are drawn, the windows are shut, the doors close, and you've written what you've written, you said it, that's it! What will it be? What about it, mister. When you've had your last beer. You laughed at your family and laughed at your little wife. She begged you not to go out to that bar.""

As I feed off a dead pig, I'm thinking back
To when I had a heartbeat, and how I would act
I would steal from the poor, I'd laugh at the sick
But in the killing fields, you get your fucking neck ripped
So as I walk along, I meet a lot of strange folks
Some people with no eyes, and gashed open throats
And if they notice your eyeballs are working well
They try to dig em out your skull, and go for self
Now in the summertime, it's like a whole 'nother realm
Water becomes fire, and oceans overwhelm
To walk outside, the heat will surely cook your brains
Try to run across the street your hair will burst to flames
Victims in a panic run from the heated light
Underneath the city, into the sewer pipes
Until the fire's gone this becomes your new land
But there's no food, so you feed off the other men
And now it's been seven months, I'm barely fed
I chase a baby billy goat with a human's head
He's steady screaming ""Let me be! Let me be!""
But while I chase him there's another demon chasing me
All of time moves backwards, I'm growing old
And still the clouds are burning fire, and so I'm told
That there's a lot of living souls such as the rich
That choose to live like a bitch, I'll see you in the Killing Fields
""You've had your big time of lust and sin and filth. What is
The end going to be when you realize that time is up? You've
Crossed the finish line going in the wrong direction. What
Shall it be? What about it, young man? When you spent your life
In a few years time? You're burned out shell at 25 years of
Age. What shall it be? What about it?
You could go to hell (what shall it be?)

What's up player?

Right

Man, let me tell you somethin'
(Violent J)
Check this out (What up?)
It might sound shady
But I fuck a rich hoe named Grady
They call her that cause her hair is blue
She's one of them rebellious rock chicks too
Anyway she has a big hoop in her neden
Rings, chains, needles, pins, and things
Tattoos, it might sound fierce
But I swear to God the bitch gots her butthole pierced
She told me she liked it rough, I'm like, ""straight""
First thing she did was punch me in the face (Pow!)
I'm about to plant one to her jaw
Before I could she was tonguin' my balls
Oooooh whadablah I dropped my weapon
Looked down and my nuts was kicksteppin'
We was butt naked all over the floor
It felt weird though cause we was at the Faygo store
(Chorus)
Momma don't like this wicked clown
I might come from the dark side of town
When she's gone and you're alone again
50 bucks says you'll let me in

Hey yo Shaggy

You know they don't like juggalos over there

50 bucks says you don't get nothing

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I've done fuck bitches both sides of the border
Nuthin' like Greta the millionaire's daughter
Something like 950 sumthin' pounds
5'8"" tall and she love clowns
Bitch had titties like water balloons
My boys used to swing off 'em like baboons
She'd buy us chocolate Swiss cheese pie
And take it, and bake it completely naked
An ocean of loopness it ain't like nuthin'
Just jump anywhere in the mess and start humpin'
Don't really matter where I stick my dick
I just reach, and grab, and stab, and jab
But that ain't the reason that I love this hoe
She used to do a funny little trick with my dick hole
She'd blow into it and make a wish
And my nuts would expand like puffer fish
(Chorus)
Momma don't like this wicked clown
I might come from the dark side of town
When she's gone and you're alone again

Vultures,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"You wait for death to happen
You loot the bloody wrecks
You con the elderly feeblos up out they pension checks
Up out they penchant checks
You kick em when they down
You tell them God is coming
You work the lowly souls
Eight-hundred numbers running
You sell what you repossess
You clean them out they nest
You wait for them to try to rest
Then yank it out they chest
You sell them medicine
You make them think they need
You come around the flowers
But you's a dirty weed
Like serpents and snakes
They rattle and bite
Whatever it takes
They get what they like
Always they fake
And know it ain't right
Your money, they make it
Then gone in the night
And make no mistake
They do got a heart
It's blacker than coal
And hard as a rock
Don't quiver or shake
When they take and part
And breaking apart
Who swim with the sharks

Pick at the eyes, pick at the brain
Pick us, your wretchedly sick and deranged
Cause you's a vulture
A wicked vulture
Pick at the heart, pick at the soul
Pick em and drag em down into your hole
Cause you's a vulture
A wicked vulture
You cut the fingers off
If there's a ring still on em
Even if they come in cursed
You still want em
You promised big things
Is headed for next year
But then you disappear
As soon as the checks clear
You lash out at the poor
And tell em to give you more
Sell everything off for the church
Sleep on the floor
You point the juiciest necks
Out to all the vampires
But lurking in the dark
You might get bit by spiders
Lizards and bugs
Flies and mosquitoes
Hookers with drugs
And dirty ass needles
Alleyway cats
Possums and rats
Killers with gats
Attacking with bats
They scums, bums
As anything comes and goes
They pimps
With tons of hoes
Dirty like all of those
I suppose
Cuz wicked's the way that they chose

Go away doc
Leave him alone
When will he die?
I'll be at home
Who gets his car?
Who gets the crib?
Those are his pills?
I'm popping the lid
I give him a week
What do I get?
Put me in his will
He's moving again
Sign it like him
Cut off that beep
There go his morphine
That shit is sweet
Give me a hit
The preacher called
He's trying to get paid
Who's feeding his dog?
Fuck that dog
It's beeping again
Ohh, that morphine's kicking in
What about his money
He wants the church to have it
How long till he dies
Let's check his wallet
Let's pull the plug
Do you think he can hear?
He's fucking dying
He doesn't care
Like serpents and snakes
They rattle and bite
Whatever it takes
They get what they like
And they gonna hide
And they gonna run
But they're gonna suffer
Some Carnival fun
And make no mistake
They do got a heart
It's blacker than coal
And hard as a rock
They gonna visit
The Carnival grounds
And they gonna perish
We promise you now

 the sky

I climbed up the tree in the back and got on my roof top
With my .22 it's hot with little pops
Started bustin' off shots aimin' all at the sky
I emptied out the gun bustin' all at the sky
Then I went and stole the bow and arrow from my dad
To the arrow tips I tied gasoline soaked rags
Climbed up with the Zippo, lit 'em off in the sky
A trail of black smoke leading off in the sky
I bought some Chinese stars from the Kung-Fu surplus
They had 'em under the glass, I made the purchase
Climbed up and I whizzed 'em off in the sky
Even stood up on the chimney, whizzed 'em off in the sky
Then I found a double barrel with shells at Wal-Mart
I threw it in next to the Faygo in my shopping cart
I got home, climbed up and blew it off in the sky
3:20 in the morning, bustin' off at the sky
I got a blow gun too, a real one at that
I dip the tips in poison, lay up on my back
And now they're piercing through the air straight up into the sky
It's like the only thing you hear is ""phew"" into the sky
I bought a harpoon off the Internet and went up
And tried to shoot it but the fuckin' rip off, it got stuck
I said ""fuck it"" and I threw the spear up into the sky
As fuckin' hard as I could, I threw it into the sky
I'm sprayin' mace up there, I throw M-80s up there
I'm shootin' everything I got, I sit and wait in my chair
Because I hate the sky above, whether moon or sun
Whether rain or snow, since the pain begun
I'm tryin' to aim for the Heavens up into the sky
Tell me why the love of my life had to die?
How's she gonna leave me and not even say bye?
I know that she's an angel and they're lettin' her fly
Every plan I thought we made together was a lie
She could of hung on, I bet she didn't even try
She left me dry, and that no one can deny
And when she fall from the sky, I'm askin' her why

Not many ninja's exist today, yet they all have indomitable fighting skills
As a part of ninjitsu
(ninja's of the indomitable fighting skills, of a ninja, a ninjer, a
Mutha'fuckin' ninja)
No matter what weapons you use, a ""ninjer"" will never die!""
Damn I wish I could be a Shogun Samurai
So I could swing a sword and make necks fly
I'd go to school and ninja-crawl through the halls
N' then I'd jump out n' stab bitches in the balls
Cuz I remember these kids from the playground
Everybody'd hang around, we were all down
But then we grew up, n' everybody turned away
N' now they dissin' me, yellin', ""fuck Nerdy-J""
I sit n' think at how it changed as I got olda'
As I think I draw a ninja on my folda', Ugh
What I would do if I only had a ninja sword
You'd see blood start flingin' on tha chalkboard
I'd tell the whole class, ""nobody move or jiggle
First one that do I'll make yer fuckin' neck wiggle.""
Everyone would start jockin', the news would take my picture'
DAMN I wish I could be a ninja
(chorus)
Damn I wish I could be a ninja, ninja(X3)
Damn It'd feel good to see people up on it'(allX2)
After I was done killin' all the yuppie fucks
All the poor kids would come n' swing from my nuts
And I would walk home feelin' like a Samurai
I'd walk in the house, and see my momma cry
I's ask why, she'd point to my drunk pops
He tried ta hit her again, but that shit STOPS
I kick him in his throat, you hear his neck break
I throw a roundhouse and knock his beard off his face
I tell him, ""Dad, now look at all your broken glass
Why don't cha pick it all-up n' stick it in your ass.""
I watch him do it, ""Now hurry up ya take forever.""
When he was done I'd squeeze his butt-cheeks together'
""Now get the FUCK out my house, never come back!""
I throw a Chinese star, stick him in his ass-crack (Ahhhh)
I turn to my mudda, ""I'm sorry that he hit'cha!""
DAMN I wish I could be a ninja

If I could be a ninja, my daddy'd be dead, but
I still gotta go to work, n' pay the rent
I flip french fries for $2.25
Mr. Donny works here he's fuckin' 45
But he'd think he ""da' shit"" cuz he's da' boss
I guess he don't know that his life is a loss
I walk in....about 5 minutes late...
Cuz I was tryin' ta clean the blood off my ninja blade
So, Mr. Donny wanna try n' get up in my face
Screamin' at me, sweatin' over this place
Mad, cuz I'm late, he's no betta' than me
Just another bitch workin' for next to free

And cuttin' up his body, and fry him on the grill
But he's too fuckin' wack, and I could kill this bitch
And I don't even need to be a ninja

And it was dark as fuck, I couldn't see, not even with a torch
I hear the streets talkin', and they aware of my moves

I try to jog a little, crow eyes glow like cats
Demonic zombies runnin' up on me, I slap 'em with the bat
But my eyes keep bleedin' from the rays of the darkness
They powerful and burn you somethin' heartless (uh!)
I hear a giant thumpin', some kind of ogre or somethin'
I see the phantom screamin' as this giant behemoth is comin'
And it swung at me, I felt a rip, my head went spinnin'
And flippin' and rollin' and finally landed in position
I could see my body still standin', headless as fuck
It finally fell but what the hell, still got my nugget but I'm stuck
I can't move, fuck, I'm only a face, why even try?
On top of that, it's a centipede crawlin' in my eye
I wanna die

Everyday I die (Back to the start, another try)
I got the time, so why shouldn't I?
Everyday I die (Back to the start, another try)
I got the time, so why shouldn't I?

I got too much time on my hands

I tried to visit J, I walked out into the cold
I see they don't collect they dead, they all up over the road
And some are fully rotted, and some they must've just spotted
I seen a headless body that resembles J's, but I doubt it
I seen a centaur, I threw a pitch fork at it above
I watch it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood
I'm fuckin' 'bout to hurl, I close my eyes and walk on
As giant crows swoopin' at me, got me, carry me on
I cut its claws with the hatchet that I keep in my hand
Even in Hell, you best believe I keep the hatchet in my hand
And as I'm fallin' now, I see the Witch is ridin' my chest
With its claws on my neck, screamin' I should've confessed
I slammed down into an iron gate, a demon statue near me
Four points stickin' out my chest, I'm hangin' there dearly
And the hungry goblins, they got a fire beneath me
They're cookin' my legs, to make myself eat me
I wanna die

Everyday I die (Back to the start, another try)
I got the time, so why shouldn't I?
Everyday I die (Back to the start, another try)
I got the time, so why shouldn't I?

I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands

Everyday I die (I got too much time on my hands)
I got the time, so why shouldn't I? (I got too much time on my hands)
Everyday I die (I got too much time on my hands)
I got the time, so why shouldn't I? (I got too much time on my hands)

Growing Again,The Tempest,2007,"When I grow up, I wanna be a giant...
The biggest muthafucka alive!
That would be the shit!
I wanna be tall, I wanna be big...

{Violent J:}
The jump off - One summer night, I noticed my shoes was fittin' wrong
My feet was all a sudden a half an inch too long
I jumped in my car, and thought
""Now who the fuck was in my seat?""
Fuckin' with my levers and re-adjustin' my mirrors
I stopped to get a Slurpie and I noticed I was floodin' in my jeans
Gettin' back in my car, I split my ass seam
My shit ain't hardly fittin' any more, fucked up detergent, or
I'm growin' bigger than a muthafuckin' dinosaur!
Got out the car and had to duck to get in Shaggy's place
You shoulda seen the fuckin' look up on his painted face he said...
{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
Holy fuckin' shit, I don't know if you knowin'
But you're growin' and it's obviously showin' homie!

{Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J:}
Watch where ya fall down (oh shit)
Watch where ya fall down (oh fuck)
Watch where ya fall down (oh shit)
Watch where ya fall down (oh fuck)
Now I'm growin' again, now I'm growin' again (oh shit)
Now I'm growin' again, now I'm growin' again (oh fuck)


{Violent J:}
The next day I woke up, Shaggy's three dogs were trippin' on me
Layed out on his couch, a smooth nine foot three
They don't fuckin' love me no more, I stand up
And put a hole in Shaggy's ceilin' with my big ass nug
The dogs ran, Shaggy's like...
{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
Holy fuck, don't move!
First thing you gotta fuckin' do is do not move!
We need to get you out the house before you fuck my shit up
{Violent J:}
I had to crawl through the hall into the front yard, then get up
I'm lookin' through the eyes of a 12 foot tall man
Don't feel any different, though I could use a tall can
I'm growin' every hour and the reason's unknown
Now I'm sittin' on your home with my feet on your lawn
Damn...



{Violent J:}
To me SUV s and Sedans, they're like pop cans
A little bit heavier but tin in my hands
Shaggy's chillin' on my shoulder in a custom made basket
{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
I'm tryin' to ride wit' my boy in this bitch and outlast it!
{Violent J:}
I try to stay in one place, it ain't no use in hidin'
Hella choppers beamin' wit' coppers on all sides
And the media governments are offerin' jobs
(He's a freak of nature!)
World press, scientists, all swarmin' wit' this mob

All around us...
(Incredible!)
{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
Fuck it J, you only gettin' bigger dog
You and me, right now, homie go for a jog
We've been sittin' here, lettin' them observe us and for what?
I say you tell 'em ""Fuck the world!"" and throw the lotus up!
{Violent J:}
Now I'm runnin', every step is 32 miles
Shakin' the earth, turnin' buildings into piles
And I'm runnin', crushin' trees like blades of grass
My head's above the clouds, all they see is my ass
And I'm runnin', 600 mile an hour wind gust
Footsteps, explosions, three days of dust
And I'm runnin', and I can still hear Shaggy on the megaphone
{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
""Keep, keep, keepin' on, don't stop, come on!""
{Violent J:}
And I'm runnin' through states in two steps or less
Through the oceans and don't even be gettin' my nuts wet
And I'm runnin', finally gravity took me away
I ran right off the planet into the black of outer space
And I'm runnin'...",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-growing-again-lyrics
Toxic Love,The Pendulum Tome,2000,"(Shaggy 2 Dope)
This is a tale of misplaced love
A tale of a man searching for that misplaced love in all the
Wrong places and how he gets his heart ripped out of his chest and
Stuck in his face so he can watch it slowly stop beating let's
Listen on and hear how my gumpy friend violent jay goes about
Getting his feelings crushed once again
(Violent J)
After 3 years in a mental asylum
I'm finally out and I'm fine now no doubt
Rolling home I see a bitch on a payphone
She was fat and round and had it going on
She had a name tag on Roxy Carol
Stepped up to her like hello
We was kicking it
I said I got this dick sup on lickin it
She said I'm down for the tactics
Then my dick stood up like a Tucson cactus
I threw her in the back of my jaloppe
She was wet and sloppy
But nothing could stop me
I was like jesus
Her neden was yellow and smelled like cheese pizza
I paid it no mind
I stuck my dick in raw and comenced to grind

Did it hurt you?

The whole car smelled like pickles
I stuck my toe in her ass
And tweaked her titty nipples
We fucked for about an hour
I dropped her off where I found her and went for the shower
I got home and I kicked back
Thought about the shower haha fuck that
When I woke up the very next morning
I was awake but my dick was snoring
It was whistling and shooting out smoke
The head was spinning like a dayton hundred spoke
I started shaking and sweating
I had a fever
My dick was swelled up like a faygo 2 liter
It was greenish with purple bungions
And dripping blue skeet and flaking like onions
She gave me skiffilufigus no doubt
I'ma find that bitch and knock her the fuck out

I'm on a mission I search and roam
Cuz my dick hole is spurting up pink foam
And I'm dragging my balls behind me
They're as big as a mailbox bumpy and slimy
Thank god I ain't dead yet
My dick is crispy but my drawers are wet somehow
There she is on the same payphone
Near Zug Island in the industrial waste zone
Wait a minute y'all hold up
Is that the same bitch I was with she looks toe-up
Holy fuck nothings in place that ain't a girl at all
It's a barrel of toxic waste!
Oh lord what have I done?
Roxy Carol is a toxic waste barrel
Me and my green dick headed back to the looney bin
I'm here to turn myself back in

Guts on the Ceiling,Carnival of Carnage,1991,"Oh, you'll never guess what's up
My muckin' head blew up
My chin's in a old man's back yard
I gotta sneak through his yard to find the fothermucker
And he's got a pitbull dog
And it's sittin' on my chin like a frog on a log
I throw a bone to try to distract
'Cause I'm wantin' my chinny-chin-chin back
I'll never be one to boast
But there's my tongue hangin' off the light post
'Cause my head exploded
And my brain's unloaded
All over this beautiful city
Teeth and bones to the nitty-gritty
There's my eyeball stuck to the wall
Right next to my splattered jaw
I don't dig this game
Chasin' my brains all through the sewer drains
My head's all over the block
'Cause I done went lunatic-tock, tick-tock
Come on dog, what's wrong with my head
It blew apart but I still ain't dead
I get no respect
I got nothin' but guts hangin' off my neck

If you come across a spine
Best believe it's mine
Oh, forget about my tongue
'Cause vato can't breathe without no lungs, heh
I lost both of mine
Now that's an item that I wouldn't mind to find
But forget about that
'Cause I'm roaming the streets with a splattered back
I'm trying to rap to this freak
But she can see my ribs all in the street
Then the chitchat went dead
She noticed that I ain't got no head
Shh, I think I hear my heart
But damn, it got hit by a SMART Bus
And landed in Pontiac
So I tell my mellow to send it back
Come on, why did my back blow up
Look for my guts, look for my guts
I got a call from Nate the Mack
Says he might have found part of my back
Then bring it on over, ace
I got slabs all over the place

Rich boy's in trouble
Car broke down on a drive through the ghetto
All the weird people, you gotta get the fuck out
Need to use the phone? Step into my fun house
Hey yo, Dope, looks like we got another
He'd like to go for a ride on the neck cutter
Straight to the cart for the death spectacular
Just ignore the dead body sittin' next to ya
Get ready for the carnival thrills
Should've kept your little faggot ass in the hills
Boom! through the door into the room, you gotta check it out
It's where we cut your fingers off and stick 'em in your mouth
That should show you that, you greedy little rich fuck
If you're bucking with the juggla you're a dead duck
Eight fingers in your mouth and two stickin' out your nose
Further down the hall, the room of joker-o's
That's where you get beat by 17 wicked clowns
For the 17 dead bodies never found
And they jump on your back 'til your ribs crack
Toss you in the cart and push you down the deadly track
Spinning and twisting, rolling and bumping
The dead fuck next to you's trying to tell ya something
Listen close, you can barely make it out
""Bitch, you ain't shit in Violent J's fun house!""

""Help me, I'm trapped in here. Somebody let me out
Oh my god! Ah!""
(Teggun ym ni kcis m'I)
""Come here, rich boy
My head is spinning 360 degrees
Richie, richie, richie
Come here""

""Bitch, fuck you, yeah, know what I'm saying?
Wicked clowns running the funhouse
And ain't no way to get out, so just chill and get your neck cut like a man!""

Pick a card, any card, any motherfucking card...
(A joker's card!)
Sorry, bitch (Aw!), the luck of the draw
Violent J's gonna have to ice your jaw
Smack, bang, snip, boom
(Send that motherfucker off to the next room)
Crash through the doors on the windy, spinny trail
Through the loop-de-loop and into a big nail
Straight through your left eye and out the back of his head
(Ah!) (Is he dead?)
No, good, you get to go to the next phase
It's the room of giggles because of your ways
You like to sit and laugh at people when they suffer
Well, now you sit and watch me laugh when I stick your mother
It's the fun house, bitch, everything's funny
You act like whipping on your ass ain't funny
And the ride of your life only gets faster
(All for the Ringmaster)
I take my Bobo gun and blow your fuckin' mouth in
Eh, yo, the next room is called the chicken pen
And it's a little tribute to the bigots of the South
We take a dead chicken shove it in your mouth
And we stuff it down your throat with a pitchfork
'Cause you're a bigot, it's what you get for
Now I take your sorry ass and I throw you out
'Cause I don't need your dead body stinkin' up my funhouse
Funhouse, stinkin' up my funhaugh!

""I got him! I got him! No! He's right here! Oh no! Oh He got away! Run! That way! Get him! Oh, little baby , ha ha ha ha ha! Come here, little boy, I got your candy. Mommy ain't gonna help you now, you little bitch""

""Yeah! Rich ass, bitch ass, snitch ass ho!
You get your motherfucking neck chopped in Violent J's fun house
So don't fuck with the wicked clowns you, punk-ass bitch!""

""Come here, little boy, I have some candy for you. I'll crack your head like Humpty Dumpty! Ooh! Little boy, come out, come out, wherever you are. The clowns are so funny!  I like them! I like it here! This little kiddie's getting his neck chopped off tonight. Ha ha ha! Woo! Come here! Ooh! Ha ha ha! Woo. Little Richie, come here. Your mommy said you're gonna come with me.

Prom Queen,Tunnel of Love,1996,"Won't you be my prom queen? (another morning)
Won't you be my prom queen?
Everybody has a real good time
Won't you be my prom queen? (must take for my senior prom)
Won't you be my prom queen?
Everybody has a real good time
Another morning, I must get up and go to school
I'm taking too long gettin dressed, tryin to look my best
Because today is not your ordinary every morning
My high school prom is coming and I heed my daddy's warnings
I'm going to find myself a girl to take to the prom
I shouldn't have too much trouble because I'm
I'm very nice, my mother says I'm very handsome
When I wear my good vest, and mother knows best
I got to school, I straggle through the hallways
I stop and gaze at all the girls just like always
But this time, I must now approach them (or)
Or my daddy might get mad and break my wrist again (ow)
And so I chose her, her hair, it matches with her face
She is so lovely, my heart pulse begin to race
I make my way between her friends and to her presence
Hello, Christine, would you be my prom queen?
I'd rather die, I'd rather die, I'd rather die... (repeat over)
(would you be my prom queen? no! aaah! prom queen)
There was a time when I could accept a no
That was before, Christine is gonna have to go
My parents will be proud of me when I bring her home
So now I sit and watch her practice in the gym dome
Christine is famous, she has so many different friends
Will they miss her when she's dead or will they just pretend
Nobody talks to me, I only talk to I
And I been telling myself all day, she's gotta die
""Good morning, everybody. This is Principal Rogers, and I would just
Like to congradulate our Senior class and wish them at tonight's
Prom dance.""
Won't you be my prom queen? (I can be your prom baby)
Won't you be my prom queen?
Everybody has a real good time
It was really fuckin easy, I mean, who would hate her?
I took a towel from the locker room to suffocate her
I had to throw away her gym bag and all her folders
And when it got dark, I caried her home on my shoulders
My daddy was asleep, when I snuck her in the back
I thought about my situation and it's kind of whack
It sounds cheap, but we're having prom in my cellar
But she's dead, I guess I'll never have to tell her
I took the bottles up to Meijer's, four a dollars worth
I took the seventeen dollars that was in her purse
I bought balloons and streaming and stuff to munch
I had a dollar left, I bought a Faygo Punch
I hung the streamers and balloons on my basement wall
I banged my head a couple times, I'm just too fuckin tall
I would have took her to the school like a normal man
But I had to kill her first they'd never understand
I put a record on and then I picked her up to dance
I bet she cannot feel the woody growing in my pants
I know my daddy would be proud of all that I've done
Instead of burning me, he'd probably come and hug his son
I think about it as I dance slowly to the beat
The more I think about it tears are rolling down my cheek
I hope I showed Christine a night like no other
After all, that's how my daddy did my mother
""Our Seniors deserve a night to celebrate with friends, celebrate
All their great work. Prom night is your very own special night
And everybody always remember their high school prom.""

That neden blowin' bubbles, pink and blue in the air
Hey baby, see us fuckin' in the mirror? Fog it up, we disappear

Look when you dickin' it so, shit, you

When swimming in my Atlantis, it's like the rest of the world ends
My house is 85% baths, so bring your girlfriends
Uh, four shower heads, hot water for an hour
These bitches' ass so dirty they could grow me a flower
Step inside the Spa Bruce, I'll treat you to my sauna
Take a load off your feet, you big-ass Honey Boo Boo mama, bitch
But if you stay all night, I'll see you tomorrow
How about that water bill? For real, you plan to leave a couple dollars?
On my clown face I'ma seat ya, like the taste of your 
Shaggy's waiting to meet ya, ""We a double feature, boo""
Treat your booty, leave it fruity, coconut scented refreshing
Soft to the touch like crushed  ink velvet impressions
Hot oil treatment extensions with cherry reflections
Your caramel complexion from exotic connections
Follow my direction for erotic perfection
I'll inject my erection without protection
Swim with me, bitch

Splish splish splash, bitch, strip fast
Soapy soap, drip, float, slip it in, smash
Soapy suds, scrub a scrub, bubble tub time
Scrub a dub, rinse, wash, towel it off, shine
Well, splish splish splash, bitch, strip fast
Soapy soap, drip, float, slip it in, smash
Soapy suds, scrub a scrub, bubble tub time
Scrub a dub, rinse, wash, towel it off, shine

Splish splish splash
(Scrub that, scrub that, scrub that butthole clean)
Bitch strip fast (Fast fast fast fast)
Soapy subs, scrub a scrub, bubble tub time
(Scrub that, scrub that, scrub that butthole clean)
Splish splish splash (Clean, clean, butthole)

Gone,The Great Milenko 20th Anniversary Bonus Disc - Bonus Spells,2017,"Verse 1: 
Everything is so clear, Easter, Fresh in my head
The beautiful girl, and everything is said
We lay in my bed, for now we just lay
I could only dream you'd be mine one day
My dream came true, although it took long
You kissed me on the bed to the Pearl Jam song. He heh
I remember all this just like it was yesterday (It wasn't yesterday)
You called me everywhere, together every hour, even in the shower (Slept in the shower)
You took me by your house, you told me you were scared, that I would think you were rich, somehow you cared what I thought
You even spent your every dime on me, but more than that, you spent your time with a fool, that couldn't hold a gem like you down, for very long.. now tell me if its gone (Don't don't don't let me, don't don't don't let me down)
Chorus:
I lived my life in an endless fight and just when everything's right I look and you're gone
I prey for a chance to make it all up, I knock on the door and remain shut I look and you're gone
I've tried to be strong, can't take it for long, I still don't know what went wrong I look and you're gone
I've tried everything, I'm on my last string, I'm stuck here under you're wing I look and you're gone
(I'm straight cause I still got memories, that'll be with me for life)
Verse 2: 
If I came home late, my day had been rough (Sometimes you would break out with that whale stuff) You'd cook dinner, chicken and spaghetti sauce, in a house, where only you took a loss
You had a new car, you could hardly drive, 'cause you had a 95, and a dive, I was broke and you supported my dream, this makes it our dream, we were a team
When it came true, I left you why, when I look at all this, I wanna die, You were there, you hung on until you fell (A woman like you didn't need that hell)
Even if I never see you again, Its so important that you hear me, and understand, that I'm sorry, I love you, I never meant wrong, and now I gotta ask myself, is it gone? (Don't, don't, don't let me, Don't don't don't let me down)

(Nothing anyone can ever say or do,will change the fact that you were once mine)
Verse 3: 
Its all only worth half, everything I do, Half way done, half without you, I play for a chance to make it all right. Its hell everyday (and worse every night)
But i'm alright though, my life is still worth living, just knowing that you're on this earth, But you're not with me, I'm left far behind, but its nobody ones fault but mine that you're gone (don't don't don't (its the fault of mine) Don't let me down)

(I'll never meet anybody as fresh as you, and if I do, it won't be the same as you, but you chose someone else over me, so fuck it, now I'm (?) )

[Verse: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
(All night) find me robbing your jewels
Setting fires, damaging, and breaking into schools
(In the darkness) it's much easier to be heartless
Break the window out the Lincoln and screwdriver start this
Mugging people, dropping on 'em from street lights
Stab them with garden tools or beat 'em with pipes
So don't come out, stay inside, cozy and tucked
And if I'm breaking in, your old lady's gettin'... fucked
(All day) car jacks, get out the van
As soon as they step out, I pop 'em anyways (BLAMMM!)
I rob liquor stores with a little .22 hold
I know it's nothing, but it's somethin' when it's bustin' at your nose
(Sunny days) I hit up the beach with cleats on
And stomp bitches in they ass, trying to tan in they thongs
(All day) see me fucking hookers at truck stops
And then I kill them, 'cause that's where my buck stops
(All night) I'm wicked and I got the power
Blood sheds on the wall during the witching hour
(In the darkness) see me ride by in an Impala
Dragging some funky ass by the foot and hear him holler
(In the nighttime) I take what's rightfully mine
I run through emergency rooms and sever life lines
Fuck the limelight, I'm the one I need to impress
With a double tip swinging axe chop to your chest
(All day) I'm selling coke laced joints to little kids
I'm a clown in a milk truck handlin' biz
(In the sunshine) I've been known to take shots at the po
I'm in the bushes with the camouflage on and rifle scope
(All day) I'm wicked, I keep it horrifying
Axe murdered some kid and his dad kite flying
I knocked the fucking mailman out on the grass
And burnt holes in his face with a magnifying glass
(All night) I fly like a vampire bat
And murder people telling stories where the campfire's at
(Blame it on the moonlight or blame it on the boogie)
I shot the motherfucking sheriff and his deputy rookie
(When it's dark out) I hit the streets in the shadows
And grab yours and boogie the woogie and stab hoes
Don't even give me a pound when you see this clown
You getting cut the fuck up and chopped the fuck down
(All day) catch me picnicking with bitches in the park
Right before I ice pick them in the heart 24/7
If it ain't us, it's somebody gettin' bloody
Wicked clowns ain't the only ones nutty, buddy
(Catch me tongue kissing) a severed head
Catch me burying another bitch dead behind the shed

Basehead Attack,The Wraith: Hell’s Pit,2004,"""It's just, my family's out of gas and around the corner and, you know, I just got off work, and, man, if you could just give me, like, a couple bucks, man, I could mail it right back to you, as soon as I get-""

So there I was watchin' Sanford & Son, workin' the graveyard shift
At a party store, rollin' a spliff
I'm behind the glass I see crackheads all night
But tonight the moon is red and shit ain't feelin' so right
My first sight was a basehead tryin' to break into my car
In plain view, too I ran out with a crowbar
Hammered it across his cranium, he fell over dead
But no blood, only dust, he's a fuckin' basehead
Here come another one jumpin' out of a tree
But I ain't even have to move, he missed by like twenty feet
He slammed down on the pavement, I quickly started kickin'
Beat him with the crowbar 'til he finally stopped twitchin' (""Stop it! Stop! Stop it!"")
Looked behind me, seen another zombie in the register
I'm used to shoo'in' 'em off (""Get the fuck out of here!"") from beggin' from the customers
But now I gotta reach up under the seat and grab the hand-ax
Whipped it from there and stuck it into his back

(The attack of the baseheads) They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin' they always missin'
(The attack of the baseheads) Every city, every town
They always on the hunt for somethin' never to be found
(And I'm like ""What the fuck?!"")
(The attack of the baseheads) They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin' they always missin'
(The attack of the baseheads) Every city, every town
They always on the hunt for somethin' never to be found

Goddammit, it's two more in the cooler once I'm back in the sto'
Pull my hand-ax out that back and then attack him some mo'
I charged, but he busted me in the head with a Pepsi
No effect, I left him shakin' on the floor like epilepsy
With they necks severed, fuckin' zombies for rocks
Another jumped my back and we went through the glass into the parking lot
He tried to kill me, he told me ""Gimme some change!""
All diggin' in my ear for it and shit, deranged!
I grabbed him by his head and tried to yank it to the left to break his neck
But his head spun all the way around, and that was fuckin' it
I was outta there, I seen another comin' out the grave
Zombies, beggin' for change!
I'm fuckin' swingin' at em, knock they chin off their face
But they still comin' at me, hands out, they wanna base
They must think my white eyeballs are giant crack rocks
I gotta slap 'em out they funky-ass socks, help me!

(The attack of the baseheads) They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin' they always missin'
(The attack of the baseheads) Every city, every town
They always on the hunt for somethin' never to be found
(The attack of the baseheads) They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin' they always missin'
(The attack of the baseheads) Every city, every town
They always on the hunt for somethin' never to be found

They don't have a brain left behind they empty eyes
They want crack rocka coca and they buzzin' like flies
You might pull they arm off, you try to shake their hand
Because their souls been gone, it's just a shell of a man
Walkin' around lookin' for rock anyway they can get it
Even if you got AIDS, them dirty bitches let you hit it
And you still gettin' something worse than you already got
I seen one catch one in the head, not even know he got shot
It was crack smoke blowing out the side of his head
He put a champagne cork in the hole and that was it
Basehead zombies, millions of 'em and more
With the steamroller, roll 'em over flat on the floor
They're like dead-ass bodies walkin' around without the ghost
With no clue where they fuckin' headed but the rock roast
Opportunities were given, they let 'em all pass
Now they themselves ain't worth the shit out they ass

(The attack of the baseheads) They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin' they always missin'
(The attack of the baseheads) Every city, every town
They always on the hunt for somethin' never to be found
(The attack of the baseheads) They comin' for your goods
Simultaneously, in fifty thousand neighborhoods
(The attack of the baseheads) They come out the dark
And they comin' for you, they wanna pull out your heart and smoke it
(The attack of the baseheads) They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin' they always missin'
(Fuckin' baseheads)
(The attack of the baseheads) Every city, every town
They always on the hunt for somethin' never to be found
(Crack rocka coca)
(And I'm like ""What the fuck?!"")
(The attack of the baseheads) They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin' they always missin'
(Crack rocka coca)
(The attack of the baseheads) Every city, every town
They always on the hunt for somethin' never to be found

Wax Museum,The Ringmaster,1994,"Greetings
Welcome to the gypsy of fortunes
Your coin was very much appreciated
And now I shall grant you your future
It seems my cards of tarot have dealt you a very odd hand
A hand of six jokers cards
, this is very rare
And suggests something most hideous is approaching you
You should be visited by a dark circus
A circus of horror, pain and anguish
This traveling mass of evil will leave your lifeless corpse to rot
While entrapping your soul to displayed at future stops
Oh yes, you must also be aware that it is your own evil doings
Which have brought about this dreaded carnival's visit
All of the sins and hatred you have cast during your life
Have whipped and spun into form, the form of one
One who leads this gruesome parade of pain into your life
One sinister beast, one known only as... Ringmaster!
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the museum, the wax museum
Thousands of dead souls covered in wax
All of the rare exhibits you are about to encounter
Of the strange and wondrous creations of the one and the only
Leader of them all
So both dead and undead please welcome the Ringmaster!

""Purpose, question, kill""
[Verse 1: Violent J &

The ICP is of the Ringmaster
And the Ringmaster is of the actions of mankind
Yeah, motherfucker! now you gotta face your worst enemy
And that's yourself 
(Bitch!)
Every wicked thing you've ever done
Has come back now
And it's gonna whip your little ass, bitchboy!
(Yeah, motherfucker!)
Oh Us? we're just clowns
We just work for the Ringmaster 
(Clowns man!)
With the wave of his magic wand
I step forward, wind back
And swing this battle axe
Upside your mother fucking head
Ho!

Ring of hearts

So step right up as the Ringmaster
Takes you on the ride of your life
Horror and fear, smiles and tears
And oh ever so overdue
The Ringmaster rises up and lifts across the sky
Through the forest and down the river
Along the valley, over the hill
And down the trail and up the sidewalk
Only to surprise you and yours
At your very front door

Strange, strange that I have thoughts  so different from the ones that I see, the ones that scream in agony, strange to know how I felt, but not so strange

What's your pleasure?
Wh-wh-why don't you go into the next room and start getting undressed?
Wha-wha-what's your pleasure?

Fat Sweaty Betty, the bitch ain't nothing new
Her ma's used to babysat me back when we was two
We'd go to the playground and to the skating rink
And we'd go under the bleachers and she'd let me hit the stank, well uh
She moved across town and never came back
Until the other day, I seen her at the Chicken Shack
She said her name was Betty, I can't believe this shit
The sexy little girl is now a fat sweaty bitch
She said, ""Hey, J, tell me how ya been?""
She had a piece of chicken gizzard stuck to her chin
I told her, ""hold still,"" and flicked it off her face and said
""Betty, oh, Betty, what you say we leave this place?""
I took her back to the crib and hit it all night
I let my fingers run across the rippled cellulite
Ooh, it was nasty, but I don't let it bother me
She rolled over, fucking knocked the wind out of me
I couldn't breathe, she wouldn't stop, I'm almost dead
I took the lamp, and bust it on her fucking head
We got dressed, I gave her a little kiss goodbye
Fat Sweaty Betty, My fat sweaty pumpkin pie

Fat Sweaty Betty, tell me when you're ready
Fat Sweaty Betty, tell me when you're ready

There's this big fat slop of shit, people call her Betty
Flabs of fat on her back, her neck, sweaty
Boogers running out her nose all over her lips
Can't tell the difference from her titties to her hips
But fuck all that, 'cause I wanna see the neden
I had to see the cat, the cheesey cheetah chedden
Rode my bike to her house, ""Hey yo, Betty lemme in
I'm packing some snack cakes, bitch, lemme in""
I can hear her coming down the stairs
She opened up the door in her motherfucking underwears
Augh, shit, fuck that, I'm turning back
But no, the door shut, and she going for the cake snack
I said, ""Relax, ho, I'm here, I'm business
You can have the candy, first you gotta wait a bit
I need a favor, come on, Betty, drop them draws.""
Augh, I knew it, Betty had balls!
Oh, no, here comes that ass
From the top of the dresser with the Yokozuna splash
I wish I never came, oh boy do I wish
She Fat Sweaty Betty, the sweaty fat bitch

Fat Sweaty Betty, tell me when you're ready
Fat Sweaty Betty, tell me when you're ready

(Fat Sweaty Betty) I know you like spaghetti
I know you like spaghetti
So tell me when you're ready, baby
(Fat Sweaty Betty) I know you like spaghetti
I know you like spaghetti
So tell me when you're ready, baby
(Fat Sweaty Betty) Tell me when you're ready
Tell me when you're ready for a cheeseburger, pizza pie, TV dinner, chicken, baby
(Fat Sweaty Betty) I gets it all, I gets it all for ya, baby
I work at Farmer Jack on the dinner floor, baby
(Fat Sweaty Betty) I bring it home, I cook it in a microwave
I feed it to ya, just let me get some stanky skins
(Fat Sweaty Betty) 'Cause I don't care, I wanna hit the cellulite
I hit the cellulite for a turkey meal delight
(Fat Sweaty Betty) 'Cause I don't care, you know I'm not afraid to cook
Take off your shoes, and let me lick your dirty foot
(Fat Sweaty Betty) I'll rub you down, I'll rub you down the right way
I hear a buzzer, apple pie's in the microwave
(Fat Sweaty Betty) I work at Farmer Jack, I work at A&P
And yes I do, my heavy baby wanna be with me
(Fat Sweaty Betty) Ya wanna be with me, ya wanna be with me
Ya want some chili cheese fries and a hoagie
(Fat Sweaty Betty) I tell her wait, wait 'till the time is right
Let me count the purple bubbles in your cellulite
(Fat Sweaty Betty) You want some Burger King, you want some Hungry Jack
You want some jelly beans, you want a Scooby snack
(Fat Sweaty Betty) You want some Domino's, you want a Milky Way
You gotta kick it to the sugar daddy Violent J

Let me hit the skins now and I'll feed you later

Headless Boogie,Riddle Box,1995,"It's Friday night, dark, scary
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery
And it's foggy, cold and smoggy
Hear a dog, a howling doggy
I'm scared, should of brought the shotgun
Would of, should of, but I ain't got one
But I watch my back, and what's that?
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback
Better run, hide, quick, fast
He's coming for my ass with a shovel
Nowhere to run nor hide but a grave pit
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit
Took a fall, deeper than six foot
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door
Into a whole new world of stiffs
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks
Club lights, sounds, bass
DJs spinnin' with maggots on they face
And what I saw next? That really took me
Uh, they did the headless boogie

Hey yo, I heard that you died
Fuck that, it's time to get live
Dead bodies let's all take a ride
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)

""Oh yeah, we dug up the finest
Bitches in the graveyard
So come on down
And if you ain't come to get your funk on
Then get the fuck out, bitch""

They all stand straight and swing to the side
No heads, but they feet still glide
Take a step back, twist and dive
I even seen Kurt Cobain gettin' live (blam!)
No heads, but they all funky
And drunk, drinking old Spunky
Don't be shy, everyone's able
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table
And kick-step, but when you do kick soft
If you're dead, your legs might fall off
The whole time I can't believe
I can't conceive, I don't wanna leave
I'm kicking it to a freak with no head
No face, but the rest is straight
She's with it, I hit it like a G
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein
Drinkin' Cisco disco dead wine
Dead stiffs comin' through the door
Heads, fingers, and limbs on the floor
I'm getting drunk, I wanna be down, what's up?
I wanna be the headless clown
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie


""Hey yo, fuck that fruity pie shit, bitch
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos

I'm going out riding the wagon

Hear it comes, the horrifying midnight wagon
Saggin', laggin', dead bodies draggin'
On a piece of string, they flop around and fling
Now shut your ass up and let the juggla sing
It's the Insane Clown Posse coming through
Looking for the hickies and the prickies and your ass too
Everybody gets a ride in the ghost car
Don't matter who you are, we going straight to hell
And it ain't far, 
Mr. Nevers,
 you seem to be the kill joy
So get your ass in fat boy!
You can sit up in the front with the Ringmaster
With the ringading-dingalinga-ping-master
And get your motherfucking wind pipe chopped off
And your funky ass body gets dropped off
In the gutter, the wheels keep rollin'
Throwin' heads out the back, nugget bowlin from the

Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
Are you down with the clown with clown love, ride the
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
Every dead fuck in the city comes to ride the
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
Nate the Mack, Jumpsteady, and Rude Boy ride the
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
Don't miss your chance

The exhaust pipe is dripping out a deadly fire
I found an old dead corpse in the trunk next to the spare tire
And it's muffling the sounds
Throw that bitch out and now the funk pounds, yo
Some say it's just a hearse, but it's much worse
It's an old dark bucket with a clown curse
Long (Long), dark (Dark), very spooky scary
I drink an old 40 bottle full of Bloody Mary, why?
'Cause I'm Violent J, sick in the nug-bone
I make strange sounds, clowns with frowns
Break it on down, break it up 'til the break of dawn
Look out your window, it's the wagon in your front lawn
Ah-boom! Abooka-boom-ba!
We do the dance of the death until you get into the car
And then I pull your tongue out slap you in the face with it
Say the joker did it, in the

Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
Ladies and gents, it's your turn, come and ride the
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
If you got a minute why don't you stop, I'm finna ride the
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
I'm a dead body so you know I love riding in the
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
Now, here's your chance (Wicked)

We don't do drive-by's in the wagon
Instead we just get out and stab your fuckin' ass
And it ain't no telling how many clowns inside
Told you seventeen, but I lied
'Cause I'm wicked and I'm wild, wicked wild
I caught a wild deer and rode it home from Belle Isle
I play the organ like an old mental case
I can freak the cello, like Chris Conley on bass
In the wagon, I throw fingers out the window
And when you roll the window down, you can smell the indo
But it ain't mine, it belongs to the stiff over there
Puffin' on a Jim Square
Heavy long, rumbling, tumbling
Step into my ride and your ass goes stumbling
Out the back with your neck in a rut
Gotta get home before the sun comes up on my

Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'
Come down, stand in line, everybody loves to ride the
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin'

And try to keep your toothless mouth shut
And don't say shit you funky ass fat bitch
I don't square dance
I drink monkey blood and kick voodoo chants (woop-woop!)
But you quick to act like you didn't know
Like you didn't know that I'm a Juggalo gigolo
Biatch wait hold up (What?)
I can't have Pa starin at my butt
Tell him to leave and keep the barn doors closed

And sport a ten-gallon cowboy hat
But after I tap it, man fuck that

And I'm finna bust a nut on that one big titty
Aww shit it's Wilbur's daughter
Fondlin pig nuts and I caught her

I know a red neck bitch named Raelita, straight stacked
Biscuit in her pocket, nipples look like flap jacks
Chicken face bitch two or three good teeth
But if I ask for sugar she's a big fuzzy peach
Now I remember when she milked the cows
Sticks of hay in the mouth, ass hangin all out
Got me itching on my balls, and I'm rubbing my wang
That damn there girl pretty did she need a twang
Hey there Missy I'm from the East
And I wouldn't mind laying in the hay for a piece
You can rub my butt like you do your Pa's
Or I can hide my meat in between your jaws
And even hum a little something sweet by Clint Black
While you stroke and caress my tender nut sac
You like it rough bitch told you I'mma bring the pain
She said ""ain't that damn movie by John Wayne""

Neden scabbed up like a horses ass
But I'mma tap it anyway and use your hair for my nut rag
Bitch what the fuck?!
Smells like a pile of dead fish in your butt
Your shirts all covered with pins and fishing tackle
And I saw more teeth on an apple
Bitch you better ask Uncle Gus
Or you and the rest of the Clampett's will get fucked up
Oh me? I talk to the spirits
Witches, demons, and they all keep screaming

Simple and Blunt,The Wraith: Shangri-La Sampler,UnKnown,"Check it out...
Another fuckin' sampler, I won't even front
I'll fuckin' tell you all about our shit, simple and blunt
And if you take the time to listen as I run this down
Maybe you might even dig our shit and understand the wicked clown
We forever underground cause up on the surface
They've always said we talentless pieces of shit and worthless
Yet,as I'm writing this now
I glance over at the wall and I don't know how
But we got two platinum albums and another four gold
And we never used MTV, we went up the back road
And built a fanbase that's so behind the clown
That they'll tear your fuckin' city in half to show they down
But see that's just it though
It ain't a fan base
It's a family drawn together like we from outer space
I mean, we call ourselves juggalos
I guess I'd explain it
We relate cause we been through the same kinds of pain
I mean, ICP don't rap about the money we get
Because half the juggalos so broke they stealing our shit
And they don't wanna hear about us pushing a Benz
When they takin' fuckin' Greyhounds just to get to gatherings
We likes it wicked
We keeps it wicked
We like cartoon serial slaughterers on our records
It's how we adjust to the pressures of life
Let our music do the killing for you, you'll be alright
And seriously, ain't you the least bit curious
What's up with this underground world? We gettin' furious
Just like this sampler you're bumping right now
This might be your calling to our carnival grounds
Tell me this, motherfucker, truly, how you livin'?
Ever get the urge maybe do a little wig-splittin'?
Ever been the last kid picked for a team?
Ever had motherfuckers come and shit on your dreams?
Do you have ideas and something to say
Only ain't nobody ever got they're ears pointed your way?
Ever been fucked with for like this and like that
And go home with crazy thoughts about cutting they neck?
You might find an escape in this band the world hates
Cause we been getting shit on, homie, we can relate
Ain't nobody here dating any Hollywood stars
Attending VIP parties at high-profile bars
But if we ain't your cup of tea then just don't fuck with me
I respect the fuck out the fact that you stuck with me
And listened on while I tried to explain ourselves
(Cause the hatchet's hustling for some record sales)
We know that ICP is fuckin' hated and doubted
But our new album's the bomb and I wouldn't lie about it
We call it the Wraith and it's the sixth joker's card
And the juggalo world's been waiting long and hard
So we saving it all, we won't play you a lick
That's why they got me on here rappin' bout this shit
But for ten years this album has been in our focus
Everything from Dog Beats on through to Dark Lotus
And it's finally dropping on November 5th
Unless the fucking record label fucks up the shit
Plan is that's the day that the best we can do
Will be put in the stores and delivered to you
Or you can download the shit free, most probably will
But the packaging and booklet it comes with is ill
So if you're lookin' for the best way of copping it free
My advice is hit a record store and pluck the CD
Get you the booklet and get you the disk
And leave all the case with the cover and shit
And then buy something cheap like a Britney Spears sticker
So they don't get suspicious when they see you at the register
One way or the other I can promise you this
Juggalo or not, our fuckin' record's the shit
And I don't give a fuck what Rolling Stone ends up givin'
Cause that's just some other idiot's opinion
If he knows what's so dope he should make it himself
And quit fucking judging every-fuckin-body else
Anyway, all we trying to say
Is that our bomb ass LP is headed your way
A little something for the underdogs out there
We extending a dap to let you know that we here
And our carnival doors is always open to yours
And for everybody else we stand up in applause
For taking a little time to listen to me spit
On this here free CD hatchet sampler shit
And for all the juggalos out there that been know the deal
We put together this here for you to feel
Come on",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-simple-and-blunt-lyrics

No master, self-taught outlaw
Five right feet to the jaw and a Southpaw
Quick kick, turn your head like it's a thick chick
Knock an eyeball out like you Slick Rick (""Morning, honey"")
Take the right side of my foot and place it
Where your teeth was, let you taste it
Rapidly before your back hits tree
You get punched, slapped, smacked and kicked with my quick Kiyyy-


Claw to the neck, chop to the skull
Haul for the rest and I'm dropping 'em all
Paw to the jaw, fall to a crawl

Next
""Ah, yes, Mr. Gatekeeper. Now we have, uh, Joseph Bruce, also known as Violent J.""
""Oh, yes. I've heard of that hideous fuck. Tell me, what makes you think I'd ever allow you into these pearly gates?""
""Wait, man. Let me explain, dog.""

First, I was born young and healthy
I told my mother one day I'd be wealthy
Can't forget my first day at school
Got stabbed in the head with a pencil, but it's cool
Get my education
A job and a family, a good reputation
And what about grade two?
Got shot in the neck, and the bullet went straight through
But I'm packing a textbook
Don't fuck with me 'cause I'm going to grade 3
Thank God it's lunch in a minute
Bit into my hot dog with a razor blade in it
And it cut my tongue off
But I know how to multiply, so what's up, boss
Finally had to step out
I dropped out of school when they ripped my neck out
Who knows where the road led?
Seen a man with a briefcase, but no head
So I'm likes fuck that
Show me a quarter and an ounce of crack
And I'm straighter than a fucking light post
I sold a lot of crack, but I bought the most

Now I'm a basehead down on my luck
Roaming the streets and got hit by a Mack truck
And thrown about a block
But I'm thinking nothing, but gimme a rock
Holding my sign ""I'll work for crack""
With my old-ass 
E.T.
 shirt on my back
And I'm sleeping in the gutter
Right next to Champtown's mother
I'm eating dead rats in the street
I keep on checking for my own heartbeat
Now I'm weighing at a buck-o-five
Twitchy little neck and I'm barely alive
Got my first taste of life in hell
I ate a dead man, shh, but don't tell
Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change?
I'll cut your face off and eat your brains
You know all about me
You act like you ain't seen 
Penitentiary

""We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of 47 counts of first degree murder.""
""Hm. Very well. Mr. Bruce, do you have any last words before your sentence?""
""Yeah, your mother""
""Huh, fine. Life in prison, motherfucker!""

Spitting and cussing and you know I'm pissed
With these iron bracelets on my fucking wrists
And I'm heading for the slammer
Serial killer, all on the camera
First day, they broke my back
Next day, they broke my neck
Third day, they broke my leg
Fourth day, they broke my head
Swallowing, kept on trucking
But there'll be no fucking
That's strictly for the soft
Ain't seen a freak in a week and my nuts fell off
So, I'm finna escape
How much shit can one klepto take?
""Stop, fool. Stop or I'll fire""
Shot me off and I fell in the razor wire
I'm all tangled up
Cut-cut-cut, slit, slit, cut-cut
You don't love me, I really don't care
Tie my ass up in the electric chair
Got no family, I got no friends
So, I pray to God that my life ends

""Do you have any last words, my son?""
Yes, Father, I do
So what!?

They thought that they had killed me
They took me to the morgue
I'm just a little stiff that's all (that's all)
Like a board
I lay there in my coffin
Just chill, and wait, and chill (and chill)
But then I jump out, knife swinging all about and
Motherfucking-mother-mother-mother-motherfucking kill

I used to wonder what life's about
'Til it chewed me up and spit me out
Your ghetto created a psycho nut
Not just psycho, psycho nut
Now, I'm living in the walls of your house
And I'll die in there, and lay, and rot like a dead mouse
I'm packing a sickle
I'm on your roof and I'm playing the fiddle
You want me in a straight jacket?
'Cause when I see a throat, I'ma hack it
Where I'm at? What's my name?
Somehow, somewhere, I got hit by a train
And it ripped my legs off
Huh, nothing but a minor cough
You can't get me, I swing from a tree
Shouting, and cussing, and shooting at me
Everybody's adding their two cents
My branch broke and I fell on a picket fence
I'm stuck and they're coming to get me
Ripped myself off and I took my lungs with me
I'm stuffing them back in
Fuck, they won't go back in
Now, my life's getting dense
'Cause my heart's still beating on a wooden fence
They shoot me up and down
Wicked, wicked, wicked, clown
Wicked, wicked, wicked, clown
You wanna know about a wicked clown?

You want to know? (Wicked clown is in the house)
You want to know? (Wicked clown is in the house)
You want to know all about a wicked clown? (Wicked clown is in the house)
A wicked clown (Wicked clown is in the house)
A wicked clown (Wicked clown is in the house)
You want to know about a wicked clown? (Wicked clown is in the house)

You Should Know,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"You should know
You should know
You should know

I'm reaching out to tell you
That I've always loved you
But my kind of love is bent
I put you through hell everyday
It's the best I could do
I never had a penny to spend on you
I come from the bottom at the bottom of the well
A place called shit just south of hell
It was there I learned how to treat a girlfriend
All my homies come first until the world end
In love and fucking I do different commodities
I love you but will fuck any hottie
And feel no fondness thing or guilty about it
Where I come from that shit is applauded
I fuck a chicken head, sometimes two
And come home and cuddle with you
Cause you're the one I choose to stay with
And your heart is something I play with

You should know
I just wanted yo come clean before I take your hand
You should know
You should know
That I'm sorry

I love you but I love to hurt you
I hate to see you cry
It's just the way that I work you
I need to put you in check, you know the deal
I need to test you to see if your love is real
I never laid a hand on you, I won't ever
My psychological torture is much better
At the end of the day I try to make it all up to you
Treat you like a queen, like the first week I knew you
Repeat this cycle every 2 days
As time goes by I think of new ways
And I'm here to tell you, your best friends a ho
We were all drunk and I fucked her like a year ago
She'll never tell you cause she came on to me
We both got it out of our system
It had to be, but still when the smoke clears I'm all yours
You're my women the rest of these ho's are whores


I truly loved you the best way that I could
I cheated and lied many times with that understood
I never claimed I would be your mister right
When we first met I was mister tonight
That's who I am sorry that I couldn't provide
We lived off your paychecks
And your ride so if you wanna leave me
I'll understand, I just wanted to come clean

Don't make me chop your head in half and smack the side with the cheek
Because I haven't had my 
melorol
 in almost a week
Your fuckin mama brought me here to entertain ya ass
So no matter what I do I expect you to laugh
Now when I do a trick and even if it isn't funny
Give me props unless you want your little necks bloody
I could probably do a cartwheel or something if you move the couch
But that ain't what I'm fuckin about
I could sew your mouth shut and pump air in through ya nose
And fuckin pop ya head but we'd get blood on our clothes
Look I'm a wicked clown I ain't no fuckin superhero
Ain't that big and scary though I fly like little Rey Mysterio
I'm quick to beat down all you little bitches right in front of you mom
And if the bitch gets heated tell her bring it on
(Chorus)
O Shit It's your birthday (Oh no it isn't)
It's somebody's birthday (Oh no it isn't)
O shit it's your birthday (Oh no it isn't)
It's your birthday
(Anybody Killa)
Sit the fuck down or it's everybody's birthday

I'll run around the White House lawn naked and screamin and bustin shots at him
I'll scratch my back with a chainsaw oh yeah got it
I'll walk through Compton alone and sport wranglers and a cowboy hat
I'll head-butt a fuckin unicorn come here bitch (No! *Thunk* Damn!)
I'll stand on a stump and let you trim my toenails with a axe
I'll sucker punch a gorilla and then try to run with a banana hangin out my ass

I'll finger fuck a toilet and French kiss a light socket

It's three o'clock in the morning and you're sleeping
Wicked clowns in the moonlight, creeping
Slide through your window under your bed
Crawl in through your ear, I'm in your head
Bumping into bones 'cause I need light
Tip-toeing down through your windpipe
Climbing down your spine was the fun part
Looky looky and I think I see your fucking heart
Uh huh so I'm stabbing like it ain't nothing
Wicked clown cut his way out your belly button
I'm like a vulture waiting in a dark place
Swooping down and I'm picking at your dead face
I'm sick, but you don't know the whole deal
No one ever loved me and they never will
Bitch, I take you out on a blind date
But then they find you dead under a wooden crate
Wrapped in a bag deep in the woods
'Cause my mother always said I was no good
Locked me in a closet, fed me dog shit
Well, I'm out now, so, motherfucker, watch it
The insanity's grip will never let go
Here's your chance to a glimpse of a ghetto freak show

Standing at your porch, chewing on a dead mouse
I'm looking like a fly so you swat me
Keep chasing me even though you got me
So what you wanna do to a ghetto thug
First you starve me and feed me them fuckin' drugs
Turn me into a wicked, wicked cat
(Wicked cat, wicked clown, wicked cat, wicked clown)
I'm coming to your house, so get ya get ya gat
Gotta have a fucking throat, hatchet once, hatchet twice
Gotta have the governor, the richer fucker, pay the price
Driving with your woman, that's sweet
Never even know I'm in the back seat
Chat chit-chat about the weather
But then I slam they fucking heads together
Is it jealousy, they never loved me
So now I'm ripping out your guts, and it's ugly
I'm trapped, don't wanna be a rich man
Not a poor man, I need my own land
Because the rich man be stressing all the dumb stuff
They cut their fucking wrists if the grass ain't green enough
Right there in your face, you can't tag it
Just found out your son is a faggot
A dick-sucking, butt-fucking homo, man
If ya stressing then you better talk to mojo man

""The time has come for the blood to run in the streets paved with gold. We have lived in the zoo of the ghetto for so long, and like animals, we'd kill each other with the hatement for others. We must move into the suburbs and punish the rich for their ignorance and the horror of death that is a part of our life in our neighborhood, and give them a taste of the same, and when we kill the government's children, and the streets smell of death, maybe then we'll see our situation in a new light and put an end to the chaos in the ghetto, and put an end to the killings.""",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-ghetto-freak-show-lyrics
The Bone,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, your honor
We find the defendant guilty on all counts

The bailiff came at me with a pair of cuffs in his hand
He was taking me to jail, but that wasn't my plan (Huh?)
I broke the arm off my chair, stabbed him hard as I can
He got the bone... (Auuugh!) HE GOT THE BONE!
I jumped over the others and kicked the door down with my feet
Ran down the steps and headed right into the street
Waved down a car, the driver stopped and looked at me
He got the bone... (Get out, bitch!) HE GOT THE BONE!
I hit the gas and I'm swerving in and out of my lane
Coppers on my tail, I'm driving like I'm insane
Old man up in the street, crossing slowly with his cane
He got the bone... HE GOT THE BONE!
Smashed into a post, I jumped outta my car
Hopped over a wall, running through someone's yard
Ran into a house, the father tried to be hard
He got the bone... (Bone muthafucka!) HE GOT THE BONE!

Why do they fuck with me when I'm having fun? (They get the bone!)
Why do they fuck with me when I'm on the run? (They get the bone!)
Why do they fuck with me cause I ain't the one? (They get the bone!)
Bone, bone, bone, bone

I busted out through the front doors and I booked down the block
The neighbors joined the chase, someone's shooting a Glock
The mailman tried to stop me, but I picked up a rock
He got the bone... (Whoa, hold on!) HE GOT THE BONE!
Police screech around the corners with they red and blue lights
I threw some fucking nerdy off his ten speed bike
But the kid was an athlete and he wanted to fight
He got the bone... (Oh, fuck you!) HE GOT THE BONE!
I ran into a restaurant, bust into the kitchen
Workers on my ass and the cooks, they was bitchin'
A hero blocked the door, I grabbed a knife, did I mention?
He got the bone... HE GOT THE BONE!
Out into the alley, took the stairs up to the roof
Chopper busting shots at me and I ain't bulletproof
I threw a rock up at the gunman and blew out his tooth
He got the bone... (Aaaug-*splat*) HE GOT THE BONE!

Why do they fuck with me when I'm having fun? (They get the bone!)
Why do they fuck with me when I'm on the run? (They get the bone!)
Why do they fuck with me cause I ain't the one?
They get the b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bone!

Cut through the parking lot, I ran up into the mall
Pigs, people, cars, cooks, choppers, and all
Throwin' shoppers off the escalator, watching 'em fall
They got the bone... THEY GOT THE BONE!
Absolute pandemonium all over the place
Everybody drop they shopping bags and join in the chase
When a cop tried to tackle me, got kicked in the face
He got the bone... (Let me go!) HE GOT THE BONE!
Stole his fucking golf cart and bust through the glass
Sideswiped a mannequin and cut across the grass
Some fucking kid ordered me to stop, I plowed his ass
He got the bone... () HE GOT THE BONE!
Police shot the tires out, my ride is a joke
I’m surrounded by an army, quickly losing all hope
I threw my ninja poof ball, disappeared into the smoke
They got the bone... (Where'd he go?! What happened?!) THEY GOT THE BONE!

Why do they fuck with me when I'm having fun? (They get the bone!)
Why do they fuck with me when I'm on the run? (They get the bone!)
Why do they fuck with me cause I ain't the one?
They get the bone...

Hello, mister! I hope you weren't sleeping! Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?

Oh, cookies, huh? That sounds really good right about now...What kind do you got?

What do you mean, sweetie? Do you have any Samoas? Or just them thin mints?

Maybe I should go...you sound really weird and I'm scared!

The Blasta,The Mighty Death Pop!,2012,"I was maybe 13
They was hurtful and mean
Specially this one fucker, Kurt Greene
Fucked with me in the hallways
Always
""
Abuse
 the loser!""
They would all say
I walked in the lunchroom
I'm getting punched soon
If Kurt Greene sees me, here comes doom
This time he spit on the back of my head
My face turned red as the laughter spread
Daddy has a gun in his closet
Way up in a black box
It's too bad though, because he locks it
Along with all of his crack rocks
(Fuck it)
Ice pick in my hand up early in the AM
Kurt's at the bus stop snuck up one plus
Stuck him in the temple, simple disaster
That was the debut of the bully blasta
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
'Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
Keep fucking with the blasta
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Keep fucking with the blasta
I was 22 and the army's calling
I'm lifeless out here so I'm all in
And my drill sergeant is barking orders
And I'm sharing my living quarters
With a big-time prick from Oklahoma
I can't stand him or his aroma
Big thick neck jock in his drawers he flexed
They all kiss his ass, they don't wanna be next
I never thought the blasta would be back
But he has to we need that
He pissed in my bed, I jumped in
Laid wet in the laughter, blood pumping
He snores like a bear but tonight was nice
We all slept like babies with his windpipe sliced
I did it, with a straight blade razor
And my bully blasta behavior
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
'Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
Keep fucking with the blasta
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Keep fucking with the blasta
Years pass
I got a family now, I put it all behind me
My son gets picked on now, and it reminds me
Of murder, the bully soon came up missing
I spoke to my son I had an intuition
""Did you have anything to do with this?""
He gave me no answer just a hug and a kiss
And said ""Don't worry dad everything will be fine
Just you pay it no mind, it's all over""
And at work my boss is a bastard
He comes to the office halfway plastered
Bitchin abusing all the women and testing
But we accept it because of the recession
He groped my wife at the office party
I stood up for her he swore he'd fire me
I threw him off the balcony 13th floor
I guess I'm a bully blasta forevermore
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
'Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me
Till he does what he has to
You fucked with the blasta (Explosions)
Keep fucking with the blasta
You fucked with the blasta
You don't know me

With this broomstick, not my penis
I do a drive by on a pogo stick
As I'm getting my dick sucked, no bullshit
I clown motherfuckers, pie to the face
Probation officers, I lie to they face
I sell fake dope, and you still buy it
I even tell you it's fake

Get clowned

Until they finally splatter

When I pulls out my axe hoes scatter
Cause in my head I hear the drums of war
Next thing you know, I comes to your door
And I kicks it in, the shit begin
Take a knife to the chicken and I sticks it in
Pluck the feathers, cut your tethers
Everybody run free, dumping in a Humvee
Mass pandemonium all around
Innocent victim dying on the ground
Hold him close as his heart slow down
And then whisper in his ear hole, ""YOU GOT CLOWNED!""


I paint my face like my brothers and sisters
We're misunderstood by these others, they diss us
Truth is these haters want to love us and kiss us
Cause they're secretly hound dogs
, we shove 'em when they piss us off

We gotta clown these hoes
Stick our big clown shoes all up their assholes
Cause when our wagons come to town
We only pick up the found, bitch
So get clowned",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-get-clowned-lyrics
Every Halloween,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 3",2001,"I paint my face every year all day
The 31st ain't nothin to me, another holiday
All of a sudden face paintin's in style
And I've been doin ever since Gilligan's Island was on
But try to live all year though
Try pickin up a chick when your painted up like a wierdo
Im 68 years old I still trick or treat
You think I care? shit I'm trying to find somethin to eat
And tell your old ladies to keep your pennys
If it ain't above a quarter, don't even bother
Im sick of these little kids to I know you did it
Put a brick in your bag and hit me in the head with it
And then they take my candy and diss
""look what I got from the fat guy painted like kiss!""
All year I'm a psycho uh huh I see
But every halloween, you wanna be me!

Every halloween
They want to be meee

Every halloween
They want to be meee
A gorila, a buffer fish and a bag lady
All made love and had a little baby
And supposedly I'm the one
But at this point thats only purely speculation
On halloween people smile at me
The rest of the year, they dial the police
They kick me off there lawn and shoot me off there cars
But on halloween there giving me candy bars
Trick or treat it's 5:30 in the morning
Im still out..im standing on your lawn
And I'm lookin through your window
*tap tap* I see a gummy bear on the table, ya gonna eat that?
My paint don't come off, and if it did
You think I'm scary now, shiiit
I look like frankenstein thats been slaped with ugly
Yet children hug me on halloween
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee
3 6 4 people hate my guts
On halloween though, they wanna ride my nuts
They dress up as monsters, freaks, and clowns
And pass jelly bears, goobers, and suckers around
They next day when I try to trick or treat
It's get off the porch or i'll call the cops you freak
I don't understand you people but that's ok
I'll see you all next time you try to be Violent J
Theyyyyyyyyy
Every halloween
They want to be meee

Every halloween
They want to be meee

Still Stabbin’,Bizaar,2000,"Hey, hey
Uh...I still have a problem
If it's ok with...them
You know
There, them
The Dark Carnival in general
It's the whole stabbin thing again, it's..
You see I...uh

I stab people like everyday folks
Skinny people any people I chop off their throats
My stabbin's are ninja like very quickly, hey
By the time you feel it I'm like 3 blocks away
I stabbed the newspaper guy and took his little truck
Now I stab people and drive away I'm like puttputtputtputt
I do a show and stab people at the same time, what of that
I stab bear cages security guards in the back of the neck
I love Waffle House, I stab people there
Their so shitty and dumpy they don't even care
I love stabbin' people, Def Leppard, remember them?
Well I cut their fuckin' drummer's arm off, you can ask him
Leo Owen the president of Island
I'm at a business meeting with him looking at him, smiling
I jumped up and stabbed him, but he kicked my ass
17th floor they through me out through the glass

Help Me(Fuck you)
Fuckin help me(Fuck you)
I need you to help me(Fuck you)
Somebody come and help me(Fuck you)

Jehovah's Witnesses I swear man I love 'em
They're standing on the porch knockin, I'm waiting above 'em
Puncture wound victims right to my door
Come back mothafucka, ill stab you some more
One time I was a wrestler, I wrestled the best
I got kicked out though, I had a knife in my spandex
I stabbed Tony Schiavone, the commentator guy
Before the match I went to shake his hand but I stabbed him in the eye
I stabbed Norman Smiley in the middle of a match
He was like ""What are you doing?"" I said fuckin relax
I stabbed him again and again, I jumped out and ran
Everybody chased me, catch me if you can
I tried to stab my own brother, bad news for my health
He twisted my arm back, I ended up stabbing myself
I stab cabby drivers right through the thick glass
Ginsu built to last, can you help me

Slice em up, Slice em down
Side to side and all around
They don't help, they don't care
Ginsu swingin everywhere
Slice em up, Slice em down
Side to side and all around
They don't help, the don't care
Ginsu swingin everywhere

I saved up my money and went and saw the Lilith Fair
Started stabbing lesbians, there was millions of them there (lesbos)
I took off my thong and I jumped in the pit
But there wasn't any pit, it was only me and that was it
But so what, I was throwin myself all over the floor
Sarah McLachlan was on stage, I said you fuckin whore
One time I met Slipknot, I stabbed their ass
Stabbed them all in the face, that's why they wear masks
My little newspaper truck runs on a tank of blood
I drive with my lights off all through the neighborhood
But its so hard to sneak because of the muffler
I hate that fucker
I did a song with Three Six Mafia, them guys are the shit
We went to the studio and I started rockin it
After the session they all left up out of there
But I stayed behind and stabbed the engineer

Can you help me(Fuck you)
You gotta help me(Fuck you)
I need you to help me(Fuck you)
Mutha-fuckin help me(Fuck you)
Naw man, fuck you(Fuckyou)
Fuck all of you(Fuck you)
You better fuckin help me(Fuck you)
Help me, help me

Slice em up, Slice em down
Side to side and all around

Do you live your life with faith, or do you live it without faith?
This is the question brought forth by him, the third joker’s card of the mighty second deck
His name? His name is a reflection of the answer itself. He is simply known as:

The Marvelous Missing Link!

What comes around, goes around
The Marvelous Missing Link has been found
Your life’s full circle is now completed
Whatever you’ve dished out then, you eat it
Now, let’s hope you like it
The way you treated your ma wasn’t right, kid
And now that you overdosed on dope and died
The link is tied
You reap everything you sow, let it sink in
Now that you’re choked up, dead, and stinking
It’s time for judgement, the Missing Link is now tied in
Off to Hell you go ridin’
Or Shangri-La, for the lucky few
Who live life tried and true
The link in the chain is for you to gain
All that you got coming to ya, bang!

What’s the matter? You’re scared to die?
Well, I wonder why!
Is it because you knew when your life was ending
You’d feel your soul descending?
Are you afraid to be treated how you treated others?
Ain’t no hiding under the covers!
Ain’t no taking it back, it’s too late for that
The link’s tied. Face it, Jack
We got some nonbelievers out here
Well, we’ll see when you face the mirror
And everything becomes crystal clear
And all that laughter’s replaced with fear
The Marvelous Missing Link is your death
Then when your life’s ending, he’s all that’s left
Once you find your link, what’s it gonna be?
I can’t wait to see!

Crows fly as the wind blow

The Link found in the sand
A final judgement for mortal man
Crows fly across the land
Tahgah, choompah, higgedy zee
The Link sets the circle free
Up or down, what’s it gonna be?

A Face 4 Fighting,Flip the Rat,2019,"I don’t walk around picking fights
But it’s true, I love to engage if the shit ignites
I’ll be the first one to admit: the light’s boring
A little warrin’ definitely excites it
Growing up, they kept showing up, the feisty
Trouble kept finding me, reminding me I liked it
I got geeked when somebody said fuck me
And I was born with the face for this, so I’m lucky
Nobody likes it, they wanna deck it
Something about it invites it every second
It pisses people off, enrages
To the point we end up in the joint, in cages
It’s cool to let some slide, but have some pride
Or you’re just a little bitch, open up wide
So if you shove me, I’ma sock you
And socking me is how you get shot, boom

Poke me with a toothpick, I stab you with a pencil, dumb dick
Stab me with a pencil, I stab you with a drumstick
Stab me with a drumstick, and to hell we gonna grow
I’ma stab that ass with a telephone pole
And I’m hitting up Hoodoo, a voodoo guru
People wheeled in a nut, you getting a boo boo
Stretched out, dead of night, your mama going boo hoo
Putrid, skinny, and white, Grim Reaper doo doo
Beat me with a ruler, I’ll beat you a cue stick
Beat me with one, I’m beating with two, fuck you
Beat me with two, I’ll beat you with a tree trunk (Whack)
ICP, punk (Fight back!)

We good. I don’t start beef
I only pick it out of my teeth
I don’t fuck with soldiers, I want the chief
Fuck the centipede legs, I want the head of the bee
Hit me with a BB gun, I’ll 22 ya
22 me, silly, my 9-milli pluggin’ through ya
9-milli me, I’ll blow ya’ with that 44
Stick me with them, a 357 is shreadin’ all that’s in your head

If you a bitch, it won’t leave your ass alone
And you feel it in your bones
And you’re wandering through the bitch-ass  (Fight back!)
Another life is what you need
A bitch’s blood is what you be
You headed nowhere with yourself in the lead (Fight back!)
Nothing good is what you do
Time is ugly for you, new
Opportunities to brew because of you (Fight back!)
You are runnin’ out of air
You’re just fuckin’ sitting there
You don’t even fucking care, get out of there (Fight back!)
Hate every bit of your life
Wanna cut it with a knife
To wanna trigger suck on a rifle (Fight back!)
You’re better than a pig
Weak and skinny, like a twig
The opposite of the shit, nobody digs you (Fight back!)
Hated your job from the start
Sluts always breakin’ your heart
All day long of every day, it’s the worst part (Fight back!)
The bitch in the mirror
A faggot, not ‘cause you’re queer
Everywhere you go sucks, could you help me? (Fight back!)

[Verse 1: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
I like to suffocate people and bite their necks
They got me in a place that ain't like the rest
And all you gotta do is try to go for the neck
And it's sedatives, sedatives, like that
Slow down, color smear all around
Weird sounds, you in the mind of a clown
And a wicked one somehow spinnin' around
Wheel me down the hallway, arms strapped down
With sedatives 
Hangin' all out the neck from the IV
Sedatives for the lively
Study me, ask me, no answer
I'm cuttin' your neck first chance, sir
White walls, white floor, small rooms
After sedatives, they become ballrooms
Crows fly by my window slow
Headed that way but lookin' at me though
[Chorus: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Sedatives, 
sedatives
(Lookin' at me) Sedatives,

(Lookin' at me) Sedatives,

Sedatives,

[Verse 2: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope

I'm an accident, human malfunction at best
And I'm lookin' at a scalpel diggin' into your chest
If I could only move, but them sedatives
You know they saving your life, them sedatives
Some of these other patients are strong as hell
Suffocating one creep took me long as hell
But I took his sedatives, well I thought they were sedatives
But they were only medatives
I fake pain, call 'em over and play dead
And yank a fistful of hair out the nurse lady's head
High on sedatives again, put me in a tiny place
Chin strap muzzle over my face
I threw a guy off the roof first day they admitted me
I was sedated, and that's when it hit me
The only time I'm at peace is when I ain't even there
God tell me, why the fuck am I here?

I want a lobotomy, no shock therapy
Come clean me nurse, take care of me
I suffocated the last two they sent in alone
They had to stick me in the chest with a shot of methadone
Recreation time, wheel me to the courtyard
Four guards in white and they might be important
And the sky is blue and I can watch trees grow
Watch leaves flow, enjoy the sedative show
Well I even have my very own room these days
White straight jacket, padded walls and PJ's
But there's so many ways and every stunt I pull
I even slammed my own mouth down on the toilet bowl
For attention? maybe, not to mention a sedative
Heard one guy say ""why even let it live?""
There's probably no sedatives in Hell
And that's the only reason I'm alive still!
The Witch is everywhere and I can see that, y'all
Stabbed one nurse in the neck with a straw
A plastic straw, yeah it's flimsy and weak
But if you cork it with your thumb and hold it right... FREEEEK!

Clown Show,Hell’s Cellar,2018,"Come one and come all, everybody know me
I'm the class clown all around, and every day the ho me
It was hilariously funny when they beat me up in the gym
I was honored and privileged they’d let me be with them
And it's funny as hell when they diss on what I wear
And they smack my head up when I try to fix up my hair
I'm so funny, I amuse even the teachers
Others beat me in the yard, and they just laugh from the bleachers

It ain’t so funny when the shows over (and it ain't so funny)
The storm blows over (and it ain't so funny)
And I chose no more (and it ain't so funny)

I got a standing ovation when I fell on my face in the class
Somebody shoe-laced my ass
They spit on my seat. They spit in my food
They spit on my face. This audience here is rude
Well, I stepped up to Sarah. I thought I'd say hi
She laughs at my show so much, figured I'd try
I asked her would she like to join me for piece of pizza pie
But she'd rather die, die, die
I visioned a bazooka barrel aimed at her face
And all that remains are pigtails floating in place
But that's only a vision and this is reality
I’ve got all of these people laughing at me, how stale of me
Smile! I’m smiling now. Mean faces and looks
Somebody kicked me in the ass, and I dropped all my books
Oh God, I'm so funny, and it’s all accidental again
I just want my clown freak show to end

It ain't so funny when the shows over (and it ain't so funny)
The storm blows over (and it ain't so funny)
And I chose no more (and it ain’t so funny)

I hop out of bed, woke up early this morning
'Cause this day here marked this clown's final performance
I ran off to school in my new clown costume clothes
I even painted my face for you hoes. Here it goes
I walk down the hall, and they all laughin' immensely
They know it's me, automatically. They all against me
But off in my bag, between two books and a folder
Is a .357 Magnum, fully loaded, with a holster
Some teachers tell me to stop, but I walk right on past
I'm headed to my performance for the first hour class
Just in time. There's the bell. I take to the stage
Jump up on the teacher's desk, laughing with rage
Come one and come all! Let me show you a trick!
It's amazing! I'll reach in this bag here, right quick!
This a .357, fully loaded and all
Now look at the back of my head on the wall

It ain't so funny when the shows over (and it ain't so funny)
The storm blows over (and it ain't so funny)
And I chose no more (and it ain't so funny)
It ain't so funny when the shows over (and it ain't so funny)
The storm blows over (and it ain't so funny)
And I chose no more (and it ain't so funny)

But Clyde walked in his jaw dropped down
Act like he never seen the butt cheeks of a clown
I had the secretary on the top of the desk
Ass hole naked, I was in the cigar chest
Smoking up Cuban blunts with the janitor
I fucked all them hoes at job ask my manager
Business women in executive halls
Let your head down an tongue slap my balls
Some of them bitches are a little bit old
Dusty ass neden with a loopy foam
Like this one chick I fucked in The dark
I had the bitch moaning like a happy ass retard
We finished turn on the lights sweat was pourin

But my boys are out back break-in into your cars

Because you're strong you'll laugh again slapping your knee (hahaha)
No matter what else shit falls in our way
I can promise they'll be a day we'll all be ok


A car accident
A house burned down
Peep the news
A quick look around
Everybody takes turns getting the bone
When tragedy slaps ya
You ain't alone
We all go through it some more than others
Some don't survive we miss our brothers and sisters
In the wind she whispers
Mrs. Mother's Nature seem like she hates ya
This life ain't easy who said it was
Shit hits the fucking fan just because
The flu don't get ya
And then it does
Shit suddenly (?) ya
Hits the fuzz
Keep living your life

Love, love (I'm free!)

I was released just that morning
I'm standing there thinking ""Freedom's boring""
Leaning against a telephone pole
That's when I seen her and lost control
She was in her car waiting at the light
She looked right at me and I thought that I might
Be in love. But then the shit turned green
She quickly took off! I ran in between
The cars behind her, screaming for help
Opened a car door and yanked the seatbelt
Off some fat kid and tossed his ass
Jumped in his pickup and mashed the gas
Caught up to my love, pulled along the side
She was looking kinda terrified
But I rammed her car, I gave her a nudge
I screamed, ""PULL OVER! I THINK I'M IN LOVE!""

I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)

I was bagging groceries, out on parole
Ten hour shifts and they taking their toll
I glanced up for a look at the time
And there she was, two lanes from mine
My stomach fell like a roller coaster
I dropped my shit and started walking closer
Introduced myself, and gave her a hug
Went in for the kiss, but I got no love
She yanked away like she was offended
But I know true love and she's pretending
She ran outside to the parking lot
But I was on that ass, she was fucking hot
I spun her around and I licked her face
She screamed, hit me with a can of mace
Two guy outta nowhere knocked me out
As if I don't know what love's about


So I'm running down the street and there's this fucking weirdo and I can tell he's following me!
He says he's in love with me, and I don't even know the guy! He...scares the shit out of me, I mean...
I don't even know him, so...
He pushes me off my bike and he just gets on top and starts holding me down and starts talking about love!
Love! (Getcha, getcha)

Dang! Two weeks left...
Insane Clown Posse
Yeah...
When we get out
Wicked clown!

When I get out, I'm goin' home to Southwest
Going straight to my freaks and getting undressed
And I'ma hit it like an insane chicken hawk
Hoochie won't be able to walk, uh!

When I get out, I'll run around town naked
Cause my freedom feels good, I can't fake it!
I'll let my nuts flop to the hip-hop
I wanna chop chop, punk cop, flip flop

When I get out, I'm goin' to my mother's house
She gonna cook a steak and serve it with brussels sprouts
But I don't care, she can cook a cinder block
And I'ma chew it on up to the last rock!

When I get out, I'm putting on my new shoes
But I don't see anybody sporting Kangaroos
And them ""Where's the Beef"" Shirts are history
But so what, I'mma sport mine like a G!

Wicked Clown! Yeah, check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out y'all!
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out!

When I get out, I'm goin' to the festival
Cussing rude and scratching my testicles
Like we did before we got locked down
I'm comin' back around, the wicked clown!

When I get out, I'ma throw a party
And guess who shows up? Nobody!
I just sit alone and play Solitaire
I don't care, at least I won't be here!

When I get out, I'm comin' back to Delray
So I can breathe the smog, but that's okay
Cause I'd much rather whiff that shit
Than my cellmate Rico's funky armpits!

When I get out, I'm headed straight to the sto'
For a big long cold thing of Faygo
And I'ma drink it down to the very end
After that, I'll eat the bottle that it came in!

Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out y'all!
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out!

""Yeah, lemme call this broad up
And tell her I'm getting out
This my baby, ya know what I'm saying?"" (""Hello"")
""Wussup, baby. Man, it's me."" (""Hello"")
""Wait a minute..."" (""J?"")
""Who the hell is this?!""
(""Hold on a man, I'll go get Rachel"")
""Who the hell is this?!""

When I get out, I'm shootin' someone in the head!
Somebody been sleeping in my bed
I never thought my sweetheart would sell me out
Now I gotta walk up and blow her mouth out!
Wicked clown, wicked, wicked clown
(Come again?)

When I get out, I'm back to the good life
So don't sweat me, Officer Barney Fife!
In the pen I seen your cop friend Budzyn
Seemed Daddy liked to use his butt some!

When I get out, it's all about the underground
I'll crawl back into the pipes and never be found
So when you're brush your teeth, ya better think
Ya might see my eyeball lookin' at ya through the sink!

Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out y'all!
Wicked Clown! Check it out y'all!
Wicked Clown! We getting out!

I'm getting out, I'm getting out!

Hm. You’re still here
That must mean you wanna play…
You’re a stupid ass!

Hello, everyone *laughs* jeez
I’m your host, Bink Chipperwink, here once again
Let’s get ready to play:
“You’re a Stupid Ass!”
Okay, stupid ass. The rules are simple:
You simply solve our mathematical clues to figure out your prize
And that prize is: a phone number! (Ooh)
When you call the number, you can hear the name of the new album and fourth Joker’s Card (Fresh!)
Ready, stupid ass? Here’s your clue
The area code is 1-313
Now, for the rest:
The first digit is...

I’m chillin’ butt naked with two bitches
One of ‘em’s the girl from Letters to Cleo
The other one’s Janet Jackson
Now, how many titties all together is there for me to suck on?
The number is...
The next digit is…

Jimmy has two balls and one wang
So does Tommy
They both got two balls and one dick each
Now, if Jimmy gave Tommy one of his balls
How many balls would Tommy have, in his nut sack
The number is…
The next digit is…

There’s ten rednecks ridin’ in the back of an old pickup truck drivin’ down a dirt road
Now, the truck his a bump, and I’d be God blessed if two of them chickens didn’t fall out the back of the truck and bust their fuckin’ heads
Now how many red necks still made it to Grammy Ma’s for supper?
The number is..
The next digit is…

Let’s say, one mornin’, while having crumpets and tea
You decided to stick your finger in your bum
Now, last night, you ‘ad your finger in your mate’s bum
In the last twenty-four hours, how many bums have you ‘ad your finger in?
(Maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner)
The number is..
The next digit is…

You got ten bottles of Faygo
Your boy Lewie drank one
And your mama drank another one
And another one was artic sun flavor (Ew)
So you threw it away ‘cause it tastes like shit!
Now how many bottles of Faygo you got left?
The number is..
The next digit is…

It’s four bitches at your boy’s house
One of ‘ems straight as fuck
And another one’s got big fat fuckin’ titties
Now, another one’s kinda ugly
But you heard that she can fuck like a wild banshee
And the last one looks like a boy
And probably gots nuts hangin’ under her neden
Now, how many bitches did you try to fuck that night?
The number is..
The last digit is…

There’s ten clowns in a mosh pit
After the show, the makeup wore off everybody’s face
And then you realize that three of ‘em
Were really punk-ass bigot rich boys
Just fakin’ the funk
How many real juggalos were left
To team up and beat their asses
The number is..
And there you have it
Good luck, contestants

Well, okay. *laughs*
You shouldn’t have too much trouble figuring these out
But if you do, and you can’t seem to figure out the phone number
Well, then it looks like:
“You’re a stupid ass!”

Dearest almighty creator...
(Violent J)
I've lived one hell of a life, if your to take it tonight
I've lived the life of a king, but so much to darken the light
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Lookin 360 degrees, 2 hundred thousand diseased
How can I lay back and chill, so many down on there knees
(Violent J)
But then again who am I, I'm just some typical guy
I ain't no fuckin hero, I just been wonderin why....
(Chorus)
I seen some children crossing the bridge
What kind of life did they get to live?
What kind of choice do they get to make?
What if it was a child's mistake?
(Violent J)
I'll never question the book, but let's say I lived by the book
I never ate meat on Tuesdays, how much bigger would my wings look?
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I try to pray everyday, but sometimes get lost on the way
I seen the holiest spirit, so much to mislead the way
(Violent J)
I gave the visions I got, I been told I'm gonna rot
Inside the devil's intestines, I'm still here holdin my spot

Come on up and open up your door
What if it's a purgatory door (repeat)

Behind the Paint,Bizaar,2000,"(Today we'll be talking about the recording artists The Insane Clown Posse)
(They look too spooky) Dickface (It kinda reminds me of gang related)
(Before the anti-christ who is comming)

Remember me bitch, 8th grade
Oak Park, skinny ass welfare aid
Utsler and Bruce brothers, we was the shit
Dungeons & Dragons, and Bruce Lee flicks
Quit school, nobody missed us
Nobody hugged and kissed us, only dissed us
And now look at these beautiful model type high class women
Taking my dick in 'em
You don't remember my kind in class
The wigged-out freak staring at your ass
Never had the courage to even say hi
Only smell your perfume vapors when you walk by
I'm the scrub that never crossed your mind
Now your flashing your titties at me waiting in line
And that's fine while you're working your charm
Look beneath the paint bitch, its the scrubs who won

*People murmuring*

You used to say, ""Ah ha, look at him!""
The same pair of pants and that shirt again
An outcast, I knew I had to do something
Figure out a way to make something out of nothing
Open up shop, got what you need
Speakers, clothes, CDs, or bags of weed
But that shit got me nowhere except jail
Me and all my homies too broke to make the bail
So now we're right back to the place where we started
Chuckles and laughs, the second we turn our backs
Assed out, but we was like, ""Fuck ya'll!""
We got each other at the drop of a homie call
Look at us now bitch, hold my platinum
All on my dick but I'm the same as back then
Forget the money and fame because
Beneath the paint life's just like it always was

*People murmuring*

Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?
Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?

Another girl I don't dare to confide
Playing that role, it hurts inside
Here I am thinking she wants me
She only wants that killer on her CD
Just when I couldn't feel any worse
Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first
The day I finally get to leave this land
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man

Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man
The shell of a used up man
The shell of a used up man
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)
The shell of a used up man
The shell of a used up man
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)
The shell of a used up man
The shell of a used up man",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-behind-the-paint-lyrics

Feeling like you don't belong, like you the only other?
Some of us scrubs got it worse than you
No homies to call on, or crew to belong too

Some of us stood up to fight but got knocked out
Some of us like to cuss and don't like your format
We like the wicked shit and chose not to ignore that
(Some of us be coming out of more than a broken home)
Some of us be living out of our cars and carry on
Some of us see the Budget Suites as a real apartment
And make you take off your shoes on our carpet
Some of us are on parole and can't leave the state
And some are dead and gone, my homie Blaze can relate
And some can't afford a free phone call

Some of us own dope cars that fail to exist
Some of us have profiles nobody else fits

Because my own kids are hungry and they're looking to me for shit

And some of us have incurable sexual venereals
And some of us have dreams of being a star)
And most won't make it that far, but it's all good
Some of us can't afford the coolest shoes
Some of us give a fuck what popularity choose
Some bitches tittie dance because their babies are crying
Others say they're dancing for college, you know that they're lying
Some of us are in love with people who ain't ours
Some of us don't give up until we're behind bars
And some of us must of been born to take the fall
(But then some of us's equal us all)
And I'm with you",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-we-belong-lyrics

I should probably take another pill or two
In the mirror, I see the face of Frankenstein
And that face is mine
I go to work at Subway, slicing ham (chop chop)
Cut my finger off again (Arghhh damn!)
I walk home, tryin to dodge and hide from thugs
They like to beat on scrubs
I go through this all the time though, I call
""J, where the fuck you at?""
""The mall,""
""Did you get your ass stomped again?""
""No!....yes..ha ha....so?
Nobody sees what I see, do they?
They just cast me aside, put me away
No friends, no style, no place to go

Thats why it's all in you (Juggalos!)
Look at me now man, brain dead
I could de-rail a fucking train with my forehead
I now live by the Carnival dominion
So mother fuck your opinion
I'm a looney path
I kill pedestrians, families, neighbors, best of friends, anybody
And if I don't kill them, I keep them in my basement and drill 'em dead
Just kiddin, all I really did is unlock the forbiden
I just let my fucking mind unwind
I don't care what you think, you don't inner-twine
Fuck the world, fuck everybody in it
Even the Sneaker Pimps girl, I'd fuck her in a minute
You can live to impress and dress fresh bitch
I don't care, fuck everybody out there!
Rydas, loonies, stalkers, fat mans, gangstas, nymphos, assholes
Crackheads
I smoke peace pipes with indian war chiefs
I steal jewels with chinese ninja theives
I dress well like yuppies and crush walls
I throw giant ice bergs like snowballs
I surf tidal wave, drink molten rock
I'll put a fucking tornado in a headlock
I'll go to Italy and straighten that tower
Whatever the fuck I want, with the juggalo's power
It's all in you (Juggalos!)
It's all for you (come on!)
It's all in you (hey hey hey)
It's all thats left to do
Thats why it's all in you (hey hey)

It's all thats left to do thats why it's all in you
Psychos, ex-convicts, cleptos, whinos, (?), lions, strangla's (?)
Here I go again, another day, dealing with these mother fucking idiots
At Subway. It's ok, cause now I see behind it and I keep myself
Reminded. None of these 9 to 5 robet puppets that I see are any better
Than me, Mother Fucka! They just struggalin, in the world they choose

I'm Violent J
I breath toxic fumes
And throw my lungs up
All over your brand new patent-leather penny loafers
You fuck!
I'm 2 Dope
I got sick ass sewer sludge stuck in my throat
And I live in a big pipe on Zug Island
So stop by and have a bowl of rust
You fucking bitch-ass faggot
Faggot, you bitch ass faggot
I'm in the Southwest Detroit, Delray
Inner city, ghetto street-gang
I got people who want me dead
But every time they run up on me
I get scared, and my skull explodes
All over those motherfuckers
Sometimes I get hungry, man
But it ain't nothing in the box but a brick sandwich
So I start hurting that motherfucker
And I chew on that bitch 'til my jaw breaks
Which don't fade me, cause I'm a hoodlum
And I don't exist to you fucks
You fucks
You green-grass fucks
Fuck me, and I'll fuck you, fucker
We comin', motherfucker

Coming to get ya
How ya see me is what ya get

Get Ya Wicked On,The Wraith: Shangri-La,2002,"I punch bitches in their fake titties. He does
I got warrants in like eight cities. He does
I like to murder those provokin'. (Damn) He does
I swing quick and leave a motherfucker's throat hangin' open
I drink the blood of a street rat. He does
Yo, Monox Boogie where the weed at
I got 18 plus speed (Uh huh)
With a plus two dagger from the Tomb of Horrors, D&D
We cave heads in with a brick. We do
We fuck hotties with the same dick. (All day) We do
We eat power lines and generators. We do
One time we shut Detroit city off for like 11 hours
We the wickedest; believe that. We do
Stevie Wonder-Bra can see that. Shit, he do
We'll rip your head off and swing it by the hair
Until we get blood everywhere. Motherfucker, get ya wicked on

We know you hate who we are
But even in Shangri-La
A wicked clown gotta get they
Wicked on, wicked on, wicked on

I'll drive a tank through your high school. He does
I let the carnival high rule. (Bow down) He does
I get sick like a crime story. He does
Motherfucker, this the Southwest Side Ghetto Territory
I can make a fist with your neck in it. He can
I need my medication every 20 minutes. He does
I store dead bodies all up under my house and every night
I hear 'em runnin' they mouth and gettin' wicked on me
Day-days on my black hearse. (Damn) We do
Clown love, juggalos first. They do
Red and black skullcaps everywhere with the fresh face paint
(Breathe it in, secondhand smoke) contacts and the Twiztid hair
We find peace at the graveyard. We do

The Dirt Ball,Psychopathics from Outer Space,2000,"(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Galacto Inspector do you read me?
Yes Captain
Status?
Completed
Your mission was to land on the Dirtball and explore it thoroughly
You were to monitor the activities of a common life on the Dirtball
And study peoples life styles
Their general habits of living in their strange society
Yes
Have you done that Galacto Inspector?
Yes I have Captain
Very well, may we have your report?
A strange place this Dirtball is
A lot of guns a lot of rich folks spitting on bums
A lot of hoodlums
These are just the bums that are really pissed off
Why? Probably cuz they been ripped off by the system
Cops, they ride around in little cars
And throw folks behind bars, like little jars
They supposed be there just to serve and protect
But they just punch faces a lot, and choke necks
Then they got the higher ups they call judges, and they rule the land
This I don't understand
First of all they like to dress this bitch up in a robe
On top of all that, ""What?"" he's mad old
And he hates anybody that looks different then he did back when he was a kid
But that shit was like 400 years ago
Captain ""Yes Galacto"" I just don't know
And the kid that was going to jail. Yeah?
He looked me dead in the face and said ""Stale.""
Then my cloaking device must of went dead. Why?
Cause the old ass judge looked at me and said
(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(Twiztid)
Very interesting, thank you Galacto Inspector
Now probes Data (Day-ta) and Data (Da-ta), do your read me?
Yes, here sir
What information were you able to gather for us on your recent voyage to the
Dirtball?
This is professor Data
My transmission signal is weak and my communication is shattered
We came in contact with several different specimens of life
Everything has got a price even if it's wrong or right
Upon sight people judge and stereotype
Their forms of government and religion are glorified
Purified as the waters that are now polluted
Members of the flock recruited for duty, locked up, or instituted
This is doctor Data I phase with the planet to see how they medicate her
She's high off that cane
Depending how you slang you can get most anything
From a nickel bag of grain to a lucy worth of cane
Maintain communication Data here again
Their leader is determined by the vote of many men
Although he's only human and slightly over weight
He control's and manipulates their whole United States
I call to the white castle
Secret service on the phone giving me a hassle
He said the information I requested was denied
Before he hung up the phone he took a deep breath, stopped, and replied
(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(Violent J)
Judging from the information so far collected
The Dirtball may not be the ideal place to land our craft
After receiving Fleek's information we'll make our final judgment
Fleek are you there?
I'm here, but hold up captain cause this ain't good
I'm getting chased by some fat rednecks in white hoods
I think there trying to kill me ""Well what do you mean?""
It seems they got a problem with the fact that I'm green
I guess on the Dirtball they all hate each other
If it ain't were your from, it's your skin color
Let me get my phase-a-tron out, hold up (buzz)
""What was that?""
I smoked 'em
But what really fuckin turns my tentacles is their relationships
They swell each other's lips
I see men that ain't shit in their daily life
So they come home drunk and beat they wife
She forgives him when he say's he didn't mean it
You ask me they can both suck my glippy glip
I give up captain beam me back to Zelaloovy
Another thing they love to watch horror movies
But your not allowed to be scary on a CD
They tried to ban this one group ICP
I went to see 'em in concert J grabbed me by the head
And then he took his microphone and said
(Chorus x6)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(Chorus x4)
Get the fuck out
So get the fuck out",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-the-dirt-ball-lyrics

"Bitch, I Lied",The Tempest,2007,"Bitch, I'm here to tell you I lied
When I seen that thick-ass it was over
Nothin else mattered, I ain't even care
I pulled the rubber off when I stuck it up in there too
Bitch, I lied to you, this ain't my home
Kicked in the back door and now we're alone
I stole the car that I picked you up in
Plus me and your girl have been fuckin
Bitch, I lied, everything I said to you
All steps to land in your bed with you
My watch is fake, this ain't my coat
And I sent you letters that my brother wrote for me
Bitch, I lied, everytime I left town
I really stayed right here at home
Dickin hoes down, every penny that you helped my mom
With went straight to the asian spa, bitch

Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, no prize
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, girl, no prize

Bitch, I lied, I didn't buy you that
I stole you that, and then I stole it back
It ain't no mr. right without a mr. wrong
First, and you fucked up and met mr. worst
I fucked a hooker and left skeet on your backseat
And kept on and never missed a beat
And bitch, I lied, my name ain't lance
I lied my way in and outta your pants
I never played football for michigan state
I lied to your neden and it bit the bait
I never won a medal for winnin a back stroke race
But bitch, I lied to your face
I'm the motherfucker that stole your momma's purse
And watched you and your daddy blame it on her
I lied everyday of our lives to your ear holes
(you look really good when you wear those)

Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, no prize
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, girl, no prize

Bitch, I lied, about so much shit
Half the shit, I forget
I tell you new lies to cover the old
I throw hot new shit on top of the cold
Flip the script up and talk you blind
Backwards, re-enactment, rewind
Tangle the topic, have you blamin you
For the fucked up shit I do
I told you I owned a mcdonald's in thailand
(and you bought that shit, damn)
I told you that al pacino was my man
(and you bought that shit, damn)
I told you a whole lotta shit cuz I can
(and you bought that shit, damn)
You're no brize, bitch, no prize

Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
Look how you turned out to be
You're no prize, no prize
Hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it

Look in my crystal ball it's alright (x2)

Welcome, my curious sisters and brothers
First, put a twenty in the jar with the others
(That's right take a seat)
Ain't no smokin' in here, I need to keep my ball clear
There spirits in there
(Whats your future, someone gonna shoot ya)
Will you get your girlfriend back, as if I know that
I can only tell you where your soul is headed
And will remain eternally embedded, the rest forget it
Life is nothin but a test to clear
Did you have a heart while you where here
And was it sincere?
Your still unraveling your future right now
What kinda person are ya bro, oh, where there you go
You control your own muthafuckin' destiny
I ain't lettin' the devil get the best of me
(I'm gonna make it into Shangri-La) golden walls
Whats up with you check your own crystal balls

Look in my crystal ball its alright
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright (x4)

Lookin' in my crystal ball I'm seein' thugs
Both catchin' and firin' slugs (paper for drugs)
I see a line waiting on block cheese a mile long
All tryin' to be strong (It's the same old song)
But when I'm lookin' into everybody's faces (smile)
Their soul are headed other places
And they ain't worried about payin' them dues down here
(Because they motherfuckin' future is crystal clear)
The focus switches to you and it ain't good
All mad cause someone rolls up out the neighborhood
Check your self, if the judgment was passed
Yo, you be in hell (right up in the asshole)
The hate will get ya if ya let it
Pack your speedo's, I hear it's hot where you headed
I'm trying to tell ya now (when the grim reaper calls)
You don't wanna be ass out grippin' your crystal balls


Look into my crystal ball its all black
And everybody's frozen in time front to back
Their controlled by the matrix of mind, body and soul
And I'm branded by the system of carnival freak shows
I see the fame analyze cause nothin is disguised
It's the same as seein' the death in the demons eyes
I'm hiding my sights, from the truth of my crystal ball
Believe me when I sayin' we comin for all of y'all

Look deep into my crystal ball
See the dead smokin' on trees and drinking alcohol
Underneath the street beneath the concrete
If you listen to the night you can hear my heart beat
All painted up carryin' an axe and shit
Juggalo love got each others backs and shit
Encased in glass for the whole world to see
Am I inside, or is the crystal ball inside of me

You’re so weird, you wanna chop yourself up with an axe
You’re so thin, you disappear behind a flag pole
You're so nasty, you’d think you was born a tadpole
You're so ass, you're butt head; we'd see your face if you mooned us
You’re so sketch, you faint if a fucking balloon pops
You a lot of wick wick wacky wack. Get bitch-slapped back
Your lips get fat. Psyche shit, skip that
The flak you get, spit back. Don't react, just smack
That's wick wick wacky, while the dick gets that
You're so weak, your bird chest shows like a titty
You're so shitty, you're the chairman of the doo-doo committee

You're so shy, a butterfly floats by and you're afraid
You're so slow, you ain't done yet, you don't finish shit
You're so addicted, you only quit quitting the shit
You're so abused, you don't know if a kiss or a punch coming
You're so used, they don't want you, but they're coming for something
You're so poor, you can't afford a front door (Come on in!)
You're so fake, compared to Milli Vanilli, you're pretend
You a lot of wick wick, wacky wack. Get bitch slapped
Lack you lip, get fresh. Slacky shit, script that
The flak, you get split back. Don't react, just slap
That's wick wick wacky, while the dick gets that
You're so alone, your girlfriend has a blow-up veil
You're so unwanted, you throw triple keggers all my yourself
You're so busy, you got fired from your job as a dad
You're so sensitive, “Let's Go Crazy” makes you sad

From yelling stop but I don't, you beg but I won't
You best to go home and score a 8-Ball of dope!

To a fucking bigot snitch on your way to jail!

The way your blonde wig flow, they did you like a ho! (OH!)

Not me, I halfway expect that shit!

She was kind though, always had a smile for me
I never thought much about her, didn't see her that way
And she was always out sick, missing every other day
Now that I think about it we was always saying ""Hello""
I always figured cuz we both were people alone
I hardly knew her at all, she sat behind me in some classes
What was really going on behind her glasses?
And why was...

Haunting me, here with me

Watching me carefully

Cuz of all the mean faces, hers was sweet and always glad
I hardly knew her for nothing, I only knew she was cool
A quiet soul, fragile, slipping through the hallways at school
And now that she's gone, I can hear her crying my name
Although it doesn't make sense to think about, it's insane
But what if I was something special to her cuz I said ""Hi""
What if she would always dream about if I was her guy
And what if those ""Hello""s that we shared went a long way
What if she felt for me, like, in a strong way
What if she was ill but always tried to make it in
Just to see me in the halls and share our ""Hello""s again
Why was...

Haunting me, here with me

Haunting me, here with me

Haunting me, here with me

Watching me carefully
Why!?
Is she calling down to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?

She was pale, and looked so ill and so frail
Maybe she looked at my life, and how it's so stale
And thought ""We're both outcasts, maybe we could have each other?""
It flew right over my head, I never even bothered
Now it's too late, and every night I hear her in my head
Begging me to join her with the dead, meh
To think about it's so strange, I hear her singing my name
Vera Lee is haunting my brain! I hear her in the rain!

Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?

[Verse 1: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope

Our society? Fucking high to me
Be one of them? Fuck that. I don’t try to me
Crows, ravens, and hawks – they've been peeping
Watch. Their behavin's off
Listen, here’s Squawks. Clear communication
With who, though? A lunar substation?
Enemy nation? I feel the air stick radiation
The terror I'm facin'? Uncomprehendable
Poisons in every edible
Harmful chemical is spraying the vegetables
Connoisseurs, tell me what they did to the meat
Answer: Fucked it! Injected it with shit and skeet
They scan us all, even kids in the potty
Plot to stop it, they'll ruin that party
Toxins, cancerous to the body
Exactly as planned by the god damn Illuminati!

Right! We're programmed, so each other we fight
Eazy and Pac saw this and was about to shed light
But they snuffed ‘em
, and now we're blamin' Suge Knight
Just they figured we would. They were right!
They travel tunnels underneath where we're standin’
They’re down there making plans of commandin'
Of upperhandin’, of reprimandin'
Fuck! Way above our understandin'
Did you know they control the music our kids hear?
Trying to program the population and steer
Them into private prisons, ‘cause the more inmates
Means the more intake the fuckin' bitch makes
Human life is their last concern
We’re just passengers on the world them bastards turn
Nine eleven was a government plot, we've learned
 Hell's Pit is where lovin' each other burns

What's killin' half a million when you've got no feelings?
They'll bust nuts healing kids die, squealing
If their own son's windpipe's in the way of a profit
There's no end in sight to the ways they'd chop it
These days, they could kill any sickness
But they'll pay keepin' them at bay; it's the business
Hawking. Just know they're watching your face from space
Peepin'
 (Just in case)
Prince knew about the third eye
 (Uh)
We've been told an untruth – an absurd lie
That's why the man died in a fashion, bashin' his credibility
They humiliated him for his ability to see
Even Einstein suffered from manic depression
Because he understood… Oppression!
Stay in the dark. Don't watch or diminish
It hurts. 
It's 

Now they splittin' atoms; it's how they make hurricanes
Tsunamis, typhoons, the murder rains
They can make you do anything, any season
Only question: Why the… For what reason?
Zoning, when they need to give the mass bone
It's tragic, and they only clone to own
Look at Kim Jong, evil and all wrong
‘Cause he's a puppet; the original is long gone
Signs, logos, barcodes that speak evil
Behind closed doors, rituals of eating people
Creepy man snakes, 
secret handshakes
They need and plan lakes 
to contaminate
Secret societies, cliques of pedophiles
Billionaire boy's clubs with satanic styles
Never enough, lips muffled and stuffed with dick
Sick shit, sold as a snuff flick

I kill family, friends, myself
What, yeah, I'd kill myself if I could only survive
I tried to kill Rob Van Winkle, in fact that's how we met
I went up to kill him and he was thinkin' the same shit
I pulled out a chainsaw, he pulled out and ax
I was like come-on, wait is that a Stanley, where'd u get that
It's natural and to murder, you gotta have it in you
It's like a dick all up in you, although I wouldn't now

2 axes come in handy
To answer Violent J, ya damn right its a Stanley
In the shadows of the dark with darkman like spawn
In the dash blazin' it up with explosive bombs
I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM
While zipping bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM
Ice mixed with blood is the killers milkshake
Here with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical death break


Disrespect me I'll run in your house
Like puffin steam stout
Break both your arms, gun in your mouth
Knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth
Bullets bust through the back of your head ya die swift
Fuckin wit tha clan, watch what you say
We kill niggas like the KKK
Shoot you with an SK or a AK bitch you gonna die either way
I'm a monster thoroughbred gun holding weed-head
Cross me bet tomorrow you'll be dead
Catch you at a show while you're chilling with your ho
And crack your skull with a bottle of Mo
I'm a Sing-Sing killer
Gun groove captain
Brooklyn home of the original gun clapping
Gats get brung, niggas get done
Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons
I'm a killer

He's a skitsofrantic, serial killer clown
Who says women love his sexy smile
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon
Sharon, what's your question?

Contestant number one
I believe first impressions last forever
So let's say you were to come over to my parents' house
And have dinner with me and my family ...
Tell me what you would do to make that first impression really stick?

Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it
I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do
And look your momma in the eye and tell her, ""FUCK YOU!!!""
Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti
I'd kick her in the butt and tell her, ""Get the food ready!""
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this
You know for only 13, she got some big tits
After that, your dad will try to jump again
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware
I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear
*applause*
Now, let's meet contestant number two
He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak
Who works for the Dark Carnival
He says women call him ""Stretch Nuts.""
Sharon, let's hear your question

I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions
A man who expresses himself in his own special way
Number two, if you fell in love with me
Exactly how would you let me know?

First thing, I could never love you
You sound like a little richie-bitch, FUCK YOU!!!
But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care
By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here
I'd go through your phone book and kill em all
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!)
Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay
I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day
I'd tell you that I love you, if you don't say it back
I'd have to chump-slam your neck and dislocate your back
I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can
And then I'd club you in the head, like a CAVEMAN!!!
When we go to the beach and walk through the sand
I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin
As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back
And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!
*applause*
Well it sounds like contestant number two
Is just overflowing with sensitivity, Sharon
It's a tough choice so far
Sharon, let's have your last question and
See which one is going to win the rights to your neden

Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the
Same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would
Your pick up line be? Whoever's the smoothest wins!

Okay, first, I'd sliiiiide up to the bar
And tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are
I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake
And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Rickie Lake!
Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick
I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick
And then to get your attention in the crowded place
I'd simply walk up and slap you in the fuckin' face

Yeah, smack her in the mouth, yo, that'll get her
Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better
Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap
Shit, you don't want contestant number two, he's mad wack
I walk into a bar and there he was
Standing up on a bucket, (ugh!) trying to fuck it
It was a big fucking smelly, ass farm llama

Bodily harm, fire alarms
Mounted acid gun, burn down the farm

I build pipe bombs with duct tape
Fill it with gunpowder, that’s all it takes
Get me a wick, long or quick
And when it blows, molecules split

I took out the crowd, I’m so proud
Connect these wires, twist with pliers
I’m sick and a coward, no one to admire

You have a friend request
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Friend request

Ha ha ha heh!
Hey! Balloon anybody? Free hugs and handshakes
‘Cause I’m sweeter than chocolate pancakes
I’m Choppy the Clown, looking for friends
Packet full of gummy bears and a dirty syringe
I’m a bit of a fibber, a play pretender
I’m supposed to say that I’m a sex offender. Heh ha!
But I’m innocent, it’s true, I’ve fled
But between me and you, she was a doo-doo head
Now I’m set. How about you? Where is your home?
When will you be there alone? I’ll creep over!
Sleep over, dude. We should!
We’ll play Twister nude in the woods. I’ll bring Twinkies!
Oh yeah, Stinky, my puppy – I’m right behind him
Hey, wanna help me find him? Hop in! Heh ha!
We can have ice cream with Reddi-wip topping
And you can scream when I’m chopping!

Hi, I’m Sam? I’m looking for somebody to watch scary movies on Netflix?

Hello! I’m Fingers the Clown with a friend request
Father of the year in a pink vest
That step dad that gladly behaves the best
‘Til I graze your breast! (On purpose?) Yes!
I like kissing you a lot, and I’ll slap your butt
And I’ll slap your friend’s butt! (What the?) What?
You better know I’m not the one you can trust, son
I’m not nuts, I’m trying to bust some
That does it, missy. See my in my man cave!
Right now, it’s you in my man cave!
Some things are better took to the grave
Like when I taught you how to shave down there
Remember, I was just dating your mom
And that was the fucking bomb, well that exploded

Everybody has friend requests, but who’s all in disguise?
Who’s really out to hurt you? Look deep behind those eyes
Who’s real? Who’s fake? Who’s a snake? Who’ll use you as prey?
We share this land with demons and devils, deceptive in every way
Who’s camouflaged in a world of lies to devise your demise?
Who’s waiting for opportunity to bite you and spite? 
(Surprise!)
So go make some friends, choose who you hang with, people you met
But one day, it just might be they fangs sunk deep in your neck

Fine lady!
What up? I’m requesting your friendship
Let me buy you a drink to sip!
I’m fresh out! (Oh what?) of uh.. Law school!
I graduated and shit! (Ah, cool)
First just dust, then came trust
Then the lust came ‘til I came, nuts bust
I’m the type you bring home to your mudda!
And in the trunk I shut her! Nah!
Say, babe, who’s that guy?
Oh it’s just a friend? Okay, bye! *gun shot*
Damn, babe, so sorry about him
We’ll carry on without him. Where’s dinner?
I told you, when I come home late, I want a hot plate
Or get socked in the face like last time
And I guarantee spousal abuse quick
Every time you refuse, bitch!

Lost in the Music,Mike E. Clark’s Extra Pop! Emporium,2012,"ICP, Swollen Members!
That underground connect
Swiftly movin' in the dark of night!
Over this Mike E. Clark...
Right here!
A lot of severely depressed kids...
Uh, really enjoy music a lot
So I think this, uh...
Draws a lot...
Raise him out of his shell socially
It's been really good for boys...
Looks forward to the music

Well...
I have panic disorder, rage, severe depression
On top of all that, I'm stressin' (Uh-huh)
Took a blind date to my therapy session
And then tried to kill her, her first impression
Was I'm groovy, I gotta be. I need a lobotomy. (Yes)
But, when I press ""Play,"" trouble leaves up outta me
Fuck the real world that my fat ass stuck in
Cause in my music, hotties are fuckin'! (Whoo!)
Expression, gettin' out all I wrote
Depression, rippin' out all your throat!
And if my hearing was ever to go...
Mass murder would be inevitable! (Ha ha huh ha!)
I'm a slick romantic, quick witted and funny
Take away my tunage and shit gets bloody! (Blah!)
Pull out the plug and kill the track
Instant panic attack!
Gigantic!

I strive!
Only through the magical world of melody!
I'd rather die!
Than face the sounds of my reality!

Just let the rhythm ride
And I'll survive somewhere inside it!
Lemme strum wit' the bass and drum
I wanna run to the place I come from!
Silence is pain, stress and pressure!
Paint my picture, so much fresher!
Kill the quiet, play it again!
Keep me alive, never let it end!
So, let the rhythm ride
And I'll survive somewhere inside it!
Lemme strum wit' the bass and drum
I wanna run to the place I come from!

Blood on my hands, blood on my T-Shirt
And everywhere else it could reach or squirt!
Violence, brought upon by silence
When they kill the beat, that's where my mind went! (Woo hoo hoo!)
My nerves went acrobatic
Skippin', flippin', trippin' what happened?
They say, ""Hip-hop's for kids!"" Silly rabbit!
Your throat I snap and squeeze and stab it!
They drive terrorists out wit' rock n roll
They don't gimme any, and I'm outta control!
All I need is freedom, unlock my soul!
Ignite my powers, shock explode!

A lot of severely depressed kids...
Uh, really enjoy music a lot
So I think this, uh...
Draws a lot...
Raise him out of his shell socially

My name's Madchild, I got mental problems
Walk around town a demented goblin
I'm the little monster, I'm going back shit!
Axes and hatchets, packets of matches!
Homicidal maniac, I am diabolical!
Angry and maniacal, I'm a human fireball!
Stand vertical, Mad's a mass murderer!
Psycho laugh hurting you, mad to mass burglar!

I'm Illusionary, confusin' my very essence
Execution from electricutin' every sentence
Very buried his verses come out the graveyard of profession
No comparin' our performance to the patterns of aggression. (C'mon!)
Incandescent like fluorescent light, sights upon the target!
When I hit it I'mma get it 'til the music flood the market!
I'm a tsunami, Swollen Army general front liner, flat liner
Black binder, rhyme book fact finder! (Yeah!)

I strive!
I strive through the melody!
I'd rather die!
Than face reality!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-lost-in-the-music-lyrics

The Insane Clown Posse
Will live forever (Live forever)
Join us (Live forever)
Follow me (Live forever)
Carnival awaits us (Live forever)
Take my hand (Live forever)
Take my hand (Live forever)
Shangri-La (Live forever)
Live forever (Live forever)

Here go another clown song, freaky and weird
I'm still preaching - I'm like Noah without the beard
I'm trying to spread the facts that I know for sure
Yet many don't believe in our carnival freakshow
It's alright though, there's enough who do
And only time will tell if our stories are true
But for everybody here I can promise you this
You'll never hear us rap about the typical bullshit
Pimpin', all the money they got
All the ice they wear, and all the people they shot
All the freaks they pull, and all the cars they drive
Only we rap about fucking a beehive
You wanna keep it real? Walk out your door
That's as real as it gets from the sky to the floor
But the Dark Carnival will take your soul away
And give you mythical adventure in a magical way

I live for The Carnival
I die for The Carnival
I pray for The Carnival
Please take me away (take me away)
I love for The Carnival
I die for The Carnival
I pray for The Carnival
Come take me away (take me away)

Funhouse, freak shows and murder-go-rounds
Fuck how you looking, paint it up like a clown
Loosen up, let it go, you ain't gotta be tense
Faygo flying everywhere, fuck making sense
And that's the beauty of it, look backstage
Ain't another group out here on the same page
Run with everybody or walk with our crew
And stand on the moon, face the world and say ""fuck you!""
I ain't sitting out playing that star biz
Put me in the crowd where my Juggalos is
Treat me special I'ma leave your lip draggin
We in this together waiting on the same wagon
Let them laugh now, let them laugh for years
We'll see who's laughing in the house of mirrors
Cause that's where I'm going and if you're not
Bump that other shit and hear about the ends they got

Live forever
Take my hand
Live forever
Live forever

Come take a journey through heaven and hell
See what we have to come, and share the story I tell
Walk hand-in-hand with the devil and God
Let them pull you in half, purgatory is alright
Fuck newspapers, fuck magazines
Fuck A&Rs, and their ball-hugging jeans
Fuck anybody trying to change our ways
As long as 6 Joker Cards got something to say
I speak for the crazy, I speak for scrubs
I speak for the thugs pissing in your hot tubs
I speak for the people that you always say don't know how to act
We like them just like that
Fuck your Grammys
Fuck your music awards
I strangle your host with his microphone cord
Fuck anybody that ain't down with the clown
From now until millenniums after I'm dead in the ground

I live for The Carnival
I die for The Carnival
I pray for The Carnival
Come take me away, take me away",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-take-me-away-lyrics
I Didn’t Mean to Kill ’Em,"Forgotten Freshness, Vols. 1 & 2",1995,"This is the story of a murderer
A cold blooded killer, a ruthless, heartless, slaughterer
I didn't mean to kill him
Listen to me, wait

Fat titties, lookin like pow!
And she's tellin me to come by right now
Oh shit, I jumped in the wagon, no more laggin, I'm taggin
This bitch, dead in the ping hole, make her lose control (mmmmmmmmm)
I showed up, I ring the ding dong
Grippin my wing wong, something's wrong
Who's this, not a bitch, but a dude
And he's tellin me to beat it; fuckin rude
It's Jimmy, her man, a punk ass
So I throw a left hook at him, splaaa
Then I came back with a right hook
POW, he fell to the ground
I didn't mean to kill him
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO JIMMY, OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!
I didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby
I didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby
Oh fuck, he's chillin with a neck broke
25 to life, is no joke
Don't die bitch hang in there
I mean I really don't care, but come on
Move quick, I run to the hospital
Make sure ain't dead yet, shit
There he is, chillin with a neck brace
With a look on his face like ehhhhh
Come on Jimmy, it's me, your homey
I even poured a little brew in your IV
Don't die, oh you tryin to speak
Fuck you, your punches are weak, ehhh
So bitch, you wanna talk shit again
I jumped up wit a boot to the chin
Pull his plugs out, and start chokin
Ewwwwwwww his necks already broken
He swung, hit me wit a bed pan
I was just makin sure you ain't dead man
Fuck this, I grabbed a scalpel
And stick it down in his scalp, uhhhhhhhhhh
Calm down, he's dead now, FUCK
Here comes somebody, better duck
Gotta hide dead Jimmy quickly
Or 25 to 50, I didn't mean to kill him
OHH MY GOD!!!! JIMMY, WHAT THE FUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby
I didn't mean to kill him, kill him, baby
Didn't mean to kill him, kill the man baby
Jumped out the window, and drug him home, jimmy's dead
And I'm finna get the bone
If they catch me, ah the death chair

They'll never find him here
(*phone rings*) Jimmy can you get that
What the FUCK, he's dead, I'm whick whack

""Yeah, this is Detective Fucknut
We're lookin for Jimmy Bowels""
He's not here, uhh, wait wait yeah he is
""This Jimmy, I'm alive, I'm not dead, I gotta go""
Oh goody, they bought it, hah, they'll never know
I killed his bitch ass
Fuck it though.  Jimmy's my room mate
He doesn't even eat much and that's straight
We just chill all day and watch videos
Call Domino's, and flick off his toes
Make em land in a fish tank, what you think?
Let him sit, FUCK OFF, I didn't mean to kill him

Some dude, rude, goosed her ass
She got mad and slapped me fast
Tried not to cry in front of my crew

And she wouldn’t let it be, and finally
He got shot, I got arrested
She moved on, and now I get molested in jail

Um, my label (Stay right there!)

I drove all the way from Detroit, back seat full of weapons
If I'da got pulled over they'd be dead in seconds
Whipped out a hitch, I arrive on the 405
The Staple Center, tonight it's the Grammys... live
Don't got no ticket, but I ain't here to scream and applaud
I come to kill Chris Brown and shock this industry crowd
Fuck him dead in his seat, blow his guts out his tux
He beat the hell out his woman and they still on his nuts
The fuckin message that is sendin must have a bloody endin
Posin as security, but he ain't safe I'm just pretendin
Bruno Mars on stage, cameras live, TV
That bitch forgave him, but still he's gotta die to me
Big record companies, executives, VIP's watchin
Probly cover up his dead hookers, big business appallin
But the underground below don't approve him, so he flex
He had his chance on top, he fucked it up, make room for the next
He stood up to applaud the show put on by Lady Gaga
Blew a cyanide dart into his throat like, 'got'cha!'
He fell back dead, stuck smilin, eyes open as the night went
They thought he was just dazed, happy from all the excitement
BUT I KILLED HIM!!

What if I shot a star out the sky? (Shooting stars!)
A piggy has to have wings, before he can fly!
What if I killed him?
What if I shot a star out the sky? (Shooting stars!)
A piggy has to have wings, before he can fly!
I fuckin killed him!
What if I shot a star out the sky? (Shooting stars!)

Can’t End Myself,Hell’s Cellar,2018,"This is a tale
A long forgotten tale of wicked mayhem
A man whose own personal Hell was his own life on earth
So therefore, in Hell, he was granted just that:
Eternal life on earth

I shot my wife in the head. I blamed the bitch for everything
She’s the reason I failed. It’s ‘cause of her I ain’t a king
I tried to carry on; I couldn’t. My decision: suicide
I put the shotgun in my mouth and with my toe put two inside
I felt my world shake. *bang* I felt my thoughts catch on fire
My skull exploded in my head. Tremendous pain was acquired
My body hit the floor. I felt cool air hit my brain
All the same, I still remain. My pulse maintain
I ran into the bathroom. I checked myself in the mirror
I had a bloody mouth, and plus the back of my head wasn’t there
I’m steady bleeding. I started freaking, ran and jumped through the glass
Some thirty feet into the driveway. I smashed at last, I passed
But not so fast. I’m still alive, and I’m driving
I thought about giving it up and going to a hospital
But then I seen a truck coming. Fuck it. I hit the bitch dead on
I walked away minus a head and an arm
(’nitruh m’I .deyonna tog I litnu ssa tuo tihs gnikcuf rehtom eht dewalc tI .yot a ekil ydob ym koohs dna edis ym no swal sti dekcol tI .noil a deppals-hctib pu thgiarts dna ooz eht otni llaw a deppoh I ?gniyd em dna em htiw pu s’tahW)
I can’t end myself
I have no head
No fuckin’ head!

People are trippin’ on me. I’m looking like the living dead
I can’t explain my situation ‘cause I have no fucking head
I just keep trying to die. What’s up with me and me dying?
I hopped a wall into the zoo and straight up bitch-slapped a lion
It locked its laws on my side and shook my body like a toy
It clawed the mother fucking shit out my ass 'til I it got annoyed
I’m hurtin’ heavy now. I took some sedatives to relax
About two hundred Xanax and passed out on the train tracks
I scored some Anthrax. I rocked it up and did a few lines
I smoked it up and tried to shoot it through my neck a few times
I’m trying to talk through my neck hole, but everybody’s runnin’
It’s only gurgles, and all this fucking blood won’t stop comin’
I got into the bathtub and cut my legs off with a saw
I tried to bleed to death, but filled the tub, more blood than I ever saw
Won’t stop comin’. My heartbeat won’t stop drummin’, I’m bummin’
I’m just a headless paraplegic on a skateboard. Help, someone
(’nitruh m’I .deyonna tog I litnu ssa tuo tihs gnikcuf rehtom eht dewalc tI .yot a ekil ydob ym koohs dna edis ym no swal sti dekcol tI .noil a deppals-hctib pu thgiarts dna ooz eht otni llaw a deppoh I ?gniyd em dna em htiw pu s’tahW)
I’m trying to end myself (End myself)
No legs
No fuckin’ head
One arm left, on a skateboard

Still got my arm, and I’m scootin’, people givin’ my ass a bootin’
Thank got these slutty-ass hooker hoes be out here prostitutin’
I got my dick sucked, I get it bitch, I rock of the Anthrax
She smoked that shit, and her heart exploded, fuckin’ blew out her back
I tried to scoot along, but a big stray dog locked onto my arm
And then it dragged me to a dumpster with about fifteen more of them
And I was punchin’ on ‘em. I ain’t gonna die, and they bitin’ my ass
I found a beer bottle. I broke it and started stabbin’ 'em with the glass
I pull myself on, grab the bumper of a passing Grenada
I’m hangin’ it, draggin’ rocks and gravel, hurting a lot
I’m about to fall out. We hit a corner, and I hit a tree hard
And with my broken-ass arm, I crawled into somebody’s yard
And in the shed, I found a wood chipper. I thought, “This is it”
I pulled it out and got it runnin’ and climbed into that bitch
And now I can’t explain the horror or the pain. I’m still here
But I feel myself being eaten by the maggots, each piece, everywhere

SuseJ says, Lord, I stand at the door and knock

Always Uninvited,  unrespected

He hangs out in bad neighborhoods up at the park

3 little kids caught inside a broken home

Leave 'Em Alone!
As sure as we're today and death is inevitable

Death is always at a shitty time
Don't bother trying to run and hide
Take his hand cross to the other side (Step to the other side)
(J and )
Freeway intersections when the bars close, he loves 'em
, he hovers above 'em

Rehab centers and caring mothers always scaring him

He encourages and raw sex?
They got him workin and steady collectin soul checks

Instead of some of these poor children we see
(Chorus) 2x
(J and Shaggy)
He remains nameless but we call him the Wraith

That's it, now your clock is tickin, every second counts

And whether you going to heaven or hell, 
He's only here to give you the death touch, 
Most people fear him

That once he finally touches you with death eternity can begin

Cause my bitch don't bitch at all
My bitch don't blink, she don't even think
About money or a fuckin mall

She don't care about what she wears
Cause she's much too busy
Pulling the worms out her butt, she ain't bathed in years! (My kind of bitch!)
My kind of bitch, I'll never forget
We first met on a Ouija Board
Ms. Crabadamn she would chew on snakes
And swallow a ninja sword!
I said, ""Hey bitch, how do ya do?
Some folks call me Violent J""
She picked her nose and flicked it at me
Smiled and was on her way, my kind of bitch!

She can drink through it, ya get used to it
It whistle every time we kiss

The other one's skinny and red
She can make the one Jiggle
The other one don't do shit but just sit there dead
My kind of bitch has a wooden eye
With a nail sticking half way out
It once caught on fire
We all had to spit in her face just to put it out
My kind of bitch is a little loopy
And her ass might droop a bit
But I scoop that loop and fold the flop

Dipping your titties in Faygo and slapping my face wit 'em, um...
Jumping from the dresser and landing on my balls""


My kind of bitch waits till I sleep
Then run and fuck my friends
And every time I break her legs
And give my homie ends (Ha ha, what's up man?!)
She shot me once and stabbed my neck
And even broke my nose

Down to her stringy toes, my kind of bitch!

At the same time, that's a must!
And uh, I'm lookin for a girl who can stretch her titties
And stuff 'em in her ass!""


Fuck yeah, muthafucka! I'm lookin for a bitch...
I'm lookin for a girl to fit my needs! (My kind of bitch!)
Yeah, we can have picnics under the moon and the graveyard...
We can have picnics under my house... (My kind of bitch!)
I'm lookin for a girl... to die with
If you're already dead, that's cool...
You could sit around and wait for me to die... (My kind of bitch!)
I'm lookin for a girl to squeeze me
I'm lookin for a girl to squeeze my balls
And let me squeeze her neck

Thy Raven’s Mirror,The Wraith: Shangri-La,2002,"We be doin' murder everyday, we be good enough to get away
You won't even know a wicked clown has hit the door
Until your melon hit the floor and roll away

How can I stop myself from murdering your neck
Methadone and Prozac only keep me in check
As soon as it's gone, I'm gonna KILL!
And that was my last refill, God damnit
I drink Lithium and I don't even know what it is
Only reason why you diss me is cause you want a sip
Everytime I drink it I piss out a laser
And cut holes in the wall with my dick phaser
I'm a do time I assume
I bitch smacked the judge right out his own court room
Then I took the bench and sentenced myself
Eternal happiness and good health motherfucker, motherfucker
Motherfucker, I represent the Hatchet
I see your eyeball lookin' at me like I'm a snatch it
And throw it to the garbage can down the hall
Then kick you in your ass as you search and crawl for it

We be doin' murder everyday, we be good enough to get away
You won't even know a wicked clown has hit the door
Until your melon hit the floor and roll away
We be doin' murder everyday, we be good enough to get away
You won't even know a wicked clown has hit the door
Until your melon hit the floor and roll away
You know Jamie Madrox rapped about something like this
Only I never really thought about how horrible it really is
Laying in a coffin in the pitch black dark
The only sound being that of my heart, if I'm alive
But I've had no pulse or even breath for days
I remember the crash and after that it's a haze
But I do recall my funeral, them lowering me in
It was about that time when my soul kicked back in
I tried to move my fingers or somethin', got nothin'
But dirt hitting the top from them shovelling, I'm fucked
It's been at least two weeks but I don't keep time
I just lay here motionless in this rotting body of mine
I tried fantasy realms and dreaming my way out
It only leads to mind panicking and torturing thoughts about
Running and breathing, will it ever really happen again
Please God, heaven or hell, just let something begin
Am I asleep or not, I don't know
My body is rotting and I feel pain
Gimme to heaven or gimme to hell
But don't leave me dead inside this thing
My body won't let me go, let me go, go
My body won't let me go, let me go, go
Am I asleep or not, I don't know
My body is rotting and I feel pain
Gimme to heaven or gimme to hell
But don't leave me dead inside this thing
Am I asleep or not, I don't know
My body is rotting and I feel pain
Gimme to heaven or gimme to hell
But don't leave me dead inside this thing
My body won't let me go, let me go, go
My body won't let me go, let me go, go",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-thy-ravens-mirror-lyrics
Jacob’s Word,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"There's uh.. strange {*voices*}
There's there's many many voices in my head many different voices
Some are like this {*repeat 7X*}
I hear voices one voice in particular
Comes into my mind perpendicular rectangular it's a strangular
He's like some kind of mental fucking mangular I don't know
He tells me to punch Esham and Shaggz so I punch em I even call Twiztid fags
They get mad slap me and smear my make-up
I've named this evil voice named him Jacob
Jacob tells me ""Climb the ladder and jump off head first
On the street don't worry it's soft""
So I jump thump I'm on a gurney
Jacob laughs at me ""Your so fucking nerdy""
Fuck him I hate him I hate him I can't escape him
I finally get alone he calls me on a telephone {*phone rings*}
""Violent J there?"" Here
""Hey this is Jacob I want you to piss in your underwear ok bud?"" Sure
I'm pissin now it fuckin tickles
Jacob's dissin again I hear his giggles
After I cut all my fingers off for that motherfucker I finally had enough
Go see a doctor
Doc, hello
""Hi have a seat let's see uh what is it Joe?""
Yeah Joe Bruce my friends call me chucky
""Chucky?"" - Either that or Bucky FUCK ME!
I'm sorry doc it's Jacob again my names J
""Tell me J uh who's this Jacob anyway?""
I fuckin want him dead it's a voice in my head
I GOT A LOT OF VOICES but this one's misled
He tells me to drink toilet water and shit
""Do ya do it?"" - No, YES!
I can't help it though I can't stop it
""J, what I want you to do is drop it""
Drop what? ""Your feeling of denial
I mean you're an asshole let's face it Jacob he's got style""
Yeah - ""You should do exactly what he tells ya""
Even stab myself?!
""Yeah hellz yeah""
Fuck man are you sure doc?
""Sincerely, now on your way out pay my fuckin secretary""
Wow 300 bucks and I'm cured it's absurd all I gotta do is wait for the word
Now I ain't heard from ol Jacob in while
I'm at home jerkin my dick off to Gilligain's Island
When BANG he popped in - ""J what's up homie?""
Where you been Jacob dogg it's been lonely
Doc says I should roll witcha let's do dis
""Alright well let's start off with a glass of your own piss""
Sure with ice? ""No ice!"" -  Nice
""Finish up the whole glass and repeat it twice""
All done - ""Let's go put your shoes on""
Where we goin homie?
""To the graveyard I want you to dig yourself up a girlfriend""
Dig up a dead body?
""I won't say it again! You heard what the doctor said fuckin do it!""
Well fuck it hand me my shovel and bucket
I dug the bitch literally I dug her
Her skin smelled like burned rubber I fuckin love her
Took her corpse home sat it on the couch
Jacob said ""Now put her foot in your mouth!""
So I did and her toes smelled like fish chunks
That's been sittin out in the sun for a couple of months
I didn't care though because Jacob told me to
""There's one more thing that I want you to do""
What's that?
""Lay down in the street and trip a semi wit yo neck""
Trip a semi truck? Bet!
There I was I'm moving off waitin to get rolled on like a Dayton
Here it comes I stuck my fuckin head out
Like this Jacob?! - ""Yeah! Pow!""
I'm in critical I got minutes left I end up fightin
With death why did the doctor tell me to listen to him!
I'm laid up about to die screw him!
Pick up the phone {*phone rings*}
""Hello?"" - Hi it's me J that one fat goofy weirdo
Yeah listen I'm about to die why did you tell me to follow his word?!
""Cuz he's a don-mega and you're a nerd""
Well I hear you on that much okay
But what kind of fuckin doctor are you anyway!
I mean your telling me I'm nothing but a scrub!
""I thought you knew homie - THIS IS DOCTOR JACOB!""
Oooohh I get it everybody have a laugh
I'm nothing but a sick homogetic mental path
I died right then and there I was never cured
I lived a shitty life all thanks to Jacob's word
(Mumbling) That mother
""What!""
I didn't say nothin
""Bull shit bitch!""
I didn't say anything!
How you gonna tell me I'm in your head bitch!""
I was gonna compliment you
""But I heard EVERYTHING!""
Well get out of my fuckin head!
""Fuck yours instead""
Get out of MY fucking head alright! My fucking head
""That's right my head too my head too!""
You don't got your own fuckin head! I'm not running around in your fucking brain!
""Cuz I ain't got one bitch""
FUCK YOU!

I'm sorry
""Eat your leg""
I'm sorry not my leg

Leave my leg alone

Take Me Home,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 3",2001,"You know the irony of life is that you have like
This big dream to get where you wanna be
But once you get there you start to dream about where you came from
I guess thats the part of the circle of our lives
Like the hands of a clock going round
If only we could wind them back and return to a time where the dream began
Its all too soon thats all will be is a dream in someones mind
Look at me I'm famous on top of the world
I finally reached up in time (im a superstar)
Stand up, step back and take a look
Is this really whut I had in mind? (i dont really think so)
I guessed them goals that we set in the day
They actually came to be. (yup yup)
But now I'm lookin at a black white paper
And with a whole book of memories (but we never read)
Seven deep in the jeep with the camel top
Everybody and they drunk as hell
Merciless Amir and awesome dre and anybody by the right would see us
(cause we always went there)
Songs were long and polution strong, and the faygo always warm and flat
(thats nasty)
But if now if this supposed to be heaven for me, then just give me my own
Hell back
So take me home
(to my empty refrigerator)
Cmon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand)
So take me home
(to my old school down in delray)
Cmon and take me home
For what little time I got left
(cmon cmon) lets go yall
Theres another festival down town
Take some bottles back up to the store
(i found two of em)
That would get us bus money down there
To get back we have to find some more
(might as well get drunk)
Hangin our flyers up everywhere
We coulda sworn we was makin noise
(everybody knew us)
Finally we had everyone in southwest
Representin with the jj boys (everybody)
I stole to eat (i stole)
I stole to live (i stole)
I stole only to survive (if yous a hoodlum)
Just like j said in 'ghetto zone' I stole a car with my tape inside
All we did was try to talk to hoes
And none of them was tryin to hear (not 1 ho)
It woulda meant so much more back then
Cause now its fake hoes everywhere
So take me home
(to my empty refrigerator)
Cmon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand) (where you at yall?)
So take me home
(to my old school down in delray) (summer time)
Cmon and take me home (delray)
Mike P, y'all
Southern rock for ya
Rudeboy
Oh lord dont let me get my girlfriends call
If she dont get off until two (we got all night long)
I finally show up at 4:30 am
And I still have to drop my crew off (but i'll be back)
Now I'm alone and ontop of it all
Looking deep in the back of my mind (looking deep in the back of my mind)
I realised the key to a happy life
Was right here wit me the whole time
Chorus x2
So take me home
(to my empty refrigerator)
Cmon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand)
So take me home
(to my old school down in delray) (where you at?)
Cmon and take me home
What up everybody I'm here chillin with samantha
""HI GUYS!""
And I bet you wondering how we like to do things around here
Well we like to do 'em with family
Were family, family
Everyone of us is family
What would life be like without family
Were family, family
Well my name is joe and I flow like whoa
I steped on stage and I stole the show
Mini c, she down with me
But today I'm representin all family
Save this song for years and years
Guarantee on day it will bring you tears
Cause you remember how things were back in the day
Lets try to keep it this way
My name is mom and the mom the might (yea)
Kickin that style that I know you'l like
Im from detroit the city of boom (boom)
I used to send violent j to his room (whut?!)
When I bust this funky style
My money stacks up over miles
Now I think i'll pass the mic
To another fresh MC I know you'l like
I gots mad love for everyone on this track
This rob rollin strong on a hoop attack
Samantha's my daughter, my mom is my mom
Nancy is my wife cause she is the bomb
(hey don't forget about me in this roll call)
Joe is my brother who is standing tall
Together there as powerfull as my unity
And i've been blessed to have my family
I am samantha, I'm a MC
Rappin with my family
Love is the word I chose to use
I spread it around like it's the news
I do the booty shake everywhere I go
And I prove I can dance and also flow
If you have a problem with who I am
You can go and jump in lake michigan
Nancys my name and I got much fame
Cause my familys on the team
I flow as I go so act like ya know
Or get slapped in the head without a ???
I do the booty shake with my daugther sam
Cause she's the one with the master plan
I got much love for new york and back
Don't question me cause that's a fact
My name is kris, as if you don't know
I ??? for a while with my crazy flow
I was born and raised in ramulous
That's where I first learned how to bust
This song is making history
Cuz it's real, it's all about family
Im quite I don't say much and I'm shy
Any minute though I might sting your eye
Were family, family
Everyone of us is family
What would life be like without family
Were family, family
Yea, the bruce brothers will never die, thats right its all about family
I'll hax anyone that ever messed with my family
My mom, yea, my brother and sister, yea and there kids yea",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-take-me-home-lyrics
Apocalypse,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"Murderers, day in and day out!
Murderers in this town right now would blow your brains out for enough money for a fix of crack cocaine!
It's never crossed their murdering minds that they're gonna burn in hell!
They've never thought the fact they're going to burn one day!

The cops have left their posts
And ran home to their wives
Today is the last day of all of our lives
There's bullets in the air
I can hear glasses breakin
There's no mistaking
The fucking earth is quaking
A man is on fire, running down my block
I put him out his misery and blast him with a rock
Explosions going off, sirens and alarms
I'm ready for death, grippin' my hatchetman charm

Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world
Apocalypse
Armageddon came now
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Let the fire
Let it rain down

Water mains blow up and shoot out the dirt
A stranger punch me in the mouth, but it ain't even hurt
I'm seeing families run only to be gunned down
By some psychopathic killer with automatic rounds
A burning chopper crashed into the house next door
The pilot got shot, I fuckin' shot him some more
It's mass mayhem, pandemonium, and armageddon
People are killing each other, themselves, and raping neden


Swarms of insects are attacting the city
I see a man fucking a headless corpse when it hit me
This is Babylon the devil is alive on earth
I pulled the clip in my Uzi and killed for all it's worth

I shot an old man on his bike
A clown on his trike
A fuckin whore named Sally
And a priest named Mike
They're all dead now
I put gun to my head, too late
A little kid shot me instead",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-apocalypse-lyrics

The darkness and Hell will blend as one
The darkness will bleed?out?the sun
The darkness?is morbidly fun
The darkness will engulf?everyone
The darkness and Hell will blend as one
The darkness will bleed out the sun
The darkness is morbidly fun

In the dark, decency don’t have to be the rule
In the dark, nobody’s watching; you can be a fool
Hang upside down, a gargoyle or a creepy ghoul
Take shit as far as you like; don’t have to keep it cool
In the dark, you’re not responsible for all that you’ve done
Generate enough blood to drown the morning sun
There’s lots to do to cemeteries, and the morgue is fun
But the dark is everywhere, dead to explore the fun
Nobody has a face. You can be what you want
Are you alive is all that matters. Your heartbeats you flaunt
And the darker the better; the dead are free to haunt
You can hear ‘em calling out your name; you see they taunt
Everyone’s alone. They savages. They tear at each other
They all share a common goal: they only care that you suffer
In the dark can be thick, suck out your air when you smother
‘Til you can’t escape the darkness, even under the covers

Flip!

Faster than a fire is the smoke when it spread
Do some filthy shit to your bitch or choke her instead
Hear the blade cut through the air and poke in your head
You’ll be prayin’ for the shit to end, hopin’ ya dead
It’s black ninjas in the dark. Even your shadows have shadows
Black as oil skeletons, you can hear them bones rattle
Blackness first, the dark see nothing void of tome battles
You can feel the dripping heat, more blood than slaughtered home cattle
The blackness of their eyeballs are bottomless pits
Something’s frowning in the darkness, you ‘bout to get bit
So much blackness is surrounding, you drown in it quick
Would you rather step in guts or hippopotamus shit?
Black teeth, black eyes, black hair, black skin
Black tongue, black soul, black magic
Your throat we will slash it
Red rum, unholy and tragic
And some come hold the black hatchet
Knock you out cold with a ratchet
They young and old going batshit
Ain’t no controlin’ the action
Black blood be flowin’ and splashin’
Just bein’ choked with a passion
Sickness take hold when you catch it
Darkness can’t nobody match it
His head explodes when you smash it
Stabbed full of holes and some gashes
But it’s much too dark to see black blood all over the mattress
There’s a raven in the room, but all we hear is a squawk
Actually, we can’t even see. Maybe it’s a hawk
I don’t know, baby, a crow maybe, or it’s a black swan
Under the black sky, black shit all on a black lawn

Wicked Rappers Delight,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 4",2005,"ICP and Esham......Wicked Rappers Delight.....2015

Fiends of the wicked shit it's time to get high
Bump your fucking shit up put some wicked shit by
Detroit legendary demon loop of terror
Staring at you right back with your eyes in the mirror
Blowin' out your brain spontaneous combustion
Lyrics like a mural in each ear and I'm bustin'
Fire breathing wicked shit and meltin' microphones
Blowin' speakers into flames setting fire to your home

How many times you gonna say I need help
Who gives a fuck if I murder myself
I'm thinkin' suicidal thoughts I shot a gay preacher
I didn't do my homework, so I shot my teacher
I dropped out the next day, fuck a GED
Then I went and clowned the industry with ICP
Threw up the 313, to let you know it's me
Esham's dope ho, I'm the king of the D

I stole a fuckin' firetruck and drove it through a Wendy's
All that happened to me was a bullet in the kidneys
I almost died death will look at me I'm right again
What's really happening reality is pretend
You can blow my fuckin' head off I'll just grow another
My brain and myself, we don't even know each other
Someone's in the darkness crawling out of my closet door
That's what the nines in the mattress for

Warlocks and witches come and learn from the master
The walls in my home feature bodies in the plaster
They're dead but stickin out like Han Solo when he froze
With my favourite weapons hangin off they fingers and toes
Wicked pimpin' scary bitches living or dead
All with vampire fangs and they givin' me head
Like cemetery girls bat dance boogie woogie betty
Her neden's big and blew out like a plate of spaghetti

I'm out cold all my teeth gold plus I don't brush em
Quarter back sneakin' plus mo key if you rush em
Bust 'em down, bust 'em up steady fuckin' 'em up
But wait why do I have all this blood on my hands
Blood on my clothes blood on my shoes I'm on the ten o'clock news
For steady, murderin' crews and they point of views
Like, purple chronic mixed with acid demonics
And a stomach full of Jagermeister ready to vomit

Mirror mirror on the wall tell us who the wicked are
Shaggy, E and J we in the game and gettin' ours
Hittin' stars in they mouth and boltin' off wicked ready
With necklaces wicked reckless, nobody expects this
Bumpin' this wicked shit homeboy you're braindead
I can fly a motherfuckin neg on your head, breakin'
And tie your fuckin' feet up to your neck
And shoot you in the back watch and kick you down the steps

I blow a crator in the side of your head
Do the same to your missus while y'all sleeping in bed
Double murder robbery, just another job to me
Rollin' in a stolen Buick hookers slobbin' me
Known through the farmlands as a do gooder wicked
Always shootin the biggots, and kicking the chickens
Askin' me the wrong question also triggers my disease
They'll find your body in Compton and head in Hollis Queens

The phone broke and on the other side was the president
I can't talk right now I'm on the toilet taking a shit
Hung up the phone I think my cover's blown I'm deep cover
Your wife ordered a pizza from me she got the meatlovers
I'm Johnny Bravo the other black rio get at me ho
I make these ho's happy tho, cause I'm they pappy oh
It's too soon for you to be on my team
But give R. Kelly a call, I think he like 'em thirteen

I once met a hooker and she did it for free
On the west verner bus number seventy three
All the way in the back she was humping on me
Until I strangled the bitch and stuffed her under my seat
I got off at my stop without so much as a drop of blood
But then I realized I forgot to wear gloves
Now I'm chasing the bus my fingerprints are on her neck
STOP! AND GIVE ME MY DEAD BITCH BACK

Fucking dead bitches on a ouiji board all night
Busting off shots in the club we all fight
Hanging motherfuckers by they neck off of streetlights
With they legs cut off trying to read me rights, shiit
I'll whip my cd at you stick it in your face
Halfway sticking out but look it still plays
I stomp when I rap and I shake the whole block
Stick my dick in your ear so you can see what I got

I was one of those monsters from the video ""Thriller""
Known to the world as the pop star killer
And from another park from the ground I arose
I'm the crusty ass booger hanging out of your nose
I'm the stink on your toes, I'm the weed to your rose
Not one of your friends but I'm one of your foes
And spitting the wicked shit is the life I chose
Do a spin grab my nuts and then b-boy pose

Can you walk for some tic tac bloody message on the board
On your chest and take turns shootin the rest
I win everytime need to be like good with every bomb
And off with your head if you're in the way of getting mine
This is Esham and the wicked clowns from the vault
We come flying out the dark with the triple gold salt
I threw a snowball so hard it replaced your eye
It melted and left a fucking hole when it dried

Life At Risk,Forgotten Freshness,1991,"Waking up to the little baby crying
Mom's yelling cause pop's got his fists flying
It's 9 in the morning and he's drunk
One day I feel that I'm gonna shoot that punk
My bitch laying next to me in the bed
I honestly don't give a fuck if the ho is dead
The only honor in my life is my rag
Without it zip me up in a body bag
Grab my brother's gun, load the .44
Take the money-back bottles and head to the store
In my neighborhood your life is a dare
'Cause there's factories pumping out black air
And I'm breathing this shit everyday
Living crazy 'cause I'm dying anyway
I see this tramp hanging under the bridge
I tell her go home and watch her kids
You listen to them cry and sob
Take your sorry ass and find a motherfucking job
See my homies hanging at the liquor store
40s and the cash, dice rolling on the floor
They say my friends'll never be any good
But the President wouldn't have been shit
If he was raised in my neighborhood
My friends say the same old shit
The Southwest side 

 have a hit on me
I guess everyone seen it
When I slammed Johnny's head into the cement
It started all this crazy shit
And now we never set out without a loaded clip
And we headed up to the dunk rim
Little boys on the court, so we punked them out
And I'm thinking of my brother
When he was pushed off the court he wanted to kill them fuckers
Now I'm standing in the bad guys shoes
Paying my dues
And I don't have no where to be
Just another street hood in the inner city
And a man is gonna ask for some change
Give him a dollar so he can go and fry his brains
Fuck no, I push him out the way
Cause that sad motherfucker got shit to say
My homie was known for the macking
Now they got him doing 10 on car jacking
And I'm thinking that I'm next to go
What the fuck I'm already living Death Row
So many out there want me dead
Everybody wants to put a bullet in my head
But I don't give a fuck if I die today
Everyone alive is gonna die anyway
What the fuck is life about
Come home late and daddy blow your mouth out
That's in the past now, I ain't soft
Daddy hits me today and I'm going to blow his fucking head off
For now the bullets close but miss
Living my life at a risk

You know J, man you're right
Too many motherfuckers out there are fake
People need to understand
That if you get hit enough times
Then you start hitting back
All we are is pawns on the game board
And if this is the way everybody's playing it
So be it, motherfuckers
Count us in
But the ICP is playing for keeps

The Truth,Hell’s Cellar,2018,"Call me an outcasted member of society
Or whatever, but fuck MTV. It's how I feel
Fuck they panels and they whole comittee
I’m bringin' gats and ammo to Manhattan city
And fuck you ready-made radio DJs
Who have no control anyways
You's a puppet. Fuck it. You’s a fuck puppet, a fuppet
So spin that playlist, eat a dick, and suck it
You know what? 
Fuck a Chino XL
Even with this return diss, your shit won't sell
It ain't what you say; it's the fact you wack
Keep dreamin' to be where we at with these plaques
What happens? These faggots with no real accomplishments
Forget that we  with these chips
They on the front lawn, but we underground kings
So fuck what your American Idol sings

Truth is, we the most hated (And it keep us alive)
We love to be cremated (‘Cause it keep us alive)
Truth is, we the most hated (And it keep us alive)
We love to be cremated (‘Cause it keep us alive)

You know what, fuck the world. I don't care about war
Fuck everybody on the dance floor
And I hate Rolling Stone. Fuck you and your own
I hope you and Spin both fuck each other off, gone
And fuck publicists, 'cause they scared of this shit
And all y'all labels be sucking our dick
Because you can’t even handle our very own genius
And half y’all interns be suckin' our penis
Truth is, we the shit whip diggity bomb
And will be until economy gone
Truth is, sometimes I hate that we famous
I always got hound dogs up in my anus
We up in these titty bars, mother fuckers starin’ at us
Is it that we glarin' enormously?
Before me is a hound dog bitch
That's about to get his bitch ass kicked, truthfully

In Hell, this one's for us (This song is for us)
And as we burnin’ up (This song is for us)
In Hell, this one's for us (This song is for us)

Truth is, we never needed anybody
And the truth is, we never been afraid to get bloody
And we ain't never been afraid to come out the house
With law suits and all straight blow out your mouths
And fuck all you gold-diggin' hooker-ass hoes
I'm a minute man because you ain't worth two blows
You's a penguin. You need to get stabbed with an icicle
Evidence melts, and I'm nice to go
Fuck MTV television. My vision is this:
Pistol grips all in your shit. Think I'm playin'?
I dream about Molotovs up through your glass
And right up your  bitch faggot ass
We the killer bad guys with them burnt up bridges
And still, ever year, see another seven digits
And we don't need no god damn mother fuckin' anybody
Wicked Clowns stay nutty. Why?

What you see in the Hollywood movie is a lie! This is the truth, and when you come to church, you should expect to hear the truth about every subject, and tonight, you're going to hear the truth about the sodomites. That this is the truth about the sodomites. Like, “Oh, we need to pray for him that he finds Jesus.” I'm gonna pray that he dies and goes to Hell. I have no love, no love! You say, “Well, I'm offended, I don't wanna ever-” Then get outta here! Because, you know what? You're not welcome here. Lose people? I hope I lose people with this kind of preaching. I hope I lose all the freak pervert sympathizers. Get outta here! You're destroying America! And speaking of nuts, I have a nut here, okay? And this is a bolt, okay? So, listen. This is what  a normal person does, alright? See, I got the bolt right here to represent the male, right? You got the nut right here to represent the female, alright? This is what normal people do, okay. This is what- now let me show you what insanity says to do. It doesn't work, stupid! See, but, but, but people are crazy today! And then there's the, the they, they say, “Oh, 
Pastor Anderson
's crazy.” And one evil, sick reprobate that none of the other kids will stand up to. Kids do not have the guts to stand up to reprobates. I'll stand up to ‘em, unlike most preachers that are a “spiritual babe in Christ,” so they get bullied and picked on by the fags. You know what? They don't bully me. Take me on! Huh? Bunch of filthy sodomites and queers. I'm the one who has the guts to preach against them! And these other preachers need to man up and stand up and say, “Come on! What are you gonna do about it, you big bully?” And the reprobates are always bullies, aren't they? They march down the street. They shout their voice so loud. They're such a small minority, but they're always a minority, and they're always a bully, and they always want to cram it down everybody's throat! Well, they're not crammin' it down my throat! You know what, I'm gla- a, you know, I didn't like goin' to seventh grade at that messed up school, but in some ways, I'm glad I did, ‘cause it made me so mad that I'm still mad, and I still hate their guts. I still hate these reprobates! I still hate these sodomites! I still hate these haters of God and these vile perverters of the flesh, and I'll stand up to ‘em, and I stood up to ‘em then, and I'm gonna stand up to ‘em now, and we need some preachers that will stand up and say, “No! No! You're not gonna back us down. You're not gonna tell us that we're not like Jesus, and that we're not- You don't even know Jesus! We know Jesus! We're gonna tell you what Jesus is like!” Because you know what? They are compromising, and they are not standing for the word of God, and they are tools of the media to brainwash you! To brainwa- They are just tools of the media to brainwash you! And to lie to you and to deceive you! My friend, but you've been deceived tonight; you've been lied to, and you don't even know what the Bible says anymore. ‘Cause you're watchin' TV, and you've been brainwashed. The media has been brainwashing you week after week and month after month and day after day to get you to think it's all about “Gay marriage, gay marriage, gay marriage, gay marriage. Don't let ‘em, don't let ‘em bake the cake. Don't bake the cake. Don't bake the cake. Yeah, if they come, I can serve ‘em, yup. I don't wanna hurt their f- yeah, but just, but just, just not the marriage, just don't let ‘em get married.” No! Care if they get married, that's not what the Bible says! (Right!) The Bible does not say, “Don't hurt their feelings.” The Bible calls them beasts! (Yeah! That's right!) Turn, in your Bible, tonight, to 2 Peter chapter 2. I'm sick of it! Why don't you get out of that stupid liberal church you're in and get into a leather lung, Bible-believing, King J Baptist church, and it wouldn't be a hard decision! D- do you, Wh- Who thinks it's a hard decision if some faggot wants you to make ‘em a wedding cake? And that's brainwashing you, my friends! And you could say, “Well, she's fighting the battle in her own ways.” She's fighting nothing; she's a tool of the devil. -ight once again.

Don't you ever pay any fuckin' attention. (Don't panic) Oooo (Um)

About what the fuck you're doing (noises in the background) I'm working on something

You cared (I'm trying to fucking concentrate) What the fuck is wrong with you

Where my swim suit at
The soups on in Argentina
Convalescent home patients serving me with subpoenas
Make sure you tell the fuckin' captain his legs are made of rubber
I got an apple for your forehead if I'm cleaning the shutters
Give me my turkey pass
Tradin' chops sticks with the hooligans
Snakes are in a submarine
I'll never go to school again
I stole you a Porsche cause your mama's a fox
I'm selling footwear insoles and I'm running three shops
Horrified jelly worms with electric infantago
Dinosaur crybabies cookin' shrimp in San Diageo
Full moons mean nothing without your roller skates
When the water runs dry and blood fills the great lakes
I'm a hired assassin but ice sculpture is art
And so I ride a horse everywhere returning shopping carts
It's raining fish flies on the east side and I'm rappin'
Slutty ass skanks get slapped for nappin' (umph)

I don't wanna know about the shit that matters
Skip-switch forget shit I scatter my brain (I scatter my brain) 

Throw your hands up
Kamikazes don't tell lies
With that watermelon foot bath they minds collide
Bitch, my knees been bald headed so download that
Ridin' on a zamboni in my 
Danny K
 hat
I'm the number one contender for a shot at the bible belt
I swam between piranhas and assaulted a patty melt
The red planet still remains in orbit
Leavin' trash piles cleaned up by A.J. Styles, Me, and J. Geils
Leopard shit in my yard
I took the yellow pill
I once stabbed a flamingo but it was only a fire drill
Meet me at the market for your kung fu prize
With that frozen ice firecracker (everybody rise)
Get your panties off ho this ship is ready to attack
Somebody get on the piano I'm calling John Cusack
And put ten on pump seven if your skills are tight
Make sure you bring a wet mitten cause its col col col cold at night

Hell’s Forecast,The Wraith: Shangri-La,2002,"Something had woke me, a thump on my roof
It was followed by crashing, more thumping ensued
I jumped out of my bed thinking I'd been invaded
Heard smashing, more pounding, the sound escalated
Looked out of my window, blood dripped down the glass
I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass
I ran into the main room and Shaggy was dead
So was Nate The Mack, Jumpsteady and ABK
Bolted out of the house to see if it's a joke
I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke
And the sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin'
It's raining with corpses, the blood is appalling

Mama told me when it rains, it pours
But never mentioned dead bodies, dead bodies
Mama told me when it rains, it pours
La dee da, da da dee, la da dee, dead bodies

I never seen so many horrified looks on people's faces
The blood is appalling
I hope I never see what all them people saw, and put them in their places
The blood is appalling
The sun was so hot, so hot
I was burning, yeah

Dead bodies lay randomly, some stack in piles
On all of their faces, pure horror, no smiles
I see children and elders and ninjas my age
All lay naked and mangled, most withered for days
I found safety, a shelter, I'm under a tree
Only fingers and organs come falling on me
I lay sleepless for days as the raining continued
The heat of the sun baking corpses like food
Then it finally stopped, I walk knee deep in blood
Over piles of bodies, through what was my 'hood
It was right at that moment the wraith had appeared
And the message it left me might sound kind of weird
But take all that I'm seeing and opposite that
Truth is I'm the one dead and this is my Hell's Pit",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-hells-forecast-lyrics
Vomit,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"Erica was a beautiful girl even without her makeup
She was something stunning from the fucking time she wake up
She had many sugar daddies paying for her needs
They never knew about each other or her evil deeds
She was self vindictive and wicked into shame
God gave her that beauty, but ugly was her brain
As the years went by she continued using suckers
Hard working individuals who gave all just to fuck her
As Erica grew older, her looks begin to fade
She's spent every dime they had to surgically upgrade
But that would only last so long as time continues ticking
The eviler that Erica grew as now she's old and bitching
She died up in her older lady laying in her coffin
Few saw her funeral as none would visit often
Her soul dropped into hell screaming as she plummets
Beelzebub welcomes her as on her face he vomits

On her face he vomits
On her face he vomits
Beelzebub welcomes her as on her face he vomits

John was a wealthy kid who had all that he wanted
Taught only in the finest schools he shut up like a comic
Graduating college, the world rests in his hands
Never thinking of the greedy or trying to understand
He landed at high paying job, his wealth accumulated
Charities that's often but only left degrading
He married and had children, but money's what he loved
He never had time for his kids as out his way he shoved 'em
He grew older in this fashion and never was he proud
Of anything that they accomplished at 'em, he screamed loud
Finally one of his sons who've felt rejected and neglected
Commited suicide and John still didn't correct it
John grew older rich and greedy and he died this way
His kids they really care less, but this ain't never said
His soul dropped into hell screaming as he plummets
Beelzebub welcomes him as on his face he vomits

On his face he vomits
On his face he vomits
Beelzebub welcomes him as on his face he vomits

If the heavens above had rejected your soul
Never are you lost without a place to go
Deeper to the bottom of hell's eternal fire
You are always welcome to come and retire",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-vomit-lyrics

You know, I thank you for doing that song with us
I really do
And every time I hear it
Every time I hear your voice
I just wanna bang that shit out backwards
I’m not gonna lie
*laughs*
But still, girl. I’m steppin’
It’s true, bitch

Kreayshawn, it’s on. I won’t front
Straight the fuck up, can I hit that... blunt?
My way of saying let’s kick it
My shit’s explicit. My dick you kiss it
Gobble, lick it, terrific it tastes
 in out of your face
So you like chicks? I’ll dick some with ya
Hit ya, split ya, Twitter the pictures
Get ya wet as an ocean
Skeet in slow motion. Pump out the lotion
It’s my notion to cause a commotion
Blow your whole neden frame out, (Boom) explosion
Big wicked clown, my dickin’ is drastic
My only hope? You’re frickin’ elastic
It’s fantastic you like it rough
What up? I’ll throw this dick at your butt

Kreayshawn (Kreayshawn)
I wanna hit that
My penis (Penis)
We wanna split that, I know
“I’m pretty sure you’re a lesbian”
But still, can I hit that shit?

I fuckin’ love your shit, that Gucci Gucci (Uh huh)
It make me wanna smooch your coochie
Lookin’ at you, I’m the only thing missin’
Your neden all on my breath when we kissin’
Baby, I’m blunt. I’m not dissin’
Battle me, you’ll meet a mortician
Fuck around and get kicked in the puss
I know some deadly ninjettes. Don’t push me
Tushy probably tastes like Sweethearts
And Swisher Sweet blunt smoke mixed with farts
But what do I know? I speculate
What up with a shot of head before the date?
And again when it’s over, slip up the slide
Top it off first. Don’t just stick it inside
It’s all in your eyes. When you high, you freaky
Plus you a dyke, so it’s tight and squeaky
Yeah *laughs*

Kreayshawn (Kreayshawn)
I wanna hit that
My penis (Penis)
We wanna split that, I know
“I know you probably got some little weakling-ass boyfriend”
But still, can I hit that shit?

You know, I’ll dick you down like I’m King Kong
And you, just a sweet little fawn (Aw)
With a mini skirt on, no panties
Next to you, your girls all look like trannies
Seen all your nudie pics freak online
Let’s take some new shit with big me behind ya
I’ll say Kreay, (Hey) meet big wang *boing*
Whip it out, and then you like “Dang!”

Kreayshawn (Kreayshawn)
I wanna hit that
My penis (Penis)
We wanna split that, I know
“Don’t be scared of my dick. It’s alright”
But still, can I hit that shit?

Yeah. Write back soon
But keep it on the low

Kick your ass, too

Tha Dogg,Flip the Rat,2019,"No, *Whimper*
I don’t have any recollection of the first time a kid felt
The piercing sting, a whip burst from his belt
And try to stay off my side with the worst welts
And crying “Mama, please stop him. It hurts. Help.”
When I hear the Hyundai pull up, in the closet I slide
Behind ‘em coats, prayin’ I don’t see them boots, or I’ll hide (No!)
“Please let me be,” I hoped and cried
But mother always told him I was inside, fuck
His big hand reaches in (Come here!), Fists my hair
Stricken with panic, I feel it rips and tears
Yellow underwear, again I pissed in fear
Always caught the beatings, never just a scare
I turned twelve and got a bowling pin. He trash picked
I said, “I don’t bowl,” then owned a fat lip
Mama laughs when asked how bad my stepdad hits
I’m just a sack of shit to beat on, I admit, because

I’m the dog who gets beat
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
Shove my nose in shit
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
Why won’t mother save me?
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
Save me

And when I turned 17
There was no datin’, only hatin’ and beatings
Bone breakin’, kicked teeth in. They waitin’ to greet me
“Mother, let me stay home, not another defeatin’”
She said, “No. Tell him you’re a friend. Make him believe it”
The school’s a nightmare (Ay). It ain’t cool to fight fair (Ay)
They shootin’ all night,  here
Smacked up so black and blue, my head spewed white hair
They said every time we see you, we beatin’ you right here
Walked to the store, mistake, dinner died in the maze
Like Pac-Man, give it back, man. For them, crime pays
Knocked out 6 times by 6 thugs in 5 days
My whole head clocked crooked, sideways
Beat up and robbed, mugged, I shit and piss blood
Called the cops, got my head split by the pigs’ clubs
Saw my pops (Yeah?) Hugged? (Hey?) Nope (Oh) Slugged (Bam)
, and never got loved
...And then it happened
One night, in the thug zone I got jacked
They slapped and attacked when I got back
And I lost it, snap, going wack
And swung the only shit I own until a skull cracked
Mother’s, with the bowling pin (Jeez...)
Her blood spreaded, and forehead folded in (Easy...)
The cops said, when they exploded in (Freeze!)
The step pops ain’t hold shit in (Fuck ‘em, though! Peace!)

I’m the dog who gets beat
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
Shove my nose in shit
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
Why won’t mother save me?
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
Save me

""I sentence him, indefinitely, to psychiatric treatment, until the positions in charge deem you fit to rejoin society with him.""

For two long years, I was medicated, sedated, I hate it
It’s how they keep you baited ‘til your shit abominated
Thoughts disintegrated, then they amputate it and refrigerate it
Never invigorate it, so I never ate it
I played it, and fed it to the dedicated
They benefited me, I’m tryin’ to be eradicated
Acting blew out (Ay) and limble, no improvement (Ay), tripped out (Ay)
Smooth is how I’m letting off. (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
I took the screw out (Ay) the window (Ay), removed it (Ay), slipped out (Ay)
Phew, now I’m jetting off. (Off, off, off)
Happily hauling ass in my slippers, like I sorta rehearsed
Countin’ cash, slipped the wallet out an orderly’s purse
Broke in a funeral home, then I stoled a slick hearse
Flashbacks of that belt sting, that old whip burst
Looky looky, what that there?
I found a bowling alley, scrub’s strollin’ in
First goal, I’ma win another bowling pin
Picked it up, thought of mother’s skull, in that
I’ma stick my fucking colon in ya
Gripped the hearse, headed for my succulent revenge
Mouth watering, dick hard, I won’t pretend
He’s passed out. Empty beer cans scatter the place
That’s when I swung me a strike. Blood spattered my face
Like an M-80 in a pot of mostaccioli
I got lots up on me, and I’ll be fine
Red noodles flung. Wet slop globs, stuck, stick
Drip, drop, shit. Toodle’s a fun word
To now? Who knows, but I’m riding this hog there
And kicking in the asshole of every dog there *Whimper*
With just a bowling pin, bone again
My fury fuller now, a little gust of lonely wind

You’re the dog who gets beat
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
Shove your nose in shit
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
Your mother can’t save you
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
Save you
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)
(Go outside! Bad dog!)
Your mother can’t save you
(Go lay down! Bad dog!)

The smog is coming
The smog is coming
The smog is coming

Aw shit, here it comes, creepin' through the cracks
The nooks, the crannies, it hit me, smack!
It's fillin' up my head, I gotta get it out
I got me a plan to get the shit out
Pulled out a ice pick and picked the bitch up
Smackin' it, pushin' it in my ear ,fuck!
Lord, oh please, what's happening to me?
It's the poisonous air from the smokestacks, G
Seepin' in my head, fuckin' up my brain
Drivin' me crazy, nuts, insane
Sewer sludgy, greasy slime
I'm always bucking with Father Time
'Cause he's my motherfuckin' enemy number one
Trying to punch out all my life by fillin' up my lungs
The shit you call air, but I call it death
'Cause it makes me choke and lose my breath
My toes begin to curl, my fingers start to fold
Got drool on my lips and my body's getting cold
Don't know what to do so now I start to panic
But it's too late, I'm dead. The smog got me, fuck it

The smog is coming
The smog is coming
The smog is coming
The smog is coming

It's another cloudy day, it's raining, but not water
It's raining oil out the sky, I think I oughta
Make a run, but I slipped on an oil slick
I can't move, I think I broke my fucking neck
It's no surprise, I'm laying there, paralyzed
Looking up into the sky helped me realize
About us, the clouds form a Devil's face
Tt must be a mirror image of the human race
And oh shit, here it comes - the deadly smog
I can tell by the howl of the stray dog
The air is calm, the streets are so still
When the smog creeps out the pipes for a kill
Broken neck, I'm chillin' cause I'm a goner
I can see the smog creepin' around the corner
I lay still and hope it doesn't notice me
Oh shit, shit, fuck, fuck, shit, G!
Looking up just to see his deadly jaws
I think, I think, I think I shit my drawers
But its okay, the smog left me alone
So I lay and watch the clouds turn into stone
And come crashing down over Delray
One even landed on your homeboy, Violent J
And I'm dead, crushed me in a split second
So if I'm dead then what the fuck I'm doin' on this record?

The smog is here
The smog is coming (Here it comes, over Delray)
The smog is coming (Here it comes, y'all I don't wanna die)
The smog is coming (Here it comes, y'all What you gonna do?)
The smog is coming (Yeah, hey, hey, hey, the smog)
The smog is coming (Here it comes)
The smog is coming
The smog is coming
The smog is coming (What you gonna do?)
(When it comes for you?) (Check it out, check it out)
(When it comes for you?)
(When it comes for you?)
(You're dead now)
The smog is coming (Check it out)
The smog is coming (I don't wanna die)
The smog is coming (Bet you're gonna die)
The smog is coming (What you gonna do?)
The smog is coming

Thoughts in my head
Of a dead body laying in his house for three weeks
Until his neighbors complain about the smell
Didn't he have anybody to know he was dead?
Thoughts in my head
Of a serial killer in Iowa decided to kill himself
Before he actually killed someone else
Was that good?
Thoughts in my head
Of an ocean of blood
And when the bombs drop, it causes tidal waves
Tidal waves that paint the town red
Everybody's dead
Thoughts in my head
Of mothers and fathers who look at me
And I can feel the hatred in their in eyes
And it's cold
And children are nothing but them in the future
Accept it
Thoughts in my head
Of a woman sitting on her porch, bald-headed
Because of a disease she caught from the air
The air that we breathe
The air we breathe is fucked up. It's fucked up!
Thoughts in my head
Of people who wanna kill me
But you can't kill me
'Cause if you kill me, I'll be back to kill you
Done it before, do it again
Thoughts in my head
Of a 16-year-old little fucking punk
Sitting in his classroom
Drawing a gang sign on a folder
In his Birmingham Hills
Well fuck what you know about love
Thoughts in my head
Of people despise me and hate me and don't know me
I hate you, too
So it's all good, it's all good
Thoughts in my head
Of a society that is so fucked up and so evil
That if somebody prays, they get made fun of and laughed at
But it's not gonna be funny
They won't be laughing
When the bombs drop and the town is red
Thoughts in my head
Thoughts in my head

Mind of Howard Stern,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"""People often wonder how two serial killers from Detroit
They call themselves the Insane Clown Posse
Became so rich and famous""
""Now you see here Howard Stern used to work radio in Detroit
Before he became a New York City big shot
Howard and the clowns go way back""

I'm Violent J and I'm certified cold
Straight millionaire 23 years old
Dropped out of school to watch Price is Right
And I strange people at night, hahahahah
Look, everybody knows I'm a killer
Twisted murderer sick drug dealer
Or whatever
I never tried to hide the fact its true
But Howard Stern's a killer too (What?!)
Listen, I'm chilling at the Neck Chop Bar, right
Where us killers hang out at night
And in walks a man I've never seen before
He took the table by the door and signaled for the bartender
With a cold look on his face
I walked up and said ""Hey you're in the wrong place!""
""Only murderers and killers are allowed here coward!""
He grabbed my neck and said

""The name's Howard""
Damn, it's Howard Stern the radio star
But this is a murderers only bar, sorry
And don't tell me you're a serial killer too
He said ""Just between me and you. I'm an axe murderer on my off days, hell""
""I only do the radio thing cause it pays well""
Wow, damn, I never would have guessed
What do you say we go choke some necks? Come on

""So what most folk don't realize is 10, 15 years ago in Detroit
This Howard character was a axe murderer, plain and simple
Mr. movie book big shot big time was a bad boy
The clowns were the only ones that ever knew this""

Together, we killed about fifty
Until he got a radio job in New York City
Good luck, a hand shake on the curb
Oh, about the killer thing, moms the word
Years later, I'm trying to make it in Hip-Hop
But every damn record that I make is a flop
And here's Howard's face everywhere I turn
Movies,books, Stern, Stern, Stern!
Damn! He don't even know we's friends anymore
We used to kill people together, oh
And that's when I called him (ring)
Suppose I go to the press with this killer thing?

""No you wouldn't, besides you can't prove me""

Videos, pictures, come on? Home movies
Howard I could take you down and you know this

""What do you want from me?""

Famousness
Put us on your big radio show
And play my LP and tell them you love me
We made a deal next day and he did it
Next thing you know we went gold in a minute (hahha)
And everybody loves ICP
Except the 17 million trying to kill me
It's all good but the world may never learn
What really goes on in the mind of Howard Stern...",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-mind-of-howard-stern-lyrics
Dead End,Featuring Freshness,2000,"The underworld watches in horror
As this marks the day that
3 of America's most notorious outlaws
Will be executed for their crimes
Together the states of Michigan and California
Will conduct the executions behind prison walls
The 3 prisoners are set to be executed by 3 separate methods
Electric chair, hanging, and firing squad
Midnight tonight will mark the first execution

Death waits in my cell I can smell him
Somebody tell him that I still breathe, leave
I'm alive I'll never see 25
Yet still I can feel, I'm real
When it all happened I was in the lime light
News, camera, gaven killer stamina
Another year I'm here but forgotten
Skin is rotting feeling old, cold
Motherfucker in a robe gonna sentence me to die in a metal chair
Fizzle my nut hair
Bad enough I'll be dead
Yet I'm tryin to figure out a way
To keep my eyes from poppin out my head
Oh they'll remember my ass
Twitchin, with my eyes drippin down the glass
Shaggy I think they're tryin to start a riot
And then it's Ice T but he don't seem fazed by it
I know the devil's waitin on me
But does God like him playin his role in killin me though
Lock me up until I die maybe
But you can never tell
We might sharing a cell in hell
Cause, my last request was
Let my homies smoke my ashes and catch a Violent J buzz
One more thing before you hit that switch
Please tell my momma that I'm sorry, I never
(Chorus x2)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never wanna die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder

The lights dimmed in my cell block
Cause all the power they got surged into one spot
J's chair hear him screamin, fully loaded
It was funny at first till his head exploded
It's something else for me
Another kill just as wicked
But cheaper on the light bill
It all starts with a thick rope
Make a noose and I'm gone
Stretch out my neck bone
Minutes left I think about my brother
When we was young...
Wait I don't have a brother
What the fuck?
My minds in a tangle
I wish somebody was here that I could strangle
I keep waking up on the floor
Cause I strangle myself but what the fuck for?
Haha starin at the cracks on the walls
Whistlin necks, fidgetin my balls
Kill me it'll still all be the same
Wicked clown Juggalo phantom of the night train
What if I drop, but don't die
Tie weights to my legs
And give it another try
Still coming think of something, I speak
I'm not feelin so hot let's go for it next week
Didn't work, I pulled down my collar
At least they won't be hearin me holla
My neck shut
(Chorus x2)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never wanna die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder
[A bit past 1:30 a.m. now
And the 3rd prisoner slowly makes his way
To the disignated spot on prison grounds
Where he will be executed by way of firing squad]

I got seven bitches aiming at me
My backs against the wall
If I only had my strap then I could plug 'em all
Watch 'em fall
But they got my ass tied up behind this wall
So the homies can't ride up
Known killer in fact I killed the most
At random though some of them I planned 'em
Fuck it, I kicked your bucket for you, floor you
Got more guns if there's more of ya
War with the cops no prob
They shouldn't took the job
Blow holes throught they heads like donuts
Grown-ups, kids and girls
Gather round and get gunned down
I do it for the fun of it, adrenaline rush
Coked up quick to bust
Plus I love my dust
Gun son, watch the blood run son
I'm on one, muthafuckas
But check it this time I'll be the one dissected
I can't wait to feel the heat when lead and flesh meets
Bitter sweet baby, I been waiting for this
Go straight to hell kick it with the rest of my clique
Fuck a blindfold I wanna look 'em deep in they eyes
So they can see the fool's face of a dog as he dies
Plus I wanna see the muthafuckas squeeze
I got a hot date with my soul mate
Bust I can't wait
(Chorus x4)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never wanna die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-dead-end-lyrics

Stick my boot up your dingleberry and marry
Bust you in the head with a hammer like tom and jerry
AMB and Clay with the 3 claw attack
Big J in the back
With the fully auto mac like

I love the haters, they hate us cuz the shit we do is so fresh
Underground, love n rep beneath the surface
Runnin and keep it wicked with JUGGALO'S and 'LETTES

Dead fallin' from the mic to my feet
Ill beat yo head into the street
With no mask on the surveillance tape
The cops got a good look at my face
Holdin the sign with the mixtape release date

Bone stub I spit that wicked blood
Flowin out my mouth as I do my thing and kick it
My steel I keeps it hella real
Head up I cut myself everytime I make the kill
Let the truth be told your girly loves it
Send her over, cuz I be like fuck it, I let her know
Chokin and stabbin her face like its nothin
Muthafucker I ain't frontin its murder lovin like
WHOOP
Throw your hands up if you ain't JUGGALO
Burn a hole in the carpet when you hit the flo'
We WHOOP we roll, no need to ask questions
Turn on your local news top story at eleven

Mental Warp,Tunnel of Love,1996,"Staring at the ceiling, the roof has a face
It's telling me I don't belong with the human race
He's askin me to join him, in eternal sleep
I give him my soul, my body he can keep
Reaching just above me , I see my pillow's there
But yet I have no head, my head is on the chair
I'm staing at my body, I look as if I'm weak
So give me back my soul, my body you can keep
Sitting on my lawn, it's just before dawn
I listen to the screaming, another life is gone
I'm playing with the children, children of the dead
My mother say's their evil, my daddy he gives a shit
Their eyeballs are bloody, their skin is ever pale
Their askin me to follow, I shall, I shall
They dress me as a clown, I'm screamin as a loon
We dance upon the cemetery, underneath the moon
Here I come there I go, I'm a night walker
I'm starin at you sleepin through your window like a stalker
I'm taping on the glass, I lick it with my tongue
I notice that the house is vacant, I'm starin at no one
I must of fell asleep, I woke up on the floor
Underneath the carpet, underneath the boards
I'm gaged with a dead rat, I lay for many weeks
The rat comes back to life, and is chewing on my cheeks

Mental Warp
My brain is gone, my brain is gone
Say no more my brain is gone (4x)

Coming is my helper, tangling my brain
Somethings weary wrong I can't describe this pain
I'm calling for my mother, I'm crawling up the stairs
My mothers laughing at me, and she's been dead for years
I'm falling down the stair case, tumble to the floor
I land up in the attic, next to the cellar door
I'm play with the pigons, they tell me many lies
They tell me I'll have wings if I let them peck my eyes
I hear a womans voice calling from the dirt
I plat my little seed, and slowly she will spurt
And now she is a tree, I hear the heart pound
I take her in my arms,  we make love to the sound
The wind is my enemy, blowing evil thoughts
Carrying the demons, soaring with the hawks
I breathe it in my body, the wind will bring no pain
Only lay its demon egg, deep inside my brain
They're calling me a killer, Not saying that I'm not
My daddy's tried to kill me ever since I was a tot
By poisoning my bottle, I feed it to my friend
'Cause if he dies my buddy, our friendship will never end
I'm sitting with the darkness, talking to the dark
It's singing lullabies, and stringing on the harp
I notice that the floor is warm and rather sick
It's 'cause I'm sitting in my stomach

Yo, Shaggy, what you know about Mozart?
Not much. Fact, I don't know shit, J, I think he was deaf
Def as in dope?
Nah man, deaf as in he can't hear shit
Nah man, that was Beefoven. See, what I know about Mozart is that he was a freak!
Freak? The fuck you talkin' bout?
Well, he had some underground shit people don't know nothin' about
Like what?
Like a song called ""Lick Mich Arse.""
What he fuck does that mean?
It means ""Lick my ass,"" bitch!
Drop that shit, Jack!

Ahhh. Mozart, dope for the most part
Respected 'cause he knows art
Likes music, and he shows heart
Loves chicks lickin' his ass when it goes dark
He wrote this. Don't sugarcoat this
To get your ass licked off is the dopest
Call it a fetish; call him a freak
Call him in need of a tongue on his butt cheek

Lick on the left side
Lick on the right
Lick down the middle
Oh shit, that's tight
 Lick mich arse all through the night

We heard somethin', Mozart had wrote it
Collabo style, had to bogart it
A little trick perfected by freaks
Step one: spread your butt cheeks
Now most hoes'll cut loose to music
And since that's our game, I'ma use it
So we jumped on this Jack White track
Now we can't keep these bitches' tongues out our ass crack

Lick on the left side
Lick on the right
Lick down the middle
Oh shit, that's tight
 Lick mich arse all through the night

Bumpin' Mozart, sunflower spot
Tongue up my ass like ""Ahhh""
A classic ninja with a classical hitch
Struck dirt way south of the clit
Drop my pants, tongue advance
Don't knock shit 'til you gave it a chance
Your tongue might get stuck in the middle of
Two pigs wrestling over a Milk Dud

Lick on the left side
Lick on the right
Lick down the middle
Oh shit, that's tight
 Lick mich arse all through the night",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-leck-mich-im-arsch-lyrics

Intro (Bang! Pow! Boom!),Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"There comes a time, every so often, when the Dark Carnival begins to swell with the countless souls awaiting judgement
And the thriving mob begins to tear at each other to find a place in lines that stretch out of view
And as attractions open wide to accommodate crowds frantically clawing their way inside
He will come to perform the cleansing.
 As the seething masses turn to witness him growing near
Their eyes attempt to make out his face forming within the looming smoke
Suddenly, Bang!
Like a continuous explosion, he moves down upon them full of thunderous fury, enveloping the masses in darkness
Then, Pow!
A deep, resonating explosion of unparalleled intensity
Those still alive begin to feel a warm rain upon their charred skin, which they soon realize is the blood of the shredded victims
They can only lay screaming in pure, stark terror, when Boom!
An earthshaking explosion of catastrophic proportions erupts
Causing all to collapse inward into a finite point of brilliant, horrific energy

Well, I've heard about those parties, they're immoral

Hey, what's up, I'm new in town
I work for the circus, Shaggy the Clown
Anyway, ole girl, I seen you around
I guess I'm trying to say that I wanna be down, hey
We had ice cream, sat in the park
I walked her all the way home when it got dark
She took me inside and when the door shut
Next thing you know I had my nuts in her butt, uhh
I wanna bitch whose down to fuck right away
And even does my homies if it's okay
A little bitch that's down with a quicky
I love chicky chicky, I ain't being picky though
So you might be a little bit fat
You might even stink a bit, I don't mind that
Even if you don't fuck on the first date
Just put my nuts in your mouth and I'll stay
I need a gir that just don't give a fuck
So, I'm caught strokin' her mom, I mean, so what
A little skins here and there, ain't nothing
I just need a bitch whose down with a lil' somethin', somethin'

My name's Violent J, so I can't fuck around
Who's the dirtiest bitch in the whole town?
There she go, she workin' at Dairy Queen
Bitch couldn't be a day over fifteen
So I do her in the butt like that
I hit it so quick, I made her butt-cheeks clap
Why wait around till she gets married
'Cause I'm ready as long as the neden's hairy
Tootsie-tootsie pumpkin pie, oops
Looks like you got nut in your eye
My fault, I didn't notice, you was still there
Now go and wash that shit out your hair, bitch
I want a girl not afraid to bone
Even if her momma's and pop's still home
And if her daddy suddenly walks in
He just might see me my nuts on his daughter's chin
Everybody in the hood says that you're easy
You look a little cracked out, a little sleasy
You're a basehead, baby, it ain't shit
I'm still down if you down for a lil' somethin', somethin'
A lil' somethin', somethin'
Hey baby, I heard you like to freak

I’m the type of scrub who gots mad hoes
Who hang out and trade tips and suggestions
You’re the type of scrub that only gots two, your hands
And both make you wear protection
I’m the type of scrub that has no boss
‘Cause I’m a self-made lord of the hustle
You’re the type of scrub who don’t work at all
You’re a sew-happy fraud; no one trusts ya
I’m the type of scrub with big-shot friends
Crooked cops, politicians, and more
You’re the type of scrub, ditched by your friends
Couldn’t stop, but probably shit your drawers
I’m the type of scrub who won’t sell out
25 years of winnin’ any way I wanna do shit
You’re the type of scrub who couldn’t sell out a free show
Of a capacity of two, you and who, bitch? Haha!

I’m the type of scrub who don’t turn the other cheek
Unless I’m winding back to deck ya
You’re the type of scrub to lick my spit off the floor
And walk off, whispering, “I don’t respect ya”

I mow my own path, blazing through sheep
You’re the type of scrub, a scoop follower, a poop swallower
If it’s the flavor of the week
I’m the type of scrub with two or three warrants
If I don’t like a rule, I break it
You’re the type of scrub doing twenty-three years to life
A crazy old lady rapist
I’m the type of scrub who like to fight back
Pull my gun out, you meet my nine
You’re the type of scrub who refuse to fight back
You say, “Blow my butt out; I’ll be fine.”

Shorty, want bubbly? Let it rip in the tub (ew)
You the type of motherfucker get a bitch nails done for a dub
Take the bitch out to eat and then when the check come, you’re like, “What?”
I’m the scrub with a blunt lip on the couch scratching my nuts
Parking lot, I got two whips, but your bitch pickin’ me up
Won’t quit hitting me up, I rang twice, then I said “what?”
You tell the bitch “hi."" I be like dick hicking me up (girl)
You shape-shifty as fuck, type of scrub nobody gon’ trust
I’m the type that might panhandle, but I got five on that blunt (yup)
Got two grand in my sock, homie, but that’s for the reup
All you got is your handout, and that face ‘bout to get punched
Say one word, and you’re lunch (bitch). It’s scrub gang on you punks
You step up to these dirty hands, and your punk ass get touched
Shot mud out of you duffs (bitch). Be crushed out of you punks

Mr. Rotten Treats,"Forgotten Freshness, Vols. 1 & 2",1995,"Um well J that was an interesting Halloween Story
Um anybody else have another
Halloween story they'd like to share with the class?
I have another one. Well you have just told your story J
So what bitch, you sit here every day and tell stories
I'll tell a story in this mutha fucka
See he doesn't want me to tell my story
Cuz he knows my story, it's about Mr. Rotten Treats
All your parents know my story too
They don't tell you about him though
Long ago they all killed Mr. Rotten Treats
They're scared that you'll talk about 'em, they're scared that
He'll come back from the dead, they're all scared
He'll cut your fucken ass
Welcome too, the other side
That's what they told me when I died
I was stabbed in the head
Look what ya done did
All the blood bled, one juggalo dead
It was a cold, dark, scary Halloween
So my neighbors and my people
They didn't really like me right?
So they came and burned down my world
Just because I like to murder their boys and girls
It was the Halloween I never meant to harm no one
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun
I see the monsters and the goblins I'm a killer to
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?
I come back from the other side
I come for the people that took away my life
Trick or treat bitch, my dead body speaks
You tricked me now it's only right
That you try my rotten treats
Trick or treat, trick or treat
Watch as the dead man walks the street (2x)
Mr. Rotten Treats got all the good shit
Over here boys and girls, I got balls freshly
Picked form Detroit's biggest nutsacks, I got
Milky bar with the delicious razor blade filling
I got fudge freshly packed from the worlds finest fudge packers
Must return to the other side
But not before I take these bitches on a murder ride
Murder go round the dead body clown
Put the treats in your mouth, and swish it around
Excuse me little boy, but is your daddy home?
Thank you sonny here's a little treat now run along
Hey buddy, you thought I was dead, man
You probably stuffed the fucken shank in my head
It was the Halloween I never meant to harm no one
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun
I see the monsters and the goblins I'm a killer to
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?
I send you to the other side
Your buddies and your neighbors can come along for the ride
Weak bitches, you thought that you had me beat
But this Halloween I'm comin back with my Rotten Treats
Trick or treat, trick or treat
Watch as the dead man walks the street (2x)
Mr. Rotten Treats runs this bitch, bitch, I got
Fried titty nipples, sweet acid drops, sweet
Chocolate covered nipple nuggets with the fresh creamy
Shit filling, ask about my bitch she loves my
Cookie dough nut dribbles
Trick or treat? (Trick)
Trick or treat? (Trick)
It was the Halloween I never meant to harm no one
I thought that you were supposed to murder it was all in fun
I seen the monsters and the goblins I'm a killer too
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?

Ride the Tempest,The Tempest,2007,"Dare to go for a spin on the world's most horrifically fabulous ride!
Behold the Tempest!  the fastest, highest, steepest, and tallest
Coaster-ride ever to exist on this or any other planet!

We fuckin rollin with no controllin, them bolts ain't holdin
Take you higher, rollin' on wires, till time expires
Swinging corners, some kids are goners, you hangin' on-ers
Duck them tunnels, they shrink like funnels...
Get your forehead pummeled
We upside down you, then 'round and 'round you
Your evil found you
Let's go faster, it's sheer disaster, while spinnin' backwards
Jagged edges, no kind of ledges, with broken wedges
It's the largest, fastest, steepest, deepest, tallest, all this, and more roller coaster

It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it
(come ride the Tempest)
You got that feelin' in you, so jump up, jump on it (jump on it)
It's something wicked for you so get on, get on it
(let's ride the Tempest)
We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it

Electrifyin' and now you climbin, feels like you flyin
The carts are shakin, slowly elevatin, sound like they breakin
Rickety, rackety, clickity, clack, up we go, you no look back
Some french guy had to look, froze up and fell out, he got so shook
So fuck him, them poles keep duckin, this cart you stuck in
Upward spiral, through the rings of fire, still climbing higher
Rackety, rickity, clackity, click, now you on the tip-top tipity
Tip of the largest, fastest, steepest, deepest, tallest, all this, and more roller coaster


Straight down, you fallin, you fallin
Straight down so fast your skin is crawlin
Straight down, you fallin, you fallin
Straight down so fast your skin is crawlin
You fallin so fast, you see your whole life flash
Your balls jump up your ass in a quick dash
You get whiplash, the shit fast on your bitch ass
And it don't stop till the shit crash

Hungry,Flip the Rat,2019,"Check me out. First off
My big brother is a chef I wanna thank, yo
He gave me the secret recipe for bankrolls
Cheese stacked kupac to the center, yo
And without cheese, fuck your whole dinner, ho
Now I’m old and hungry with a big belly
“Would you like cheese on the top of that?” Helly
And when I’m skinny, fuck you; my belly hangs
You can’t see it through my shirt, but it swangs
I’m a big, fat, cheddar-hungry, ten-ton hippo
Fuck that. Take it back. I said quadriple
For my snack, it’s a beast in the least. It’s that simple
I’m like a baby on a nip or a drunk on the 
To make bankrolls you need a lot of dough, and more cheese the better
And if your bitch offer selling neden, let her
Cake works. Cake is good. I got a big mouth
Throw ‘em in; that ain’t all the cakes you got. What? How ‘bout your friends?

I saw you (You and them fools)
Making cheesy bread
(Cheese and bread. Cheese and bread)
(I’m hungry for that cheese and bread)
You were buying jewels and cars
And that shit should be ours
(Cheese and bread. Cheese and bread)
(I’m hungry for that cheese and bread)

Dun dun dun dun! “Hey, it’s the cheese man!
He can eat blocks of cheese!” Damn fucking right, I can
I smell cheese. Everybody empty their pockets
Eyeball me again, boy, and I’ma sock it
Better give me cheddar, blow your dome for the provolone
Blue cheese, too, please. That’s my nachos, not yours
I jackin’ limburger (Mmm), stack of ten burgers
*Gulp* “Where’d they all go?” Fucking murder
Buttermilk bank rolls with the cheddar in the center
“Did you come to eat or serve?” Eat. “Do not enter.”
Unless you got dinner, it’s two shots in ya *gunshots*
And your bitch is at home with two cocks in her
Catch me waving two Dracos at the cheese factory
Like I’m hungry. Who got some snacks for me?
Mozzarella bankrolls. These ain’t blanks, hoes
Call your peeps, tell ‘em please get the cheese for the bankroll

I saw you (You and them fools)
Making cheesy bread
(Cheese and bread. Cheese and bread)
(I’m hungry for that cheese and bread)
You were buying jewels and cars
And that shit should be ours
(Cheese and bread. Cheese and bread)
(I’m hungry for that cheese and bread)

A-1, go get her on these ho niggas
My figure, first class on you  niggas
I heat the bread ‘til it’s toast on these broke bitches
I squeeze the lead ‘til you ghosts. Ain’t no jokes with us
Big Hoodoo, the Lex Luther, the super troopas
Big voodoo, the loop scooper with two shooters
The hit spitter, the pinch hitter, with Swiss skrilla
From seven milla, with drug dealas and real killas
Rock star, I’m popping  all over the globe
Cheddar chase and came up from the basement, all over the door
Check my credentials, my residential is detrimental
Of instrumentals, I’m monumental. It’s kind of simple
I’m fearless, like Fred the Fury got me at your temple
I’m serious, you’re dead. I hear my name come out your dental
I’m a hyena on the higher tier. Everybody dyin’ here
When I come back around for the lion share

I saw you (You and them fools)
Making cheesy bread
(Cheese and bread. Cheese and bread)
(I’m hungry for that cheese and bread)
You were buying jewels and cars
And that shit should be ours
(Cheese and bread. Cheese and bread)
(I’m hungry for that cheese and bread)

I saw you (I saw you) (You and them fools)
Making cheesy bread (Bread)
(Cheese and bread. Cheese and bread)

Dead Pumpkins,Forgotten Freshness,1991,"""J, do you have a Halloween story for the class?""
""Y-y-yeah, um, there was this boy, and he lived in his house
And, um, he went to bed one day, and then when he woke up, um
When he woke up, he was buried up to his head in the dirt
And, um, he couldn't move, and this man came walking along
But instead of the man helping him out, the man just started
Kicking him and kicking him in his face, over and over
And then he got the lawnmower, and then he.....""

Trick or treat, bon appetit
All the little kiddies running down my street
Gathering candy treats door to door
But they walk past mine, what for?
Probably 'cause the pumpkins on my porch are real
Real human heads carved out with steel
Cut out the eyes, man, it takes but a minute
Rip out the b-b-b-b-brains and put a candle in it
Maybe they leave 'cause I take 'em inside
Come and meet Mother, two years ago she died
Little boys laugh, 'cause they think it's just a dummy
But then the smell hits 'em, mmmmm, smells yummy
Open your bags and I'll give you my treat
Crusty yellow toes off a dead woman's feet
Take me by the hand, and I'll lead you downstairs
And that, little Jimmy, is where you'll spend the next seven years
Starving and weakening, chained to a wall
Staring at a roach, hoping it will crawl
Into your mouth for a tasty cuisine
Yes, my little friends, it's a Dead Pumpkins Halloween

""Aw, yeah! It's that special time again, boys and girls
So come to the pumpkin patch and bring your candy sacks so I can shit in it, you bitch!""

Well, I love all the children, but I can't fuck around
Don't come to my door dressed as a clown
'Cause you never know, I might take it the wrong way
'Cause I'm the real wicked juggalocoro Violent J
All year 'round, but I love my Halloween
You'll never get an apple or a purple jelly bean
Droplets of chocolate, a licorice snack
Instead you get a deep-fried French poodle nutsack
Looking out my door, I see no children in sight
Perhaps they're all dead, yesterday was Devil's Night
They burn down the city and they leave it crispy-charred
I light myself on fire, and I dance around my backyard
All the pretty girlies, I can see where you're at
Sitting on your window, I can turn into a bat
Watching you remove all your little clothesies for bed
I crash through the window and land on your head
Drinking the blood, blood is gone to the bone
And now I must leave, Mother's calling me home
Up to the moonlight, I'm gone from the scene
Peace to Detroit City and have a Dead Pumpkin Halloween

""Yeah, I'ma snatch your little candy bag
Only I'm gonna tie it around your mother fuckin' neck
And choke you with it Wicked Clown style, mother fucker!

Hey yo Violent J, whats up?!
It's Christmas, time for a slaughter
Maybe your wife, maybe your daughter
It's midnight, I land my sleigh
Make way for jolly St. J
Climb down the chimney, for the murder
Dressed as the fat man everyones heard of
Shimmy down, shimmy down, what the fuck?
Somebody help me, I'm stuck
Now what to do? I feel whack
I got stuck in a chimney stack
But I hack, and shimmer on down
Santa Claus Clown
Can't fuck around, now
Living room, shhh, I creep
Tippy toes cuz they asleep
I pulled out the axe and slid down the hall
I got a gift for all of ya'll
Whats that? I better hide quick
Oh fuck, it's the real St. Nick
And he musta been taken a shit
But regardless, I better move quick, now
So I jumped him, Santa's no joke
Fucked around got my damn neck broke
He's strapped, he shot, he didn't miss
(Gunshots and ho ho ho)
I had a red Christmas
""I'm dreaming of a dead Christmas
The kind you'll never have again
Cuz if you have a dead Christmas
That means your dead and thats the end""

Seasons greetings loser, yo 2 Dope kick it!
Jack Frost nibbles, ha! but fuck that
I ain't got a home so he nibbles on my nutsack
And my buttcrack, toes, and elbows
My nose is froze, fuck you hoes!
So I made a friend like me, a snow man
He was down with the clown like a pro man
Had a hat and eyes outta charcoal
And a pipe, we fill it with indo
Me and him sang songs in the snowflakes
He ate snowballs, I ate cornflakes
And we both would freeze our balls off
I was there every time his head falls off
I put it back on for him with a smile
He was my boy, made from a snow pile
Then the storm came, a blizzard
Snow, wind, ice, a blizzard
We pulled through we hid in an alley
The next day it was like sunny valley
He was meltin and I was just fine
He got pissed and pulled out a nine
""If I'm gonna die you should come with me
Cuz we're boys"" (gunshot) It hit me
Damn I'm dying, I'm dead he got his wish
And all I got was another red Christmas
""Silent night, violent fight
Now I'm dead, one to the head
Christmas this year seemed so whack""
Happy New Year bitch boy
Hey, I got a New Years resolution
For your chicken face mother
To kiss my motherfuckin' ass, Woo!
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Ask your fuckin' mommma bitch
The ICP don't play, hey
Wicked Clown, Wicked Clown
Bitches drop your drawers
Don't talk back just suck my sack
And fiddle with my balls

Shock,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me
Give me a lobotomy
(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me
Give me a lobotomy

I ran outside and tried to stop a Seville
But they just laughed and almost killed me
My face is bloody and my shoes are gone
Standing in traffic, what went wrong?
In my hand is an axe, weapon
Can't relax 'till I know what happened
How did I get to this location
Who the fuck am I chasing?
Or are they in persuit of me?
Either or, I choose to flee
Runnin' on the sidewalk, spazmatic
Shirt's all bloody, no, can't have it
Peel it off, I run inside
Somebody's house, I come to hide
Some kid playing his Xbox, SCREAM, and I'm still in shock

(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy
There's no escape from my own head, it's so fucked up
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy

I jumped the kid with his power cord, but he got away, oh lord
I ran upstairs behind the mirror
I'm looking for dope, it's clear
I found some klonopin and downed the rest, about 10
Back outside, fat and bloody
Running from or looking for somebody
It don't matter, my brain's shattered
Swinging my axe like ""hey batter!""
The sun beating on my face
I hear the police pick up my pace
Into a strip mall, CVS
Huntin' for dope, PVS
He seen me coming and shut the gate
I ain't got time to fucking wait
I'm in shock

(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy
There's no escape from my own head, it's so fucked up
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy

Out the back entrance I cut
Them klonopins are catching up
I tried to hop up over a wall
Backwards, back down I fall
I wanna pass out, but that can't happen
Keep running myself, I'm slapping
I'm getting dizzy, glass in the road
I stepped in it, it took its toll
I hopped the fence onto the grass
2 backyards, looking through the glass
People watching television
They be like ""Damn, Yes I'm wishing""
How I got here? Ain't got a clue
I laid on the lawn for a minute or 2
To catch my breath, just for a spell
Everything's fine, All is well...",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-shock-lyrics

I'd like to introduce our new student
Uhh, uh Willy Bubba, Willy is from Kentucky, uh, welcome Willy
I'll be your teacher, my name is Ms. Felmy

Well I flopped out of school but I still hang in the hall
So there I was, you'll never guess what I saw
Maybe a chicken, I thought it was a duck
But it was a redneck fuck, so I walked up
""Hey Willy Bubba, hubba-bubba-lubba
My name's Violent J, but my homies call me chicken plucker
I been down with the clown since day one, it's day two
I guess I got some plucking to do
In these parts, we tie you to the desk
And all line up and take blows to your chest 
Fists to your chin , kicks to your head 
Last year we killed a kid dead (HAHHH!! oh, my fault...)
Walked in the school, there's hay in the hallway
Leading to your locker, walk up 'n sock ya
Then bounce your head around the class room and act nutty
The teacher walks in and asked everybody

Who kicked Willy Bubba's ass? (I DID!)
Did you do it right here in the class? (SHO' DID!)
Did you punch him in the face, did you slap him in the mouth
Did you kick him in the forehead (YUP, YUP!)
Who kicked Willy Bubba's ass? (I DID!)
Did you do it right here in the class? (SHO' DID!)
Did you punch him in the face, did you slap him in the mouth
Did you kick him in the forehead (YUP, YUP!)

Willy Willy Bubba hubba lubba dubba dilly
Tell me why you talk so silly, bitch
You sound like you come from the land of the bigots
Jolly old Dickens, the land of the chickens
I guess you're in season, I'm packing me a .44
Barrels to your head and blow your face out your asshole
Pow, bitch! I'm Shaggy 2 Dope
I'm coming for your kin folk, you get your chin broke
And don't cry or run to the teach
She can't understand your redneck-ass speech
If she could, she wouldn't do a thang
'Cause she's my bitch and she loves to suck my wang
You in trouble, Bubba, you better run quick
You too slow, Willy, 'cause you a fat bitch
I caught up and got my hands all bloody

Who kicked Willy Bubba's ass? (I DID!)

Did you kick him in the forehead (YUP, YUP!)

Revenge,Flip the Rat,2019,"[Verse 1: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
I always get revenge, if down the road or right away (Facts!)
And once I finally do, don't think that they just got away (They didn’t!)
I hit your ass again, and then again; it never ends (Facts!)
Relax, I shun, and safe at last, them feelings ain't your friend (Skwo!)
You may even have never known the bonus ‘cause of me (Clown love!)
I don't need credit as long as fucked is how you be (For sure!)
We gon’ hit you again and again in the ER (True that!)
Hit you again up in the morgue, ‘cause wicked's what we are
Traumatize you, then surprise you
More and more, ‘til you realize you
Fucking with guys who pulverize you
And we have spies who do despise you
But that's a blast, to obliverize you
Analyze you, we in disguise, too
With only two tries, the chance arise
And meet your demise, we neutralize you
You nerdy pussy holes, you steal our shit, and you will learn (Skwo!)
My only concern is to be certain that you burn (For sure!)
I don't forgive or work it out. Work your mouth on my dick (Clown love!)
I bury you in Picker Forest, cross made out of sticks (Yeah!)

Never safe, you're always hunted
Never safe, revenge we want
No compromise, you're always hunted
Never safe, revenge is wanted
[Verse 2: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
I'll kill your fucking mama, send her nipples to your house (Heh heh!)
Commit a home invasion, slap a brick across your mouth (Eat it!)
Shoot your baby mama in the knee and snatch her purse (Skwo!)
Next time, it's much worse. You’ll catch her right up in a hearse (Aah!)
Steam roll over enemies, and we will never pay (Oh yeah!)
Wake you up at 47 off a beat from seventh grade (Tell ‘em!)
I’ll set a fucking car bomb underneath your driver's seat (For sure!)
I don’t care who in your family ends up all over the street
With that phony show, juffalos
Reap what you sow, dick you blow
You sold your soul to try to grow
But we all know it's just a money hole
Watched by a crow because they know
Your , your time is low
The Reaper show, and you roll
Off you go, in a coffin, ho!
You bitches feed off us like babies sucking on a tit (For sure!)
You, rooftop cross the street, I'll put a bullet in your hip (Macc!)
Guarded by pussies who guard your booty with their dick (Legit!)
I'ma blow your house up, scream “clown love” and hit the switch (Clown love!)

Never safe, you’re always hunted
Never safe, revenge we want
No compromise, you're always hunted
Never safe, revenge is wanted

You thought we were just cool with you ho'ing us the fuck out?
Go see the nice dream man and have yourself a cocksicle, bitch!
‘Cause we comin' back for ya!
And you never know when Red Fred gonna pop out the box
And bust you out your socks, bitch!

Never safe, revenge we want

He'd probably suck my dick for a penny
That's fucking nasty, what kinda bitch does he get?
The kind that smells like shit with a scabbed lip
Pushing all that trash in his shopping cart
Must've smoked himself into a retard
No shoes, thick-ass calloused-up toes
Frozen boogers all up under his whisky nose
The motherfucker's ass is probably molded shut
Bet he's got tadpoles living on his butt
I fucking don't understand these people
No kinda class, somebody needs to beat they ass
I wanna tell him, ""Get the fuck off my block!""
I wanna beat his face in with a rock!
He ain't good for shit, but bringing our property down
Dragging his funky ass around
He's starving, sporting a pair of Troop sweats
Hands dried and cracked up like the Sahara
Wanting everyone's affection

I know she fucks on me, who needs proof
She probably kisses me with dick hairs on her tooth
I bet she fucks people in my own bed
He wears my slippers while she's giving him head
Look what I do, I get away with it
What the fuck makes me think that she ain't never did it
Last time I beat her ass wasn't shit
Fat lips ain't nothing, this time I'm breaking something
Shes gonna learn not to gimme any hassle
I'm the king, I make the money, I work at White Castle!
I'm the one who failed in life
I'm the one who takes it out on my wife
She don't cheat, who am I trying to fool
I should've done this to myself long ago

Raise when I walk in the room, me and God are a tag team
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

You die, he gets life, she pays, he's free

Guess My Religion,"Smothered, Covered & Chunked",2012,"Why's everybody always playing with God? 
Ain't that a bitch?
The church house getting rich
And I'm looking like dookie on a stick
As soon as I walked in, they couldn't wait
To pass that fat ass collection plate
And before I could stick my dollar in
The ushers were making rounds again
To get here I had to catch a ride
And these motherfuckers talking about 20 percent in tithes
Telling me its for the homeless and those with no where to go
But at night, the church doors close
The poor get a cup of soup if they lucky
While the pastor peeps a flat screen and a mink snuggie
He says he talks to God on Facebook
The congregation cheats the whole place crooks
I don't give a fuck about your blessings
You want to know my religion, why don't you guess it?

Why's everybody always playing with God? 
I gotta talk about these snakes behind the pulpit
Cause they full of that bullshit
It's no wonder they think they large
When these motherfucking members treat they ass like God
They pulled a man outta wheelchair
He back flipped across the stage
Into the back to get paid
Took his act to the next town more money made
It ain't even real wine, it's Kool-Aid
Half the choir hit the weed that morning
They can't help it, church is fucking boring
I'm sick and tired of my homies getting killed
And the pastor's saying that its God's Will
Fuck the enemy is what I said
I won't turn the other cheek bitch
I'll bust your head
Put your hands on me, and shit gets scary
I'mma put your ass in a cemetery
There's so much about religion I find odd
There's no middleman between me and my God
I don't give a fuck about your blessings
You wanna know my religion, why don't you guess it?

Just because you got a collar and big book
Don't mean that you ain't a sick crook
So many ways to be misled and get paid
Who are you to tell me when I'm saved
Real believers would practice what they preach
And praise the Lord more than one day out the week
Another reason people ain't repenting
The church house be having some fine ass women in it
And that's why the preacher can't spread the word of the Lord
Cause he be looking just as hard
It's the blind trying to lead the blind
And you wonder why people are so behind
Pedophiles, you don't want the truth
He's jacking off the other side of the confession booth
All this shit is way out of hand
All these motherfuckers doing the hook behind the choir stand
You getting mad cause I'm questioning your merit
But bitch, dammit, if the shoe fit, wear it
I don't give a fuck about your blessings
You want to know my religion, why don't you guess it?
Why's everybody always playing with God?

Why is everyone always playing with God?

Yeah, some of you motherfuckers phony as hell
Jumping up and down, catching the Holy Ghost
Spinning all up in the air and shit
When you fall on me, I'm going to knock you smooth out
I don't give a damn, I ain't even playing
Fake fucks, coming to church on Sunday with a motherfucking hangover and
Shit
Still drunk, selling weed in the pews
I see you bitch
Why is everyone always playing with God?

Why is everyone always playing with God?

Spiking the holy water

I see you hoes turning tricks in the back
You bitches

Drunk ass preacher, nothing but a
(Why is everyone always playing with God?)
Trying to grab a little boys ass cheeks
Keep your dick out the choir you little perv
(Why is everyone always playing with God?)
Fucking old ass pedophile
I seen the preachers car parked outside the Sunrise Health Spa
There goes your donation money
Hookers and crack
You fucking bitches
All these poor ass old people don't know any better
Give all their money to that snake on the stage
Just sitting there in that pink Cadillac
Classic bo-hand
And a big ass chinchilla all the way down to his ankle bones

I'll have the fat bearded lady sitting on your face (Hahahahaha)
Bitch boy bitchy you might get hurt
Dead Carnival clowns putting in w-w-w-work
You think your the shit 'cause you think you got the upper hand
But why don't you come and meet my boy, the Strong Man
And he'll grab you by the head and squeeze until it pops
And shake your motherfucking neck until your head flops
'Cause I'm running with the beyond, you motherfucks
I'll make a voodoo doll of ya, and flick your nuts (Hahahahaha)
See I was born to cause a killer carny ruckus
I came up and then- stop it I told ya motherfuckers
I leave a screw driver sticking half way out your dome
The worst part about is, I'm not alone

Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a chair
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a ch-ch-chair

I'm a nerd, and all the bitches call me a nerdy geek
And they would love to stick their thumbtacks on my seat
And they would throw their split balls at that class freak
And everyone of them bitches died in their sleep
'Cause I fuck around with books and my self was born
Crystal balls, black magic and jokers cards
And that night just when I'm feelin lonely
The clowns come to my bed and juggle for me
So don't fuck with the Shaggs 'cause I cast spells
And don't come crying to me when your tongue swells
I'm hanging with freak shows, like Crab Boy, Snake Boy
Flipper and Scab Boy
And a man who can eat his own fucking face
And then shit it out and screw it back into place
If you don't think so you can suck my bone
'Cause I tried telling ya man, I'm not alone

Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a chair
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust you in your motherfucking head with a ch-ch-chair
Jokers and freaks, jokers and freaks
Well I like to hang with Tall Jess and Jump Steady
Nate The Mack , Violent J and Uncle Freddy
Chucky, motherfucking yes, 'cause got my respect
But I really like to hang with old Rubber Neck
A freak show from the circus that you don't know
And I fucked the Lion Lady in the knitting hole
And sometime she do an acrobatic flip on my nuts
And it feels so good!
So tell your boys that they all a bunch of chump suckers
I walk around your neighborhood chokin' motherfuckers
I used to be a fool but now the joker's got juice
Shit changed when I started hanging out with Zeus
And if you take me out you know I'm coming back again
With my homeboys Jack and the Cannon Man
He come flying out the barrel doing Mach 9
With his fist coming straight for your spine
Never fuck with the Shaggs 'cause it's always tickin
I'll throw a curse and turn your ass into a chicken
So when you see me by my lonely in the ghetto zone
Motherfucker better realize, I'm not alone
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but you picked the wrong fight

Got the shiny SV on my chest, what up
Violent J the clown, I'm goofy for a second
But then you see my Cellist, I'm on top of her naked
You know my status, I'm Juggalatus, and we the baddest
Here to severe your melon, it's wicked shit that we sellin'
We off the track now, give your bitch ass a bitch slap now
Nobody never steppin' down, we bout to enter second round

Runnin' backyards up a wall, Shaggy 2 Dope in this motherfucker
You talkin' to your boy, the silence is for suckers
So I'm out there, throughout the year I'm right here
Don't stare like a bitch, bitch buy me a beer
Nobody wicked like me, I do this terrifically
And my motherfuckin pimp slap will knock down a tree
So clown love bitch, I've seen it tatted on titties
We forever on tour, clown love in your cities
Rollin' over..

It's show time, blow your mind

I got 3 bodies in my trunk, I'm blowin red lights
And bet I'm blowin heads off before I've read any rights
Baby I'm outlaw, painted up and packin' the bombs
I stomp cracks in the streets and sound fire alarms
Bitch run for your life, we keep it wicked and scary
And we welcome to our world anything that you bury
I throw meteors and fireballs through brick walls
And got a 3 foot dick for all you chick jaws

Walkin' through the sun, bout to strangle someone
Maybe it's a custom, gotta get it done
I live like that, spirits talk to me like that
I'm lost in the Ouija board, ain't never comin' back
Ooh ooh drink some liqour, I don't care
When it comes to paranormals, get up outta here
They try to speak to me, I say don't bother
I'm doin' somethin else, I'm rollin' over

Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
So much time, so much time
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
It's show time, blow your mind

So much time, so much time
Rollin' Over

It's show time, blow your mind

ICP in this bitch
Ya know what I'm saying?
All you bitches, man
You come over to my house
And I'ma take ya upstairs
And I'ma stick you with my wang
Ya know what I'm saying?

(I stuck her with my wang) She hit me in the balls
I grabbed her by her neck, and I bounced her off the walls
She said it was an accident and then apologized
But I still took my elbow and blackened both her eyes
(I stuck her with my wang) Bitchy bitchy ho
I'd like to stick a Faygo bottle in her neden hole
I twist ya and turn ya, just to shake it up
Pop off the lid, now it's shooting out her butt
(I stuck her with my wang) She grabbed me by my nuggets
She told me that she loved me, then commenced on to suck it
I tried to hold it back, but I nutted in her ear
And hen it dried up, the bitch couldn't hear

I stuck her with my wang
(He stuck her with his wang, y'all)
I stuck her with my wang
(He stuck her with his wang, then he hit the door)

 My mega ding-a-ling
After I hit it, my boys will do the same
Bitches come in flocks when the carnival's in town
Suckin' on my nuts, trying to be down (Fuck no)
(I stuck her with my wang) The freaky little slut
She wanted me to stick my finger in and out her butt
I asked the bitch why, she gave no reply
I went psycholistic, and I stuck it in her eye
(I stuck her with my wang) I hit it slow motion
I had the Ringmaster brew me up a love potion
I put it on her neden, I know this sounds insane
Her coochie started whistlin' and singin' out my name
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy, stick me with your wang!

I stuck her with my wang
(He stuck her with his wang, y'all)
I stuck her with my wang
(He said he stuck her with his wang, then he hit the door)
I stuck her with my wang
(He stuck her with his wang, y'all)
I stuck her with my wang
(He stuck her with his wang, then he hit the door)

(I stuck her with my wang) I hit it chicken style
I hit it up in Meijer's in the home improvement aisle
She called me Bob Vila when I stuck it in the place
I tied her legs behind her head and kicked her in the face
(I stuck her with my wang) I took some Elmer's glue
I slapped it on her titties, and I stuck her to the roof
And when I came back, I opened up the door
Her titties were so long they was draggin' on the floor
(I stuck her with my wang) A little two on one
I told her, ""Call a friend over, we can have some fun""
I heard her knock knock, I'm finna get some stank
I opened up the door. ""Hi, I'm Frank""

I kicked him in his ass
(He kicked him in his ass, y'all)
I kicked him in his ass
(He kicked him in his ass then we fucked him up)
I stuck her with my wang

I kicked him in his ass
(He kicked him in his ass then we fucked him up)

I’ll Keep My Hatchet,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"We're keeping tables loaded with pistols, military, hunting, laser-optics, and shooting rifles
Sunday morning, the first 50 paying adults will receive a free stainless lock-blade pocketknife
Don't forget to register for the free custom-built AR-15 being given away by the Bridge Town Gun Shop

Keep your AR-15
Trash knife kept clean
Cross hair laser beam on your ruger machine
Keep your 9 milli Luger with that hot ass red dot
I'll keep my hatchet
Swing-and-go chop!

Keep that Colt pipe back
With that big Desert Eagle
That weaponry dagger, carve that ass up-reload
9mili Mac10, that musket rifle that pop!
And I'll keep my hatchet
Swing-and-go chop!

That double burst
12 gauge sawed-off
Murder in the first
M60, .44 Magnum, or Glock
I'll keep my hatchet

Swiss army knife, Bowie, machette don't stop!

Confessions,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 3",2001,"They say it's hard to live down a checkered past. A man with a criminal record often has a tough time going straight, and when he decides to shift over to what the world calls ""virtuous living,"" often report, ""They just won't forget, they won't let me forget."" There's one story we haven't told  now. It's the story of what happened to a man who made the switch from the things of God to the things of the world

Father (hey), I confess for doing it
I had a brain (yes), but life had to ruin it (gone)
Screw in it (thoughts), twist it, infect it (kill)
Dissect it (spit), don't respect it (blood)
When you put me in a cage full of animals (creepy)
Savages (killers), and cold-blooded cannibals (monsters)
I can't help but become what's around me ()
Tried to run, but they found me, surround me (shit)
Then they choke ya (squeeze), and provoke ya (tease)
Try to smoke ya, turn you into a joker (he he he)
I tried to rip it off (wait), but its all I know (it's)
The only thing I ever knew (me), so what to do?
Look at you (never), a bigot till your growin' old (evil)
Your growin' mold, with a soul that's freezin' cold (so?)
So I confess, but even if I'm all wrong
I'll be down with the clown till I'm dead and gone

Yes, I confess, but I really could care less
Father, I tried, but they wasn't on my side
Yes, I confess, but I really could care less
Father, I tried, but they wasn't on my side

I confess, this lady had a purse (old), so I took it (snatch)
I took it home, opened it up, and shook it (look)
She had papers (comb), lipstick and nail polish (shit)
Credit cards and about twenty-seven dollars (change)
I bought a fifth (liquor), drank it and laid there (stoned)
It seemed like I could see the purse everywhere (bone)
On the light post (look), by this mail box (look)
I tried to run from it (where?), I ran a couple blocks (look!)
But there it was, on the side walk, waitin' for me (shit!)
It tried to lure me to it (stop!), I had to fuckin' do it (no!)
I picked it up (), and stuck my fuckin' hand in it (Agh)
It was full of rats (Ah!), and they fuckin' bit it off (Why?)
Father I confess, I'm a criminal ()
But my worlds too subliminal, around me
Look at them, all the wicked masses
That's why I'm down with the clown till I'm ashes

Yes, I confess, but I really could care less
Father, I tried, but they wasn't on my side
Yes, I confess, but I really could care less
Father, I tried, but they wasn't on my side

It's like a circus, a wicked carnival
Everybody's got a ticket, they're lookin'
For the freaks, to point and gawk at
Look at yourself, the joke's on you, Jack

Yes, I confess, but I really could care less
(Down with the clown for life!)
Father, I tried, but they wasn't on my side
(I confess to ya!)
Yes, I confess, but I really could care less
(Down with the clown for life!)
Father, I tried, but they wasn't on my side
(Accept my confession!)
Yes, I confess, but I really could care less
(I'm down with the clown for life! A life!)
Father, I tried, but they wasn't on my side
(I confess to ya!)
Yes, I confess, but I really could care less

Dear ICP,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 4",2005,"""Dear ICP
I was wondering if you could help me. Uh, I've been involved in a relationship for several years now, and uh, I found out that this girl had an affair with someone else, right? So, I wanna stay with the girl, you know, I feel real hurt over this
Um, what should I do?""

Smack that bitch right across the lips
Cause she ain't nothin but a filthy bitch
Beat that freak in the head with a cinder block
Blackin' her eyes, you lunatic-tock
Cause I really don't gives a fuck
Except when I'm tryin' to put her in the buck
Shit, I ain't said nothin'
Somebody left they load in her bellybutton
How you gonna say you love that
When her breath be smellin' like somebody's nut sack
I oughta smack you in your fucking head
Should've shot that bitch in the back with nothin' said
But you nothin' but a pogo (Pogo)
Tryin' to fall in love but you can't love a yo-yo
She'll run and fuck then come right back
Then I greet her at the door with a smack
Cause I'm psycho swingin'
Till you hit her singin'

Loved my woman, had another man
So I slapped her in the dome with a frying pan

""Dear ICP
I recently became involved with someone who I care very much about. He feels we should be having sex now, but I don't know if I'm quite ready for that stage in our relationship. I don't wanna lose him, but I don't know if I'm ready to give myself up yet
What do you think?""

I think you's a dumb-ass bitch
In a minute he ain't even gonna want the shit
You need to shut your stuck-up mouth
Cause your pussy ain't worth the walk to your house
I'm tired of the dookie lies (Bitch)
You know your dream about his ugly-ass face between your thighs
'Cause you think it feels nice
All he wants to do is smack your ass once or twice
And make your butt crack jiggle
And stick his little ding-a-ling in the middle
I suppose you can wait for a weddin'
But ain't nothin' wrong with givin' up a little neden
But if you really wanna hold on to the coochie
At least let him stick his nuts in your booty
Or work something else out
Like, maybe let him chill with his nuts in your mouth
But if not, well thats alright
'Cause he'll just fuck some other bitch tonight, yo

""2 Dope is the mother fuckin' shit
You know what I'm sayin?
Bitches be lining up to get a glimpse of his nuts
And stick 'em in their butts
But only the nastiest, ugliest, Southwest sewer skanks
Be gettin to do the nasty with the mother fuckin' Shaggy""

""Dear ICP
Yeah, I have a problem. I would like to know if you could let me in on some of your deepest, darkest secrets on how to enjoy longer-lasting sex. I would be much obliged. I'd really like to know.""

Roll a pound of chocolate Thai
And smoke that shit until you die
Piggity puffin on the sess
T-takin' off her dress
Slap her titties up and down
Do they bounce? (Yes!)
Good! Get some Red Bull
And pour it in her bootie hole
Did she yell ""What the fuck?"" (Yes!)
You did it right
So turn the bitch over and punch her in the eye
Some bitches like this, but I don't know why
But some will hit you back; you must watch out for that
Cause if you with a gangsta bitch, you ain't gettin jack (Aww)
How to keep your nut? Shh... I have a secret
But if I'm gonna tell you, you've got to promise to keep it
Get you some Faygo and pour it in a bowl
And let your nuts soak in it (What?) Just kiddin' (Oh)
That is all, your lesson for today
If you can't get it right, you's a punk-ass bitch!

""Wicked Clowns, mother fucker!
Violent J, 2 Dope, you know what I'm sayin?
Check it, mother fuck it, Nate the Mack, Lay Lo
Fuck off, woo hoo! We in the mother fucker!
Wicked Clown, Wicked clown, woo hoo
Get the fuck off me, bitch, 'cause I'm in the fucking haugh""

""Um, I wanna talk to Violent J
I have a project
In which I think he might be interested in
Perhaps, performing on
It's a good, good, song
Good, wholesome country tune
And I think he could be perfect for it
Um, please have him give me a call
I am a Midwest producer in the local area
And I think this project would be very good for him
And his exposure
To the country community
So at my earliest convenience
Please have him give me a call

So there you are, you're sittin' there, just kinda chillin'
A richie boy, you look a little bit like Dylan
The 90210 bitch with the funny hair
So I'm gonna change a few things around, here and there
Start with your eyes, I pluck 'em both out your head
And pull your balls out your sack and stick 'em there instead
Then I snap off your toes and stick 'em in your nose
And pull the hair out your head until your skull shows
You're almost ready, gotta fix you for the show tonight
But your lips, man, to me, they just don't look right
They could be a little fatter, even more
So fuckin' fat that your lip is draggin' on the floor
Tie your tongue into a knot and stretch it out
And tack a sign on it, tellin' what you're all about
Set you up, 'cuz now you're ready, so open up the door
'Cuz at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show

Carnival thrills
Carnival chills
Carnival excites you
Carnival kills
(Ahh, ooh, ahh, ohh)
Another freak show for the jugga-lugga-lo

So there you are, come on in, chickie, wow! Ain't you a pretty?
I think I'll start with the silicone that's in your titty
I'll pull it out and put it in your forehead and cheek
So now, you look like the elephant bitch freak
Don't try to run, chickie-poo, I'm just gettin' started
I'll beat your head in with a brick until you're half-retarded
Remember that ugly girl you laughed at at the prom?
Don't try to laugh now, bitch, you look like her mom
You came to do the starin', but it's you they're starin' at
I'll stuff you full of chili-cheese dogs to make you fat
Then I'll stretch your fuckin' lips and stick 'em in your ear
So all that evil shit you talk, only you can hear
I shave you bald, and glue your titty on the top
And then I spit on your nipple until you drop
Hey! Almost ready? Jumpsteady, open the door
'Cuz at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show

Everybody wanna beep, Why?
Why? Everytime I'm broke and I sell rock, I wind up in a cell block, Why?
Why? Everytime I shoot somebody in the face, pigs give chase, Why?
Why? Everytime I drink a little gasoline, I shit my spleen, Why?
Why? When I try to fly like a birdy
I wind up on a gurney, dead tell me why

Won't you tell me why? Someone tell me why?
Jesus tell me why? I must find out why

Why? Everytime I swallow a flathead nail, my neck feels stale, Why?
Why? Everytime I contact dark spirits
They wanna break my mirrors, Why?

""I admit I can't explain it"" - 7X w/ various dj scratches

Why? Everytime I raise my arms in celebration, player hation, Why?
Why? Just cause I'm dead, decayed, and passed
You give me no ass, Why?
Why? Everytime I chew on thumbtacks, I get blood on my snacks, Why?
Why? Everytime an angel wanna kiss me, it always seems to miss me, Why?
Why? Why does Shangri La seem so far away, you better leave today. It don't matter why

NO MATTER WHY! (repeated over the chorus)",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-questions-lyrics
Dreams of Grandeur,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"I was out drinking all night long
Riding home when something went gong
There she was, a prostitute
She look like a druggy but God, she cute
Standing out front a seedy motel
I'm blew out drunk like ""What the hell?""
And she was young, like twenty-one
I asked her pimp if she could have some fun
How much to keep her with me 'til dawn?
400 duckets, and it was on
He posted up outside the room
Guarding his treasure, a certified goon
There we were inside her spot
Five minutes later she was smoking a rock
And I was shocked, I just stared
But something burning inside me cared
We talked all night, I passed on fucking
But that glass dick she kept sucking
She was gone, but she was sweet
She was clean but had funky feet
She said her pimp only feeds her rocks
And pays her shit, she can't clean her socks
Together they travel from town to town
He gets paid while she gets down
Behind her life of agonizing
She had a beauty that was hypnotizing
I thought, ""What if I made her mine?
Send her to rehab on my dime?""
Cleaned her up, washed her hair
All she needs is someone to care
I could help her escape these streets so mean
And take her home where the sheets are clean
Help her escape that evil devil
And upgrade her to life on my level
Asked was she down, she couldn't believe it
And started to cry, ""How do we achieve it?""
I told her, ""Just escape your room
And be out front exactly at noon
And I'll swoop on by, and scoop you up
Look for me in my big black truck""
She was with it, we had a plan
I said goodbye and I kissed her hand
I was determined when I got home to be there at noon
And we'd be gone
I laid my head down with dreams of grandeur
(Was she there?) I'll never know the answer
I overslept and woke up at 3
Sobered up like, ""What's wrong with me?""
I don't want no crackhead fucking sleeze
As my girlfriend, shit, please
I laughed it off and went back to bed
She can have that pimp instead

What the fuck was I thinking?
I don't want no hooker
I was up all night drinking
I thought she was a looker
My delusions of grandeur
Made me think I could have her
Made me think I could save her
Damn I was way to faded
Woah, oh, oh
Ah, damn
I was way too faded off
Woah",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-dreams-of-grandeur-lyrics
It,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 3",2001,"Good schools. The learning process
I had no education when I was a kid I have no explanation for them things I
Did. I pulled the legs off a dog and rolled 'em down a hill I put poop in a
Hot-dog bun and ate it for the thrill. I tried to impress this girl who lived
On my block I said ""Look"" and I bashed my homies face in with a rock. HuHu and
Then the people came and took me away They made me eat pills like 25 everyday
Everything is slowing slow like in slow motion My penis won't get hard by the
Time it does I ain't horny no more. That's it enough I jumped out the window
12th floor I put a sock on my penis and I robbed the jewelery store ( stick 'em
Up) the police might chase me but I won't get caught. If I do it ain't my
Fault. Something takes me over
HOOK: Something's talking in my head. I can't help thinking it hates me
Something's telling me I'm dead. It's going to cripple and rape me.(2x)
My brain has a brain of it's own. My body ain't got nothing to do with it, so
Leave it alone. Don't punish me for something I did unless I did what I'm doing
And I ain't doing nothing, dig it. Heroin is no part of my diet but hey, I
Mean, what the fuck, right I'll try it. (give me a balloon) I don't care about
My face anymore, I talk and eat with my feet and drag my face on the floor
Them crows are watching me(watching me) they're watching me my every step. Them
Crows are watching me (watching me) they're watching me. I creeped and crept

Like whipped cream and lemon che-che-cherry pie
I need a woman , to let me hit it
In the bushes raw at the herpe clinic
I need a bitch, who like to fight
And get her nose punched in like every night

I need a bitch in a cheap hotel
So I don't know which one to blame for the smell
I need a bitch, that doesn't care
She like to finger f**k her booty in the mirror
Cherry pie, my cherry pie
Cherry pie with lemon jell-o cherry pie
I need a bitch hurricanranna

It's validation to murk you, your situation's wrecked
Cremation and damnation within the Black Blizzard

Lost at the Carnival,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"Surprise, surprise
Shucky Ducky quack quack
The dark carnival is back
All ages welcome
The carnival is free
To those who qualify
Step right up, come on in
And have a ball

You havin fun, walkin witcha mom and pops
At the carnival, you get on the cyclops
As it spins, it whips you up, something terrifying
You're scared to death, two seconds from cryin'
(It's finally over, you run back to where your parents were
But they're missing, everything's a blur
You walk into the crowd, nothin makes cute faces
You hear buzzes and bells and laughs from mental cases)
Are they in the fun house? You walk into it
And right away you're thinking ""why did I do it?""
You're in the tilted room, the maze of mirrors
Scary faces in the black light, drumming up fears
(You headed up the stairs, and down the slide
Thank God you're finally back outside
You check the food lines, river world, highs and lows
It's really happenin', you're lost at the carnival)

Where to run? (Lost at the Carnival)
Where to go? (Lost at the Carnival)
Where to turn? (Lost at the Carnival)
You don't know (Lost at the Carnival)
Check the rides (Lost at the Carnival)
Check the games (Lost at the Carnival)
You're alone (Lost at the Carnival)
Lost in a maze (Lost at the Carnival)
Lost at the Carnival, you're lost at the carn-

You get on the ferris wheel, a view from above
Oh, you didn't try the river of love?
You hop in a boat slowly floating through the darkness
Evil cupids swooping down on a harness
(You wanna cry, but you try to hold it in, man
Is that daddy shooting BB's at the tin cans?
Run up to him, tap him on the shoulders
Some drunk, would've been about 30 years older)
""Come on! Don't bother me! i'm tryna win, kid!""
You didn't look in Queen Lasheva's pyramid
Once again, there you are lost in a maze
Staring at King Tut, in his eyes you gaze
(Suddenly he blinks and stares right back upon you
Running off, was it real, or was it supposed to do that?
Don't ask Carnies for help, they got levers to pull
It's really happenin', you're lost at the Carnival)

Where to run? (Lost at the Carnival)
Where to go? (Lost at the Carnival)
Where to turn? (Lost at the Carnival)
You don't know (Lost at the Carnival)
Check the rides (Lost at the Carnival)
Check the games (Lost at the Carnival)
You're alone (Lost at the Carnival)
Lost in a maze (Lost at the Carnival)
Lost at the Carnival, you're lost at the carn-

You hear laughter, you smell the cotton candy cookin'
Goin' through the haunted mansion
Now looking for your parents
Clown faces popin' out the dark
You're thinking ""it's impossible to check the whole park""
(Just when you've had about all you can take
You check the midway games, and that was a mistake)
""Hey kid, come over here, it's only a buck!""
""Hey little boy, win a big prize, come try yer luck!""
Only one place left, the house of amusement
It looks friendly, it's gotta be where they went
Inside you find your father, his eyes glow red
He's on display in the wall of the hall of death!
(There's your mother with fangs, chained to a post
You're not even alive, you realize you're a ghost
This is your personal hell, and now you know
That you're doomed to forever be lost at the Carnival!)

Santa Killas,A Carnival Christmas,1994,"""Hey, it's Christmas. It's Christmas in Detroit, we got a special
Christmas treat. We got Mike Clark on this shit, he's finna rap
And we got Fink from the eastside. Oh, and we also got 2 Dope.""

It's the holiday season, snow on the ground
Candy canes, cookies sprinkle the town
Everyone's jolly, happy, and merry
The dead sing carols in the cemetery
I went up to the mall to meet a Santa Claus
""Why you wanna meet the Santa Claus?""
Just because he's a star and I wanna get his autograph
""Did you meet the fat bastard?""
You don't know the half
So I'm waitin in the line with my pad and pen
I finally got up to the bitch and he had a grin
He said that he watches me and I'm a disgrace
So I reach for the nine and shot him in his spine
All the kiddies runnin, screamin and cryin
Santa ain't breathin, I think that he's dying
He's trying to move so I boot him in his grill
Ahh, bitch should've known about the Santa Claus killa
Chorus:
Santa Claus I'm comin, I'm comin, I'm comin
The Santa Claus Killaz
(4x)

I'm a Santa Claus killa
Bitch what the fuck you know about?
You knowin nothin
So fuck turkey and stuffing!
I drink a straight forty
Fuck that shitty eggnog
Cause I'm a wicked clown down straight freak dog
I gets paid, I'm picking up the G shit
And Santa Claus ain't never brought me shit
The fat slop doesn't buy my bread and milk
So don't come around bitch and get your cap peeled
I'm Mike Clark
I'm creeping through Clark Park
In a 1981 Sky Lark
And it's dusted, dented and rusted
Don't look or get your lips busted
Santa Claus won't bring me a BM
So I'm gonna choke that bitch when I see him
MC Detroit Big Wheeler
But on Christmas Eve I'm a Santa Claus killa
""Oh, I'm so lonely around Christmas, I miss Santa Claus
He won't come to my house, I wonder if he's scared
But that's okay, because if he won't come to me, I'll come to him
Santa I'm coming to see you. Merry Christmas.""

It's Christmas Eve
Another time to deceive
Got another trick up my sleeve
He won't leave
I just wait tick tock ticky
Somebody tell me where the fuck is Saint Nickie
Nick, you prick, you north pole hick
Bitch ass sap, what the fuck is that? (huh)
Sounds like Rudolph and the whole clique
(It's time for some down with the clown G shit)
I hear the fat bitch in the chimney
Spark up the matches
Fire catches
And I burnt that MOTHAFUCKA UP
""Ho, ho.. wha.. wha.. what the fuck!""
Cook his ass with a crackling sound
Watch as the ash comes juggling down
I smoke them bones and I get much illa
Fink the Eastside G
The Santa Claus killa
Chorus

One last murder, I gets deadly
Sit back children, check the medley
It's cold out, I could give a fuck less
Cause I'm waitin on a bitch in a red dress
A fat bitch with a big white beard
Strapped with a big lead pipe I'm geared
I hear bells, jing-a-ling-ding, jing-ting-ling-ding-a-ling
That's the sound, the dead man hear
The dead man hear when death is near
I'm like Damn! Take my pipe and say fuck it
Whip and lug it
Straight to the nugget
Out cold in a flash, a dash
Then I pushed his ass off the ROOF and straight jacked the sleigh ha!
The ghetto's payday from the Santa Claus killa

I Could Never,Flip the Rat,2019,"It’s gotta be tough, man. Being God?
Being God, man? That shit is hard, I imagine
The responsibility? To be God?
Get the fuck outta here 

First of all, imagine never being surprised
Picture that for a second
Nothing unexpected. No “Holy fuck, that’s my favorite record”
No lucky breaks, scoring the rarest shit in your collection
Fucking millions of hotties with no need for protection
You’re Mr. Know-it-all. You fucking own them all
You can let go and fall. You fucking float, is all
The finest hoes, you saw. Vaginas, you rode ‘em all
Line up and explode them all, pins to a bowling ball
But it must be hella boring. No challenge ain’t rewarding
If winning was a given, son, what you’ve won: unimportant
If success if automatic, where’s the magic when you own it?
There’s no sport when you resort to all sorts of shorts with no opponent
I sorta feel sorry for God. It’s probably odd throwing lighting rods
At people, pissed, cursing, like they’re the better person for the job
Without a shoulder to lean on. No one to hold ya, ‘cause they peons
Nowhere to go, ‘cause you’re way too big for this floating boulder that we on
Here for eons, fighting traitors, demons, devils, and hatin’
It seems when trouble’s our way in, they beam up, double the prayin’
We’re talking sticky notes galore of who needs what and what for
Cure the sick, feed the poor, then they’re like, “thanks, but we need more”
Don’t put my baby in that whore. Protect my son; he’s gone to war
Help my dad; his back is sore. Keeping track is tricky sure, but
Thirty mill’ a day or more, plus watching us and keeping score
That earthquake in Ecuador, was it Him? We don’t know for sure

Too much power (Too much pressure)
Much too holy (No one’s fresher)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
He’s too needed (Too elevated)
Too forgiving (No one’s greater)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
I could never be God (I could never be God)

Why you tripping? Everything is in his plan
Some shit, don’t no one understand
How do we know that’s true? ‘Cause back in 1422, Pakistan
He told us. It’s written in the scriptures. Not in words, pictures
Right there it is, in the pyramids, in the shadows when the sun eclipses
And they say He’s everywhere, even on the court when you’re hoopin’
But if you try passing Him the ball, of course, you’re fucking stupid
Is He here with me right now, even in the booth thing?
Is He sitting on your lap when you’re pooping? Maybe
He was probably bored out of his mind before he made the planet
Just fucking floating in the dark, probably couldn’t stand it
Then he planned it, kind of His own ant farm. It’s what He deserves
He can observe us, swerve us, and serve us, unnerve us, curving his nerves
Perfect, servants, if we’re jerks, He can hurt us
Insert us, have some fun, and when we’re done, murk us
On purpose, His purpose, to work us, dodge serpents
Revert us to the bling kingdom’s circus, it’s worth this when curtains
You’ve heard this in churches
Or, for eternity:
You burnin’ with vermin. It hurts, and you squirmin’
Whew, Forever’s a Hell of a time to be churnin’
Concerned, you thought Heaven awaits, but saw the reddest of gates
Now you stressin’ with intestines infected with snakes
He gave you a heart and a brain and everything you need to beat him
But there you are, slithering and centipeding. Shame

Too much power (Too much pressure)
Much too holy (No one’s fresher)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
He’s too needed (Too elevated)
Too forgiving (No one’s greater)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
I could never be God (I could never be God)

God don’t got no posse, or pose for paparazzi
He don’t leave after parties in fleets of Bugattis
He’s so damn introverted, if He spoke, no one heard it
It’s absurd how cool this fool be schoolin’ His service
When He first got the gig, though, was He still just a kid?
Who the fuck hired Him, though? Someone hidden in a pyramid?
All His responsibilities and insane abilities
He’ll blow the wind and spill the seas all while still chillin’ with me
He’s killing me, you feelin’ me? What’s the real deal? start tellin’ me
But still, this shit seem, I feel His love instilled in me
Thrillin’ me, it be ill with that skill in His will
The whole deal, but on the real, I don’t fill the build, if you will
Too many pills, so hey, I guess I gotta say: Nope!
Ha ha ha! Yo, maybe go try the Pope
If I did, though, I would most definitely throw a lightning bolt
At them mother fucking preachers who grope little kids

Too much power (Too much pressure)
Much too holy (No one’s fresher)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
He’s too needed (Too elevated)
Too forgiving (No one’s greater)
I could never be God (I could never be God)
I could never be God (I could never)

The Midway,The Marvelous Missing Link: Found,2015,"Ladies and gentlemen, bring your dollar bills
Ones, fives, tens and twenties, and more
Bring 'em this way to the Dark Carnival’s midway games
Win a giant stuffed animal
The prize is yours and they money is ours
At the fun and challenging midway games

Hey there, fellow, win a prize for your girlfriend’s heart
(How?) Pop a balloon with a dart
It’s impossible to miss (I popped all three)
We got a big winner! Give him an NSYNC sticker
(Huh? What about them big stuffed animal toys?)
You gotta pop a thousand for one of them boys
Then he spent 'til he won and he saw it was made in Guatamalamala
It won't last him 'til tomorrow
Step over here, son, win a fat prize
Look how easy it is, wipe your eyes
All you gotta do is toss a ring on a bottle top
So you try it again, and you won’t stop
It look so fucking easy at first
That's why your mom keeps digging in her purse
She spent her last seventy five bucks, but you not hit
Because you tried so hard, you get a goldfish

Big winners (Woo!) On the midway track
Shitty prizes (Boo!) Yes, but you’ll be back
Big winners (Woo!) On the midway track
Shitty prizes (Boo!) Yes, but you’ll be back

Hit up one of our many on site ATMs
And come play a few of our stale and cheap
Low budget, high profitable midway games

Excuse me sir, do you like to shoot hoop?
It's a simple concept throw, the ball through the loop
And look at these prizes, it's worth a try
And plus, you look like an athletic guy
(Fair enough, give me three shots) Good luck!
One brick, two brick, three brick (He sucks)
Meanwhile, the ball’s getting bigger then the hoop
And we’re getting paid 'cause people are stupid
Shoot three rubber duckies off the track
And you can win anything in the back
(Whoa! Check it out, dude, they got a Drake poster!)
(I know, and I want it! Let's go for it)
Little did they know, only two ducks fall back
The rest of 'em are welded to the track
Good shooting! You definitely came close, sir
One more and you would've had that sweet poster

Big winners (Woo!) On the midway track
Shitty prizes (Boo!) Yes, but you’ll be back
Big winners (Woo!) On the midway track
Shitty prizes (Boo!) Yes, but you’ll be back

While you are enjoying our midway games
Don’t worry about our pill popping junkie-ass meth head carnies
Cheating you out of your hard-earned money

This game is the easiest, give it a try
You know you want to, don't just walk by
All you gotta do is knock three cups over
With a bean bag, easy as a three leaf clover
So you try it again and again, you keep playing
'Cause you'd have no idea what the cups are weighing
Ain't no fucking way a bean bag is gonna tip these down
Welcome to the carnival, clown
Hey Dad, win a prize for your son
This game has prizes for everyone
Come try the high bell, swing the big mallet
Come try the dunk tank, see if you can nail it
You can't leave with nothing, try it again
Where'd you win that prize? Run back and tell a friend
Balls, darts, bee bees, and water games
We got many, many ways to ensure that you’re all all lames
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

Radio Stars,Bizzar,2000,"Occasionally, the overwhelming temptation to reach
The pinnacle of the pop music genre, will reduce even
The most deplorable examples of the underground music scene
To attempt to change their so-called artistic endeavours, in a
Vain attempt to appeal to the public at large
Behold, the metamorphosis:
Uh, fuck platinum, platinum just ain't enough
We need more money, more house and cars and stuff
I'm sick of Juggalos, I want them other hoes
I want them shitty hoes, you get with radio and videos
We'll do whatever it takes to get some air play
We'll make that bounce shit, triple our sales and pay
Yeah, come on Shaggy. What? Follow my lead. Let's go
It's time we change our shit up to get what we need. Come on
Uh, radio play!
Yo! Yo! Come on and ride me, ride me
Pull! Pull!! Come on and hide me, hide me
Cat black(?) I'm gonna grow(?) one, gold one
Club Cat(?) You want them old ones, old ones
Black, black, ???
Love me, I'm on the radio, radio
Cut, cut, We gonna throw it away, throw it away
Give up, Give us the radio play, radio play
What? Hey! What? What? What? Hey! What? What? What? Hey!
What? Hey! What? What? What? Hey! What? What? What? Hey!

The pathetic attempts never cease
The moronic musical onslaught contiues to insult
The intelligence of the savvy consumer
How much more can an audience be asked to endure?
Didn't work, ah fuck, what happened?
They always told us that we sucked at rapping
Well I don't know how to play a guitar
I'll play the skin flute to be a radio star
I'm sick of keeping it real, and underground
I want the ten millions fans sellout radio sound
Even though we'll be played next summer
Show me a radio dick, and I'll show you a hummer
Here we go, oh my god
Joey fell in love with a college girl
She had a backpack and a pony tail
She said her name was Lisa but I do not know
She drinks disco lemonade and cherry Jell-O
I can put my Buddy Holly glasses on
I can even sing one of these faggot songs
I can play in checkered pants and never smile
Whatever's cool for your radio (?)
Tommy fell in love with a college...
The boorish, bumbling buffoons are baffled in their journey
Through the music business. Each sonnet is more ridiculous
Than the last. Their strides towards musical success are
Little more than a stumble into complete failure
That was bullshit. What the fuck? You think of something!
I'm sitting here trying to write hits, you're doing nothing
You wrote the crunk shit, but did it work? No
It flopped on its ass. At least I tried though
Alright, ain't no need to be fighting with each other
We need to start talking about relationships and lovers. Why?
Can you sing? No. Niether can I
If we're gonna be radio stars, we atleast gotta try
? Remix, uh, remix, Clownboy, uh, feel me
Touch me, Clownboy, remix, uh
Girl, I gotta let you know, on radio
I wanna lick you from head to toe
Girl, your perfume, it's smelling so sweet
I wanna make love, between the sheets
Girl, play my song, when I'm on the phone long
I'm a radio man, and I know that I can't sing, yes I can
Give me one more chance, and I'll make you dance
Girl, we make radio songs, for radio fans, we can't go wrong (4x)

"Murder, Murder, Murder",Psychopathics from Outer Space,2000,"First I plan my escape
Nothin on papes and live the scene without a trace
I'm lookin dead in her face
But she dont see me Im unoticed
I head straight to her window for better focus
Hokus Pokus!
I see the door serve light, I let myself in
Head full of room with plans of murder and mayhem
There she go, there that bitch lay
Livin on this earth to my dismay
TIME TO PAY!
Palms are sweaty im bout to vomit
I grabbed the knife outta my belt and jab it in her stomach
Again and again, now she's screamin like I care
But I could give a fuck less before she dies I grab her by her blood
Soaked hair
And tell her shits gonna be allright on my end
Im glad it happened this way, back in my daughters life again
Ain't it a shame?
That it came to this
Life goes on except for one less bitch
Ain't it trip?

Murder Murder Murder. You never heard of it
?Bomb in the doors.? Bodies in the hurst
Now your lifes goin because we wanted you to die
Time to kiss your ass goodbye!
Dont ask why

It was Tuesday December 24, 97
Time on the clock 1:11
Thinkin bout sendin somebody to heaven
On the crossroads of faith of a soul lies in my hands
I suppose, know im wearin dark clothes
Parked on the sidestreet
Peepin out the scenary
Make sure ain't nobody seein me
As I move to the trunk of the stolen car
Up to the back door with the crowbar
So far the plans fullproof
All from the phone booth
Got the message machine
Nobody's on the scene
Kick in the backdoor, 1:34
Lookin for the family dog, thor!
Kicked him in jaw with the workboots
Knocked a couple teeth loose
Smacked him in the mouth with my empty duce duce
Then I smile!
Break his neck and watch him piss on kitchen tile
Never liked him since the day he try to play me foul
Tried to bite me, stab a stake knife in his head
So much for that mans best friend
Know Im all up in the place in the bedroom masterbatin
Cumin on the sheets and pillow cases
Fuck that bitch, shes just a kunt
And her mother's nothin but a slut
Can't wait to seal her mouth shut
2:30 she returns home from work
Nice blouse, tight shirt
Business attire
For this hooker for hire
Throw the keys on the table said baby are you home
Didn't expect Bones
Were alone
And shes reachin for the telephone, to call the police
Strangled with the cord, now deceased
In a process of a suffication
Being fucked up for demonstration
Let em till I know im many faces
Now shes dead in the closet
Hangin out with all the winter clothes
In the struggle suffered a bloody nose
But im straight though
As I move to the bathroom to wash my hands
Its all part of the plan
Dont think you understand, SEE!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-murder-murder-murder-lyrics

On your path the bridge is broken
You in Hell, no air, you're chokin'
Where's your link? It's lost, you're fallin'
All the witche's weight you're haulin'
You're so close, yet so far away
Running down an endless hallway
One link from your true salvation
But without it, pure damnation

It's missin' (It's missin')
It's gone (It's gone)
Can't find it (Can't find it)
And my life is wrong
Because it's missin' (It's missin')

My life, my life is wrong

Linkless, you fall into Hell's grip
Lost in darkness, life's a short trip
Search and seek it, or you will sink
You must believe, try hard, just think
You're in hell's hole, stuck in deep shit

Look and find it, don't stop your quest

Lost in a world of pitch black terror
Scared to be alone, afraid of the mirror
All I wanna do is find what's mine
Complete my link, then let off shine
Some of us spend year after year
On the quest for what's really right there
It's up to you, are you ready to make the change
Or remain deranged
The Devil is breathin' down your neck
Claws over your eyes, ridin' piggyback
And he's gonna do everything he can
To make sure that you're his man
Find your freedom, find your link
To find it, all you gotta do is think
Because as long as it's missing from your heart
You in the dark

And straight split ya punk ass into chunks, punk chunks!
And my pitbulls love punk chunks!

I hang a left real slowly, you could pass me walkin'
It's 3:07 a.m. and my ass be stalkin'
My task, to find him; my headlights are blindin'
I'm sipping on Red Pop; my gears are grindin'
He overheard a conversation, now he's takin' the stand
But he's mistaken, uh uh, must be Satan shakin' his hand
'Cause I'ma throw this big axe, and pin him dead to the door
Leave him hanging in his boots, three inches from the floor

Run away bitch, don't say shit
I'm over here digging your grave in my basement
In my cellar under the drill is where I place them
After I catch 'em and then I kill 'em 'cause I'm dangerous
See I'm a villain on a roll
My body count deeper than it ever was before
Got him running down the road, and you know I'm finna explode
Cause I'm a killer with a blood thirst I could never let go!

Don't try and break away 'cause when I catch ya, then ya done
I let the hollows do the chasing, I ain't tryna run!
My niggas ratchet and I'm ill like I got Ebola
Swingin' my hatchet like a real psychopathic soldier
Bitch niggas everywhere so you know we always workin'
Killers for hire when we catch you then it's close curtains

I'm searching through the east side, I search through the west
And I give a shit less if any eggs in your nest
I don't feel sorry, you brought this on yourself, run for that wealth
And now your head's going on my shelf because I'm stealth
As I'm huntin' you down, you should just try to relax
Because I'm all over your tracks. Get ready for the stabs and hacks

Bury you at midnight underneath the Big Dipper

I can't have it in my Grand National, stab it to the metal
If I have to I'll bring back his head; I have a debt to settle

Piggy pie - 71022,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Piggie Pie""
""Come and get it! Woo!
We got some fresh fills for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch!
So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!""

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine
I rode into town with my axe in my holster
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face
It blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (hehe)
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head
Since we out west, I had a little fun
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium

Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (no), I might choose an axe (yes)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck
He walked in the room, and everybody rose
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet
Now I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up
Old-ass man, I let him get away
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die
So I ragged on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds


The last little piggy, his house is made of gold
He lives in a mansion on his own private road
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate
Cause this little piggy, must definitely fry
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel
People in my city, they fighting for they meals
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it
So I'm a take his money stack and stuff his face with it
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate
Cause I need...",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-piggy-pie-71022-lyrics
Shugston Brooks 1959-2004 (Outtake),Mike E. Clark’s Extra Pop! Emporium,2012,"Look up to ya!
""This here is the story of an unfortunate piece of shit
By the name of Shugston Brooks
Born 1959, died 2004
Over some bullshit he heard from a friend""

I've lived the good life, though I've beat my wife for years
She don't listen to the man, I simply bring her to tears
See I believe in keeping order, in front of my daughters
And their little brother, shit I put the boots to they mother
After I calm down, I might apologize
Put some ice on her eyes and we think up some lies
To tell the rest, cover up the bruise on her breast
Then she do me up a plate of hot food on my chest, yes
Often my drinkin', leads me to overthinkin'
Screaming in her face, breath liquorly stinkin'
This time though, I beat her ass something ferocious
A friend told me something left me feeling explosive
He said he thought he'd seen her at Bennigan's with another
She cried, ""I told you three times, I had lunch with my brother!""
I wasn't sure, plus I'm buzzing, so I dealt a skull fracture
And for the first time she called the police, I got captured!

""I don't believe it, she actually called the cops
I got booked, sentenced, all of that
After fifteen years of our love, she called 'em
She's going down for this, she's going down hard!""

A thirty day bid ruined my life up in the pen'
I got fired, plus I have to face my family and friends
Where to begin, I met a thug in jail named Ben
And for just under a grand, he put a gun in my hand
Thunk up a plan, she will definitely die for doin' this
My whole family betrayed me, how could they ruin this?
I can't live with the shame, all the pain of 'how could he?'
I'm thinking murder suicide, take us both out bloody
They freed me and I fleed for her job up town
Tried to shoot through the glass, they seen me and screamed ""Get down!""
She got away but I tried, now it's time for me to end
Ran about a block, cocked it, put it under my chin
I sqozed it, neck frozen, stiff, click, damn!
My nine gun, brand new but the shit got jammed
Pandemonium, desperate sweat sting in my eyes
All because I heard somebody singing me lies, I said I...

I heard it from a friend...
""Damn, I wish I never heard that man
I tried to kill her and then I tried to kill myself
I failed at both!
Now I'm stuck out here on the streets with this gun
People tripping out, I'm tripping out""

There's a mad gunman in the city, big news spreads quick
People step aside, they see it in my eyeballs, I'm sick
I heard a cops' radio, spun around to react
Looking at him like, ""I'll blow your fucking guts out your back, Jack!
Back off me!"" Set down his coffee with ease
And slowly pulled his weapon out and calmly asked me to freeze
We stand off, I back around the corner, I'm bookin'
Within seconds the perimeter heated up and it's cookin'
I'm not an athlete, on top of that I got bad feet
So I snatched up a hostage in a sitting mad suite
Kissed her soft young face, pressed the gat to her cheek
Whispered in her ear, ""I'm sorry dear, I'm having a bad week!""
Forty-five long minutes passed, nerves was tweakin'
The negotiator pleaded, no I wasn't speakin'
They finally ordered the marksman, carry through with the solution
It all started with some verbal pollution, because I...

Heard it from a friend who-o-o
Heard it from a friend who-o-o
Heard it from another he'd been messing around
(A friend told me something left me feeling explosive)

Don't always believe what you hear
People love to tell you bad news
They love it!

Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street
55, 65 bodies at least
I hang with the stiffs 'til the break of dawn
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn
Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven
Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin;
Tastes like chicken finger lickin' deep fried
I ate a dead body, but don't tell, I lied
I just ate my first dead body last week
Still gots a finger nail caught in my teeth
Before you start yelling and cursin' my name
Remember something's wrong with my brain, insane
Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall
I'm sliding and I'm bouncing off shit like a hockey puck
And my mother's like ""What the fuck?!""
He said I was born of an alien race
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand
I'm just a dead body man

We got bodies, dead bodies!

We got somebodies, we got nobodies
(Tell me, have you ever seen a dead body man?)
Bodies, bodies, bodies, whoo!

Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van
All the little kiddies love the dead body man
I drive through my neighborhood ringing my bell
Some people run 'cause they don't like the smell
Others line up just as quick as they can
To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man
It's all good, if you can stand the funk, but uh
Heh, Just don't look in the trunk
I drive down Central kickin' the bass
Chillin with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head
'Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead
Of a ho you can't trust, always diggin' a nut
A dead body bitch learn to keep her mouth shut
Riding in the back is my dead body crew
Only they can never think of nothin' to do
If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand
I'm just the dead body man

(Dead bodies, dead bodies, dead bodies, dead bodies)
We also collect dead bodies so, if you know any dead people

Maybe I don't even like you, but I gotta front cause you're a record label guy (mother fucker!)
What if I dragged you by the hair, into the street, and beat your ass, and put a boot up in your eye (Puh! Bitch!)
Maybe I would rather fuck a Missy Elliot before a Tony... ""Braxton""
Myabe I would rather fuck a Macy Grey before a Janet... ""Jackson""
Maybe I don't have no self esteem so I like to pick on everybody else
Maybe when I was a boy, underneath my shirt I had bruises and welts ""Oh"" (It's ok)
Maybe I was hungry, bottom barrel poor, and my mom was always sick
Maybe I'm lying, I'm just tryna find an excuse to be a dick, I'm a dick - dick
Maybe I'm upset that you left me, I'll hang myself right about your bed ""You should try suicide""
From the ceiling fan, so I'll be swingin' when you walk I, I might kick you in the head (Stook!)
Maybe I got seven therapists, I been committed, but my manager he got me free (Double A ya'll)
18 Pills a day, I get so dizzy and high, sometimes I can't even see, (I gotta sit down)

Flamethrower,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn

Don't ask us where we got it we made it ourselves
Directions are online but you better be stealth
We drove out to the boonies. No one in sight
We found an old barn in the dead of the night
I opened the trunk I can smell the gasoline
Gripped it in my hands yeah this bad boy is mean
Aimed it at the barn lift the tip and pull the switch
The flame shot all over it and burned down that bitch
The dark of the night was suddenly bright light
I felt the heat blast on my face my skin felt tight
We quickly put it back in the trunk and then jet-ed
This motherfucker worked perfectly
Now we headed down south
To see what kinda shit we can pull
If we get pulled over shit they gotta go
Don't want nothing stopping us from completing our tour
With one instrument the motherfucking flamethrower

Gasoline (Make sure you got)
Gasoline (Make sure you got)
Gasoline (Make sure you got)
Gasoline (Make sure you got)
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker (Burn!)
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker (Burn!)

It was a long drive I could have fell asleep at the wheel
But I'm rolling on adrenaline this shit is for real
We did our research well and we picked out our spots
We know who were cooking when we spit out the hots
The first is a racist biker gang called ""The Rebels""
They bout to have funerals but no need for shovels
Cause we gonna cremate these fools bones to ashes
Rolled in the club house of flash the gases
Then we walk backward and jumped in our ride
As black smoke pillowed into the sky
Many of them ran out still engulfed in flames
We peeled off bumping that Reindeer Games
We hit the freeway I was still in a trance
That was so much fun I almost pissed my pants
Don't want nothing stopping us from completing our tour
With one instrument the motherfucking flamethrower

Gasoline (Make sure you got)
Gasoline (Make sure you got)
Gasoline (Make sure you got)
Gasoline (Make sure you got)
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker (Burn!)
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker (Burn!)

We headed through South Carolina a triple K rally
I didn't think they had these anymore but sadly they do
So we might as well cook the last of em'
The town hall bout to turn into an oven
We walked in the back door into the main room
Seen all the white hoods and kaboom
We quickly saw that they uniforms are flammable
Torched every one of them then we had to go
We was out with the quickness straight to West Virginia
A racist judge and police force, yeah, we getting ya
Two and a half days now without sleep
We pulled into town slowly on the creep
We parked the car and started walking in. We heard ""Freeze!""
We were spotted by the cops, I flipped the switch and squeezed
As we got shot we burned them alive
Our mission was completed, though we didn't survive

Gasoline (Make sure you got)
Gasoline (Make sure you got)

Our Hero,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"""As Doctor Griffin informed you earlier, television won't be allowed until 8 PM tonight
Dinner will be served in forty-five minutes, tonight is goulash, corn, cookies and Kool-Aid
""Ooh, Kool-Aid cookies! ""
We begin our story inside the state mental institution, where our hero was admitted
He's only got four months of treatment left
We join him now while he franticly tries to reach his girlfriend Rebecca

I been callin', she ain't pickin' up the phone
It's been two weeks now she ain't been home
I hang on the end and just let it ring
It suddenly picked up and I heard some things
Sound like fuckin', everything shook
They somehow fucked the phone off the hook
I can hear my bitch, ""Push it in my ass! Oh Rick!
Take it out fast! ""I'll be out in four months, free to go
But that's too long to let this grow
I'm out the window, I scaled the roof
Dodgin' search lights and Doctors suits
Through the yard quick over the fence
Fuckin' razor wire ripped my pants
Into the river, up the overpass
Rebecca, I'm a kill yo ass!

Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go, Clown! Go, Clown!
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! And all the other patients said
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go, Clown! Go, Clown!
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go! Go! Go! Go!

We join our hero, still in his patient pajamas
Hiding outside of Rebecca's house in the bushes
He plans to kill her, but he hasn't had any sex himself in over three years

I looked through the window, there's Rebecca
Standin' there talkin' to that fuckin' pecka
He's about to leave, he slaps her ass, out the front door, he walks right past me
I coulda killed him, but then I couldn't
He was just gettin' some neden, who wouldn't?
She's the bitch slut who sold me dry; I walked right in, arms open wide
""Rebecca? I'm out four months early!
What up with some of that beer and squirmy?
""We fucked on the couch, she said ""Ouch!""
I dug my nuts in her neden pouch
She smiled, and said she's glad I'm home, and could I excuse her to use the phone?
She was quick to wanna warn Rick the dick but couldn't, 'cause her throat got slit!

Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go, Clown! Go, Clown!
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! And all the other patients said
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go, Clown! Go, Clown!
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Returning from the store, Rebecca's lover is pulling up in the driveway
Our hero is inside fixing himself a ham and bologna sandwich over her dead body
Dodging the headlights, he moves quickly

Oh fuck! Ricks back with a pack of rubbers! I'm in the kitchen all in the cupboards
I low crawl quickly on my hands and knees, I locked the dead bolt, but he had keys
I took a deep breath behind the door, coulda killed him again but I spared him once more
He was scratchin' a lotto ticket, the whole time my blade was out, ready to stick it
I was out the front before he found her dead; I ran my ass off and stole the moped
All the way back to the overpass, in through the river, across the grass
I cleared the yard but this time it was hard, that fuckin' barb wire almost left me scarred
In through the window, back in bed, in time for breakfast and morning meds

Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go, Clown! Go, Clown!
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! And all my locked up homies said
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go, Clown! Go, Clown!
Go Shaggz! Go Shaggy clown! Go! Go! Go! Go!

So there you have it, our hero is safe and sound, back in his room
Sporting flip flops and a hospital gown with his ass hanging out
As luck would have it, Rick the dick was arrested and convicted for Rebecca's murder, and sent to death row
Living proof that fucking with a killer's bitch can fuck everybody up in the long run
Don't do it man, keep your dumb dick in your pants. You're better off, beating off
Especially fuckin' with my bitch
Fuck around, and they'll find bullet holes in your forehead",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-our-hero-lyrics
Hum Drum Boogie,The Tempest,2007,"Oh goody! 

She surprises me, sometimes she hums on my balls
And I can see the world right through her bedroom walls
She has a jaw like a pelican's beak is deep
Humming me right to sleep, my favorite freak
I can rearrange the patterns of the stars in the sky
I can fly with the seagulls on the beach with the tide
Cause she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air
And if I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls

Come on put it on me bitch
Hit me with the humdrum boogie
That thing, oh goodie
Come on put it on me bitch
Right now, right now boogie
That thing, my balls
Come on put it on me bitch
Hit me with the humdrum boogie
That thing, oh goodie
Come on put it on me bitch

I see my life flash before me
I hear all my favorite song at one time
(when she blow me) right before I actually go blind
I'm running back and forth though the door of (in and out of) my mind
(when she blow me) my favortie freak is so fine
To have her hum in performance, the show is enormous
Only two fans in attendance, these two in my pants
(my balls) she's my favortie, she's got my standing applause
Humming me into harmony, right through my balls
Come on put it on me bitch
Hit me with the humdrum boggie
That thing, oh goodie
Come on put it on me bitch
Right now, right now
Boogie, that thing, my balls
Come on put it on me bitch
Right now, right now
Boogie, that thing, my balls
Undo my belt, put down my drawers
Kiss my dick and hum my balls
Undo my belt, put down my drawers
Kiss my dick and hum my balls
And she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air
If I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls
Come on put it on me bitch
Hit me with the humdrum boogie
That thing, oh goodie
Come on put it on me bitch
Right now, right now

Someone’s Gonna Die,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"I remember as a young buck, tryin' to get a grip in the southwest
Everyday I'm coming in with my mouth bust
Cause I fought back, I never hold out
I'm still a man even with my chin blown out
I held my ground, the city didn't get to me
But when I came home daddy put his foot to me
I lay awake, praying that that the motherfucker dies
I see his fist then the pain in my mother's eyes
Tell me lies, they did when I was only ten
They got me loony toony, I'm drinking boony gin
And once again, the city gave another test
I wasn't there for my brother now he laid to rest
To the chest, a bullet got the best of him
They caught his killer, I'm going for the rest of em'
When they found, gun em' down, wicked clown, wicked sound
POP POP
The murder goes round and round, I wonder will it ever cease
Fuck the police, they tried to rape my niece
But at least she's OK, they never caught her
I spend my nights in the gutter drinking sewer water
I'm not alone there's others in my territory
We all share the same story
A horror story, and its gory
I join the gang, I'm riding high
So if you try to take my pride then someone's gonna die

Someone's gonna die cause it has to be
So many people live life dastardly
If you lookin' for the answer don't be askin' me
I either blast him or he blastin' me

Back in the city, there's only two kind of love
Clown love and the love for the up above
I fell in love with a bitch, she ho'd me
I should've listened to the carnies when they told me
Women are the devil, they pollute your mind
They take control with their hole, and then they roll
Its getting old, I'm grabbing every bitch I find
They try to play me, I punch em' in the lower spine
I'm on my mind, I'm steady trying to catch a grip, don't wanna slip
The ghettos like a sinking ship
I'm going under, I wonder if i'm alone
I see my sadness drawn on with me in the ghetto zone
I show respect to the cruise, and with the lose
You might get shot up in the skull stepping on my shoes
My shoes are tracks, they're nothing but $1.50
Just wanna murder anybody trying to get with me
I need my mother I miss her
I reminisce, I'm thinking about every Friday night, she'd bring us chips
I'm watching chips
She'd let us stay awake late, that shit was great
But now its all about hate
Them days are gone
I belong to another life, another time
When different shit is on my mind
Shit like murder, death, and graveyards, joker's cards, and how someone's gonna die",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-someones-gonna-die-lyrics
Put it down,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Good Schools
The learning process
I had no education when I was a kid
I have no explination for them things that I did
I pulled the legs off a dog and rolled them down a hill
I put poop in a hotdog bun and ate it for the thrill
I tried to impress this girl that lived on my block
I said look, and bashed my homies face in with a rock
Then other people came and took me away
They made me eat pills, like 25 everyday
Everything is slow, like in slow motion
My penis won’t get hard
By the time it does I ain’t horny no more
That’s it, enough I jump out the window
12th floor
I put a sock on my penis and robbed a jewelry store
The police might chase me, but I won’t get caught
If I do it ain’t my fault, something takes me over
Somethings talking in my head
I can’t help thinking it hates me
Somethings telling me I’m dead
It’s going to cripple and rape me
Somethings talking in my head
I can’t help thinking it hates me
Somethings telling me I’m dead
It’s going to cripple and rape me
My brain, has a brain of it’s own
My body ain’t got nothing to do with it
So leave it alone
Don’t punish me for something I did
Unless I did what i’m doing, and I ain’t doing nothing dig it
Herion is no part of my diet
But hey, I mean what the fuck right i’ll try it
Give me a ballon
I don’t care about my face anymore
I talk and eat with my feat and drag my face on the floor
Them crows are wathing me
There watching me (my every step)
Them crows are watching me
There watching me (I creeped and crept)
Fungus spreds soft green and fuzzy
Fuzzy wasn’t a fuzzy bear was he fuzzy
I hate, whoop, wait a minute
Don’t move, god there’s something on your neck
Be still
CHOP!
Hahahahahhhaaa
Somethings talking in my head
I can’t help thinking it hates me
Somethings telling me i’m dead
It’s going to cripple and rape me
Somethings talking in my head
I can’t help thinking it hates me
Somethings telling me i’m dead
It’s going to cripple and rape me
That dog is scaring me
That dog is talking to me
That dog is scaring me
That dog is talking to me
Im sexy
A preying mantis is neon green ya’ll
And it’s head is so fucking small
How can it’s tiny brain be so bright
*Pwup**Kikh**Alllright*
If I punch you in the face it don’t mean nothing
I mean I don’t want you getting mad or something
Just relax
? my buts exposed
If I keep my eyes closed
Something takes over
Somethings talking in my head
I can’t help thinking it hates me
Somethings telling me i’m dead
It’s going to cripple and rape me
Somethings talking in my head
I can’t help thinking it hates me
Somethings telling me i’m dead
It’s going to cripple and rape me
Somethings talking in my head
I can’t help thinking it hates me

I'm Violent J, Papa Killjoy, I can't be fixed
I'm a crooked ass clown with some filthy tricks
I kill hot bitches, out their butt I grow weed plants
So every time I hit the blunt, it's like I'm hitting that ass

And I'm Shaggy, throwing heads in the air by the hair
I bounce them off my heals while people cough they meals
I kick heads like soccer balls and do tricks with them
I get hotter than a globetrotter, twirling and spinning

I sick with it with a sword, I can balance and stand on it
Killed many men, one swing in the end
I'm so quick you won't see shit but the guy's eyes wiggling
And me in the Bruce Lee stance giggling

I rob liquor stores at night when the workers are tired
I run up in that bitch swinging chainsaws on fire
And I can balance on a ball while juggling all your limbs

While rest of you is chained up in a chair watching him
Under the big top

We have so many tricks to show you (Come down)
So many freak shows to go to (Come down)
So many eyeballs to throw
Your soul you're quick to drop
Under the big top
This wicked shit we flow to (Come down)
So many dead souls we go through (Come down)
Inside Hell's Pit they throw you
Let the fire get to know you

Violent J is a man that can end your life
And then wear your slippers and fuck your wife
You get a pie in the face, a fucking pie in the face
Then you get cut up and sent to your momma in a suitcase

Bitch I'm Shaggy clear outta my squares
I ride a bike backwards in my underwears
I tell human stories to ghosts and I dead the awake
Plus I'm trapped in the other side of the mirror I think

Twenty five chairs stacked up, I'm on the top
Fucking balancing on my head, I'm about to drop
And I'm holding up a bear on my foot that juggaling
All six in the mix, will this be the end?

This will the end of my dick all up in another bitches ass
Wicked clowns will make the wicked shit last
And I kick a dick's ass trying to stop the shit
Icepick to your temple than pop your shit
Under the Big Top


I'm Violent J's a juggla, pillow faced smuggla
You recognize my voice? I'm in a ski mask mugging ya
I can walk on stilts 900 feet high
And than drop a dart down straight into your eye

Well I'm Shaggy Shaggs, I went from rags to rags
And I've received many meals out your garbage bags
I can do backflips all the way up a wall
Swinging an axe, that was the last thing that you saw

I can slit your throat from across the room
Throwing a Joker's Card under the light of the moon
And then I hook my feet onto your swinging ceiling fan
With two swords and yell for everybody else to come in

You can split me in the middle and saw straight down
You have two one legged halves of me jumping around
If you cut them in half, you have four of us fuckers
My limbs all crawling and attacking like brothers

Amber Alert,20th Anniversary Hallowicked Collection,2013,"A missing eight year old girl
This is a child abduction alert regarding the following child
An amber alert as police are searching
Officers are searching for the man they think kidnapped -
The daughter that police are looking for right now
Child abduction emergency
Well this is a dangerous situation right now
We continue to follow breaking news out of Albuquerque -
Where police are trying to find a little girl
No spottings in the metro at this time
We have just received this important -
Announcement regarding the abduction of a child
As the hunt continues for a little girl who has been missing for almost two days
Why does god let 'em cry...
How can evil be so mean...
We share this planet with monsters way beyond wretched
Slice em up dissect 'em, serpents for intestines
These glitches walk among us, spawn from Satan's bowels
So black as they blood their hearts corroded and foul
They make demons look like fairies, a fear beyond the scary
They make phantoms look like phonies, the sickness that they carry
To discuss it is forbidden, may your tongue be bitten
And evil so unthinkable in children's blood it's written
So cruel it's nothing cool to the wicked it's the fools
May they burn in fire pools for demolishing the rules
Yet they weak and so pathetic on the innocent they lurk
When they strike everybody more than hurt, Sound the Amber Alert
Why does god let 'em cry, They're too young to deny
How can evil be so mean, Why don't we live to be
Why does god just turn his eye, He just lets it fly
How can people be so cold, Why don't we take control
They have hope in the beginning that this terror isn't so
Some kind of unconceivable bone, will it just let em go?
So much refusal to believe it's really happening to them
But they don't even wake up from this nightmare, This shit dont have an end
To kill yourself would be cappin' out, so you carry on
While this rancid beast cowards hiding in the unknown
Look at itself in the mirror a fire breathing soulless ogre
Looking for its chance to catch a parent slippin' up at Kroger
Or the bus stop at Must Stop, how come god has it
It's far below your common criminal, in jail they stab it
There's no punishment appropriate there's not enough hurt
For this abomination haunting the earth, Causing an Amber Alert
Why does god let 'em cry, They're too young to deny
How can evil be so mean, Why don't live to be
Why does god just turn his eye, He just lets it fly
How can people be so cold, Why don't we take control
I won't rap about specifics to glorify its actions
Gory horrified reactions meet its satisfactions
It's a devil on this earth ""the devil"" but only worse
I kill it with a 30 round burst, give it no hearse
No tombstone or grave plot, no obituary
Just a piece fuckin' scum shit we don't even bury
Leave it for the rodents and rats, rotten in the trash
Let some psychotic puffer fiend fuck it in its ass
I call it an it 'cause it's demonic it's not shit
It ain't a he or a she it ain't snot spit
I swear god should step up, explain how it works
How can he ever let this happen, Why do we need an Amber Alert
How can he ever let this happen, Why do we need an Amber Alert!
Why does god let 'em cry, they're too young to deny
How can evil be so mean
How can he ever let this happen, why do we need an Amber Alert!
How can evil be so mean, why don't live to be
How can evil be so mean
How can he ever let this happen, why do we need an Amber Alert!
How can evil be so mean, why don't live to be
How can evil be so mean
How can he ever let this happen, why do we need an Amber Alert!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-amber-alert-lyrics

Alakazam,Hell’s Cellar,2018,"Who's that joker man stabbin’ you deep
And have your spilled blood flowin' like a Babylon creek
It's Violent J, the mother fuckin’ red neck killa
Pick ‘em up and rip they body in half, like a gorilla
‘Cause I'm out there like a scream in the night
I juggle dead kitty cats and dance naked in the moonlight
Wicked Clowns, forever in the shadows
And I'm taking that head off that neck of yours
Baby bubba, a bubba bang, alakaboo
I got a hatchet with a blade of fire, runnin' at you
I'm out the Southwest gutter- scrubby, nerdy, and nutty
So fuck your old money, get your throat bloody makin' fun of me
Get on! Crows watch me up on the wires
I caught one and pulled its fuckin' beak off with some pliers
And I can dance to the sound of bodies rottin' underground
And if you hear it too, dance with the clown. Come on, alakazam

Black magic, this wickedry
I love to let it get a grip on me
Let me be the first to get the word to you
I’m gonna murder you. One for the darkness
(Alakazam) Black magic, this wickedry
I love to let it get a grip on me
Let me be the first to get the word to you
I’m gonna murder you. One for the darkness
(Alakazam)

I slide in through your window like a snake at night
And then all through your family home and take what I like
And if you wake up, you fallin' back asleep for good *laughing*
You met Shaggy, a killer in paint and gang rags
Ninjutsu, all up the walls like Spider-Man
Give me a lighter and a gas can, this town’s on fire
And I got knives in my boots. I kick like Jet Li
I put holes in your cheeks, and they can't even catch me *roar*
Fuck fallin' in love. I chainsaw bitches
All the loves of my life - I left ‘em buried in ditches
And I gets my boggie on, boogie bang to the beat
I'll blow the brains out your head and spread ‘em all in the street
I’m a magician. Six cards appear in the flesh
Show's over, and now the Witch is there on your chest
They got you runnin' through the darkness just as fast as you can
Like, god damn, alakazam, damn, alakazam

Black magic, this wickedry
I love to let it get a grip on me
Let me be the first to get the word to you
I'm gonna murder you. One for the darkness
(Alakazam) Black magic, this wickedry
I love to let it get a grip on me
Let me be the first to get the word to you
I'm gonna murder you. One for the darkness
(Alakazam)

Bam! Bam! Fire I throw
I set your fuckin' back on fire, cut and wire your throat
Bloody fingers. I didn't do it ‘less I got away
I gives a fuck about my soul in Hell; I let it rot away
I live to die, and how I die is totally up to me
I kidnap somebody's mama, hung her dead from a tree
Call me crazy or call me nothing; I don't give a fuck
Because I'm walking with the Witch, and I don't need another look
Holy shit, y'all

Oh, Jesus
Oh, dear Jesus
Oh Lord
Hoioi. Hoioi. Rrrr. Hrrr
Jongongongongongongong
Yes, Lord
I'm learnin' ‘is quick prayer
Teach it to all you really quickly
Okie dokie, Lord

Thank you, Father, for more of the heavy

How,The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost,2015,"I don't wanna die and burn in hell
I wanna live honourable and do well
But how? How do I stay on path
When I see somethin' fucked up I wanna laugh?
How do I honour my dead beat father
Who walked out on two kids, like why bother?
And left my mother with poverty, fuck my dad
I wanna slaughter thee
Look at this world and all the Gods
How can I not look at all the odds
You got Allah, Buddha, Jehovah, Jah, give praise
However you was raise
How do I not wonder who's right or wrong
How do I keep my believin' strong?
How do I make it to Shangri-La
When the worlds so fucked up? Damn it's hard

How do I live a beautiful life
When all of this darkness has covered my life
How could this be you said was a lie
How will I know if I done good in your eyes?

I'm asking ""how?"" How can I ignore the hotties
How do I not check their slammin' bodies?
How do I stay faithful and quit the game
When I doubt my wife is doin' the same?
How in the fuck can I not have any
Drive a bucket and I want a Bentley?
Live in a trailer and not envy
A man who's got a mansion sittin' on land
Is this a joke?
How can anybody with nothin' see the rich and not be salty
And what if some psychopath had my son?
How can I not just grab my gun
How can I not have adrenaline buzz
Aim and blow a hole where his eyeball was
I saved my son, he's alive and well
But I killed a man am I goin' to hell?


How can I actually be a saint
How can I live and be somethin' I ain't?
How do I not steal, when I'm dyin' of hunger, and I end up under?
How do I just turn the other cheek
When I'm disrespected, slapped and beat?
What's wrong with fightin' back and winnin'
How come if I'm not a punk I'm sinnin'

How can I pray true and true
When most of what I pray for don't come through
And what about science and all the facts
How do I keep my faith in tact?
How do I not lie when the truth is painful
Embarrassing, harmful or shameful?
How do I not live afraid of hell
And be happily content my soul is well?


If I've done good in your eyes
If I look good in your eyes
If I look good in your eyes
If I look good in your eyes...",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-how-lyrics
Red Howl Moon,20th Anniversary Hallowicked Collection,2014,"Every so often the blood red moon rises
This means big surprises
Cats can feel it, they fight with each other
Psychopaths emerge and strangle their mother
People are high without dope in their system
Miscellaneous violence you could list 'em
The suicide rate on these nights quadruples
And wolves howl with dilated pupils
But these blood red moon nights get worse
When they happen to fall on October 31st
Like tonight I’m a grown man I should be home
Handing out gumballs, but I’m all in the zone
I want to murder somebody with a dull butter knife
I want to run wild and let go of my life
I’m sweatin’, twitchin’, I’ve gotta do something soon
Howl at the moon!

Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Are you talking to the moon or something?
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Are you talking to the moon or something?
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Are you talking to the moon or something?
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Are you talking to the moon

I want to bask and soak it in, all the precious moonlight
Tonight it's bloody red it's got me feelin' alright
On top of that it's Halloween, the world is filled up with fright
I wanna reach the highest point so I can howl tonight

I don’t even like Halloween! Fuck off me!
I ain’t giving out licorice and toffee
But tonight is different, I’m feeling frisky
Kind of like I drank a whole bottle of whiskey
I look in the sky and the moon is bleeding
Got me thinkin’ I’m some kind of heathen
I grabbed the hammer out of my tool box
And slipped out the back door wearing my socks
Under the light of the red moon I hopped some fences
Wearing a Jason mask from Spencer’s
I’m tempted to enter a home and slaughter
Kill this old man and choke his daughter
How do I fight this evil urge?
A red moon Halloween means it’s time to purge
I stand there in a field with the moon above me
And howl because it’s so lovely



I climb up this house carefully and slow
Once on top I’m under the moon’s glow
I climb the chimney to the highest peak
And howl and try not to shriek

I climb a tree to its highest branch
The higher I go, the moon advance
I’m on the tippy top next to an owl
Peel out of my shirt and howl

If I don’t howl blood will spill
I climb this building or I will kill
To the top I stand up on the air duct
Aand start to howl, as off I jump

I scale this tower totally naked
The urge to kill, I just can’t shake it
I reach the top, the moon is passing
I start to howl and jump off backwards",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-red-howl-moon-lyrics
Supernatural,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"Motherfucker, I can speak to crows
I see through their eyes
I can hear the truth behind the wickedest lies
I can snap my fingers and make fire appear
I see visions of the future through a crack in the mirror
I'm supernatural, I turn water to ice
With my bare hands, I don't need a freezer device
I can bend the spoon, tie it up in a knot, without touching it once
(True powers I got)
I can spit hot acid, I can see in the dark
Because I'm supernatural, and I'm living my part
I can levitate cards but I'm not a magician
'Cause my magic is official while these others are wishin'
I can read your palm, I got the telekinesis
Concentrate on a piece of fruit and blow it to pieces
I can see through walls and guess the color you're wearin'
Before you walk in the room
(My super psyche is flarin')
I can close my eyes and read the page of a book
I can tell you where your keys are and don't have to look
I'm supernatural, it's in the beat of my heart
The only bone that comes with it is the hard part

I can feel the pain of the dead
The angry dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead
I feel the pain of the dead
The angry dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead

Supernatural without the hat tricks
Sometimes I find 'em floatin' just above my mattress
I don't have to hit the switch to cut the lights on
I don't have to say check (to know my mic's on)
I got the ESP extraordinarily
So much my momma used to say 'OK, you're scarin' me'
I can tell you what hand you got the ball in
Without the ID I can always tell who's callin' (My man)
I can melt a candle down just by starin' at it
If I keep glarin' at it, steady wearin' at it (Come on)
The wind blows every time I walk outside
Dogs don't bark, they howl
(Most cats hide)
'Cause I'm supernatural like a vampire
See me hold out my hand and withstand fire
I can turn it all on or off as I go
The only part I can't control

Is when I feel the pain of the dead
The angry dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead
I feel the pain of the dead
The angry dead
The lost and alone, I feel 'em bang in my head
They yell for someone else but I can hear 'em instead
I can hear 'em instead, I can hear 'em instead

Over your bitch ass
They showing up missing yet
(Chorus 2x- Esham & Violent J)
If this mic was a biatch
We'd be running a train
We'd all be spanking that ass
We would all be getting brains
We treat the mic like a pussy
And hit it with different styles
We in the FBI files cause we wicked and we wild
(Esham)
I sit back and I think
With this blunt and this drink
Should I slit my fucking wrist?
Bloods dripping on the sink
Do I need to see a shrink?
Bloods on my white meat
I'm writing rhymes in blood cause I don't use ink
Keep my eyes on the pride
You might miss it if you blink
Shooting torpedoes at your ship so it might sink
Flows ice cold froze like it's a ice rink
So singing these lyrics might get you in the clink
(Fresh Kid Ice)
I remembered his head between your legs
All up in the pussy in the bed
Don't you wanna play with me?
Fresh Kid Ice fill the fantasies
Cause it ain't nothing wrong bout having sex
Line them up lets see who's next
HOES, hoes get outta line
We'll beat them, beat them
That's how the real hatchet boys treat them, treat them
(Violent J)
I'm flat broke
From that smoke
My gats broke
So I'm strangling somebody for they money
Getting bloody cause I'm nutty like your ball bag
I'm killing all fags
Cause I love to get pussy
When it's wet and mushy
I'll let you work me from here to Turkey
If you with it baby, unless you rocking herpes
You can forget it baby
The only ice I got be on your wife's neck
And I got it yet but I'm about to get it bit
(Fish & Grits)
So stop playing cause it ain't no game
I got 16 in the clip and one in the chams
I'm ready to blow your brain, let you t-shirt stain
Nigga from Miami so I'm a hurricane
Flipping every corner when I'm hitting the block
Rolling every corner when were dropping the top
Nigga damn know you better check my style
2 Live Crew we'll never die
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Popping wheelies backward or driving forwards
In the Escalade
Getting my dick sucked from the back like always
Whiten out hoes eyes like bitch what bring it
Put that neden back in those panties hoe its stanking
Got 26 pumps working and they fully juiced
I be banging with my homies like the hoover deuce
All I'm saying, me E, J Fish and Ice
We hold it together like the
Mothafucking wire splice, bitch
(Chorus 2x- Esham & Violent J)
If this mic was a biatch
We'd be running a train
We'd all be spanking that ass
We would all be getting brains
We treat the mic like a pussy
And hit it with different styles
We in the FBI files cause we wicked and we wild
Fresh Kid Ice
China Man

And made that bitch bark at the moon

Halloween Head,20th Anniversary Hallowicked Collection,2013,"Every halloween he emerges
To reek havoc upon the streets of Detroit
Nobody knows what he looks like
Some believes he wears a paper bag on his head
Some believe it's a pumpkin mask
The one thing that they know for sure
Is the blood on his knife is real
He is... Halloween Head

I wait in my cellar as the months pass slowly
So many days and weeks, holy-moly
Sometimes I hear children playing outdoors
Sunlight creeps through the cracky boards

I just wait as the such time thinks perfectly
In a moments it follow up to October thirtally
And then I free the flee of three manic
Into the landscapes, spreadin' my wings and make the land shake

Jump into the black sky and explode
Rain bloody acid, brand new above the all
My body landed, west 35K east
Halloween had a certified beast

Had nothing to our neighbourhood, houses on the 
Jump into a swimmingpool to turn the water black
And the move on along, and he treat or tricks
A Halloween Head beat you with a sheet full of bricks

He's crazed death, black as night
He comes around when the shit ain't right
Halloween Head x4
Halloween, ahahahahaha!
As red as blood, a ghostly white
He ate the kids and he know he bites
Halloween Head x4
Halloween, ahahahahaha!

Stop the car! Tokio drift kid
Snatch him up and beat his head off, full gifted
Fuel the car across the finish line first
The kid came in much later, hearse

I've stomped on the street, ninjas pooped their pants
The poop advenced when they scoop a glance
A Halloween Head gritty, I ain't nothin' pretty
Beat me a pumpkin shitty, haha

I snatch innocent bitches, and then I shake em
And shake em, until they stop moving, I break em
Fuck em, I choke em, I splat them on the wall, splatter!
Bitches don't matter to a Halloween Head

I buried ten men up to their chin
And kick every last one of they face in
Cause it's fun, it's free, it's halloween mean
And I'm a halloween crack fiend

He's crazed death, black as night
He comes around when the shit ain't right
Halloween Head x4
Halloween, ahahahahaha!
As red as blood, a ghostly white
He ate the kids and he know he bites
Halloween Head x4
Halloween, ahahahahaha!

I'm taller than his face on
Better beat on the titty you hoes
Run out of your clothes, kick your dicks in
And serve another fix in
Cut and scratch you hicks, murder mixin'

I impale heads on the sticks, stop starin'
Quick to burn if he forget to turn
I'm on time, brush with line and rat cheese
Please, praise me to my knees and every year it's

Boom motherfucker! Come halloween night
Beat you till the cops come (pop! pop!) pop some
And next stop em dead in their tracks
Call the ambulance, with the dead we dance

There's a witch on a broom with a full moon behind her
Look into the sky, a quick reminder
To wake the dead, let your wings spread
I fall out and fly behind the mighty halloween head

He's crazed death, black as night
He comes around when the shit ain't right
Halloween Head x4
Halloween, ahahahahaha!
As red as blood, a ghostly white
He ate the kids and he know he bites
Halloween Head x4
Halloween, ahahahahaha!

If you're out trick or treatin'  this halloween
Don't stay out too late and whatever you do
Don't ask the men with a paperbag on his head for candy
Stay away from everybody wearin' a pumpkin mask
As a matter of fact, stay from anybody who in any way
Resembles the halloween head, by the way
The legend is not just in Detroit
Some believe there's a Halloween Head in every city
Who thinks the goblins and ghouls who haunt the streets
On halloween, give him a license to terrorize and kill
Stay away as far away as you can from Halloween Head",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-halloween-head-lyrics
Intro (Bizzar),Bizzar,2000,"(wind, chimes, thunder in background)
To All who are receiving this broadcast we are entering the 13th hour of continuing cloud coverage this ongoing event has now been upgraded to a national emergency, this has been a sleepless night across metro Detroit this panic and terror has swept the streets, it seems much of Detroit has as well much of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable cloud that still clutches the sky, from New York to Honolulu, Miami to Fairbanks, the expansion of the cloud has subsided as a wall of darkness, an artificial night still grips the land. Witnesses now tell us thousands upon thousands of people are emerging from sewers everywhere, their faces are painted and, and they look like clowns...the people are running and screaming but eyewitnesses say their not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy has over taken them and at this time we do not know why or where the people are running but there seems to be an organized plan directing their actions, its like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina, the events of clowns are now on the move, moving in unison, moving in one direction towards an unknown destination, almost as if they can see what others cannot. Heating an inaudible call that silently pierces this calm before the storm",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-intro-bizzar-lyrics
Off the Track,The Calm,2005,"I battle samurais, they fight like little bitches to me
I've murdered everybody, I need some switches for me
Take me some place, nobody never knew existed
Gone like the missle that missed it and gone balistic
It's floatin' on anybody caught in the way
I'm falling through the future while your back in the day
And know that, there's a storm comin' brewin' up ahead
Black rain as hot as it can get, oh shit

We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me

Motherfucker I been droppin' freestyles, for fifty three miles
We drop some nuclear bombs, we tryin' to see smiles
I caught a shootin' star inside a peanut butter jar
We bring it in the vocal booth and beam out like rayzars
We draw crop circles, that prints sky purples
Cast out colorful shiny diamonds wonderful
I'm not the one that bullshit about the thunder though
We keep it juggalo, we underground and mo'
Rockin' shows in my underwear, never been the one to care
Spend every penny that we ever made on weed and beer
I make the rainest, but the joker cards is ever famous
And who can blame us, the carnival became us
I'm sleepin' in the clouds, leaping through the night sky
I fantasize, let you see something beyond your eyes
I seen the galaxy, ate Lucky Charms off the Milky Way
But tommorow gonna be the day, we off the tracks

We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me

And we gon' ride high
Swerve left and right high
All night
We gon' ride high
Swerve left and right high
All night

You gotta meet me to believe me, and beat me to achieve me
And vision through your third eye to even try to see me
I'm too dramatic, I'll slap you with the Sledge-O-Matic
I'm on your TV screen, talkin' through the static
On the beaches of Afghanistan, talkin' to the reefer man
Caught in a avalanche and don't need an ambulance
Come with me, I'll show you how to relax
Dark Carnival wagons is flying off the tracks
So come on...

We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me

Mexico City,The Tempest,2007,"Mexico City (City) a place that you can go
And live your life on the low (okay)
Mexico City (City) a place that you can hide
And everything'll be tight (alright)

They want me on murder rap, which violates my probation
Ain't no fuckin way I'm stayin here wit what I'm facin
Sold my car to a junkyard and bought a one-way bus ride
Take me cross the border, I'll cool out and hide
After 80 wicked hours of stale, they hit the last stop
Threw me out the bus, left me standing there, asses out
Turned and started walkin, tell me what is there to see?
Everything was all in spanish but the sign ""welcome to mexico city""

Mexico City (City) a place that you can go
And live your life on the low (okay)
Mexico City (City) a place that you can hide
And everything'll be tight (alright)

Maybe I can fetch a job, find a wife start a family

Maybe I can get a place, settle down and try to blend in

Maybe I can just relax, be myself and quit pretendin

Even islands off the map within the dead sea passageway
Don't fuckin matter, man, from pakistan to chuck e. chesse's
From the ramada in granada on through far as the equator reaches
Virgina beaches, saskatoon, cancum, the blue lagoon
From desert sand dunes, metropolises to the boons
From pueblo north, kakalaki, back to waikiki
They searchin high and low for me but I'm in mexico city

You wasn't true to me
When I was locked up you fucked somethin like 34 guys
But I let that slide
Cuz your ass is bangin, your titties is phat
I wanted to fuck that, but fuck that
I never gave a fuck that, you put me through the courts
And gave me genital warts
Now I stack my nine, I'm goin for your knees

As your standin there I'ma be like BITCH!
You know you done fucked up right?
Girl ya know I love ya but now ya gotta die
Now ya gotta die, now ya gotta die

Bitch don't talk about bitches I'm fuckin them
Please no fat bitches I'm fuckin slim
Unless its one of those nights I'm smokin my shit
I don't care about how I'm fuckin it
How much it cost big fat crack head?
Ain't tryin to hear all them words you said
Five minutes bitch, and I came
Fuck your name, and from were you came
I don't give a fuck bitch, I will kill you
You Sequeta

Bloody Bitch,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I live life like I'm playing a game of X-box
I don't give a fuck if I die or get caught
There I am, god-damn, everything was smooth
I woke up with a bloody bitch dead in the bathroom
My wicked shit praise that I heard through the days
Somehow now relays my new murderous ways
Violent J's not around but Moon Glorious is there
Scared of fucking death, and what's happening here
Blood in the tub as I scrub a dub, on my knees geez
I hope she ain't have a disease
I need the keys to the shed, I'ma cut the head off
My daddy got a knife in there to cut lead off
How should I do this, what sounds fun?
I just sat on her headpiece and twiddled my thumbs
Finally said fuck it, stomped her face
Sunk in like a pumpkin, I left no trace
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (on my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (In my bathroom)
Find me, deep in the night I be thugging
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (In my bathroom)
Find me, end of the night I be scrubbing
You must think I'm some kind of fucking idiot, don't ya?
What you think I'ma do, warn you when I'm on ya?
That's what TV do, with forensic files
Teaching all your secrets and styles
Got that (?alumina phorisone or phollisone?) for your crime lab
You'll find nothing but a carcass slab
I got fourty dead bodies all buried out back
And if a limb's sticking out when I'm mowing I handle that
This bitch don't, she deserve this
She had a neden that wouldn't provide service
She even stuck a stiletto in my eye
Three inches deep and I still couldn't see why
I had to stab her with a toothbrush in the throat
And then stuff the bitch mouth with a bar of soap
Drown the bitch in a toilet at that
Look at them tiles, she dead on crack
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (on my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (In my bathroom)
Find me, deep in the night I be thugging
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (In my bathroom)
Find me, end of the night I be scrubbing
Four o' clock in the morning out here and one slip up
Had to freeze her so the bitch ain't a dripper
Unzip the zipper, feel like Jack the Ripper
Had to monkey flip her in a wood chipper
Blood on my walls, mirrors and floors
Some even on the carpet from under the doors
I never saw so much fucking blood before
A slutty whore with more blood than a dinosaur
Ajax (here's a quarter), call Mr. Clean
Tell him and Comet they're needed at the scene
Scrubbed all night to some old color me bad
Wrapped up the bloody towels in a garbage bag
Send it to the curb, it ain't absurd
This week's been good, that bitch was the third
Hell's Pit's gots a cactus waiting on my ass
So expect me to cry when its time to pass
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (on my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (In my bathroom)
Find me, deep in the night I be thugging
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor)
Another bitch dead (In my bathroom)
Find me, end of the night I be scrubbing",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-bloody-bitch-lyrics
Mancow Made Us,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"(Intro)
This is the rags to riches story
Of the Insane Clown Posse
Mancow made us rich and famous
Whole world hate us, Mancow played us
Now look at us, platinum status
We owe it all to 
Mancow
(Verse 1: Violent J)
I'm Violent J and I'm rich like Rush Limbaugh is fat Imagine that
First, Mancow put us on the air
And everybody jumped on our wagons right there
Mancow's been down with the clown
Since Kurt Cobain's head was still around
I won't forget how I made my bread
Cause I remember we was like John Denver, hehe...dead
Back then I thought I was the bomb
I couldn't even sell a tape to my own mom
I was broke, dinner was grain and rye
Now I sit with chilled Faygo in a phat ride
And at shows I sold out nightly
On top of that I think Erma likes me
Mickey Mouse we ain't goin no place
So bitch get used to my ugly face, c'mon
(Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope)
Shaggs 2 Dope and I'm a high school drop out
Convicted felon, I don't mind tellin
You hear my lyrics and you hate my guts
But I got a million bucks and you don't
I don't even make sense when I rap
Bllll Skkkee Skkkaaa how you like that?
Soon as Mancow hit the switch
Next thing you know we got rich, uhh
Mancow made us rich and famous
Whole world hate us, Mancow played us

I got a broken taillight and I'll smash you, bitch
Get outta my way, we got clown luv
Phat props to the lyrical Tom Dub

It's the M, O, N, O, and I can't even spell the rest
It takes too long and I need a fuckin cigarette

My right ear's mad wack
So shut the fuck up and listen or get an ass kicking
I slap hoes and call them bitches to their face
And scream ""Now fuck off bitch, Twiztid in the place!""
So back up, recognize and check nuts
Cause simply my dear, I don't give a fuck!

If I Was a King,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 4",2005,"If I was a king all bitchs would blow me

Big Bad Wolf,Hell’s Cellar,2018,"I’m deep off in these woods, and I’m hungry as hell
I see a stacked little biddy comin’ down the trail
She had a red mini skirt and a bitch-had ass
Like two beach balls stuffed down the back of her pants
She got a basket of cheeseburgers, too. I can smell them
She said, “Stay away, evil wolf, or I’m tellin’”
I’m like “Why you gotta act like a fuck-ass bitch?
You could throw a woof some of them fries, right quick”
But the bitch broke. I sprinted quick as hell down a back trail
I know the ho be as slow as a snail
I got to Grandma’s first and ate the bitch right there
Put her robe on and wig and waited in her chair
In walks Little Red. She said, “Something’s wrong
Grandma, why is your face hairy and long?”
I snarled my teeth and showed Grandma’s blood
And said, “Bitch, top me off, unless you want some”

Run, bitch!
Before you get your ass cheeks ripped off! Ha ha!
Who’s afraid of the big bad woof?
The big bad woof? The big bad woof?
Who’s afraid of the big bad woof?
He’ll rip your fuckin’ throat out

I be the big bad boy daddy bad-ass woof
And I own this ghetto-ass patch of the woods
Here come three little bitch boys, richies. They was piggies
But they was just bitches to me
I said “Fuck that shit. Build a house on my block
And I’m blowin’ it down. Don’t come showin’ around”
But they laughed it off and had me thrown in the pen
For threatenin’. When I got out, they been moved in
What the fuck they think they provin’?
What the fuck they doin’? What the fuck, my fangs are droolin’
The first house I blew down was straws and sticks
House gone, but he was left there taking a shit
I tried to get him. He ran into the second piggy home
It was made of good lumber, but I got they number
I took a hit of the magic blunt, blew that shit down
And they both ran off into the big compound
The third shit was a fortress made out of stone
Ain’t no way that’s comin’ down. Plus, the blunt gone
I just walked right through the front door and killed all three
In the living room. Blame it on the full moon (Awoo!)

Bitch, beware. The woof Sometimes gets wicked, wicked (Awoo!)
If I die, please bring me back a woof
; Let me be wicked
So beware; the woof sometimes gets wicked, wicked (Awoo!)
Don’t chase the woof no more. What for? He’s only wicked, wicked

So I’m sittin’ there, chillin’ with four dead sheep in the freezer
I’m with this fine-ass French poodle skeezer
And I hear some kid yellin’ “WOLF! WOLF!”
But I run this bitch. This is my home, my hood
Who the fuck is they talkin’ about attackin’ they sheep?
I ain’t even been down there in a fuckin’ week
Next night, I’m all up under this ho’s tail, nose deep
Same shit again: “WOLF! SAVE THE SHEEP!”
What the fuck is they problem? I ain’t even attackin’
I’m over here gettin’ my dick sucked, relaxin’
They must be chasin’ off some squirrels or somethin’
Either that, or that dumb fuck kid is frontin’
But I am runnin’ low on my sheep from their yard
And next week the boys are comin’ by to cue and play cards
So that night, I went on my monthly prowl with the snarl
Every backyard, I piss and leave hot 
I started headed for the flock of fat fluffy-ass sheep
And they go “Baa!” even in they fuckin’ sleep
And the kid seen me, for real, and started blowin’ up the spot
He cried, “WOOF!” but nobody came. I took all they got

I wanna prowl like the woof do at night (Da woof man)
I wanna howl like the woof do, and be a fright (Shit, werewolves?)
I wanna prowl like the woof do at night
(Think I’m trippin’, the woof will snatch yo’ ass out the )
I wanna howl like the woof do, and be a fright (Shit!)
I wanna prowl like the woof do at night (Oh, you ain’t scared of a woof?) ()
(You’ll be scared of a woof when it takes your leg back home to its pups, mother fucker)
I wanna howl like the wokf do, and be a fright (Shit)
I wanna prowl like the woof do at night (Shit) (Shit)
(Snatch a bite out yo bitch ass) (Out yo bitch ass!)
I wanna howl like the woof do, and be a fright

Gettin’ a hope from God
To be able to see
To discern the times of the seasons that’s ahead of you

If I Was God,Psychopathics from Outer Space 3,2007,"(America - has lost sight of God
The Bible says - the wicked shall be turned to hell
And all nations that forget God
America has forgotten The God
The more rapes there will be
The more muggings there will be
The more drugs there will be
The more murders there will be)
If I was God - I'd probably try to clear my brain
Kick back up in the heavens and see what we can change
First off, I'd have no guns - just hand to hand combat
Only the strong survive like cavemen, I'd like that
If I was God - the Sun would blink from time to time and blackout
I'd introduce the newest ryda - put Eazy-E back out
I'd fuckin' ride up in the sky upon a cloud floatin' around
Both grantin' wishes and throwing lightning bolts down
If I was God - I'd show up and host a Saturday night live
Just to freak em' out and let everybody know I'm alive
If I was God - I'd explode every crooked preacher's head
Right then when he's screaming and preaching face all red ... POP!
If I was God - I'd go and try to whip the devils' ass
But it probably ain't that easy and I probably learn it fast
If I was God - I'd ride a dragon down to earth
Pull Bin Laden out of sand - fuckin' kill him myself
If I was God - I'd turn pop music upside down
We have the top 40 list - be top 40 underground
I'd watch Twiztid take home 7 grammies or more
I'd see Boondox riding front page on the source
And somehow I'd be about to marry a Beyonce
Tellin the paparazzi ""All y'all get the fuck outta the way!!!""
If I was God - I'll grow my face hairs long like Moses
Hit the club in iced out halo and see where the hoes is
I cork all the volcanos and let this bitch blow
And then rewrite the timeline so that it never happened so
I do it again and again and again and again and again
Every time I needed to express my anger within
I'd fly above the cities - a giant with searchlight eyes
I let you motherfuckers know I'm watching - ready to energize
I've got them lighting bolts, I'd turn prisons to country clubs
Make a lot more hotties be attracted to scrubs
If I was God - every now and then it rained dynamite
Just to keep you on your toes - make sure you got your shit tight
I'd bring dinosaurs back - just when nobody expects
And send your prayers to each other - see if you gonna reject it
I'd give everybody free rewinds for shit they mighta' passed up
I cure the sick and diseased and let the crippled get their ass up
I make it rain money everywhere it's needed
Crooked cops will get their ass beaten, shit and get even
I'd do a lot a shit different, but I don't know shit
I'm so happy that I ain't him, my head about to split
I've fuckin' make it rain indoors - I know that much
I'd take a photo of me with the devil in a camel clutch
And put it on all the TVs for 24 hours
Make giant meteors pass by the earth within the couple yards
Shit, If I was God - I'd walk around the city like King-Kong
Be down on the street and fuckin' peep in your home
If I was God - jealousy would be easily detected
Their faces would turn out of the demon everytime time they felt it
Fucking earthquake - I'll shake this bitch dramatically
I pick the earth of shaking pepper my spaghetti with trees
Holy shit yall'
What the fuck would I do?
If I was God ?
Man, fuck, what the fuck should I do?
I'd give all hungry and needy pizzas and steak
And cook it all over the flames of hell if that's what it takes
I'd drop a couple new animals every fuckin' month or so
And send a few tornadoes through where they normally go
I'd not only walk on the water for you - I'd hammer slide and boogie
And snap my fingers, and give all the little kids each a cookie
I'd send snowstorms to the dessert,  heatstrokes to the artic
Three times a year visits which are dearly departed
I'd put about 10 000 real Jason Voorhees up there
Just to add a fresh element of fear in the air
I'd throw angel picnics and parties we get drunk and come down to earth
Probably picking fuckin' fights up in the church
I'd have a stretch limo so long the fronts already there and I even left yet
Faygo lakes everywhere
I'd jog inside the earth and make it spin like a hamster wheel
I'd have aliens come and try to make us their meal
But that's exactly why they gave the job to somebody else
Or is there ""a they"" fuck it - figure it yourself
Cause I ain't have a clue in hell
Shit, I'm probably going to hell
Fuck it, man
What ?
I'm going to Hell!
I'm probably fucking going to Hell!
Fuck it, man
What?
I'm going to hell!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-if-i-was-god-lyrics

The Marvelous Missing Link!
The Marvelous Missing Link!

Is there darkness all around you?
Are you lost and confused, afraid?
All the time, afraid inside?
Does it sometimes feel like you're walking through a dark, endless cave, with no way out in sight?
Does it feel like you're falling further and further into an endless pit of despair?
Does it seem that nobody can help you, or even understand what it is you're going through?

Your link is missing (Your link is missing)
You're lost, but there is a way (There is a way)
You must find your link (You must find your link)
You must find faith (You must find faith)
You must believe (You must believe)
Hope and believe in your faith (Hope and believe)
Whatever that faith is (But whatever it is)
You must have faith and believe (Have faith and believe)
We only get so much time to live (We get so much time)
Don't spend your days in the dark and then die without ever having faith (Faith)

Find your Missing Link

Thrill of the Kill,The Eye of the Storm ,2007,"I'm shakin' so fast that you could say I'm vibratin'
There's a sickness in my head a hunger escalatin'
There's no other ending to this shit so why the f**k I'm waitin'
Hop into the darkness for my homicidal break-in
I thought it out for many weeks I even told a reverend
But he ain't even listenin' 'cause I'm over eleven
I told my girlfriend and she just said it was cute
Then asked me how she looked in her f**k me boots and took off
Sweatin' and my chest is burnin' like I'm on fire
So much pressure in my head I could blow air in through a car tire
I'm about to burst pop shatter explode
And everybody's pokin' sticks at me like they wanna splat me
No one sees me when I creep I stay behind shit
Check for open windows I scale across and climb shit
Get inside and choke an old lady in her Craftmatic
And like fresh oxygen to an asthmatic I get a thrill

Every time that a door gets closed. The thrill
Every time that the reaper shows. The thrill
Every time that the red blood flows. The thrill
I gets my proper dose
Every time, (every time) every time (the thrill)
Every time, (every time) every time (the thrill)
Every time that the red blood flows. The thrill

I told the doctor that I losin' all my will to resist
But he was busy eye-f**kin' his receptionist
He wrote me some scripts for time off and placebos
Then set a killa free out his doors
At home in the tunnels underneath the train station
The urge suddenly attacks like an invasion
There's no reasonin' with it and it ain't over 'til it's done
But once I finally do it it's a lot of f**kin' fun
I try to tell my therapist and counselor as well
But they just say Uh huh until the time limit bell
I told a couple homies and they urged me on to it
If I ever had a f**kin' chance of fightin' this I blew it
I was meant for it opened up a door and jumped in
It was all over 'bout as quick as it began
I started stickin' guts rippin' like I'm guttin' chicken
Her life left her body and my happiness kicked in
Woo!

The thrill 

But when the high comes crashing down where will I be found
I'll be underground (burning away)
And when the high comes crashing down where will I be found
I'll be underground (burning away)
I guess all I'd say is that...
Well why apologize I plead for no forgiveness
I'm goin' straight to hell and I deserve their business
Its useless don't know why I have this illness in me
This killness in me I always knew that to hell they'd send me
Every day was a nightmare only all very real
But nothing compares to enjoyment of the thrill of the kill
(You sick f**k) Thrill of the kill
(You sick f**k) Thrill of the kill
(You sick f**k) Thrill of the kill
(F**k you sick f**k) Thrill of the kill, kill, kill
(You sick f**k) Thrill of the kill

Yo J take it away homeboy Lyricaly
The ghetto yeah boy I'm a proud ass resident
I got more boys than the motha fuckin president
Watchin my back through jack leadin jack
Tryin to mack to your back homeboy you get sacked
By 14 of the hottest motha fuckas on the water bed
ICP fuck a microglycerine
I'll let his backbone pry out his motha fuckin throat
Come across to Detroit throw your ass in a moat
Yo Homeboy you know your in effect
But what about the crimes you ain't kicked none yet
On the ramed out streets of the inner city Delray
There once lived a little boy named Violent J
Saw a lot of bad thing a child stays out of
When he hit 13, motha fucka when violent
Took along yo the crimes that I done
People must understand it wasn't just for fun
When your cold at night and theres nothin to eat
You can give a fuck about another fuckers feed
Growin up stonger one next to me
With military MC's hard nock Bruce Lee
Hangin at the stadium just talkin and swearin
Punk walk by laughin at what I was wearin
Prince born walkin around with silver spoons in his mouth
My brother shoved it so far down the kid shit it out
Nate the Mack so loud in front of his house
Leanin against his old's drinkin 40's with clouds
Drunk fool walked by with his wallet and key
They took it all and left 'em in his BVD's
2 Much and 2 Dope got boomin rides
Took your amp took your tookin snick by nine
Try to told 'em between us and your fresh seet to
Left that shity ass 10 dolla crate all for you
Kid Villian the hustla took the whole damn ride
Didn't notice your girl was still sittin inside
She stayed in the car while you ran in the store
Kid plucked your car and ended up fuckin your whore
Q-Tip look through your window on a monday night
Took your couch big jar everything in site
Sold 'em all for gold cuz my boys are swingin
Stole your mothers raidy rade off her motha fuckin finger
Lay Low sold bullets to your uncle Jim
And the village men wonder why he been gettin so slim
Now he steals from you so at night your lockin
And the money you get goes to Lay Low's pocket
D-Lyrical like a cat sneaks up from behind
Check nine to your spine is what your able to find
That pile yo is cool and calm
That rope around your neck winds up in a pile
Don Juan goes back just askin the fool
Spent more time in jail, then you spent in school
In the LA roles just go make a deal
Stole your little snitches mother fuckin tranin wheels
Pimp, Hustler, Baller, Daddy D
Got more freaks then a skater got teeth
But pimpin pimp daddy is pimpin down river
Can in one had with one to hold the liver
Iron Ranger is the brute of the IC crew
Make kid visiouse look like Little Kid Blue
So battery had to be done to an HP
Simple plan its all so the sucker try to say maybe
Rude Boy, aww shit J tell 'em
HP watchin verner boys swellin
Southwest boys, Juan and Andrew
What the fuck can you do?
The playable unstopable ICP
Boy you can't fade me
Your game is too tuff is what you say
ICP stands for I Can Play
Any game set up by a barn yard hit
Touch a pich fork, and my gun will click
So you say my raps are mean and uncalled for
Fuck you and your mothers a whore

Ain't down with gang bangin only down with milkin cows

Crop Circles,The Calm,2005,"The sun rises and sets on time every day of the year
But sporadically, the circles appear
Bafflin' all through the history of no man
Since fuckin' with the mystery of Stonehenge
Aliens, cults, witches with lawnmowers
Mind blowers, nobody knows what for sure
Bloody nose when I walk in the vicinity
But I can read em, and I believe that I need em
I'm runnin through a wheat field chasing a ghost
They love cicles, use em for portals and time holes
And dance backwards and chant with the crow people
At the crop circle, I come to know people
Under moon rays, lightin' up my new ways
The new lays, they mow em down in 2 days
A hundred years from now we'll pay for that mishap
With another motherfuckin' hurricane bitch slap

The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
Something solely meant just for me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something

This ball of mud that we live on is alive
You try to wipe its mouth, it's gonna wipe us out
I lay in the field alone in the middle of the night
I try to get my life right and pray for bright light
Set flames to the wheat rows during an eclipse
And the spirits will come out and dance, catch you a glimpse
They're like artists, connect me the stars in rare fashion
Intricately placed with secrets of white magic
Im runnin' through the moonlit fields
Following a little orb light hoping it might reveal
Any secret, it's dancing and I can't catch up
And I almost ran headfirst into a truck
No compass will work, and I'm lookin' for answers
While the sands of my hour glass fall up backwards
Have I lost you? cause I've lost me too
But if your hiding in the crops I will come find you

The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
Something solely meant just for me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something

Forty thousand years ago, the stoning of a young man
His story written in the crops near spoken
In England, The face of a dead woman
Shown, etched out a wheatfield uniquely woven

Hierogliphics, mathmatical genius
Predicting the orbital patterns of Venus
In the grass behind your grandpa's wood barn
Complex designs dropped seconds before dawn

Dead birds scattered throughout the patterns of earth
No explanations left by the shadows of dark
Batteries drained of their power in seconds
I'm laying in the crop circles countin' my blessings

And my no headaches and nausea will creep in
And your nose will bleed when your sleepin'

Don't go near there don't dare beware
Unless your like us and don't care
 - x2
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
Something solely meant just for me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something

'Cuz your ass is big an' your titties is fat
I wanted to fuck that, but fuck that
I never gave a fuck that you put me through the courts
An' gave me genital warts

You know you done fucked up, right?""

I wake up to a text tellin' me to eat shit
I walk out the house catch a brick in the lip
Waitin' for the bus it tried to hit me
Fuck it I'll walk a dog with rabies bit me
Get to my job it's fuck me I'm fired
Just started my fuckin' day I'm already tired
Asked a hottie for her number she sprayed me with mace
I gave a bum a dollar he spit in my face

I've learned to be okay with
Fuck you fuck you

I don't mind fuck you
I might even prefer
The fuck you fuck you
I'm actually okay

When I try to hit the blunt my name is skipped
I'm that nerd in the lunch room with no where to sit
I'm forever last pick cause I ain't physically fit
The whole world do me like Tila I get pelted with shit
I stick my hand out for a dap get kicked in the gut
It's fuckin' freezin' out here all doors slammed shut
Cops preachers and teachers nobody has time
I finally get to the front back to the back of the line


I would rather be the fuckin' monster than to be the scared bitch
I would rather be a bum that needed than to be the pretty rich
I would rather be the lost and cheated than to be the schemin' one (I would rather be)

Right Now,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"Right now someone fell out of a neden
Somebody's walking the isle of a wedding
Someone's fucking, someone's fighting
Someone else probably getting struck by lightning

Right now someone just got 25 years
Somebody tripped falling down the stairs
And you can't help, cause you ain't there
It's going down right now, but you don't know where

Right now there's a hottie blowin on dick
It don't belong to the man they with
Scratch off ticket, somebody just hit
And partied so hard, they lost that shit

Right now someone quit rehab to drink
Somebody looks hot as fuck but they stink
Someone in a car crash got paralyzed
Somebody else got lucky, and don't realize

Right now, all around the earth
We live for all its worth
Right now, all around the globe
This life is all we know
Right now, as we hear this song, so much is goin' wrong
Right now, at this very moment in time, somebody's moment defined

Right now someone just contracted SARS
And donated their brain to science jars
He got demoted, she got promoted
He got so mad, his head exploded

Right now somebody fell head over heels in love
Someone else lost all of the above
Somebody's bone is another's gain
Boat crash, kidney found at last

Right now as youre hearing this beat
Some little kid is stepping out into the street and SPLAT!
Just like that...a car, luckily, it didn't happen where YOU are

Right now, it's going down
Don't front any time of the day, any night of the month
Enjoy the calm relaxation
Cause else where STRANGULATION


Somebody's being born right now
And somebody's fuckin dying right now!
Us? We're fuckin droppin depths of wisdom right now...BITCH

Stop, with every tick of the tock of the clock, somebody else gets shot
Maybe in Guam, or down the block
Tick tock, tick tock, click, the death pop

Right now, everything's great, but out there in cell block 8, rape
Brutal bloody, massacre murder
Thankfully in some place you never heard of

Right now some people shouldn't be alone
From the nursery to the nursing home
Little boy, training wheels, he don't need em anymore
Old man does, wheelchair rollin on the floor

Right now people are coming or going
Shrinking or growing, pushing or pulling
Speeding or slowing, spending or earning
Teaching or learning, freezing or burning",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-right-now-lyrics

You have dug your own grave if you say you wanna battle
Don't you know your in trouble up the creek with out a paddle
Cuz I keep gettin betta I'm tougha then leatha
I'm rated numba one and I'll rain for eva
Some people wear silva and some wear gold
But then I'll snatch it off your neck and diss you cold
It's like a fantasy it's irony my rhymes go down in history
Hit my boys proven with the freshest termenology
Know more words then a pocked dictionary
Got more information then your local library
Some girls I'm kissin and others I'm dissin
But you don't know what you been missin
Make a fresh tongue twista
Could give your tongue a blista
If you see it my way then theres a chance you'll diffa
Give a sigh then you crie then you say good bye
Don't even try don't reply then you want to die
I make you rhyme though it's time
Commit an innocent crime
It's the truth no excuse a visual rhyme
Dissin you, to battle me you bit off more then you can chew
Tearin up the scene destrukter van vew
The way I'll leave you more puzzled then arubics cube
Wanna battle the best your gonna die like the rest
Wait I'll crush your bones and rip up your flesh
You can do what you want but leave the rhyme to the skills
Cuz every person that don't listen is a sucker that kills
And when I first started rappin I set some goals
To rock your mind, your body and of course your sould
Now when it comes to these goals I have now acheaved
So for all you none believers it's TIME TO BELIEVE
Take it to the Violent Side

Fuck off gold dick I don't rap for gratitude
You'll remember my name after I get the shot
Don't laugh now bitch tie your lips in a not
Delray, Detroit, Southwest Military

Yo I like I like big fat fucked up freaks

Hey yo the J stands for Joe
Violent straight up means that I'm a motha fuckin psycho
Reputation like Jason on the southwest side
Shot 47 times boy still ain't died
In the LA roads pumpkin gangsta codes
Sellin yayo part time sellin stereos
Yeah boy and my tape comes with 'em
When I stole the radio my tape was already in 'em
Life style of a motha fuckin scalowag
Throw a fist if ya throw me a mag
I'll use it cuz ya never know I'm packin a gun
Straight up young one you don't want none son
Fuck those talkin shit fuckin seem to quit

Play My Song,The Tempest,2007,"We hit the ace, ace, ace, and love giving chase
Wicked clowns got more than some pie for your face
With a drip, drip, drip, it's blood on the strip
Three disassembled bodies in the trunk of the whip
Hear the saw, saw, saw, right below your jaw
And see your own head roll off the table and fall
See the puck, puck, puck, flaming arrows in your truck
And one in your lung stuck, you fucked out of luck

Play my song (give me something I can lean on)
Well what you tryna hear (something about murder, I got that)
Play my song, bloody, bloody, bloody...

Here come the hack, hack, hack, knives in your back
Blood down your spine all in your ass crack
With a swing, swing, swing, your throat's whistling
The three incisions I made are as fine as g strings
It's the pap, pap, pap, from behind with a bat
And splatter every crack till your whole head flat
Beat the jab, jab, jab, I'll punch you in your flab
Drag you to the butcher shop and chop you into slab


Every one of us got to have murder or death
To remind ourselves that we still have our breath
Whether it's tasteful or disgraceful
Shit, as long as everybody get a face full
Some of us root for the coppers, others root for the killing
But everybody needs their murderous thrillings
Trace it back to when mankind was swinging from a tree
Murder's what we talking about and always will be",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-play-my-song-lyrics
This Halloween Is Crazy,20th Anniversary Hallowicked Collection,2013,"Spooky, spooky - shock wave!
Insane Clowns here to rock your grave
It's Halloween in the city and it's raining pumpkins
Smashing on cars, splatting, thumping
What the hell is going on? Everybody run!
A pumpkin hit me in the melon but I'm having fun
I made a dummy for the front porch, sat him in the chair
Turned around and it was gone like it booked up outta here
I gave a little kid a little Heath
He locked onto my arm with red eyes and fang ass teeth
I kicked him off me, he laughed and flew away
But it's Halloween nothing's gonna ruin my day

Every year, ghost's come through the mirror but
This Halloween is crazy!
Something wicked's in the air, more than any other year
Every year there's scary howls from wolves and owls but
This Halloween is crazy!
Something wicked's in the air, more than any other year, I feel it!

Spooky, spooky - I'm scared and wired
A bat flew into my living room and turned into a vampire
Ugh, we smoked a bowl of that fire
On Halloween, a night we all admire!
Everybody's being spooky and shit so I hid
Figured I'd jump out and scare a little kid
I did it, I tried the mean ass gag
But she was strapped with a stun gun and fried my bean bag


From high in the night sky pumpkins fall
And don't nobody seem to give a fuck at all
They get blasted, get back up and keep trick-or-treating
Pumpkin rain is brutal, these kids could take a beating
Zombies crawling up out of the mud
Three headed thugs, fists covered in blood
I seen a witch fly by on a broom
Pointing and laughing at me, smacked into a tree (boom!)
I'm almost out of candy, the doorbell rang
But nobody was there, then it happened again
I went out and up the back and watched from the roof
It was the dummy I made (what?!) and now I have proof
He's alive, I suicide dive on his ass
And now they duking it out, rolling round on the grass
Everybody gathered around us, under the moonlight
And all chanted these words as they watched the fight
They said...

Spooky, spooky, let's all get stupid
This Halloween is crazy!

Another Love Song (album version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
I Mean I Hear What Your Saying
I Mean You Got Carried Away In The Moment
And I Could Forgive You
I Could Do That
I Could Do Anything
If I Wanted to
I Could Buy You A Lexus Truck With A White Leather Interior
I Could Kill Off Some Bears And Dogs And Shit
Just To Make You A Fur Coat
I could love you and treat you with class
And Have babies fallin all out your ass
But thinkin about that
I feel I'd rather kill you
(Cause I got you in my car and u ain't goin' nowhere bitch your dead)
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie
I could take all the facepaint off and get a real job workin for your dad
I would rather take a 10 pound axe and stick it your daddys forehead
I could let you move into my house
You'd fuck the neighbour everytime i go out
And wipe his nut on my pillow (Oh)
But I think id rather kill you
(Cause we parked all alone in this dark alley way, hey)
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie
Im the one who killed your precious cat and stuffed him in your fuckin mailbox
If I only hadnt cut off my hair id choke you with all my dreadlocks
When I scream at the moon every night
You should have known something just ain't right
Cause im going to slap you (Bitch)
And then im going to kill you
(Cause the moon told me to and its watching us right now)
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie
I could go back to school instead
And try to get my diploma, I know
I'd much rather bang your head on the wall
Until you fall into a coma
Cause i can't get you out of my head
Id cut my head off but then i would be dead
And I ain't the only mutherfucker thats dying
So lets just die together
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie (lets just die toghter)
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch ass

Foggin’ Up the Window,F.T.F.O.M.F.,2017,"“Oh yeah, oh, slut, take it off, oh, oh, oh yeah”

Your lights are on, it’s dark in the AM, like two, ooh
Which means you can’t see me, haha, but I can see you
Just waitin’ patiently for the bra and panty drop
Dick hard since I been scopin’, can’t wait to jack it off (Skeet)
The longer I peep, the closer my face gets up on the glass
Gotta relax, this is a’ art, don’t want a cap in my ass
But I got this, I’m a pro, perfect camouflage
More than an obsession or a hobby, treat it like my job
Drop them drawers, bitch. Shit, I’ma bust in my pants (Huh?)
Nut in the undies? Nah, that takes out all the romance
*Orgasms* God damn it, ho. The fuck you made me do?
Full load in my white tighties, bitch, now you doomed
Just wanted to rub one out. I never wanted to hurt her
What started out as Peeping Tom shit just escalated to murder
Jumped through the window, her dude is home, no time to check ‘em
Turned around and throw back out, *Gunshots* caught a hot one in the wreck ‘em

Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I can’t help it
Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I feel selfish
It’s so dark. It’s so dark
Very dark out here, very dark and scary
Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I feel selfish

Bitch, there’s a’ eerie legendary killer starin’ through your glass
Obituary filler, scary thriller, here to put you in the past
I stand with dew on the grass, I plan to chew on your ass
Understand it hurted when I screwed on my mask
Mama said pick somebody, smile more. Meet a slutty styled whore
Skeet on the study tile floor. Eat like a nutty wild boar
Complete that bloody vile chore. Reach my buddy, I’ll pour
Some beers. Who cares what’s left up underneath some muddy piled boards
Silly putty, aisle four (Have you seen my childhood?)
I’m Dr. Conrad Murray without the propofol, I choke ‘em all
Rotten egg breath, I’m outside, foggin’ up your windows
Draw a hatchet man,  all the innuendos
Comin’ on 67, moon glares on top of my bald head
Bet none of y’all gets in heaven, who cares, choppin’ ‘em all dead
The number four is all red! Red Fred! Red Fred!
Lumpy goop, chunky soup, you dead on the bed spread

Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I can’t help it
Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I feel selfish
It’s so dark. It’s so dark
Very dark out here, very dark and scary
Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I feel selfish

You hear a twig break, neighbor’s dog barkin’ non stop
Car alarms goin’ off, grab the phone, call the cops
It might be nothing’, or it might just be me, though
Pressed up on the glass, and foggin’ up your window
Steamin’ up your window pane, steamin’ up my glasses
Screamin’ nuts, snortin’ cocaine, screamin’ cut my gashes
Dreamin’ blood pourin’ no rain, dreamin’ of molasses
I even nut more  skeetin’ on her slashes
I don’t give no fucks if you’re 19 or 99
I’m invadin’ your privacy, bitch, and I’m gonna get mine
Serial killer, blood spiller, dome peeler, drug dealer, for realer
Don’t think I ain’t in, I reach for the phone, and I kill ya

Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I can’t help it
Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)
I feel selfish
It’s so dark. It’s so dark
Very dark out here, very dark and scary
Foggin’ up the window (Am I a foggin’ up the glass?)

Out There,Featuring Freshness,2003,"""The wicked clowns and Bushwick Bill are lost in space""
(Violent J)
The car broke down and she was like ""Honey, get the flash light""
Still one in the dash right?
Only cause it's late at night
And who knows
What's out there
She was right tho
Ain't gonna help with a light tho
People dying tonight
Cause yo this maniac is, out there
I'm hanging like a possum
Murder tricks, I got some
Spot them
Look come around to the bottom
And slaughter them, out there
His boo was locked up in the car
On the phone and tripping hard
Screaming
F**k that bitch was scurred
There's a killer out there
Cut that crying shit off
I cut
You die
I get off
I'm crawling up on the car
Trying to rip the moon roof lid off, out there
Bitch turned the wipers on
Hazard lights and blew the horn
I smashed with my axe, and pulled her to the lawn, out there
She kicked me hard, to the grill
With one of them, Doc Martin heels
Murderas, you know how that feels
Your lip be out there
Time to die
Close my eyes
Swung and felt a thump
I done spilt her head in half like a tree stump, out there
(Chorus)
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Lights on in the house
But it's dark outside
You can even close one eye
Look bitch, I'm out there
Camp fire lit
Boy Scout meeting's they talk of me
Even they leaders got memories of me, I'm out there
Forensic scientists try to finger me out
But I'm too quick for their Sheriff's stupid asses
I'm still out there
Pull up all your road blocks
I'm running them them's in my socks
Silently taken out all cops, one by one, I'm out there
Leave they bodies
In the street
Continue on my murder spree
They can believe all my heat
When I pull it out there
Break up into the Zoo
Dress up in a monkey suit
Sticking up families for they loot, my brain, is out there
Handy with an ice pick
Pull it out and use it good
In and out your temple
Blood is squirting all out there
I'm the urban legend you heard at your college dorm
Jump out and squeeze your vocal cords
When you out there
(Chorus)
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing
(Bushwick Bill)
Some where out there a remnance of Bushwick
My mind loads clips at your block
And leave you stuck bitch
A psychopath
With a clasp and a black ski mask
Leave you in body bags
For a news flash
I might be small
But I got big balls
Write my name on the wall
With bloodstains after the brawl
Evil thoughts run deep in my brain
I'm sick and deranged
So picture the pain
Flowing in my veins
Yeah I'm sick
I'm sicker then Hitler
My gat spit streak mothaf**king forbidden scriptures
Niggas run from a gun, forgetting they can't
I drag a Mossberg, cause it won't fit in my pants
I run up in your ride, it's parked and
It's darken
Jump out your glove compartment, sparking
The shit that I do, make many faint
Dead saint
Turn your blood into candy paint
(Chorus)
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-out-there-lyrics

For a little grip now, we been rocking your ass
The future ain't scary cause we got the past
Can't nothing ever take away the Gatherings
You can take what's happening now
Not what I'm rapping about
And I remember every Hallowicked to a T
And every Project Born, Marz, Esham, and Myzery
And even though I don't remember your name
From the instore
Swear to God, I couldn't love you anymore
Do you mention the Abyss at Virginia Beach?
And out of state you're so hot, Juggalos reach
(Juggalos reach)
And what about the Bronco Bowl in Deep Ellem?
And that crazy ass house club in Houston? (Tell them)
Twenty thousand websites, hotlines, and clubs
Gang bangers, codes, nobody's and scrubs
To every last Juggalette that turned me out
Thank you much, and I hope to see you on the next route
You know everybody hates on this world of ours
And if you learn one thing from the Joker Cards
Let it be the other shit is six different views
Diamond any way you choose

Juggalos get pissed when the show's over
Even cities that I leave, they not letting me in
They let me know if they a Juggalo
Through thick and through thin
I like Twiztid

Free standing
And always down to give a helping hand in
And to everybody else out there, do your thing
Cause it ain't no ducking when the hatchet swings
We try to sing, we try to rap
We try to rock and spit

In three years later, you'll look back and tip us a beer

I wanna tell you I love all the letters ya'll
Got them hung up on the fridge
And all up on the garage wall
What about these Mini-Gatherings we hear?
Ya'll don't be surprised when we walk up in there
With Vampiro and Sabu flying above
Representing the Juggalos with nothing but love
On TV, they make them try to hide their shit
But real Juggalos always bear the hatchet
And all the fresh titty bars DJ's with mullets
All nuts while we there, but you hate us and love them
Yes, you groupie as fuck, and good to go
But don't get excited thinking makes you a Juggalo
Yes, we gather once a year, big top above
We give shit like Big Silva nothing but love
But you gotta be fresh and with open mind
Or your ass get left behind
That's why I love ya'll

Complicated World,Phantom: X-Tra Spooky Edition,2015,"All you- all you need to know is
All you- all you- all you need to know is

Why do we have to lock our doors at night?
Why can't we relax and take everything lightly?
People will break in and rob you blind
Rape you and murder you, this world ain't kind
How come the President is always hated?
The whole fucking government is always degraded
Because they lie all the time, and they're all corrupt
They take from the poor, and that shit is fucked up
Why are most of us afraid to step to a hottie?
Why do we get slapped if we compliment her body?
Usually the finer they are, the bigger bitches they are
Unless you gripping some fancy-ass car
How come so many cops are bullies and dickheads?
Why do they always treat us like inferior shit heads?
It's simple: they were all morons and geeks
Now that they got a badge, they think they ain't weak

I wanna know!
All you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong
This world is complicated
If you grow old, you made it
I wanna know!
All you- all you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong
This world is complicated
If you grow old, you made it

Why do we have to pay to get healthcare?
Why don't they just cover it the way they do welfare?
Two reasons: first, medicine is big cash
And if doctors weren't getting paid, they'd treat you like an ass
Question: why did we invade Iraq?
So many of our troops died and ain't comin' back
Well, big black gooey rich oil
Texas tea, that bubbly boil
How do rich people have so many problems?
Seems they'd only have one: people trying to rob 'em
Rich people love cocaine to death
They snort it up they face like the poor do meth
How come there's so many kids without a dad?
So many mothers alone, it's really kinda sad
Because deadbeat dads need a beatin' 'til they half dead
And wake 'em up with a brick to the head

I wanna know!
All you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong
This world is complicated
If you grow old, you made it
I wanna know!
All you- all you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong
This world is complicated
If you grow old, you made it

How come so many people are sick in this world?
Like creepy old molesters who stalk little girls
Because it's up to us to vigilante the problem
Beat a pedophile 'til he's crippled, solve 'em
Why do so many homeless ask you for change?
Why don't they look for a job? I find it strange?
'Cause most of 'em ain't really homeless at all
They just lookin' for a big fat white crack ball
How come Robin Williams had to kill himself?
What the fuck is depression? What the fuck is mental health?
A killer, an underestimated health crisis
They should study for a cure, no matter what the price is
How come us juggalos are so degraded
Dissed on, labeled, picked on, and hated?
It's easy: because we're so original and sweet
Misunderstood ninjas they would never defeat

I wanna know!
All you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong
This world is complicated
If you grow old, you made it
I wanna know!
All you- all you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong
This world is complicated
If you grow old, you made it
I wanna know!
All you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong
This world is complicated
If you grow old, you made it
I wanna know!
All you- all you- all you need to know is
Watch your back and be strong

With a bag full of goodies for the girls and boys
Like a nine millimeter, fuck toys (fuck toys)
It's December 25th baby jingle my balls
Handin' out yellow snow cones to all a y'all
This year I believe Santa Claus went crazy
Caught his ass slangin' rocks to my old lady
Santa and Snowman bringin under this shit
Happy Hanukkah motherfuckers, suck my dick
Come and let us know what you want for Christmas Time
Whatchu want?
Where's my fucking brother?
And whatchu want?
A big chocolate donut
Everybody, tell us what you want
The Yanks to win a fuckin series
In Christmas time you will have all out fun and cheer. In Christmas time we all will have much fun and holicheer
Shaggy 2 Dope:
Ring a ding ding go the sound of my sleigh bell
Reindeer fly crooked (Why?) Cause they drunk as hell
That's how we do when we got shit to do
After all this Christmas Eve and a fifth too
All these little richie boys up real nice
No Sega, Donkey Man, and fuck Old Spice
A hooker for little Jimmy
Timmy get some Henney
Santa puff a jimmy in a minny
Fuck Kenny
Georgy, aah, instructions for a séance
And Santa ain't gettin' shit but two dead parents
And now it's back to the Southwest Pole
All Skanta Claws got for Christmas was coal
What do you want? What do you want? What do
Whatchu want?
A little peek at your butt
And whatchu want?
A Craftman socket set
Everybody, tell us what you want
A whole elephant
Whatch want?
Some ice on my gold fronts
And whatchu want?
I'll suck your dick
Everybody, tell us what you want
A platinum plus plaque
Whatchu want?
Moon Glorius
And whatchu want?
A sinful Christmas
Haha
Everybody, tell us what you want

Freakazoid baseheads sparin' changin'
Homeless hobos pushin' dead bodies in a cart
Uh, listen to the good part
Pigs are outdoors, roamin' the land
Chewin' on somebody's head. I don't understand
It's to much for my nugget to process
So I stop the car, step out, and get undressed
Then climb the trees and kick it with the owls
You don't like that you can suck my balls
Just me and my homeboy Lloyd, you see
Probably can't. Nobody can see him but me
Lunatics, zombies, and goons
Roaming underneath the 17 moons
Of Delray. Hell ray suicide poison
Can't beat 'em. Fuck it. I'd might as well join 'em

To snack on. His name is Willaby Rags

It's easy, life every day
Knife up to my neck with two days left to pay
Shit’s all good. Throw me some love, props
My wife found that hooker's panties in my fuckin' glove box
Shit’s feel nice, on top of my game
I'm out of last chances, got warrants all on my name
I'm happy, I'm straight on track, right
You got it shootin' heroin, but got off to crack, right

I'm doin' really well these days
(Oh the paranoia hasn't beat it)
I’m doin’ really well these days
(The entire sickness, I defeat it)
I'm doin’ really well these days
(Oh the paranoia hasn't beat it)
I'm doin' really well these days

My future lookin’ bright as the sun
Four separate entities all trying to kill me at once
Good times, though, these days are all good
They cut my homie's head off and stuck it on my car hood
(La la la la)

I love it, so give me more of it, the pressure
I love it, so give me more of it. Can't get around
Or above it, so give me more, and I get to bum rush
Blood gush, ants crush, spontaneous combust!

A face, though no one knows its me, and yet it helps them notice me
Cops don't even need a print, they just toss me in and throw the key
These times all as good as can be
Cops don't even need a print, they just toss me in and throw the key
There's a fuckin' vampire floating in my window stool
Tell me, what the fuck does he want with my neck? That ain't cool
Find some bitch's neck, Lucy. Don't get stabbed with a steak
And tell Frankenstein to fuck off, out there in a car waitin'

“Mommy, who's Daddy talkin' to?”

Life is a walk in the park
I seen my shadow get killed by another, ripped out its heart
There's no place I'd rather be
Take me off this earth. The whole world's destroying me

I love it, so give me more of it, the pressure
I love it, so give me more of it. Can't get around
Or above it, so give me more, and I get to bum rush

I love it, so give me more of it, the pressure
I love it, so give me more of it. Can't get around
Or above it, so give me more, and I get to bum rush
Blood gush, ants crush, spontaneous combust!

I walked in, grabbed a pop, and took off my jeans and stretched out
Then it hit me: this ain't my house
But I was so tired, so wired, so expired
That I decided to borrow and admire
But I woke up with a rifle's barrel all up in my nostril
The cops came, dropped me off at the hospital
Get me a shot of spazmatic relief
They needed surgery to remove an arm from my teeth

But I'm doin' really well these days
(Oh the paranoia hasn't beat it)
I'm doin' really well these days
(The entire sickness, I defeat it)
I'm doin' really well these days
(Oh the paranoia hasn't beat it)
I'm doin' really well these days!

I'm okay. No problem's here
If I get bloody enough, the sun will dry me up; I'll disappear
Wonderful, my life is grand
I love it when my head explode again and again

I love it, so give me more of it, the pressure
I love it, so give me more of it. Can't get around
Or above it, so give me more, and I get to bum rush

I Feel The Same Wickid Hungers Calling From Deep
They Tell Me To Hunt Devil In They' Robes And Slippers
Take Some Rope Clippers, A Black Cloak And Scissors
Now I'm Standin' In The Back Yard If I Don't Regret
Steady Sweatin' When I Do This, Ain't No Forgettin'
Enter Through The Back Door While Everybodys Asleep
I See They Tighty And Neat, I Bout' To Bloody The Sheets
It's Gonna Be A Blood Splatter Expert Feild Date
Because I'm Killin' Today To Take This Feelin' Away

I Threw Her In The Trunk Got Home And Found Her Suffercated Waste
I Had To Cut The Bitch Up, Just Met To Shut The Bitch Up
I Never F**ked That Hoe, They Said I Did Man She Was A Slut
I'm Sick And Tired Of They Lies Thus' Everybody Dies
Break Into Some Homes
I Take The Spoon And Bloody Eyes

But You Can't See The Darkness I Do
Maybe I'm Heartless Its True
But Every Part Is Cause You

Playin’ In The Woods (Outtake),Mike E. Clark’s Extra Pop! Emporium,2012,"Ooh
I like playing in the woods at night
All alone in the dark - I don't need a flashlight
If it's warm out - I get naked
Except for my shoes - My feet can't take it
June-bugs, bees and mosquitoes
Snatch them out of the air with my tongue
And eat those
I love a full moon let it glow mm-mm
Illuminate, shadows grow and loom there
Ooh yeah, lay here in the leaves
Earth come crawl over me please
Snails ,fleas ,snakes and centipedes
Many friends in need - I let them enter me
My secret life in the woods is crazy
The sun comes up too soon and chase me away
But I'll be back, alone
To kick it with the crickets
Right at home

I like playing in the woods at night
(No campfire)
Just me and the moonlight
I like playing in the woods at night
Coyotes, crows and cowwebs
I like playing in the woods at night
(No campfire)
Just me and the moonlight
I like playing in the woods at night
Ooh, everything seems to begin closing in
What the fuck was that ? There it goes again
I don't wanna run - I wanna be a friend
And bond with the otherside, let me in
Show me how to fry, kill, fight
Be one with the night, not to punk and fright
To be alone in the dark for miles takes heart
But am i really alone ? That's the best part
I lay there - they take little bites
And it hurts, but i don't move
Show them that's its alright
It hurts more when bigger shit shows up
They tear chunks off me, but i ain't no softy
I'm Haaard!
I do whatever I please
Play dead for hours - buried in the leaves
My midnight playground, my private park
To run to alone naked child of the dark
I'm saying

Caterpillars cling to the tree trunks
Salamanders, snakes and skunks
Blood bats - they don't need eyes
To snag off anything that flies
I live a wild life
So why can't I be wildlife ? With a hunting knife
My feet sink deep in the mood
After it rain - I can't complain
No exhaust, no noise pollution
No retribution of evolution
If it ain't nature - I fucking hate ya'
Kill or be killed - Till something ate ya;
Twigs ,bushes, muddy den
Chipmunk in my mouth, bloody chin
The moooon follows me because it loves me
The one does nature does me

I like playing in the woods at night

Intro (The Pendulum Tome),The Pendulum Tome,2000,"It was a soft gentle night
In the little town of, of, well, your town
The gentle breeze swept the streets
Creating that pleasant howl that these kind town folks
Have enjoyed for so many, many years
The wind chimes sent their peaceful melodies
Into the ears of the sleepy residents
But the unusual was approaching in the distance
Something evil was heading towards this small town
While the residents slept, something crept
Slithered and crawled its way through the quiet streets
Guided by the moon light
These frightening strangers set up tents and rides
Shows and games, there were savage jesters
And wicked ringmasters
There were horrid freak shows
And sights only the impending doom will witness
They brung with them the carnage
That they had lived with for eternity
The morning is a new day
The people of this town will unwillingly witness
The show of their lives, only rumored to exist
You will be the next to die helplessly

And mashin, in a black Navigator baby
100 spoke Dayton Dayday today be payday

And i'm the beginner, winner, we fuckin during dinner
To bang her biscuit out our first time out is nothin new
I fuck her on the plate of food

I'm boatin' an Impala, hood is open and i'm scopin
Bitches flaggin' me down, wit' they tittie nipples
But see it ain't that simple, bitches now'll leave you crippled
If I stuck my dick in every ugly bitch that road up
My dick would make you wanna throw up, I would be so to 'up
And I don't wanna have my dick look like a cucumber
Bumply, green and lumber, fuck all that
I gets picky, I like to take and floss my hoes
I can't be flossin dirty bitches that got mossy toes
It's a million hottie hootchies all up on this earth
Taste what life is worth man, I don't wanna die

You can bash out all my front teeth if you really want to
Been wantin' to go part my grill out anyway so fuck you
I wanna live to see the world rain diamonds and pearls
And treasures, for all the little boys and girls
I want to live to see my great grandchildren have they kids
And be so old that I can't even lift my eyelids
I want to live to see the lights of the Goodyear blimp
It's gone Ice Cube's a bitch
Psychopathic ryder baby, call me Bullet, I be dumpin
I get your brakes a pumpin everytime I'm droppin somethin
And I went solo so you know I flow like Rollie Pollie's
Roll up in they shill, bankin helly mill

Well‚? (Talk to me‚ baby!)

I'm? friends with Red Fred‚ Flip the Rat, and Frankie the Frog
For conversation, without question‚ that Frankie can be a hog
Always gots advice for me and shares his life story
His?  was ""follow or die,"" and I heed by that warning
I? hear the ""RIBBIT, RIBBIT"" at night like a cricket
No hanky panky‚ grab my shank and stab me, Frankie wanna kick it
He? told me in the morning I best be on my guard
To greet this weak-ass  girl in my yard, Rebecca
And Frankie says heavens, he shouldn't be hard
And if she won't accept what's left, accept, or start taking charge
There's? me, nervous, see? As if I deserve it, rejected
My respect for  service as if own purpose reflected me
Effectively, Rebecca was corrected once my punch connected
A bunch connected, and at once I was accepted
We have so much in common; it's astounding, I swear
She regains consciousness, gagged and bound in her chair
I sucked the dirt off her toes, we're both now in our underwear
She said, ""I'm cold,"" I said, ""I know. Death will warm you, my dear.""
Let's snuggle in my Snuggie. I'll show you magic, I swear
Lose that thong, I'll make my  disappear

I keep mother's final gift to me dusted on in my bottom cupboard (drip)
My little piggy bank Frog (talk to me, baby!)
Blot scribbled on the price tag, tape stuck to the bottom
It says more than just (drip) when I rub it (talk to me, baby!)
I'm hearing, ""RIBBIT, RIBBIT, RIBBIT"" and I love it
It says more than just ""RIBBIT"" when I rub it (talk to me, baby!)
I'm hearing, ""RIBBIT, RIBBIT, RIBBIT"" and I love it
It says more than just ""RIBBIT"" when I rub it (talk to me, baby!)

Well, Frankie told me to kiss her, but he was wrong, I suppose
I close my eyes to try, but Rebecca head butted my nose
He told me ""try again,"" and I complied
But then she screamed for me to ""Get off!"" and bit my lip off
My bloody chin, I try to lick off
Staring in the mirror, jacking my dick off
Something about our blood mix, it makes me get off
I never saw Rebecca's rope slip off, oh no
I felt the blast, slash, flash, glass crash, smashed my face
Bitch bashed me in the head with a vase. I gave chase
I'm slipping in place, my blood dripping, I'm ripping after her
I'm tripping, 'k? No looking, 'cause I'm inflicting a massacre
You hear Rebecca gurgle, and some sniffin',  right?
And what's left? A mutilated pile of her, smile of her
My froggy helped us find each other
You in freezer bags and on my plate
Now let's find your mother

I keep mother's final gift to me dusted on in my bottom cupboard (drip)

BECCA BITES! BECCA BITES! It's not that I hate her
It's just that with every swallow I dominate her, I celebrate her
I made my Frog a plate, two fat Becca burgers
We can feed the needy, speedy! Some good come from this seedy murder
Dibs on that neck bone! Boiled til the fat gone
Texts from her mama said, “when you coming home?”
I text back, “Mom! I met a really great guy, a winner!
Grab Dad, okay? He wants to have us for dinner!”
A little later, I heard a bell, like, “What the hell?” Then, some pounding
Oh, it’s her parents at the door. I’ve never heard that sound
I let ‘em in. Me and my frog have never had guests
“Another joker, huh? Ha ha ha, my husband’s the best!”
Rebecca’s almost ready. Fresh hot hors d’oeuvres I bring
I call ‘em Becca Bites. She really put her heart in them things
“Chewy. What kind of meat is that?” I think it’s… the butt muscle
“Yeah, okay, but what kind-” “Ricky, honey, don’t fuss over it.”
I grab the meat cleaver. “Hey, is that an antique?”
Take a closer look! Buried it, in between her eyes, six inches deep
I yoked it out, swung again, severed her whole clean
Her dad had the coolest look on his mug that I’ve ever seen
But then I shot him

Love For Dem Gangsters,"Smothered, Covered & Chunked",2012,"Aww shit, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't step
On a funky-ass track jump back
Strapped with a axe in the back and a 7-8 lak
Unclean, gangsta lean, I blow green
None the gangbang like it ain't no thing
I hang with OG killas don't set trip
Or you might get stabbed in the fucking head
Wake the death when I bump the street
I kick juggalo shit to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, waving my hatchet flags
Leaving hell of filed enemies rocking toe tags
With Shaggz and Hutch and a folt, pros
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know as we kick the corers
Givin love to them killas that I can be 4 us

If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right)
If you got love for them ninjas
Let me hear you say hooo if you’re straight juggalo (hooooo!)
If you got love for them butterflies
Let me hear you say ooooh, lettes we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for the family
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!)

Chump chump on fools with the quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get props for the way that I kick this
I’m a ninja, a straight ninja (who's that?)
The southwest choke-doke
And I squeezed so hard that you felt it broke
Showed up at your funeral and smoked ya folk
A juggalo like me let a scrotum swing
Now I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I tell it like it straight-up is
If here’s somebody in my trunk you better mind your business
And my Mossberg bangs like thunder, bury you under

OG's show the way, so I give love to 'em

If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right)
If you got love for them ninjas
Let me hear you say hooo if you’re straight juggalo (hooooo!)
If you got love for them butterflies
Let me hear you say ooooh, lettes we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for the family
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!)

So you can hear my shit bump from Compton to the D
The O.G. H-U-T-C-H Hustla
Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
And a… Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it comes to me
Cause I'm the long dick bust-a-nut like my nigga Eazy
Bitches can't see me, hoes think I'm crazy
But I don't think so, because I'm straight loco
I give a fuck about a skanless bitch
I let it hit it one time if you suck this dick
I won't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is when I gives love to ya, Wooo!!

If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right )

Demon Faces,Psychopathics from Outer Space 2,2003,"Motherfuckers always trying to steal your energy, as soon as they see you shining, and going some place or doing something. The demon faces come out and they just hate on you for no reason at all, just because you shine
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I, I don't know, every time I see a video show
I see horrors and sharp teeth, why?
Most these puppets open butt holes up wide
I can't even walk down the street
Without these demons swinging off my meat
Demon faces appear everywhere
Mothafuckers trying to analyze my nut hair
(Anybody Killa)
I see demons everywhere
But I just keep walking like I don't care
When I'm at the mall or on the streets
They are always at drive thru's when I'm looking for eats
I can't shake them. every time I look ones coming
If I lose it, I'm afraid I'm gonna start dumping
Stay calm, clear my brain
Set fire to a face so I don't see it again
(Chorus - Esham)
They're always watching me
They see me spending money
I see the evil in your eyes
The same died they really don't want me to fly
Now I know why
(YOU GOT A DEMON FACE!)
(Monoxide Child)
Are you ready for the jump off?
I'm in a traffic jam with the punk ass cops behind me
In a raid van understand I got a demon in my trunk
And it's face change form and the hater got bucked
He kept looking at me and I started to panic
So I nutted the fuck up and let his whole crew have it
The cop hit the lights and pulled right by me
Now I'm of to burry this bitch behind me
(Violent J)
Demon coming around looking like GWAR
See them in my minds eye, I know who they are
Face pissed off, I'm there and I can't keep calm
I'm steadily exploding, just chilling, the bomb
I see Medusa seduce them with aids in they ass
And a band of necks trying to chase my cash
Better go knock on the van with some of them local openers
Cause they be hoping for you whores...
(Chorus - Esham)
They're always watching me
They see me spending money
I see the evil in your eyes
The same died they really don't want me to fly
Now I know why
(YOU GOT A DEMON FACE!)
(Jamie Madrox)
So many have that demon face, think the so real
They call me fake for goodness sake
Man I just don't know
But I advise you not to trust any them hoes
Them things ain't eyes in the front of they head
They hazard lights one and the walking dead
You're a talking head with a tail to match
Worried about my (DEMONS) mind your own scratch
(Esham)
Now I done been in all types of holy places
Situations with demon faces full of hatred
Condemn the sacred Adam & Eve was in the garden naked
That's why I never talk to a snake bitch
So I won't be bit in the snake pit
Game is immune to a venomous fake bitch
That's why they can't take it
(Chorus - Esham)
They're always watching me
They see me spending money
I see the evil in your eyes
The same died they really don't want me to fly
Now I know why

Rosemary,The Calm,2005,"LET ME IN THIS BITCH!
LET ME GET SOME CHANGE THEN!
MAN FUCK THIS DRESS CODE, BITCH!
I CAN DANCE MOTHERFUCKER!
I CAN DANCE!

I'm on crack, walkin' alleyways downtown
People drop change so I'm checkin the ground
Behind the nightclub, I can hear the bump outside
I hear em laughin' and drinkin' and dancin', gettin' live
And I'm lonely, graspin' on my 55 cent
I don't know where my meds went, they been spent
And I'm bent, I don't remember yesterday at all
I'm barkin' at the moon as I'm pissin' on the wall
People grippin' new cars, checkin' out a few bars
They see me comin', side step a few yards
I'm like a bad man, holdin' out my crusty ass hand
Scoldin' an imaginary friend
I'm scary and I'm blackin out, just about to lose all hope
I was peerin' through the window of a nightclub scopin'
And there she was, everything I planned for
On the spotlight on the dance floor, gravitatin'

She kept her rhythm, her feet to the floor
She dipped down, she did the twirl and she shook it some more
She's groovy..
She made me happy, I tried to refrain
I walk on but then I run right back, I'm at it again
She's callin'..

I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle
Carjacked a minivan and punched full throttle
Right back to the spot then I waited to get her
But when she came out, she had a bitch boy wit her
No problem, hit the pipe and follow em home
And my imaginary friend gon' have to leave me alone
Cause it's really goin' down, I feel it pullin' me down
Knowin' I'm a wicked clown, I gotta throw it down
She pulled in, her and her fuck ass strolled in
I hit the pipe again and hop out the stolen
Jumpin' through backyards, clumsy and trippin'
It don't matter when your goal is a throat slittin'
And the way she danced lit flames
Burnin' me alive out here, quit playin' games
I'm on the side of her house, lookin' in through the back den
And there she was again wit him, dancin'

She kept her rhythm, her feet to the floor
She dipped down, she did the twirl and she shook it some more
She's groovy..
She made me happy, I tried to refrain
I walk on but then I run right back, I'm at it again
She's callin'..

I walked right in through the front door unlocked
No gun cocked, cinder block
Clown paint, I came here to dance boogie
Mhm Ahh, and maybe tap a little nookie
I'm creepin', music bumpin' in the back
I'm down the hallway hidin' behind the coat rack
And here come the punk fuck to get champagne
I take the rock and pop him wit the damn thing
Hit him in the back of the head
He dropped the wine, but I caught it in time
I had to take his life wit a steak knife
I washed it and put it back, I'm keepin' the place nice
I'm comin' bitch, you want to olive or somethin'?
I'm fuckin' straight up the streets but I'm down wit some frontin'
I want to tango...but instead
I'm still outside the club and it's all in my head

She kept her rhythm, her feet to the floor
She dipped down, she did the twirl and she shook it some more
She's groovy..
She made me happy, I tried to refrain
I walk home but then I run right back, I'm at it again
She's callin'..",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-rosemary-lyrics
Bang! Pow! Boom! Sampler,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"“Is that a dick in your ear?”
Would you let a man stick a dick in your ear? I think not. Yet you continue to listen to lame radio stations every day, which is just like having a big dick in your ear!
“Fuck the radio!” (Welcome to the wicked shit)

(Woo!) Heheheheheheh. You won’t be hearing us on 102.Foo!
Or 88.Hate!
Nah, we don’t give a fuck, fuck, fuck about that shit-
You see, the radio is afraid of us!
Our music takes you on an adventure, into the dark realm of the Dark Carnival, presented only by
By, by, by Psychopathic Records! (Whoop whoop!)
We are the most hated band in the world
The Duke of the Wicked
And the Southwest Side Strangler
The Insane Clown Posse!
From Detroit City Murderous
It’s ICP
Big Violent J
And Shaggy 2 Dope
Back with super producer Mike E. Clark
Exploding
On September 1st
With the release of their brand spankin’ new album
The incredible Bang Pow Boom

With a Bang! (BANG!)
Say goodbye to everything!
Your complete annihilation is the reason he came!
And a Pow! (POW!)
He's wiping everything out!
Turn your whole fucking world into a mushroom cloud!
And a Boom! (BOOM!)
It's your inevitable doom!
Nobody escapes, and everybody's consumed!
With a Bang! (BANG!)
I’m sick of the fuckin’ radio telling me what the fuck to listen to
What’s fresh, what’s not fresh, what’s hot
What about the shit I wanna hear? Like some underground shit
Some fuckin’ real shit
Man, the Wicked Clowns are that untapped, untouched shit
Unfucked with by that mainstream
The real, authentic, underground wicked shit (Woo!)
Bang! Pow! Boom! Features 17 crispy-ass tracks of all-out Dark Carnival wicked shit madness
Including the brand new instant horror classic juggalos are bound to love: Fonz Pond

The water's thick with murky mud
The weeds are red like splattered blood
In this pond a spirit cries
Snakes and bugs replaced his eyes
Some don't believe and dare to swim
Something under will pull you in
Hidden deep in the wild brush
If you know where it is, then hush
(We almost there)
Don't go in the water!
At Fonz Pond
Don't go in the water!
At Fonz Pond

Fonz Pond is about a haunted pond, somewhere deep, deep, hidden within the woods, and all kinds of kids dare each other to jump in the water, and go up there and end up missing and shit. Something pulls them in the water. It’s, uh, it’s spooky. Also, the street banger for stranglers called, “To Catch a Predator”

I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I’ma earn
But it sure is fun (to catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (to catch a predator)
And it sure is fun (to catch a predator)
Violent J poses as a child on the internet and catches pedophiles at his house. Then, he hangs them by one foot in the basement and tortures them. It’s fuckin’ awesome
Only on the amazing Bang! Pow! Boom! can you find this high-energy spazmatic flavor bad boy right here (The Bone)
The song is like an instant shot of energizement (The Bone)
And it’s called (The Bone) The Bone. (The Bone) (The Bone) (The Bone)

The bailiff came at me with a pair of cuffs in his hand
He was taking me to jail, but that wasn't my plan
I broke the arm off my chair, stabbed him hard as I can
He got the bone... HE GOT THE BONE!
I jumped over the others and kicked the door down with my feet
Ran down the steps and headed right into the street
Waved down a car, the driver stopped and looked at me
He got the bone... (Get out, bitch!) HE GOT THE BONE!
I hit the gas and I'm swerving in and out of my lane
Coppers on my tail, I'm driving like I'm insane
Old man up in the street, crossing slowly with his cane
He got the bone... HE GOT THE BONE!
Smashed into a post, I jumped outta my car
Hopped over a wall, running through someone's yard
Ran into a house, the father tried to be hard
He got the bone... (Bone muthafucka!) HE GOT THE BONE!
 Mom!
 We would love to keep playing that song for you, but until Bang! Pow! Boom! comes out on September 1st
YOU GOT THE BONE!
Collectors, peep this out (What?)
Bang! Pow! Boom! will be available in three different flavors (Ooh!)
You’ll notice in stores that the CD comes in three different colors. Well, that’s not the only thing different about them. Each of the three versions also have their own unique album intro and hidden track. Which version will you cop? Green, red, or blue? Hm? (Hmm)
Featuring absolutely no special guest, ICP return to their original Dark Carnival ways on hilarious tracks like “Boing Boing”

Bitches get sprung when I walk by
I dunno if it's my ass, or maybe cause I talk fly
But no lie, as soon as I speak to 'em
They all want me to screw em
And “Juggalo Island”

We can have fun. (Ha ha ha ha ha!)
We can let go, by the water
Bang! Pow! Boom!, Sunny like high noon
Met some ‘lettes, and they all comin’ over soon
Have a luau, I'm getting blew out
Come over here if you ever get threw out
We gotta place for ya-
(And) (And) And the slow-rollin’ thunder-slammin’ masterpiece (masterpiece)
“I found a body”

I found a body (found a body)
I sure as hell could use a buddy (use a buddy)
I'm lonely, I could use a homie (a homie)
Ever since I got out, stress has been on me
(Stress has been on me...)
(This song) (This song) (This song) (This song)
This song is about finding a dead body in an alley. It’s grizzly and bringing it home to hang out with. It’s brutal. Classic ICP wicked shit, psychotic, Mike E. Clark is sick for this one (sick) (sick) (sick) (sick) (sick)
Man, the Wicked Clowns are not afraid to go to the extreme to entertain. That’s just what they do, and that’s who like this shit. People who are into extreme shit
(BANG! POW! BOOM!)
This CD sampler also comes with a ninja decoder tool
Hang onto this high-tech device and find secret important messages hidden within the massive booklet that comes with Bang! Pow! Boom!

This is my sidekick Fat Pat
He goes ""Ha ha ha ha"" and all a that (That's right!)
Anyhow on my way here I almost died
This bitch in front of me was like a hundred and five
They worry about drunks, and late night truckers
Old ass bitches try to kill motherfuckers (Ha ha ha ha)
This lady's got her left blinker on for an hour or more
Then she makes a right into my side door
This comedy shit's gettin' old
The game is to be sold, not to be told
Oh yeah, you can feel the excitement right?
Snoop dogg is with us tonight

I like my chili hot. As a matter of fact I like my chili so God damn hot
That you can cook a hog's ass in a spoonful
When a workin' man such as myself wants a little hot fixin, I reach for
That bottle of momma's God Damn Hot Chili
Smooth tender chunks with chili beans filled with momma's hot bastard
Bacon bits, and drizzled with just the right amount of thick savory sauce
Drippin' with noodle nuggets and Texas tough onions
Mm mm that's hot, God Damn Hot

They call me Snoop Dogg and I can raise your arm
So any MC that disagree with me

While other fools stare and, scratch their balls (What?)
They want to be like you, they want to try to steal your flow

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
Some bitch ass nigga tryin' to steal my flow
But I don't pay em no attention
Oh, should I mention?
I'm all about the money and ridin' in cars with suspension
Bouncin', bankin' up corners smokin' dough
Smokin' that weed, hangin' out with my locs and folks
Don't give a fuck about nothin' at all
That's why I'm known to the world as big motherfuckin' Snoop Dogg

And sittin behind them chillin in a chair

It's some other man in the hand in hand
Now she looks so happy you don't understand
See this is an illusion, it never came true

Your wife can't smile cuz ya knocked her teeth out
And she can't see straight from gettin hit
Cuz you're a fat fuckin drunk piece of shit
But it's all good here, come have a beer

Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Look who's next it's Mr. Clark
The dirty old man from the trailer park
You got your ticket? Thanks take your coat off
And later on, why not, I'll rip your throat off
""Lets take a walk down the hallway
It's a long way it, it takes all day""
And when you get to the end you'll find a chair
You see all the blood, yeah your boy was just here
We get all different kind of people comin through
Richies, chickens and bitches just like you
In the Halls everybody gets a turn
To sit and witness your illusion before you burn
What do we have here, oh yeah, no way
It looks like your kids and they okay
Your daughter's chillin up in college top grade
And your son's a fuckin doctor, phat paid
They got families and kids and it's all good
They even coach little league in the neighborhood
Is this true have ya really seen tha holy ghost?
Nah, bitch, not even close!
Back to reality your son's on crack
And your daughter's got nut stains on her back
And they both fuckin smell like shit
And live in the gutter and sell crack to each other
When they were kids you'd beat em and leave em home
And even whip em with the cord on the telephone
And that reminds me man hey ya gotta call
Watch your step to Hell...it's a long fall!
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Ah, it's time to pack up and move to the next town
But we forgot Mr. Bigot, okay, dig it
We can't show you an illusion cuz we're all packed
But I'll still cut ya neck out, hows that?
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into

Don't look now, your life is gone

But you won't recall
Cause Michael Jackson squeezed up on some little kids balls
What you consider DRAMA
Ain't all that
It's just that your wack
With your intergalactic satellite data compress
Yes, but we can't feed the homeless
And then OJ's wack story unfolded
Everybody watched that while Okalahoma exploded
900 good reasons why this world don't really care
Thats what it costs for a wheel chair!
What you know bout terrible?
Terrible, you don't know what's terrible
Terrible, what you know bout terrible?
Terrible, you don't know what's terrible
That's right bitch

With you next to your grand daddy underground
Deck yo bitch-ass, again and again

Wave my flag as I walk your streets

Hang out the window chuckin' hand grenades
Got the flame thrower for them morning raids
Stole a space shuttle so I can do a drive-by on the whole planet

High Rise,The Eye of the Storm ,2007,"The floor 'round his body slowly started to crack
He was screamin' but no one could do nothin' but step back
He plunged below until the level beneath
Broke five ribs both hands and blew out his teeth
But the level below is where they all want his position
They all look the other way and continue with bull shittin'
The floor's crackin' again he screams help someone
And then smashed down right through it like something engulfed him

There once was a man of power who lived on top of his high rise (his high rise)
Bloody red were his eyes, they say wealthiest in town (in town)
First his chair crushed beneath him, even with the help of his top guys (top guys)
They couldn't lift him up that day somethin' was pullin' him down (down)

The floor 'round his body slowly started to crack
He was screamin' but no one could do nothin' but step back
He plunged below until the level beneath
Broke five ribs both hands and blew out his teeth
But the level below is where they all want his position
They all look the other way and continue with bull shittin'
The floor's crackin' again he screams help someone
And then smashed down right through it like something engulfed him

His beat up and broken body blasting its way down the high rise (high rise)
Leaving a hole on every level, which others gather around (around)
He's screaming as he's falling don't let them take me from my life (my life)
Dropping tier by tier something was pulling him down
Ahhh

Crashing down through every level all the people turn and look away
Somebody help me, help me
Somebody help me, help me
Crashing down through every level all the people turn and look away
Somebody help me, help me
Somebody help me, help me

He was old and weak and frail (frail frail), he casted hell from his high rise (his high rise)
Some say his building was so tall so on the world he looked down (down)
I bet now he wishes it wasn't built from the ground up a mile (o o o)
Every level brings him closer down to whatever's in the ground (whatever's in the ground)

The floor 'round his body slowly started to crack
He was screamin' but no one could do nothin' but step back
He plunged below until the level beneath
Broke five ribs both hands and blew out his teeth
But the level below is where they all want his position
They all look the other way and continue with bull shittin'
The floor's crackin' again he screams help someone
And then smashed down right through it like something engulfed him
Nobody really seemed to care much on any level
Watchin' him fall and guessin' that he'll meet the devil
His head hit a rock maybe a pipe I don't know and know
But he was dead and now he's still got eight floors to go
He landed in a kitchen on a tray of steak blades
Even though he was dead his hair went flippin' off the maze
What was left of his body smashed through all the floors
A mangled ball of meat rolled out the front doors",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-high-rise-lyrics
Dirt Ball,Heavy Metal 2000 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),UnKnown,"(feat. Twiztid)
Galacto Inspector do you read me?
Yes Captain
Status?
Completed
Your mission was to land on the Dirtball and explore it thoroughly
You were to monitor the activities of a common life on the Dirtball
And study peoples life styles
Their general habits of living in their strange society
Yes
Have you done that Galacto Inspector?
Yes I have Captain
Very well, may we have your report?
A strange place this Dirtball is
A lot of guns a lot of rich folks spitting on bums
A lot of hoodlums
These are just the bums that are really pissed off
Why? Probably cuz they been ripped off by the system
Cops, they ride around in little cars
And throw folks behind bars, like little jars
They supposed be there just to serve and protect
But they just punch faces a lot, and choke necks
Then they got the higher ups they call judges, and they rule the land
This I don't understand
First of all they like to dress this bitch up in a robe
On top of all that, ""What?"" he's mad old
And he hates anybody that looks different then he did back when he was a
Kid
But that shit was like 400 years ago
Captain ""Yes Galacto"" I just don't know
Any kid that was going to jail. Yeah?
He looked me dead in the face and said ""Stale.""
Then my cloaking device must of went dead. Why?
Cause the old ass judge looked at me and said
(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
Very interesting, thank you Galacto Inspector
Now probes Data (Day-ta) and Data (Da-ta), do your read me?
Yes, here sir
What information were you able to gather for us on your recent voyage to the
Dirtball?
This is professor Data
My transmission signal is weak and my communication is shattered
We came in contact with several different specimens of life
Everything has got a price even if it's wrong or right
Upon sight people judge and stereo type
Their forms of government and religion are glorified
Purified as the waters that are now polluted
Members of the flock recruited for duty, locked up, or instituted
This is doctor Data I phase with the planet to see how they medicate her
She's high off that cane
Depending how you slang you can get most anything
From a nickel bag of grain to a lucy worth of cane
Maintain communication Data here again
Their leader is determined by the vote of many men
Although he's only human and slightly over weight
He control's and manipulates their whole United States
I call to the white castle
Secret service on the phone giving me a hassle
He said the information I requested was denied
Before he hung up the phone he took a deep breath, stopped, and replied
(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
Judging from the information so far collected
The Dirtball may not be the ideal place to land our craft
After receiving this information we'll make our final judgment
Fleek are you there?
I'm here, but hold up captain cause this ain't good
I'm getting chased by some fat rednecks in white hoods
I think there trying to kill me ""Well what do you mean?""
It seems they got a problem with the fact that I'm green
I guess on the Dirtball they all hate each other
If it ain't were your from, it's your skin color
Let me get my phaser tron out, hold up (buzz)
""What was that?""
I smoked 'em
But what really fuckin turns my tentacles is their relationships
They swell each other's lips
I see men that ain't shit in their daily life
So they come home drunk and beat they wife
She forgives him when he say's he didn't mean it
You ask me they can both suck my petty lip
I give up captain beam me back to Zelaloovy
Another thing they love to watch horror movies
But your not allowed to be scary on a CD
They tried to ban this one group ICP
I went to see 'em in concert J grabbed me by the head
And then he took his microphone and said 
(Chorus x6)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(Chorus x4)
Get the fuck out
So get the fuck out",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-dirt-ball-lyrics
Mountain Girl,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2011,"I was wanted in town for a serious crime
Packed up for the hills started farming swine
When I potted sweet miss Caroline
Fuck Micheal and Paul the girl is mine
We made love in the barn on a pile of dung
She had a meth issue I was wild and drunk
But was love L-O-V-U-E
I hit it with a pitchfork now you do me
Yeah we experimented our love was cemented
She said we was forever and I figured she meant it
Until Caroline decided to spill
She was promised to another, her cousin Bill
I'm standing there thinking this wasn't real
Ripped out my heart how does it feel
She left me for dead a buzzards meal
I all but gave up that was until
Soup cans was tied to the back of his tractor
About to get hitched he couldn't be happier
Shotgun wedding I brought the shotty
Caroline ain't mine, I'm poppin' everybody
-thats right y'all right then and there J staked his claim on sweet miss
By way of shotgun I might add
And he took back the woman he loved
Together they ran off hand in hand
And he took back the woman he loved
Hand in hand into the wild mountainside
Cousin Bill wasn't done he gathered a posse
Tried to act hard but his eyes were glossy
They had hound dogs, guns and torches
Family's watched sat right on the porches
Tryna track us
Sure to find us and doon attack u
Me and Caroline paid it no mind
We was humping even though we had no time
She was too find
Pulled my nut boys out and she kissed them
I begged and pleaded we need to run

I Can See It All,Hell’s Cellar,2018,"You don’t wanna be me. Stay outta my head
I don’t wanna slow down. I’m stayin’ out of bed
Every time I close my eyes, I can still see
And most of what I’m seeing, I don’t wanna believe
I see my girlfriends on AOL
Webcams of her titties and pussy off to my pals
I can see a policeman shootin’ heroin
I can see a nun with a set of nuts on her chin
I see demon grins behind most smiles *laughter*
Daddies with they daughters and showin’ ‘em sex styles
I don’t wanna see anymore. It’s all in full color
The evil that men do - my own and every other
I see a man beatin’ his wife and the neighbors doing nothin’
I don’t know where they’re at or where they’re are. Tell me something
I don’t even wanna blink and see another murder flash
Or relive it all tellin’ a shrink about it. Fuck that!

I don’t wanna see no more. I don’t wanna be no more
Show me what for. I can’t take it no more
I’m about to shoot a building up, and burn another down
More demonic visions everywhere to be found

I see a man, maybe early twenties
Beatin’ up the pussy, almost rapin’ young honeys
And the honeys are scared, holdin’ back they tears
Livin’ out their rebellion from the younger years
I see black crows with or without my eyes closed
Unsolved murder files, stacked, ailes and rows
I see bitches, bitin’ the hearts of young men
With blood drippin’ down they chin. It’s all sin
I don’t know when it began or when it’s ever gonna end
I’m trying to pay no attention to the lynchin’
And the pillagin’. I’m feelin’ ill again
I throw up. More thoughts show up. I’m gettin’ toe up
On top of the Renaissance, I’m about to jump off to the flo’
Show me these horror thoughts no mo’
On my way down, I seen one more quick vision
I’m burnin’ in the belly of the beast, twitchin’

I don’t wanna see no more. I don’t wanna be no more
Show me what for. I can’t take it no more
I’m about to shoot a building up, and burn another down
More demonic visions everywhere to be found

I’m about to shoot a building up
And burn another down
More demonic visions
Everywhere to be found (I don’t wanna see anymore)
I’m about to shoot a building up
And burn another down (I’m fucked for)
More demonic visions
Everywhere to be found (I don’t wanna see!)
I don’t wanna see no more
I don’t wanna be no more (No more!)
Show me what for
I can’t take it no more
I’m about to shoot a building up
And burn another down (Burn this mother fucker down)
More demonic visions
Everywhere to be found (Burn this mother fucker down)
I’m about to shoot a building up
More demonic visions everywhere to be found
Fuck it. I don’t care anymore!
I’m about to shoot a building up
Burn it down!

The Perfect Night,The Eye of the Storm ,2007,"On the perfect night the graveyard is lit by a full moon
Autumn leaves and stone often treated with an old boom
Here and there the night air carries bass drops
The soundtrack is something fast running through the crops
On the perfect night fallin' stars don't even get noticed
People throwin' holy water on they doors is scared of ghosts
On the perfect night the wind is blowin' hard enough to sway the trees
And it's about a hundred degrees
On the perfect night the whole town shuts of its lights
And listens to the city; screams, sirens, howls, and fights
On the perfect night everything blends in with the shadows
Moon in the sky; rats, owls, bats, ravens, and crows
On the perfect night

Iii...(Be sure to lock up and board all your windows
And doors and don't leave your home. Don't. Don't)
Love a perfect Night (Don't leave your home. Don't)
Perfect night (Don't Leave your home)

On the perfect night bitches get they panties pulled off and love it
The f**kin' moon is so low you can almost touch it
Bats rule the dark skies snatchin' mosquitoes
Possums diggin' through your garbage cans for leftover Fritos
On the perfect night there's twenty-seven clowns in a minivan
And every one of us understands how we could kill a man
On the perfect night it's windy enough to surf clouds
Like the hawks and vultures on they pilgrimage south
Street lights that haven't worked for years suddenly glow
Missin' children from a hundred years ago now they show
On the perfect night no reception, something's in the air
Maybe you can see it or ya can't but it's clearly there
On the perfect night


Fortune tellers and psychics have nosebleeds all night
'cause they're flooded with the energies attackin' 'em bright
A headless man on a ten speed in the middle of the road
He's swervin' a little but still peddlin' home
On the perfect night dead people get to sleep in
'cause when they wake up on a night like this its where to begin
The ringmaster's wagons can travel far and undisturbed
'Cept they show up in the dark for the town they about to serve
The dark is perfectly upon us like a million piranhas
Swallow you whole like little dicks in big vaginas
On the perfect night you can bet that nobody's sleepin'
The darkness outside is thick and heavy got your walls creakin'",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-the-perfect-night-lyrics

The DJ tryin' to play me rude
I say ""what they call you?""

I had to back up and scoop my wig off the floor
It practically blew out the door
I dusted myself off and walked back up to 'em

I'm thinkin I'm a little bit better (oh yeah?)
Some folks call me the neck shredder
Cuz I cuts a lot too, so why don't you scoot down

And have dinner with me and my family
Tell me what you would do to make
That first impression really stick""

I might show up in a tux, Ha!, but I doubt it

And look your mama in the eye and tell her, ""Fuck you!""

I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, ""Get the food ready!""
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this
You know for only 13, she got some big tits
After that, your dad will try to jump again
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware
I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear

First thing, I could never love you

I'd go through your phone book and whack em all
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (
What?!

Anyone who looked at ya, would have to pay
I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day *gunshot*
I'd grab your titties and stretch em down past your waist
Let 'em go, and watch 'em both spring up in your face
I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can
Get you naked, and hit it like a caveman!
When we go to the beach and walk through the sand
I throw a little in your face and say, ""I'm just playin'""
As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back
And grab your underwear and wedge it up yo' ass crack!

And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Ricki Lake!
Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick
I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick
And then to get your attention in the crowded place
I'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face
Yeah, freak with your nuts, yo, that'll get her
Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better

Drunk at the party drinkin 5th of M.D
Cold passed out on my homeboy's crib
Curled up on the floor like a motha fuckin kid
Dreamen I was drinkin some Faygo
In my dorm house and here comes a tornado
The crib goes up spinnin round and round
Then BAM i just landed ground
Walked out the house seen the yellow brick road
Up walks a little pimp with a can and some gold
Nugget rings, gold teeth and a cup of 8 ball
And only 3 feet tall
He said welcome and greedings to your new land Joe
I said who the fuck are you Sky Lolo?
He said I'm a pimp a player a baller and yo
To get out of here you walk the yellow brick road
By the way homeboy you got a murder rep
Pointed down at the house and my head just sat
I crushed the witch all I saw was a freak
She had a fresh pair of pumps on lookin oh so sweet
I grabed the midget by his throat and checked in his gat
Slaped 'em in the eye and said I'm the mack
Checked on the witches pumps and said I'm on my way
My name ain't Dorathy yo it's Violent J
If the wizards guards don't let me pass
I'ma stick my size 10 boot in they ass
Walkin down yellow brick singin Yo Crime Pays
Came to a part in the road and a half and a gage
In the field I saw a god damn scare crow
I ain't playin no games tell my ass were to go
He said hold up motha fucka it ain't about all that
I ain't scary bitch my names Nate The Mack
I got a mossburg underneath my straw
We can buck 2 pucko he's a god damn jaw
Yo homeboy this place ain't a joint
This crazy ass belongs with me in Detroit
He said Scare Crow Mack I don't really care
Like big daddy cane I'll take you there
So we sat down chillin on yellow brick
Talkin about all the bitches that sucked our dick
Later down the road I said God damn!
I saw a fuckin tin man
I said suit cans scrap metal and coral
I'ma crumble your ass like aluminum foil
Unless you take me to the wizard so I can go home G
Damn Tin Man had a gat pointed at me
I'll team with 2 Dope and I'll fuck you up
Figure I'll pull the trigger and your casket shut
I said bring your tin can ass with us
Me and Scare Crow Mack will stick to the bus
A cap in the Wizards ass
Come to Detroit and make plenty of cash
Commin up to the forest me and my 2 boys
Like in the movie we was singin that noise
Hoods and Hoodlums and Theives oh my
Hoods and Hoodlums and Theives oh my
Hoods and Hoodlums and Theives oh my
I'ma blacked someone's eye
If I get jumped in the fuckin jungle
Cuz if someone rushes me, we gonna rumble
Then a fuckin lion jumped on Nate The Mack
Tried to eat his ass like he was Nate The Snack
The Lion pulled out a gat and said drop your walletes
You wanna spark homeboy you eatin bullets
My name is Lavel Lion then he started crien
Slip once and all ya motha fuckas are diein
Chill you god damn buck tooth ass hoe
Don't rob us G rob a liquar store
In Detroit Delray southwest city
Cuz know livin in these woods are shity
Come with us, we'll take ya to Delray
You can rob motha fuckas every god damn day
Shit finally we was at the castle
And with there guards we got no hastle
Strap like Al Capone started bustin out the holes
Droped them all, like domino's
We found some big doors so we kicked 'em in
And thats when we seen my Wizard friend
I said take my ass home and he started to laugh
So I shot his pompus show magical ass
Boom boom boom, the mutha fucka dropped
Before I stepped to 'em make sure my gun was cocked
We found a set of key's layin beside him
They went to his truck and we was low ridin
Back to Detroit like MOJO
Fucked his ass up and we forgot about toto
Bang woke up drunk as hell
Stumbled over to Rude Boy
Before I started to tell My story
Then I let it pass
Cuz I know he'll laugh at my drunk ass",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-wizard-of-delray-1687755-lyrics
Wind Me Up,The Eye of the Storm ,2007,"Wind me up
So I can keep up with you
Shits so electric these days
I clash with everything new
I try to fire my guns
I try to bang on my drums

There was a time when I ran
The fastest anyone seen
There was a time in my hands
I had the world it would seem
There was a time I could stand
On top with no in between
There was a time
When I didn't need somebody to
Wind me up

I'm tryin' to race with the best
This once was easily done
It came easy to me
Now there's no to for risk
They do shit faster these days
I know, I'm tryin' to keep up

There was a time when I ran
The fastest of anyone seen
There was a time in my hands
I had the world it would seem
There was a time I could stand

On top with no in between
There was a time
When I didn't need somebody to
Wind me up
I can't let ship pass me by
I'm winded yet still I keep on
I'll never ever never at least try
This world is spinnin' so fast
I'm still on it
Lets see how long I'll last, how long I'll last


There was a time
There was a time I didn't need a wind up
There was a time
There was a time I didn't need a

When Vampiro Gets High,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 3",2001,"Ok we're ready
Just remember to school it you just gotta be faster though
We gotta go through it faster

Because we don't have that much space

The name is Vampiro, go
Vampiro child of the rancid, wretched darkness
Vampiro I truly am a juggalotus
Maniac killa super unknown hero (Vampiro) yeah
A true hatchet ryda, long reign the lotus killas
Then again it's my privilege to power bomb your fuckin' ass
On a bed of butcher knives motherfucker (Muthafacko)
Open up the dam doors back bitch boy
And I am one of six killers
With Jamie Monoxide (Jamie Madrox)
Oh fuck ok, that's that dude from Twiztid
Shaggy, Blade (Monoxide)
What the fuck? Yeah Monoxide (Blaze)
Blaze, and of course Violent J
Wet blood trails drain through the streets of Detroit
Like Faygo off a Juggalo's dick motherfucker (A Juggalo's body)
Oh, the result of six serial murdering maniac killas
Killing, murdering, stabbing (Chopping, hacking, cutting, shooting)
And maybe lighting your fucking dick on fire bitch (Whoooo!)
All hail the lotus pod from hence we came
And when our job is complete we will return to (In your ribs, in your ribs)
In my nuts (No, in your ribs)
Alright (The Lotus Pod)

Feels So Right,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 4",2005,"Perched up like a gargoyle waiting up in a tree
Dropped down upon a victim, fall so silently
Clown paint with a hoodie, my face glows at night
Lurking through shadows, all feels so right
Bloodshed on my arms warm as the feeling
Fresh kill is never cold but felt so appealing
Death in one's eyes illuminates in moon light
I stand here a monster and it all feels so right!
And it all feels so right!
And it all feels so right!
Round goes the mary
Scary am I watching her jogging moon in the sky
Like a spider I wait for my sacrifice
I hate what I'm doing but it all feels so right!
I sleep with the bats and they tell me stories
We both feed on death and much hated for it
Sometimes I resist but the urge is to tight
Murders committed and it all feels so right!
And it all feels so right!
And it all feels so right!
One stab to the hungry one
Stab for the weak
One stab for the forgotten
One stab for the free
One stab for the laughter
One stab for the strife
Bullets rippin' through my body
And it all feels so right!!!
And it all feels so right!!!
And it all feels so right!!!
And it all feels so right!!!

Gangsta Codes,Intelligence and Violence,UnKnown,"* later known as the Insane Clown Posse
It was a Saturday Night and I was lookin for fun
So goin fellas we gonna bash the re-run
Of the posse so I decided to go
With Nate the Mack and his old ass old's
Rollin through the alleys, we never take main roads
Cuz we follow Gangsta Codes
Commin up to Marshal, at a light
Some punks behind us kicked on they brights
They ran out their car and wouldn't ya know
Dumb fuckers just smashed out the back window
Yellin some shit about 'Fuck Delray'
Jumped back in their car and tried to get away
We lost 'em off Camble but thats ok
Cuz I know where these fuckers stay
And you can bet it sure was bouncin and fun
I'ma chew his ass up like bubble yum
Walked to the front door but it was locked
So I played it cool and I knocked
And they opend the door and looked out
And thats when they caught a beer bottle in the mouth
Lady ran out the back door probably his mother
They slamed the bitch, with a Lousville Slugger
Hit 'em house harder it makes sense
You fuck with Violent J and it's your village expense
No feelings for others, you gotta be cold
Cuz we follow gangsta codes
I was younger, and I met a fine lady
I never give time to a bitch with dimples maybe
I met during a concert at the atitude
She said Up on stage, was that you?
I said, yeah how'd ya like my show?
Great Violent J can I call ya Joe?
I said can we go back to my place I wonder?
Then I fucked her like a Jungle Samoan Head Hunter
I had it goin, my love was flowin
But after 2 months things started slowin
Down I thought she might of been crawlin around
So I went to a school on the rich side of town
I hawked a scope through the class room window
Looked in and saw the fuckin bimbo
Was holdin hands with some rich fool
I'ma kill his ass, but not in school
I'ma call up the boys and when the bell hits 3
I'ma stomp his fuckin head on the concrete
They walked out, chit chattered about the weather
Then I ran up and slammed their fuckin heads together
ICP kicks them around like a hacky sac
It's for the girl Violent J she gets more then a smack
To make sure she don't fuck around with guys no more
I put her in a figure four
Never say you're sorry make your ass see the rules, bitch
I follow gangsta codes
Never forget the first time I had a gun
It was a 22 Its hot under the sun
One day I was at Kid Villians girl friend
I said I gotta take a piss she said go right in
Instead of the bathroom I went through another door
And found a 22 in her daddy's drawer
I punched in a course and I was geeked as hell
Along with a few other items I could sell
Kid fucked, fucked it's time to go
But on the way home all's I had to know
If it worked or not, 
so I took aim at a stray dog
And I blew out its brains it was fresh as hell
I couldn't wait to shoot
Some dumb bitch or a prostitute
Delray cafe can establish business
All of the costumers were about to witness
An armed robery out for the cash flow
Atleast 500 and a bottle of Faygo
Walked in and said, I'd like a hamburger
A large fry and your cash in the register
I pulled out the gun that I was proud to have
She was terrified but the guys in the back
Must of knew some day this would happen
Cuz they had 2 shot gunz and an AK-47
I looked at my gun and the Mexicans weapons
I looked at the door and I started half steppin
Out but it really doesn't matter I supose
Cuz I still follow Gangsta Codes
D-Lyrical to annivers the Gangsta Codes
Thats the lonely follow only in roads
Chosen path with the pun we had taken
I thought so quick theres no time for shaken
And thats what J was here to say
For the Spanish tribe that follows 'Do you comprende' others do you understand
Well grip the words that I'm givin at hand
Take this as a guide and persue this disclosure
Cuz I be the real thing and thats why you flows
For those that don't follow don't be a sucker off the street
Just another justice is what you'll meet
Skip one on the passage and one I wrote
Take this as a message and follow Gangsta Codes

Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

We love all hoes, skinny old hoes
Big bald hoes, we dig all those

We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

We slap rappers in the head with the mic during freestyle wars
And get thrown out the doors

We rock and roll where, and think we don't care
About what the fuck is going on out there

We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

Fuck you, fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck y'all

When the streets go quiet, it means something wrong
I'm standin' on the corner sippin' on something strong

We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

Channel seven eye team, hit us with the high beam
Wicked clowns droppin' them down live on the scene

We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

We so deep underground, the devil came around
But got his tale chopped off by Shaggy the clown

Fuck you we like it like that

Many hate us, but we the greatest
Y'all just keep talkin', elevate us

We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

We human cannonballs flying with no nets
Into brick walls, scarier the show gets

We throwin' punches hittin' faces like freight trains
Garunteed to put shit in your Hanes

Something to Say,Intelligence and Violence,UnKnown,"* later known as the Insane Clown Posse
Somethin to say stereo my scenario
Boy I love to put a critic in critical
Fools perade perade so full in the brain
I started showin and blowin and showin up to the grade
I don't play no games look around now clown throw down
Dirt mounds were the corps is found
After every show the critics call me a criminal
Cuz the who I know, cuz of were I go
Some interjections practice and colectin gets paid
Play all day, you wanna check this
Perhaps to inform me I'm a lyrical phantom
Critic can't stand a canom mahanom
To the ICP so we can skin they hide
It's critic hunt season all them suckas die
Then I sit in the shade with the jams I made
Layed they get paid and get stired up like Kool-Aid
Some get fed up, I won't let up
They get shet up we met up and go head up
Then I slam them asses and lyricaly
Lyrical by suprise they then avaporize
See them they don't understand a system in judicial
The ICP is pullen tracks individualy
So you can see for to me money
Tryin some salery how can it be
A pencil paper figure to conclusion
And start usin a scratch to confusion
What do you get the shit or quit I'm singin it
Bit by bit legit and hit critics are hatin it
Critics can't stop me my music will always play
I got somethin to say
Somethin to say about America's murder town
Here to prove that Detroit is the worst around
On the streets, roamin population
Word is heard it's raised across the nation
Villians roamin on the avenues
Third collins hear just the name of you
2 Much and 2 Dope you better hope to cope
Nope ya boys hold and shook the rope to cope
Ghetto Style are you worth his while
He'll smielin and fielin put the boys in a pile
Q-Tip legit shit you confetti
Think he still havin a fit you fuckin hell streek
Kid villian he's always willin
To kick ya lazy motha fuckas to the motha fuckin ceilin
Bad luck bro, cuz I snatched your change
I looked at the plate and it said Made in spain
So what did I do? I sold it down town
If I'm a gang I'ma be the best around
Tragety someone catch the beein me
It wasn't me the fools got the jewlery
Out of town let me remind you
That I'ma find you
Then I'ma grind you, spit find you
Look at our crime tryin to find a solution
I'll be introducin to and exacution
Some try to tangle think they can mangle
Haha, I said we strangel
I said it gets better, cuz it's the better and the better then the best
Damn that was fresh
Theres other things I see like inner city Delray
When it comes to Detroit I got somethin to say
Somethin to say about a motha fucka snitch now I'm sittin in jail
Ain't that a bitch?
A snitch is the type of guy that is very agravating
Put me in jail with one you better segregate
Before its too late before I dominate
Snitches are bitches all of 'em I hate
Yeah Violent J and I know you'll agree
That the ICP will show no simpathy
But make sympothy bitches ain't shit to me
But it's slick to be the rhyming of the synthany
Snitches don't like us boys that are ghetto hard
So I played there ass like a uno card
Start fetchin don't even mention
Whatever it was that we did to cause attention
Sometime snitches don't even need to be there
I know Violent J has a 9 millimeter
I get busted they can't be trusted
So I smear there asses like mustard
Some try me and think they can find me
I'm put up in jail, yo you know were I'll be
If I see a snitch you gonna see the individual
And my visibaly be unforgetable
Murder is homocide brutaly died
When they hook us what they saw they shoulda lied
It's pay back time and paybacks are a bitch
Thats what happend to a motha fuckin snitch
On the scene of a crime, stay the hell away

The Monster,The Marvelous Missing Link (The Outtakes),2015,"Yeah, thinkin’ back
A reminisce song (r-r-r-reminisce)
Yeah, I remember everything about my childhood (ch-ch-childhood)
Everything

We was playin’ in the backyard 
Sleeping bags, sliding down the stairs
Settin’ up army men all day
Then argue as soon as we start to play
Out in the street, playing 500
Fat-ass bush, just dive on it
Pounce on a fence, hop on the garage
‘Cause right now, we the ones in charge
D-Diggin’ through the cupboards, Saltines
Some canned food, but all beans
Water balloons, snowballs in the winter
All up in whatever say “do not enter”
But some nights, all the fun went dead-
Mom worked late, and he’s home instead
In our house, there’s no safety zone
W-w-w-when the monster’s home

Cruelty, Humility (Fuck, why?)
The kind of punishment that never goes away
W-w-w-when the monster’s home
Brutality, Humility (Fuck! Fuck!)
The kind of punishment that never goes away
W-w-w-when the monster’s home

The sun always came up again, birds chirping
Kids outside, water guns squirtin’
Fuck it! Ha ha! I’m laughing again
Tuck that shit deep down within
Freeze tag, my brother’s the fastest
Any time we ran, he would blow right past us
We never had money for the ice cream man
(But sometimes wound up with some in hand)
Three Stooges marathons all night
When my mom was home, everything was tight
But she worked a double shift most cases
And left us out late with happy faces (happy faces-)
Ninja night tag, we’re having a ball
Up in the trees or scaling a wall
Till we hear our names called out through the devil’s drone
(*lion growl*)
The monster’s home

Cruelty, Humility (Fuck, fuck)
The kind of punishment that never goes away
W-w-w-when the monster’s home
Brutality, Humility (Oh shit! Fuck!)
The kind of punishment that never goes away
W-w-w-when the monster’s home

It’s supposed to be fun, being a child
Carefree days, and nights go wild
Imagination limitless
Too young for corruption, innocence (innocence)
Runnin’, playin’, jumpin’, screamin’
One headlight, here come the demon
Mom’s at work. Fuck, we’re all alone! (*lion growl*)
And the monster’s home. (laughter)

Cruelty. (Fuck! Fuck!) Humility. (Oh shit! Fuck!)
The kind of punishment that never goes away
W-w-w-when the monster’s home
Brutality. (Brutality!) Humility. (Humility!)
The kind of punishment that never goes away (Never goes away!)
W-w-w-when the monster’s home

Gang Related,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now if you got yo hat tilted to tha side
And you always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that you rep make others upset
Then you might be gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)
Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be
Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be
Gang related! in and out tha penitentiary
With no thought of graduation or a fuckin' degree
Still clockin' ""g""s from what you learned on tha streets
Then you might be
Gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)

You might be (what!? what!?)
You might be gang related!
Do you wear a hatchetman?
You in a gang and yo ass better be ready to do that thang
You rep tha jrb and you will never switch
(jrb?) juggalo rydas bitch!
Did you beat your girlfriends who dissed your boys
Did your crew's name originate in Illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""
Then you gang related to muthafucka like Violent J
I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free
Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

Do you participate in gang related activities?
03's, 211's, 187's?
If you do that's okay, fuck we all do
I'm only tryin' to say you gang related too bitch!
Take anybody killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery
The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe

Ah ha
Ha ha
Ha ha ha! you know what man? you just might be!
In spite of your own knowledge of 'em
A gangsta, gangobodacious, smacksimus
Maximum boogie woogie ryda aka gang related
You dilapidated muthafucko!
[Repeat[
You might be
You might be gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)
You fuckin' gangbangulator!",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-gang-related-lyrics
Bodies Fly,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 4",2005,"Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
People flyin to the sky and explode
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
And then the blood rains all over the road

I ain't never seen anything like my first day in the pit
I seen this lady tryin to hang on to some kid but no give
Hes loose straight up into the sky and completely exploited
And then the fuckin blood shower unloaded holy fuck!
Im trippin out i felt like i was gonna threw up
And then another ninja threw up and blew up im like fuck!
I tryed to call my mom i grabbed the bloody pay phone
But the phone bit my ear off and left a hole in my dome
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
People flyin to the sky and explode
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
And then the blood rains all over the road

I seen a fella sittin on the curb payin nobody no mind
He was cryin like everyone else then he started flyin
I knew what was comin next so i ran and tryed to duck
But half his face landed by me bloody fried as fuck
People shootin up like bottle rockets nothin can stop them
Your starin at the floor catchin all them peices droppin
And its bloody bloody bloody it ain't funny when it rains on
Everybody body body body and your bodys fucked
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
People flyin to the sky and explode
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode
And then the blood rains all over the road
Put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere
Everybody put your hands in the air like you dont care
That its fuckin rainin blood everywhere

Dickhead,The First Six,2014,"Bitch, I'm a dickhead. So the fuck what?
Your daddy's a faggot and your mother's a slut
I cruise the earth without a care in the world
I don't need any homies, and fuck a girlfriend
I could jack off in the middle of the mall
Only got one motto: ""Fuck y'all bitches!""
I'll punch little kids in the face and run
I don't give a fuck if I sock your son
I'll fake my way into bitches' hearts
It's easy. Half of these hoes are retards
As soon as a ninja bust a nut
I'll flip her and piss all over her butt (Woo!)
I'll pull my pants up and dash away
Snatched a purse and throw the cash away
'Cause I don't need it. I steal my shit
From those who need it most
I'm a straight-up dickhead

(Holy shit! What'd you say?)
(You ain't livin' like that, no way)
Oh yeah, bitch, I'm a dick dick dickhead
I'm a big big big fat dick dick dickhead
(Come on now, I mean really, hey)
(You ain't livin' like that, no way)
Oh yeah, bitch, I'm a dick dick dickhead
I'm a big big big fat dick dick dickhead

I help old ladies across the street
Whip out a gun, pull out my meat
And scream, ""Suck that,"" give 'em a heart attack
When you're going to Hell, it ain't hard to pack, bitch
I stand on the overpass and drop bricks
Shoot up high schools just for kicks
When I was a kid, I was a terrorist (uh huh)
Fuckin' young hoes 'til their cherry bust (yeah)
I still do whatever the fuck I chose
I got the clap, syphilis, my dick ooze
I don't use a condom; I spread the shit
'Cause I'm a dick, bitch, and I don't quit
I attacked my mom and dad with a sword (yeah)
Drove a boat to the mental ward
'Cause I'm hard, I got mad drug habits
And torture baby rabbits
Yo, I'm a dickhead

(Holy shit! What'd you say?)
(You ain't livin' like that, no way)
Oh yeah, bitch, I'm a dick dick dickhead
I'm a big big big fat dick dick dickhead
(Come on now, I mean really, hey)
(You ain't livin' like that, no way)
Oh yeah, bitch, I'm a dick dick dickhead
I'm a big big big fat dick dick dickhead

I was born a rich kid in a loving home
Burned it down. Free I roam
I went to church, and I stole the dough
Every Sunday, yo, I was back for mo'
The preacher caught me and asked me why
I said I did it for meth and then blast his eye in
Socked the other one, he couldn't see
I grabbed all the money, and out I flee
My melon is a big-ass mushroom cap
With a pee hole right up under my hat
I'm Mr. Dickhead, the one and only
I rob the homeless, cold, and lonely
Kick 'em in the fucking face and gut hard
And then steal their shopping cart
And shove it down a hill, 'cause I'm ill
What's left? Find somebody to kill
A real dickhead

(Holy shit! What'd you say?)

Williamsburg Psych Ward,Phantom: X-Tra Spooky Edition,2015,"Arrested
In Portland, Oregon
Sent up the river
To the house of the nutty
There ain’t time for me

Once again, I’m locked up in a psych ward
This time, I can’t escape; they assured me
I see a man who headbutts the wall constantly
His head is wrapped in gauze but still bloody
He’s that nutty, and check that girl out over there
She’s beautiful. Too bad she pulled out all her hair
All I care about is findin’ my way outta here
They got a guy in here who throws his own shit in the air
It makes no sense to beat his fuckin’ ass
He just takes out his teeth and laughs
Then there’s this bitch, a vampire creep
She’ll bite your neck, for real, if you asleep

Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“75  in”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“This bitch just shit his pants”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Woo hoo hoo!)

They wanna sedate everyone and make ‘em zombies
But I spit my shit out behind the trees
Some of these guys are so smart they can save the debt of the nation
Then they’d eat your face in
Look a this guy, a handsome fellow
He drinks his own piss. His skin is yellow
And this man is just a shell of himself
He hasn’t talked for years. He’s kept alive through wealth
They say his family’s paid. Nobody’s seen him in years
He doesn’t watch TV or have any cares
He’s just a zombie kept alive through meds
What you’re actually seeing is the walking dead

Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“Time to take your meds”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“Put that man in the straits!”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(“Masturbating in solitary confinement”) (Woo hoo hoo!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Woo hoo hoo!) (“My prescription is: look happy”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“We’ll run down the street and catch you”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)

These guards ain’t playin; they got tasers and nightsticks
I ain’t playin’ either. There’s too many dicks
These fools masturbate right in front of each other
I’d sleep through it, but don’t forget the vampire mother
Waitin’ for me to doze so she can bite my neck
Meanwhile, the guards are playin’ poker with a fresh deck
I got no friends in here, not in this whole place
I was talkin’ to one dude, but then he licked my face
I had to punch him in his belly, gave up on every one
If only I could get a uniform and a stun gun
It was late, and I was on my mission
Hope they don’t notice a guard’s missin’
Tied his ass up, stunned him once for good measure
Slipped out of the closet, it was my pleasure
Walked out the main door and took the elevator down
Stole a truck and slowly cruised outta town

Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“Slowly into the cafeteria”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“Lights out in five minutes”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Woo hoo hoo!) (“Single file only in line”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Woo hoo hoo!)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!) (“On today’s menu: mystery meat”)
Williamsburg Psych Ward
(Ha ha ha!)

Bye, bitches
Freed again
(Ha ha ha!)
Took a flight to Hawaii
(Woo hoo hoo!) (Woo hoo hoo!)
Aloha

Don't you know your in trouble up the creek with out a paddle
Cuz I keep gettin betta I'm tougha then leatha
I'm rated numba one and I'll rain for eva
Some people wear silva and some wear gold
But then I'll snatch it off your neck and diss you cold
It's like a fantasy it's irony my rhymes go down in history
Hit my boys proven with the freshest termenology
Know more words then a pocked dictionary
Got more information then your local library
Some girls I'm kissin and others I'm dissin
But you don't know what you been missin
Make a fresh tongue twista
Could give your tongue a blista
If you see it my way then theres a chance you'll diffa
Give a sigh then you crie then you say good bye
Don't even try don't reply then you want to die
I make you rhyme though it's time
Commit an innocent crime
It's the truth no excuse a visual rhyme
Dissin you, to battle me you bit off more then you can chew
Tearin up the scene destrukter van vew
The way I'll leave you more puzzled then arubics cube
Wanna battle the best your gonna die like the rest
Wait I'll crush your bones and rip up your flesh
You can do what you want but leave the rhyme to the skills
Cuz every person that don't listen is a sucker that kills
And when I first started rappin I set some goals
To rock your mind, your body and of course your sould
Now when it comes to these goals I have now acheaved
So for all you none believers it's TIME TO BELIEVE
Take it to the Violent Side

Life style of a motha f*ckin scalowag
Throw a fist if ya throw me a mag

The Wizard of Delray,Intelligence and Violence,UnKnown,"Aw shit homeboy you shoulda seen me
Drunk at the party drinkin 5th of M.D
Cold passed out on my homeboy's crib
Curled up on the floor like a motha fuckin kid
Dreamen I was drinkin some Faygo
In my dorm house and here comes a tornado
The crib goes up spinnin round and round
Then BAM i just landed ground
Walked out the house seen the yellow brick road
Up walks a little pimp with a can and some gold
Nugget rings, gold teeth and a cup of 8 ball
And only 3 feet tall
He said welcome and greedings to your new land Joe
I said who the fuck are you Sky Lolo?
He said I'm a pimp a player a baller and yo
To get out of here you walk the yellow brick road
By the way homeboy you got a murder rep
Pointed down at the house and my head just sat
I crushed the witch all I saw was a freak
She had a fresh pair of pumps on lookin oh so sweet
I grabed the midget by his throat and checked in his gat
Slaped 'em in the eye and said I'm the mack
Checked on the witches pumps and said I'm on my way
My name ain't Dorothy yo it's Violent J
If the wizards guards don't let me pass
I'ma stick my size 10 boot in they ass
Walkin down yellow brick singin Yo Crime Pays
Came to a part in the road and a half and a gage
In the field I saw a god damn scare crow
I ain't playin no games tell my ass where to go
He said hold up motha fucka it ain't about all that
I ain't scary bitch my names Nate The Mack
I got a Mossberg underneath my straw
We can buck 2 pucko he's a god damn jaw
Yo homeboy this place ain't a joint
This crazy ass belongs with me in Detroit
He said Scare Crow Mack I don't really care
Like big daddy cane I'll take you there
So we sat down chillin on yellow brick
Talkin about all the bitches that sucked our dick
Later down the road I said God damn!
I saw a fuckin tin man
I said suit cans scrap metal and coral
I'ma crumble your ass like aluminum foil
Unless you take me to the wizard so I can go home G
Damn Tin Man had a gat pointed at me
I'll team with 2 Dope and I'll fuck you up
Figure I'll pull the trigger and your casket shut
I said bring your tin can ass with us
Me and Scare Crow Mack will stick to bust
A cap in the Wizards ass
Come to Detroit and make plenty of cash
Commin up to the forest me and my 2 boys
Like in the movie we was singin that noise
Hoods and Hoodlums and Theives oh my
Hoods and Hoodlums and Theives oh my
Hoods and Hoodlums and Theives oh my
I'ma blacken someone's eye
If I get jumped in the fuckin jungle
Cuz if someone rushes me, we gonna rumble
Then a fuckin lion jumped on Nate The Mack
Tried to eat his ass like he was Nate The Snack
The Lion pulled out a gat and said drop your walletes
You wanna spark homeboy you eatin bullets
My name is Lavel Lion then he started cryin'
Slip once and all ya mothafuckas are dyin'
Chill you god damn buck tooth ass hoe
Don't rob us G rob a liquor store
In Detroit Delray southwest city
Cuz you know livin in these woods is shitty
Come with us, we'll take ya to Delray
You can rob mothafuckas every god damn day
Shit finally we was at the castle
And with their guards we got no hassle
Strapped like Al Capone started bustin out the hoes
Droped them all, like domino's
We found some big doors so we kicked 'em in
And thats when we seen my Wizard friend
I said take my ass home and he started to laugh
So I shot his pompous show magical ass
Boom boom boom, the muthafucka dropped
Before I stepped to 'em make sure my gun was cocked
We found a set of key's layin beside him
They went to his truck and we was low ridin
Back to Detroit like MOJO
Fucked his ass up and we forgot about toto
Bang woke up drunk as hell
Stumbled over to Rude Boy
Before I started to tell My story
Then I let it pass
Cuz I know he'll laugh at my drunk ass",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-the-wizard-of-delray-lyrics

Gangsta Codes - 1122279,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It was a Saturday Night and I was lookin for fun
So goin fellas we gonna bash the re-run
Of the posse so I decided to go
With Nate the Mack and his old ass old's
Roalin through the ally's, we never take main roads
Cuz we follow Gangsta Codes
Commin up to Marshal, at a light
Some punks behind use kicked on they brights
They ran out there car and wouldn't ya know
Dumb fuckers just smashed out the back window
Yellin some shit about Fuck Delray
Jumped back in there car and tried to get away
We lost 'em off Camble but thats ok
Cuz I know were these fuckers stay
And you can bet it sure was bouncin and fun
I'ma chew his ass up like bubble yum
Walked to the front door but it was locked
So I played it cool and I nocked
And they opend the door and looked out
And thats when they caught a beer bottle in the mouth
Lady ran out the back door probably his mother
They slamed the bitch, with a Lewy Ville Slugger
Hit 'em house harder it makes sence
You fuck with Violent J and it's your village expence
No feelings for others, you gotta be cold
Cuz we follow gangsta codes
I was younger, and I met a fine lady
I never give time to a bitch with dimples maybe
I met during a concert at the atitude
She said Up on stage, was that you?
I said, yeah how'd ya like my show?
Great Violent J can I call ya Joe?
I said can we go back to my place I wonder?
Then I fucked her like a Jungle Semowen Head Hunter
I had it goin, my love was flowin
But after 2 months things started slowin
Down I thought she might of been crawlin around
So I went to a school on the rich side of town
I hawked a scope through the class room window
Looked in and saw the fuckin bimbo
Was holdin hands with some rich fool
I'ma KILL his ass but not in school
I'ma call up the boys and when the bell hits 3
I'ma stomp his fuckin head on the concreate
They walked out, chit chatterd about the weather
Then I ran up and slamed there fuckin heads together
ICP kicks them around like a hacky sac
It's for the girl Violent J she gets more then a smack
To make sure she don't fuck around with guys no more
I put her in a figure four
Never say your sorry make your ass see the rules, bitch
I follow gangsta codes
Never forget the first time I had a gun
It was a 22 Its hot under the sun
One day I was at Kid Villians girl friend
I said I gotta take a piss she said go right in
Instead of the bathroom I went through another door
And found a 22 in her daddy's drawer
I punched in a course and I was geeked as hell
Along with a few other items I could sell
Kid fucked, fucked it's time to go
But on the way home all's I had to know
If it worked or not, so I took aim at a stray dog
And I blew out it's brains it was fresh as hell
I couldn't wait to shoot
Some dumb bitch or a prostetute
Delray cafe can establish business
All of the costumers were about to witness
An armed robery out for the cash flow
Atleast 500 and a bottle of Faygo
Walked in and said, I'd like a hamburger
A large frie and your cash in the register
I pulled out the gun that I was proud to have
She was terrified but the guys in the back
Must of knew some day this would happen
Cuz they had 2 shot gunz and an AK-47
I looked at my gun and the Mexicans weapons
I looked at the door and I started half steppin
Out but it really doesn't matter I supose
Cuz I still follow Gangsta Codes
D-Lyrical to annivers the Gangsta Codes
Thats the lonely follow only in roads
Choasen path with the pun we had taken
I thought so quick theres no time for shaken
And thats what J was here to say
For the Spanish tribe that follows Do you comprende others do you understand
Well grip the words that I'm givin at hand
Take this as a guide and persue this disclosure
Cuz I be the real thing and thats why you flows
For those that don't follow don't be a sucker off the street

Stomp,The Old Shit,1994,"(Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp)
Forks is up. Forks is down
Forks is up. Forks is down
(Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp)
Forks is up. Forks is down
Wicked clown, wicked clown

Take a look around ya. Tell me what ya see
Ya see flames and smoke, then there's me
I'm burnin' houses and jumpin' telephone poles
They call me fireface. I'm suckin' hot coals
Give me a quarter. I'll buy a quarter worth of gas
Sneak in your house, and slowly poor it in your ass
Blaze it up, you run around screechin' scorned
Your ass is burnin', your nuts pop like pop corn
And when I see ya, I stomp all the flames out
Stomp your face and yo' ass, stomp your titties
I'll stomp your balls. We stomp in my wicked town
Forks up and forks down, a wicked clown
I represent like a true gang banger should
I paint the forks and the K's in your neighborhood
So when you see me, give a nod and say ""What up?""
Then walk away, or I'll stomp your fuckin' mouth shut
When I'm done, I drink a couple gallons of gas
And then I stick a lighter in my ass (Boom)

(Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp)

Somebody’s Dissin U,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They call me Hektik
Cause the way the pain is interjected
You talk shit you gonna regret it
Fuck it, you said it
Watch your mouth fool
I'm on the move
Time to play
For words you say
One level of pain on display
Bitch back off
Too late your bitch is spread out, you jack off
Keepin you wishing that you was dead off
The planet
Can't understand it? Let me explain
All that shit you talked drove me insane
But my brain swells, my ears bleed
And all the bad level of attack is underrated, remember that
Head's get cracked with baseball bats
I love the sound it makes when it pings
I even love it when my ears ring
Stomp on suckers in a second
Leave you with no sign of recollection
Rearrange your whole memory section
Disease, infection, over night I die slowly
Covered in corn stalks, protected by the oak trees
Freeze muthafuckas
Get your hands in the air muthafuckas
This ain't a game
I don't talk shit I slit necks just because
Catchin' the buzz
And keeping a look out for the fuzz
If I get hit by the cops I'm goin' out like Val Kilmer
Heat the whole squad, droppin the bomb then watch em simmer
Pain is a beautiful thang it makes my spine shiver
Murder for hire, better believe I deliver
(Chorus x2)
If you think somebody's dissin you they probably are
So far all I been hearin is player hatin (Oh yeah)
Moving with the speed of the robot sonic exhaust
Chronic fumes, fuel, gin, and tonic
Half of the world is corrupt and alive
Other half is depressed and they want to die
I.S.I
Why ask why?
Realize there's a killer in your face
Look him in his eyes
Before your body dies
I'ma grab your soul straight up out your chest
Put it in my black glass jar
With all the rest
Of the competition
Pack rhymes with precision
Eliminating adversaries
And all of our divisions are cuttin like an incision
While other suckers is missin
With enough cheese for 3 niggas in college with tuition
Take a listen I drop knowledge like a teacher
An ill preacher preaching a sermon
I been learning how to sing along with the dead man's song
He's got an X in his head so I know what side he's on
And brain dead people always say right on
They got 10 on the weed cause we all high arms
We let bygones be bygones and then dismiss
Your wack ass bitches in the abyss
Fuck the diss
Cause you let your colors show too many times
It goes way deeper than rhymes
Fuck a beat cause I rock accapella
Crazy ass fella
Used to fuck Cinderella
In the back of the pumpkin coach
Smoking roach after roach
Fuck her all night
And in the mornin make me French toast
Coast to coast
Drop knowledge like a teacher
I.S.I. in this bitch we play the preachers
(Chorus x2)
If you think somebody's dissin you they probably are
So far all I been hearin is player hatin",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-somebodys-dissin-u-lyrics
Steve Meets Abu,Steve Meets Abu (Single),UnKnown,"Picture, you've grown up in the holy lands of the Middle East, your entire life dedicated to religion. You don't know the wild lawlessness of the western world, only the peaceful ways of your God

You're happy, there's only a smile on your face
Nobody carries weapons, guns, shanks, or mace (nothing!)
No heroin or crack, homeless vets, or street gangs
No trench coat weirdos showing kids how they meat hangs (nope!)
Picture this, no cigarettes, shitty cancer burgers
No public massacres or titty dancer murders (none!)
Random bones, abandoned homes full of squatters
No breaking in, taking, raping your daughters
Picture this, no runaways, no kids having kids
Twelve-year-old meth heads dead or doing life bids
No preachers slipping roofies to children at Bible study
No wives with secret lives, slutty, fucking your buddy (no more!)
No gambling, liquor stores on every block
Homeless hobos in flocks, trying to score them some rocks (get off!)
No hookers' health spas and human sex slave trafficking
No devil at large and what that master brings
Picture this, five times a day, everyone around you
Is on their knees, kneeling, and the feeling surrounds you
Everyone succumbing to the faith that summons you
Next to the King, everything else is number two
In unison, all together now, its heaven's bow
They all proud, man, woman, and child
If a different belief than yours makes you wanna laugh
Picture Noah catching two bears, seals, and giraffes, bitch (ha ha!)
Picture being gay a sin, Adam and Steve
I laughed so loud in church, they fucking had me leave
It's all  and makes sense, if you was taught and raised, you'll have it
Even if your family tree fought slaves

Having been born and raised in the beautifully peaceful holy lands, picture how terrifying the ways of the Western world must seem to you, and picture how scary the constant threat of an invasion must be

Picture this, happiness, no mistaking your bliss
You just wish to exist and miss Satan's abyss
The rest of civilization are evil life nations
An ominous threat, you'll forever lie facing
Over there, women are raped, and snipers won't quit (damn!)
Pissed off judges sentence you while they dope sit (what?)
In school, you heard about the bombs and how to take cover
So insane they kill each other, even they mother (oh)
Divorce is nothing, they marry again and again
Bitches wear shorts up they ass, bearing skin
PLOW! Street shootouts, murder and violence
Picture that, when all you've known is peaceful silence
Their own government kills them with liquor and tobacco
Rich oil tycoons, evil as Hitler, straight jackals
But sicker and much quicker to react, smack, and whack those
With the black oil stacks they attacking and jacking them for
They could show up any minute, spreading evilness
Overthrow your own holy land and heed your bliss
Right or wrong, you only know what's been taught all along
Die in a holy war, god will adore you, so be strong

Picture the grim day of an actual invasion. The evil henchmen of the long corrupted mainlands have now reached your people and are demanding your conversion to their evil and deadly ways of life

Picture this, another quiet and warm blissful night
Suddenly, explosions ripped through your life
Your family screams, you lie shouting, ""Shit's okay!""
But they was warned for years about this day
The devil's minions have finally come
You don't even think to escape. There's nowhere to run
Those who make it to the freeway are gunned down
Bridges explode, cars blown into dust clouds
Picture this, Satan's abyss demanding you and yours (no!)
Barking orders, talking foreign, kicking through your doors (no!)
You'll stand with us and pray to our god, or you'll die bleeding (no!)
We building prisons over here now, 
Picture this, explosives  to a vest
Three demons enter your home, you know what to do next
Kiss your family goodbye, phase through your surgeon
You're about to be chilling in heaven with a gang of virgins
They in your home, searching through your kitchen
Open up the door and pull the cord without flinching
You walk right up, he turns around and looks just like you
He says ""My name is Steve."" You tell him, ""Mine is Abu,""
And then boom

Come across to Detroit throw your ass in a moat
Yo Homeboy you know your in effect
But what about the crimes you ain't kicked none yet
On the ramed out streets of the inner city Delray
There once lived a little boy named Violent J
Saw a lot of bad thing a child stays out of
When he hit 13, motha fucka when violent
Took along yo the crimes that I done
People must understand it wasn't just for fun
When your cold at night and theres nothin to eat
You can give a fuck about another fuckers feed
Growin up stonger one next to me
With military MC's hard nock Bruce Lee
Hangin at the stadium just talkin and swearin
Punk walk by laughin at what I was wearin
Prince born walkin around with silver spoons in his mouth
My brother shoved it so far down the kid shit it out
Nate the Mack so loud in front of his house
Leanin against his old's drinkin 40's with clouds
Drunk fool walked by with his wallet and key
They took it all and left 'em in his BVD's

Took your amp took your tookin snick by nine
Try to told 'em between us and your fresh seet to

Kid Villian the hustla took the whole damn ride
Didn't notice your girl was still sittin inside
She stayed in the car while you ran in the store
Kid plucked your car and ended up fuckin your whore
Q-Tip look through your window on a monday night
Took your couch big jar everything in site
Sold 'em all for gold cuz my boys are swingin
Stole your mothers raidy rade off her motha fuckin finger
Lay Low sold bullets to your uncle Jim
And the village men wonder why he been gettin so slim
Now he steals from you so at night your lockin
And the money you get goes to Lay Low's pocket
D-Lyrical like a cat sneaks up from behind
Check nine to your spine is what your able to find
That pile yo is cool and calm
That rope around your neck winds up in a pile
Don Juan goes back just askin the fool
Spent more time in jail, then you spent in school
In the LA roles just go make a deal
Stole your little snitches mother fuckin tranin wheels
Pimp, Hustler, Baller, Daddy D
Got more freaks then a skater got teeth
But pimpin pimp daddy is pimpin down river
Can in one had with one to hold the liver
Iron Ranger is the brute of the IC crew

Until you fall into a coma

Id cut my head off but then i would be dead
And I ain't the only mutherfucker thats dying

Goblin,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"From the bowls of the city, lurkin’ in the trenches
Underneath the bridges, behind the park benches
Stench is seepin’ off me. I’m gutterlicious
Thinkin’ nothin’ of your wishes. I’m uttelry vicious
Crawlin’ through the sewers, it’s an intricate job
Some only a foot wide. I move like the Blob
Seep into your home every time you catch a night terror
It’s ‘cause I’m right there, suckin’ out your air
A priest can’t do shit but just tickle my humor *laugh*
‘Cause I ain’t from the pit. No, that’s only a rumor
I’m atomically demoic. You see me and vomit
More heads than a totem pole and faster than a comet

I fill you with fright, and kill you, I might

“Nothing, nothing. You ain’t scarin’ nothing”
“Nothing, nothing.” It ain’t nothin’
I’m a goblin, a hobgoblin
What the fuck is a goon to a goblin?
“Nothing, nothing. You ain’t scarin’ nothing”
“Nothing, nothing.” It ain’t nothin’

Clinging’ to your ceiling, back bent like the exorcist
Slit necks and wrist, I exist
Crawlin’ tarantula style with a face smile
Very bad intentions all the while
I’ll have sick fun playing with my victim
Lurkin’ through the darkness until I pick one
A damned soul lost in the nether void
Committin’ atrocities feeds me joy
Oh, boy. Catch me in the creepiest corner
Starin’ you down, gazin’ upon ya
Waitin’ to harm ya, that’s what I’m here for
Always lookin’ for trouble, hear me creek in the floor
Outside your closet door lies a demon
I inflict tortuous pain while you screamin’ *scream*
And then, that’s it. There’ll be no more breathin’
Much more than a’ evil heathen
I’m a goblin

I’m a goblin, a hobgoblin
What the fuck is a goon to a goblin?
“Nothing, nothing. You ain’t scarin’ nothing”

I’m not a zombie. I’m a goblin

Started out with the very first man I rolled
A party store owner, became a blood doner
Donated some blood to a delly street corner
I clubed the old man with a brick on the chin
It was grand master sin but I'll do it again
Prostetutes want loot so they can shot up
Haha, whats goin up is the end of my boot bitch
Right up your ass if you try and confront me
Try and comfort me you lie in my trunky
Pick you up down river, you never should quiver
Deliver cap peeler dump your ass in the river
I kill prostitutes just to whore I can whore
Violent dribbles say man I'm in the ghetto territory
My days away of well bred disbelievers are on their death beds
My territory is what you vacate

A disease of lyrics that is about to be infective
Break it down to some intelligence B

Breakin it down till dawn

It better be me you had a ration for
Felt the violence now feel intelligence
Pleed the 5th, the case is irelivent
In the croud is who will persue
Whatever it takes, that what I'll do
Cuz I'm a push over when it comes to a gathering
Grab a mic, and make it start happening
Break through from the ghetto to bring you this
Punk didn't you know, I never miss
I bout urenin to be hype
If you get what I'm sayin, then your my type
Don't worry, cuz I won't neglect
Inner City Posse is in effect
Why don't ya kick a little violence J
Street gang so we bang sweet hours we hang
Occupasion gang population ghetto thang
Educatin make a facial was too much for me
No smarter pushin cards at the A.M.P
Now I wait down wage so I grab a gage
Hopin saw once more hey make front page
To survive detroit on average pay
Some choose to abuse to live this way
Projects come home in the ghetto zone
Don't man they pass who never roam

Get out of the heat immediately
Can you feel it?

Inside a couch you can't help but roast
Burnt like toast
She hangs above us
Beatin on everyone It don't love us
It's too hot to argue It's too hot to chill
Too hot to cool off we all on the grill
It's like pain in the air big waves of heat
Dryin out trees meltin tar in the street
The hot ball grows closer shuttin us down
Beamin back heat rays up off the ground
Swimming pools dry empty the water is slim
The sky is on fire burnin all within
Metal objects heat up brush fires burn

Swelterin heat waves when sunshine hurts

Rubber peels off tires to the street then fries
The sun don't go down it just stays put
Vampin out life turnin earth to soot
The juices are dried up it boils the mind
Don't look at the ball or forever go blind
It's too hot to hurry too hot to breathe
Treacherous heat waves too hot to believe
The hands melt off the clock on the wall
Fire engulfs us many tiny flames crawl
Too hot to worry too hot to cry
Too hot to let go and too hot to try
Too hot to panic too hot to maintain

My dick in your vertical smile (yeah)
We kiss and hug, and snug, and tickle
But the bitch wouldn't even buff my fucking pickle (bitch)
You fucked everybody else in the place, it's all good

Intro (Bizaar),Bizaar,2000,"*Radio static*
...over Detroit. Right now, a massive cloud is lingering over the city. Police say calls from worried residents began pouring in this morning. Witnesses say it looked like a large, dark rain cloud, that initially started over Hart Plaza, and within' hours, the cloud spread, now covering a large portion of the Midwest. People in the affected regions say it looks like the workings of an incredible thunderstorm, the bizarre weather events being linked to the cloud, including red lightning, black hail, and super hot gale force winds. Meteorologists remain baffled as satellite pictures and radar shows the cloud is continuing to expand. Experts say that its current rate of travel, the the entire nation will be completely covered in just a matter of hours. Police are asking you please to remain indoors and not panic. The President has ordered the military to be on emergency alert, and they stand by, powerless, forced to watch and wait. As the cloud expands, many people are now placing spiritual significance on its appearance. Leaders from mainstream religions and apocalyptic cults are declaring it to be anything from the second coming to grim consequence of man’s abuse of nature. Fueling the speculation are reports from across the country that the only light piercing this churning, inky, shroud are beams of sunlight, which are only falling at places of worship: all religions and denominations. As the cloud continues to expand across the nation, the rest of the world looks on with growing concern",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-intro-bizaar-lyrics

I’m coming out
Yeah, bitch!
I’m finally found in this up in this motherfucker
Just look around
I’m shinin'! super shinin', like diamond-encrusted 20-inch rims, motherfucker!
I’m rollin’ the fuck on!

Take a look around
Your link is found
You're finally found
Look around, Just look around
The world is full of wonder
And now it’s all mine

Take it Out on Me,The First Six,2014,"At first, I was terrified, frozen white, I couldn’t move
I thought this would be my Hell forever, never to improve
But then over time I learned what to expect from her visits
And all my questions were answered regarding who or what is it
Missy’s a phantom from a past life, stuck in purgatory
Killed at twenty-two years old, about a hundred years before me
Someone stuck her with a rusty knife, again and again
And now she’s stuck alone there in the void, and I’m her only friend
And when she’s nice, she’s so nice, but when she’s mad, there’s Hell to pay
I’m the only soul she knows, so she sends it all my way
She sets my bed up in flames and fills the floor with rattlesnakes
The walls shake, whatever it takes ‘til my sanity breaks
I’ve been ripped upon so many times, I take it ‘cause I love her
She fills my bed with tarantulas under my covers
I live to help her. Take it out on me. What’s a little pain?
I hold her tight at night while she sticks her fangs in my brain

It’s an old house, in an old section of town
Where he lays in his bedroom at night, she comes around
And chokes him down. At first, he never understood her
He used to think how could her, a hundred-year-old murder
Now he gets it; she was killed long ago and won’t forget it
She takes it out on him as if he did it, but he loves her
‘Cause she’s the only woman in his sorry life
The torture is wrong, but happens almost every night

Possibly, when I’m dead and gone, we can be one
For now I’ll let her punish me hard, like I’m her only son
Sometimes I call her mother. It’s funny, she’s not my mom
But when she’s unleashing fury, that seems to keep her calm
I do my damn duty; it’s my job to let her terrify me
How else on earth would she release her pain, and where would I be
Without her in my life? What would I do? We’re like a couple
Every night, I have to rush the fuck home, ‘cause I’m in trouble
She was taken at a tender young age, a bloody rage
Her life story is so fucking short, with blood on every page
Of course she’s full of anger; she was taken by a stranger
And here I’m sleeping in her bedroom. ‘Course I’m in danger
So she haunts me because she wants me. That’s why she taunts me
She fights me because she likes me. That’s why she bites me
I’m there for her for all her horror, never ignore her
It’s my chore to take more, ‘til I’m black and blue and sorer

It’s an old house, in an old section of town
Where he lays in his bedroom at night, she comes around
And chokes him down. At first, he never understood her
He used to think how could her, a hundred-year-old murder
Now he gets it; she was killed long ago and won’t forget it
She takes it out on him as if he did it, but he loves her
‘Cause she’s the only woman in his sorry life
The torture is wrong, but happens almost every night

Who am I to be living a real life
When yours was cut short by a steel knife?
I think of all that you had to miss
You never even been kissed
Take it out on me
Take it out on me
Take it out on me
Take it out on me
Make it rain blood. Crush my lungs
Show me Hell’s caverns; pull out my tongue
Jump on my back; twist off my head
Let ‘em kill me instead

*Uh, shit. I was just at the racetrack with my brother*
Cool beans, man. Peel out
*What?*
Take your shirt off
*What for, man?*
Ha ha! I’m saying, man. I know you got a six pack. Sh-show me- Let me see your back, man
*Why?*

03:24,The First Six,2014,"Speak of our demise, you speak the tongue of the devil
Every obstacle we cross, we advance another level
Our towers ascend much higher than the skyline
So if you want beef, I got yours. Why don't you try mine?
Friends becomes enemies because time surprises you
Those who once idolize suddenly despisin' you
Later when asked who his influences were
Suddenly he forgets, and his brains become a blur
You get shit on for all that you did and all the love
All the time you spent tryin' to vouch he ain't a scrub
Keep your cronuts cause I'ma show go nuts when the times right
For now enjoy the limelight, we hittin' from your blindside
And e don't want no in-betweeners on our team either
See you walk home or get in the car packin' a heater
That's a ryder, the definition of a gunfight
Try to pull one on me ill take your army out in one night
Your're gonna smash into a tree, cashed right on the corner
Horn blowin', everybody dead, early in the mornin'
'Cause we shoot back, and like you got a fruit-packed center
All your blood comes squirtin' out, when all the bullets enter
We some old-time gangstas from the Southwest side
Since I was 14, dreamt about committing homicide
But I never knew who 'til now, bang! bang! 
Never thought I could really do it now I see how
Everybody fuckin' pluckin' from our tree. It's time we guard the yard
That's why I'm tellin y'all we reekin' havoc next joker card
I'm sick a talkin' bout love when don't nobody show us none
Except for juggalo ninjas that's had our back from day one
Sleeping giants, and when we ring the bells of war
You best believe it, it's gonna be some hell to score
Record sales, I give a fuck whether we sell anymore
I'm more concerned about revenge and mobbin' into your door
Bitches out promotin' our shows, if I see that van again
I swear to God ill get to panicking and brandishing a ten
I ain't no chopper, unless you talking about decapitation
All you faggots eating off us, causing more than aggravation
Fuck your flyers. Pack your fuckin' shit up and beat it
If I catch you on our scene I'll take a brick and make ya eat it
I got a love for everybody that was ever on the hatchet
And it's gonna stay the same until we buried in a casket
I ride with Myzery from the Bronx back to the murder mitten
All the way out to LA and back and never bullshittin'
When it's time to get forbidden whatever we committin
From a distance or a personal like a throat slittin'
Plus my homies from the Southwest side all down to ride
Unleash 'em all to the battleground whenever we decide
Dirty groundhogs out here all livin in our garden
It's time we fuckin harden, hit you with the beg your pardon
Of a moose. Gonna Joe Bruce gun to make your juice run
All over the walls behind you to remind you
This is our turf, and all that it's worth is our takin'
It's time you fuckin' fat piggies got blown into bacon
Violent J and Shaggy from day one, with the painted faces
Quit rippin' us off, always dreamin' of tradin' places
But you'll never have what we got, we too far up the mountain
So stay the fuck in home like a pussy and keep poutin'
Jumpsteady, my brother, has been the keeper of the peace
But even he says that it's time our fuckin' dogs are released *bark*
So let us pull the fuckin' guns out and see who fuckin runs out
And see who stays on our side ready to ride
It's time that we quit lettin' all the bullshit slide
Where the fuck is our pride? Raise from the dead if it died
I moved my family to safe ground, cause hell about to rain
I can't front it feels good to go insane and bring the pain
And shake the fuckin ground up my trigger fingers curled up
Piss on 'em and don't miss, buck buck buck buck
We hurt their feelings when we squirt their blood on the ceiling
Wicked clowns with an axe to your neck. What's more appealing?

 Check it out, babe, the House Of Wax!
 Um no no
 Are you serious?!
Honey I'm scared!
 Come on man!
 Well, if you're not gonna support me, then I'm going home!
 Bye!
 Fuck you!

Hoes,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 6",2019,"I love hoes that love me, even the ugly ones
Hoes? and they panties, sweet than candies
Long? titties, walla balla king kong
Titties fat like pumpkins, or little itty bitties
Hoes make me jump up and clap my heels
When? they blowin’ my balls off and feedin’ me meals
I? love hoes’ smell, cinnamon perfume scents
Jackin’ off in your window, see me hoppin’ the fence
I? love old ladies. They did the most fuckin’
And young hoes fantasize about dick suckin’
I love hungry hoes with crusty toes
Painted up, wet juggalettes, fresh from shows
Give? me pig tails, pony tails, tease your shit up
Either way, I nut on your titties and then get up
I love it when hoes get mad, a new side to ‘em
It only makes me wanna do ‘em. I love hoes

Ho, I’m a ho. Two hoes is just who we are (Ho, ho, ho)
I ho my homies over hoes and ho their ho hard (Ho, ho, ho)
I’m a ho, baby Hey ho, I’ll pull your whole card (Ho, ho, ho)
I’m a ho for home. When hoes ho me, I ho hard (Ho, ho)

Hoes take you to court because they miss your dick
They can be scantless, wicked, and sick
I chase hoes. Ho chaser, ho catcher
I’m like a mother fucking blood hound: I smell her and fetch her
I love hoes that fuck outside and ain’t scared of it
And always polish your knob because they love it
I love hoes with accents, hoes that’s hood rats
Hoes that graduated, top of the stats
I don’t fucking care. Middle-aged moms
Young and old hoes are the mother fucking bomb
I love hoes with the artificial hair and boobs
I cut heads off gay poser dudes
Little mama, keep droppin’ babies out of your neden
You’re the reason we’re alive, and ain’t nobody forgettin’

I’m a ho, baby Hey ho, I’ll pull your whole card (Ho, ho, ho)
I’m a ho for home. When hoes ho me, I ho hard (Ho, ho)

Now you know I love hoes, and they love me back
Take my meat in they butt, down to the nut sack
I treat these hoes like a rodeo
Lasso ‘em, tie ‘em up, and plug they holes
I like ‘em rail thin, and I like me a biggin
And everything in between, I make room to fit in
I knew me a ho, Loopy Lauren
Had me a large pizza, so I knew I was scorin’
I fed her a slice. One gulp, it was gone
By the end of dessert, I was peelin’ off her thong
I knew a small ho with a big ol’ neden
She turned me out, had me shakin’ and sweatin’
It’s okay. I recovered. Took a while
But I came back, hit it jackhammer style
I love me some hoes, I don’t think you understand
No homies no more, ‘cause they men, man

Ho, I’m a ho. Two hoes is just who we are (Ho, ho, ho)
I ho my homies over hoes and ho their ho hard (Ho, ho, ho)
I’m a ho, baby Hey ho, I’ll pull your whole card (Ho, ho, ho)

Sometimes I get so high, my mind gets lost in
Compton, with Eazy-E, ridin’ down Slauson
Ice cold 40’s, freezin’ our balls
Smokin’ purple  and shorties creepin’ and crawlin’
I won’t lie, no place I’d rather be when I’m high
Than up on Andre the Giant’s shoulders, smokin’ 
On his way to the ring as he’s beatin’ some ass
I’m front row with Bruce Lee, eatin’ brownies of hash
Then I dash in the limo off to Neverand
For a water balloon fight with the King of Pop, my man
We stop his ferris wheel, way up on top
And smoke cotton candy nuggets out his personal crop
I can’t stop wishin’ all my heroes wasn’t dead, man
We was marinatin’ somewhere gettin’ high instead
It’s just a dream, or so it seem, but every day I’m closer
Than I’ve ever been to gettin’ high with breed again

Take a big hit. Praise Jah, rastafari
Up to the sky, so high, unbelievable
Jimi Hendrix jammin’ solos for kilo
Look at Kobain whippin’ cocaine with Elvis
Sid Vicious rippin’ whip-it’s with Jesus?

Up and down the street on my bike. I’m gettin’ silly
Like Evel Knievel ridin’ around soakin’ Phillies
You’re jumpin down the stairs, breakin’ bones. Man, I know you feel me
Time to  just shoot it
Albert Einstein, duct tape and super glue it
I’m high like Mike’s dad. Pass it up and just do it
And everybody still alive, feel the vibe and groove it (Yeah)
I see myself ridin’ up and down the block
Goin’ west side  smokin’ pot with 2Pac. Ha!

Been on my quest for all my life
These hoes look blessed, but they’re hella trife

I fuckin’ found my baby (I finally found my baby)
(It’s true that it’s you)

I was ready to give it all up (Give it all up)
And settle for some dumb slut (For some dumb slut)
Out of prospects and places to try (All out)
But then you busted through right into my life (Right into my life)

I gave my trust, and for that, got crushed
I’ve had my world rammed into dust
I’ve looked, stalked, chased, hawked
But now, I can’ walk off
I’ve prowled, creeped, sought, seeked
Crept, but now it’s the shit

Because I found you (I finally found you)
I fuckin’ found my baby (I finally found my boo)
Thank God I found you (I finally found you)

Ayo, Breed, why you got penning on your walls?
Sittin' on a gurney, head wrapped and bald
Well, the doctor say I’m manic depressive
So now I'm just counting my blessings
But either way it go, shit I'm knowing I’m stressin'
So here's an SOS out to that Smith and Wesson
I'm looking for a way out, when I used to be way up
You can stay up out my business or I'll fuck your whole day up, for real
Killin' a bitch is therapeutic, and feel a hell of a lot better soon as you shoot it
Got me to where I wouldn't mind watching you bleed
Coughing blood on your hands and knees, yeah, I'm pissed
You better hope they come with my meds ’cause I got all gory shit coming through my head
They say I won’t be getting out of here for months (Shit)
But I'ma leave this bitch tomorrow and I’m walkin' out the front, for real

Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)

It's like my brain is locked, they're tryna put the key in
It’s all good, but this ain't no place to be in
It look like a loony bin that we in
'Cause me and my brain be disagreeing
A cup to pee in, evaluation, and get shocked up with no hesitation
Give me my pills, bitch, the voices are coming
And I gotta roll quick, my Rolls Royce is running
I'm walking along a beach in Panama
No I'm not, I'm seeing things, God dammit, awe
Slow me down, speed me up
I'm chasing little kids in a haunted ice cream truck
I'm dreaming again, in a beamin' ass Benz
Getting sucked off, then she cleaning my friends
She had a fat ass, I slapped it proper, and woke up jackin' off in front of the doctors

Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)
Get out my head and let me go (Let me go)

Miss Fuckaloopagoopo, my doctor
She was stupid, so, I socked her
I cold snuck the hoe, popped her
Then cut her up, chopped her
They found a dick in her butthole, stuck
Somebody plug that shit there, what?
Fuckin' tragedy, it's not fair
Shit, beats me how it got there
Can't miss mine, brbrbrbr nope, peep it
But that was dope how the dude said ""Keep it""
I need  albino
Like the beats and the loops of the vinyl
Face mangled, tangled spinal
Neck strangled, twisted, die hoe
Ribs shattered, seconds, final

House of Mirrors (feat. Capital E),UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Ladies and gentlemen, the house of mirrors
For just one bet, venture through this wonderful exhibit
See yourself in all the weird shapes and sizes
You, young man, would you like to go into the house of mirrors
Well, okay
Have a good time, son
And good luck finding your way out
Wait a minute, I don't like it in here
Hey, wait a minute, let me out of here
Let...there's dead bodies in here
There's dead bodies in here
I don't like it in here!!!""
Step inside, come my way
This here is your fatal day
You have lied, they have cried
Now your life has been denied
Look into the big mirror
Your reflection is so clear
Devil's head, rotting flesh
With the snakes inside your chest
In the mirror you can't hide
You've been granted Jacob's lide
Whipping fear, spinning pain
All you crying is in vain
You're the beast you never knew
This reflects the things you do
Others starving down the block
Richie's heart is like a rock
How can I make a law?
I'm just here to break your jaw
House of Glass, down and up
You might get your ass cut
Mirror of Life, Mirror of Pain
Death, I wave my magic cain
Your last words are those of fear
But they go unheard in the House of Mirrors
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors
Magic wand, magic mirror
Timeless clock says death is near
Death is here, death is on
My king bishop takes your pawn
You can't break House of Mirrors
That's bad luck for seven years
Only in my wicked realm
Of thee untold, now unfold
Thinking back, what you do
Buy a richie home or two
Even though some down and out
You keep what you could live without
You're the beast you never knew
This reflects the things you do
Others starving down the block
Richie's heart is like a rock
First I grab, then I stab
Cut you up into a slab
Grind and twist, flick my wrist
Toss you in the magic mist
Look into Halls of Glass
Every mirror shows the past
With no love you kick the sin of face
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors
Three blind mice, your worst fear
Look into the deadly mirror
Welcome to the House of Mirrors, Mr. Exec
You should explain to E why ICP should let you live
As you look on I see this image in your reflection
A bigot under cover, showing no affections
To the ghettos and the hoods
Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow
And when that shit happens, there's no pinion, no sorrow
Cuz you refuse to lift a hand
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand
And if I were you I'd fear myself
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth
You just gotta let em fall
You Violent J, ""what up"", bash that head against the wall
And don't let him run for the door (where you goin, bitch?)
Make him detour to the sore
And let's wash away his bigot sins
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends
And let them see what they really like
Hand-high riding the Benz and I'm a clown-riding the bike
So look closely in the mirror
You're the beast you never knew, so be the next to volunteer
To live in the hood with the ICP
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors
""Who's next for the one and the only
House of Mirrors? This Carnival will only be in your town
Until our job is done; so get it over with
And step into the House of Mirrors
You young lady, come this way
Step into the House of Mirrors and see the spineless, heartless
Stingy, rich little skank that you are
Or maybe you'd be interested in the Murder-Go-Round
Or the Wax Museum, or maybe the bearded man Jumpsteady
Will supply your thrills or how bout the juggling trio

Phantom,Phantom: X-Tra Spooky Edition,2015,"Get scared, bitch
Boo, mother fucker!
Yeah, uh, yeah

The day I die is a day to rejoice
‘Cause I'm comin’ back if I'm given a choice
I'ma be a ghoul, a ghost, or a phantom
I’ma haunt mother fuckers off at random *scream*
Watch me hover right above your bed
With fifteen snakes comin' out of my head
I'ma sit on your chest just like The Witch
I'ma be a wicked-ass son of a bitch
My old enemies will all be screamin'
Stab ‘em with my tail if I become a demon
When you look in the mirror, I'ma be right there
Fillin' your skin bitch-ass whole with fear
Spin my head around like the exorcist
But she'll look like a Barbie doll next to this
I’ma make ghost hunters all shit their pants
Join  and move to France

Bones and blood and bats from Hell
Raise the dead. He has to kill
Back to haunt those of ill will
And you (Die) you (Die) you (Die) you (Die)
Bones and blood and bats from Hell
Raise the dead. He has to kill
Back to haunt those of ill will
And you (Die!) you (Die!) you (Die!)

Shit, don’t let me die. Heed my warning
‘Cause I'm comin’ back, a gargoyle
, soarin'
My ex-girlfriends are all gettin' the vision
I'm knockin’ on the walls at night. “Who is it?”
They locked the doors. It could be someone nutty
When they walk in the room, I'll be hangin', bloody
Arms stretched out, screamin' their name
I'm finna drive these bitches insane
I'll make it rain blood all over your home
I'll rattle your walls every time you're alone
I'll kill your cat and hang him by the tail
With a rusty nail. (MEOW!) I'm that stale
I'll leave you screamin' and evacuatin'
Why am I doing this shit? ‘Cause I'm hatin'
If I can't be alive, I'm hauntin', dead
I'll put a thousand tarantulas all in your bed

Bones and blood and bats from Hell
Raise the dead. He has to kill
Back to haunt those of ill will
And you (Die) you (Die) you (Die) you (Die)
Bones and blood and bats from Hell
Raise the dead. He has to kill
Back to haunt those of ill will
And you (Die!) you (Die!) you (Die!)

Nah, there's no escapin' my spiritual rapin'
If you think it's a coincidence, you're mistaken
When you're trying to relax in a bubble bath
I turn the water to blood, sit back, and laugh

I float down the halls, draggin' my balls
Leavin' a trail of dead bones and skulls
Fuck sittin' around all night in my grave
I'll put your boyfriend's head in the microwave *beep beep beep*

I'll wake the dead up and raise an army
Attack the streets, people scream “Don't harm me!”
Ascend on your home like this was Thriller
But no Michael Jackson, ‘cause this is realer

Well, damn, that 
Nowhere to run, ‘cause we blocked the road
Shock your hair white, and you ain't old
We'll squeeze your neck until your head explode

Bones and blood and bats from Hell
Raise the dead. He has to kill
Back to haunt those of ill will
And you (Die) you (Die) you (Die) you (Die)
Bones and blood and bats from Hell
Raise the dead. He has to kill
Back to haunt those of ill will, forever…

Birfday Party (Outtake),Mike E. Clark’s Extra Pop! Emporium,2012,"Remember me?
Don’t act like you don’t remember me, bitch
I know you remember
Because

(You came to my birthday party)
Back before bein’ cool was such a disease (Uh huh)
(You came to my birthday party)
We held it down and rocked it out at Chuck E. Cheese (We did)
(You came to my birthday party)
You even brought me a present. We drank pop and played tag
(You came to my birthday party)
We were unconditioned to hate and call each other fag

We were nine or ten years old. I know you don’t remember
Even if you do, you won’t admit it. You would never
Lend a hand if you saw me getting beat up in the back, and
Still I remember when you showed up dressed like Bat-Man, when
[Chorus: Violent J & 
Shaggy  2 Dope
]
(You came to my birthday party)
We gave a fuck less about race, creed, or color
(You came to my birthday party)
When it was time to go home, we cried and begged our mothers
(No!)
(You came to my birthday party)
We ate the cake and ice cream, acted a fool from the sugar
(You came to my birthday party)
We laughed and chased your little sister ‘round with a booger

We didn’t know life would separate us, turn us into scrubs and players
Turn us into nerds and jocks, frontin’ for these haters
And we gravitate to cliques and wouldn’t be caught dead together
Back then, our hearts were pure and clean, ‘cause we ain’t know no better. Ha!

(You came to my birthday party)
What would happen if I showed up at yours next weekend?
(You came to my birthday party)
Ain’t nothin’ changed but the times, yet I’d surely catch a beatin’
(You came to my birthday party)
Your daddy dropped you off and picked you up when it was done
(You came to my birthday party)
My mama wrapped the leftover cake and even let you take some

Go ahead and lie to me. No matter who you try to be
I remember when you was true. You can’t deny to me
We should all remember then, pure and young and heaven sent
We’re taught by others how to hate. We’re born with love, it’s evident
A child’s mind is something free. All they want is company
But life turns us on each other. Punk him or he’s punkin’ me
The masses are like blind sheep, follow ‘cause they minds weak
Remember we was cool as little kids? (Don’t remind me) But you did

(You came to my birthday party) (You did)
Back before bein’ cool was such a disease (Uh huh)
(You came to my birthday party)
We held it down and rocked it down at Chuck E. uh, Cheese

You brought me a present. We drank pop and played tag
(You came to my birthday party)
We were unconditioned to hate and call each other fags

(You came to my birthday party)

(You came to my birthday party)
Or or or or or video footage
(You came to my birthday party)
I I I I I I know you remember, bitch
(You came to my birthday party)
You’re too cool to admit, but I know you remember
(You came to my birthday party)
Punk mother fucker, I know you remember. You remember
(You came to my birthday party) (You remember, bitch)
We was friends. I know you remember (Woo!)

Dead bodies wake from the juggalo sound
Raise from the ground
Raise from the ground!
Call me crazy, I’d rather be dead
With my eyeballs hangin’ out of my head
Follow your bigot-ass wicked law
I’d rather be ass-out dead like “Fuck y’all!”
Dead folks wakin’ up now any minute
To pull they arm off and slap you with it!
Dead bodies wake from the juggalo sound
Raise from the ground!
Raise from the ground!

Everybody dead on the East Side (RISE!)
Everybody dead on the West Side (RISE!)
Everybody dead on the North Side (RISE!)

Judgement Day 2018,UnKnown,2018,"(Intro)
""What I will be teaching about is Demonology. Now let's pray: Father I thank you?for?this class, I?thank you for this beginning, I?thank you for (Demonology)""
""Jesus ain't gonna let you call him (What about Jesus?)""
""You gonna call him Junior""
""You've been talking about the same God, the same God, the same God, that will do it for you""
""I've been Blessed to have your mother! 55 years old and she still slides""
""I don't want your mouth, we are about Bibles""
""They created a ""god"" who doesn't exist""
(verse 1) Judgment Day is here, FFF!
Don't bother prayin' cause there's no time left
Headed for Armageddon
I'm bleeding like I'm sweatin'
As I'm Walkin' Da Flatlinez, we Runnin' Out of Time
Nobody's safe so why you thinkin' you safe hoe?
You'd Rather Be Dead is what you said so take it slow
Hacks from the Battle Axe
Jacked up from mad attacks
Headless Crooked Preacher in the trunk of the Cadillac
God's gonna get ya, it's all cause He loves ya
With the Witch suffocatin', levitatin' above ya
Don't go to church in tithe they say 'among one thing Jack
Life is a one way road you can't go back.""
The Devil will cook you but God's wrath is much worse
Ya dying at first, but then the Holy Water is cursed
The good and the evil collide, just in the nick of time
Before you even make up ya mind; a double homicide
Suicidal tendencies, only get in the fuckin' way
Face ya sins, the gig is up, it's Judgment Day
(Chorus) {sampled ""War Pigs' Black Sabbath]
Day of Judgment God is calling
Hand of God has struck the hour
(Verse 2) Shaggy 2 Dope:
Thou shall not sin so our playaz are singin' song
Who the fuck is you to tell me what's right from wrong?
Death is in my eyes, so pain is my disguise
So deadly it's followed by maggots and flies
You'll see from ya face that ya judgment is just you
Old sins plus new, they rushed you, then bust you
Fool don't trust me, I can't be trusted
But you can Judge in Peace until it gets busted
Ya goin' to Hell for all your sins
Pins and needles, needles and pens
Voodoo Doctor on the rocks with Vodka
Bustin beats, boxin' where the whore got ya
Landed on the moon, but still can't fly right
Other's wanna fake ya step, can't die right?
Sellin' Bibles on the corner with your pay
For all your sins it's Judgment Day
(sampled chorus alternate 2)
Day of Judgment God is calling
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh Lord yea!
(Verse 3) Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope:
You motherfuckin' sinner the evil will choke ya
Check the hand you was dealt, it's all Jokers!
Judgment Day, time to pay, for all you've earned
You'll never die, chained to a stake, you'll burn
Your going to Hell if ya sell lies that's all she wrote
Lord forgive me, No ,bitch, ya don't (Huh?)
Judgment Day, Armageddon is here to stay
Now all of a sudden, all you wanna do is pray
Say sorry for all the death you left, but that don't work
Say sorry for all the pain you bring, but that don't work
Ya say ya sorry for ya whole life spent (?)
Ya say ya sorry for ya hate but you're too late
Bitch meet your fate, It's Judgment Day

Surviving the Game,Featuring Freshness,2000,"Tell me, what the fuck you gonna tell a vet, a boss?
…....... yet? You lost
You underestimated, weak expectations
We superceeded all of that, fat all in the map
With that (ooh), like we brand new
We schoolin, freak it the whole game
Feelin' like a fool for speakin'
But we ain't tryna win any awards, make fake friends
Exploding below the streets, earthquake
In this … shed networking and digging tunnels
Invading the industry, hijacking the channels
The hatchet and hard truth, part proof that lives
Among the mass contention, the system gives
If you attackin' back with axes, gats and hatchets
Bust 'n doing backflips by any means tactics
Get it, their head all in the way? Split it
Always leave one alive so they can tell 'em you did it
And then we
We break bread, make bread, take bread
They said, that we couldn't do it
But we still here surviving the game
We ride and we grind, survivin' they try to
Keep our voice quiet, but we still here survivin' the game
From killa county to the motor city rollin'
We holdin' 'em steady underground heaters
And we still here survivin' the game
It ain't nothing but a thing to us
It ain't nothing but a thing to bust
We crush 'em
It ain't nothing but a thing to spit fire
The real shit don't expire we at a high wire
Pullin' tricks 'n stunts we done only hit once
Electrocute the industry every six months
We get on this bitch but we don't want it
Keep the Lotus low love don't flaunt it
Another Juggalo hit bitch I'm on it
And if I ever won a Grammy I'd pawn it
You wanna know about this?
Well I doubt this you wanna diss
Cause what you love ain't about shit
We not only survive but thrive and blast
And never stop like “Ah, at last”
Puttin' in work self-made experts
Show this played out scene how the next works
Ambition, that's what got these ho's dissin'
Thowin' weak ass blows and all week missin'

Dough gotta cut, let me introduce
To the Juggalo nation ain't no substitute
For the original hard truth soldier it's on
I get the strap of the wreck and get yo motherfuckin' back blown
The revolutionary pro hitter
Spittin' hard truth bricks over street slaps we get wit' ya
With 4 million sold …
It ain't a thing for me to post and reach across the motherfuckin Nile
Motor city get yo grib tight
'n recognise the arcitect that sparked the light
Crack the code, show the whole world the power of truth
Now motherfucker can you buy that too? I guess ruthless
I see the bitch in them ho's they get nervous
'Cause I'm N.W.A. but with a purpose
In these days and times all fake raps and media traps keep it underground
Guerilla attack
We break bread, make bread, take bread
They said, that we couldn't do it
But we still here surviving the game
We ride and we grind, survivin' they try to
Keep our voice quiet, but we still here survivin' the game
From killa county to the motor city rollin'
We holdin' 'em steady underground heaters
And we still here survivin the game
It ain't nothing but a thing to us
It ain't nothing but a thing to bust
We crush 'em
We break bread, make bread, take bread
They said, that we couldn't do it
But we still here surviving the game
We ride and we grind, survivin' they try to
Keep our voice quiet, but we still here survivin' the game
From killa county to the motor city rollin'
We holdin' 'em steady underground heaters
And we still here survivin the game
It ain't nothing but a thing to us
It ain't nothing but a thing to bust
We crush 'em
It's like a blast fast massacre, mass than blast faster
'n slash your whole status, you're staff 'cause y'all have had it
I crash through with mac-mooze(??) attack fools with the black tool
With the hard truth for the grass roots and greet y'all with that Whoop Whoop!
It's MC'in, I'm seein' 'em eatin' them notice
It's no supposing just quotable quotes I wrote 'em
Fuck around in the arena, I'm meaner, supreme 'n leaner
I seen 'em slippin', I rip 'em, I'm set trippin' 'n blitz in your system
Juggalos know the best they, recognise my essay
Comin' deep as essays, I'm S.A
The moral of the story's like Maury, I am the father
Split your wig back, bullshit raps don't even bother
Take your motherfuckers back to battlin'
I'm battlin', known to make 'em scatter when spittin' gangster chattering
All up in your gathering, back I'm with that black on snatch
'n crack your backbone, bitch don't even act on
Write a check 'n make your whole crew bounce
Fake rappers wanna give me a pound
Can't fuck around with that wanna-g, wannabee-itus it's like a virus
Sign they ass into the clinic, g shit I be the venom, hit him up, for sinnin'
Run, protect yo women, Juggalettes know, recognise the true's for jokes
Let a soldier do his thing when I'm in yo scene
Kiss the pinky ring now motherfucker I'm anti-bling
And I take bread 'n make bread, what they said
And all that, but stall that, I never change the format
Recall that, when this drop, I am Hip-Hop
So fuck what you claimin', hard truth don't stop
So before you fix your mouth and say that you ain't heard
The A-R after the P before the I-S served
No I put you up on gang cook, ain't have a skirt
From my mouth to your motherfuckin' ears now that's my word",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-surviving-the-game-lyrics

These Walls Will Fall,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 6",2019,"This just in:
A deadly riot has erupted at Jackson State Penitentiary
Which officials now believe involves the entire prison

Dead bodies, destruction and fire will be the fallout
I’m in the guard shack. I hit release and let ‘em all out
I threw a bull out the fifth tier. I’m in a panic
Wilin’ out up here like I’m a manic satanic
I’m killin’ screws with whatever I can do to do it
It’s kill or be killed, and I’m just cruisin’ through it
All control is lost, but freedom’s a goner
I like the buzz from the electric chair; it give me a boner

(Fall!) For our freedom (Fuckin’ fall!)
These wall will fall (These walls will fall!)
We will defeat ‘em (Fuckin’ fall)
Kill and eat ‘em all (Kill and eat ‘em all)

I’m in the prison yard. Around my head, bullets are whizzin’ hard
I see the flames of Hell have finally risen and charred
And now it’s death at any second. Shop ‘em, tryin’ to wreck it
Dead guard on the grass, his pistol I check it
I put a bullet in the back of a bull. I always hated her
Walk by slow and blow a hole in her braided hair
At least I got the last laugh. The guard power blast back
I’m shot, havin’ trouble breathin’ like an asthmatic

The riot erupted at about 7:30 AM this morning
When prison officials lost control over both the yard and kitchen area
When inmate fighting simultaneously broke out at both locations

(Fall!) For our freedom (Fuckin’ fall!)
These wall will fall (These walls will fall!)
We will defeat ‘em (Fuckin’ fall)
Kill and eat ‘em all (Kill and eat ‘em all)

Why’d I Have To Die?,The Marvelous Missing Link (The Outtakes),2015,"We are gathered here today
To mourn the loss of
A dearly departed
Hard-working
Wonderful soul
He leaves behind his three wonderful children
And his beautiful wife
His mighty, mighty beautiful wife
His voluptuous, curvy wife

I'm sitting here in the afterlife. I see the pearly gates
I guess now I’m supposed to wait
I got wings; I can fly around. It's all heavenly
I thought I'd live to be at least seventy
I got three daughters; the oldest was only ten
And I’m supposed to fly? What about them?
I left my wife behind to fend for herself
And I wasn't even in poor health
I left my family to suffer, down there crying
While I'm in the beautiful afterlife, flying
I'm waiting in line to see God, and when I get to Him
I'ma ask him what the fuck was he doing
I was happy on earth; I wanted to stay
I can't do this to my wife. I got so much to say
There wasn't even a goodbye; I just upped and jetted
Now they're staring at my grave, my name embedded

Why’d I have to die? (I wasn’t ready to)
Why'd I have to die? (God, I’m asking you)
Why'd I have to die? (This is bullshit!)
Why'd I have to die? (What about my kids?)
Why'd I have to die? (I was a young man)
Why’d I have to die? (I don't understand)
Why'd I have to die? (I don't want heaven!)
Why'd I have to die? (No, this can't happen!)

I was on my way home from a double shift
In my right pocket, I had my wife's gift
It was her birthday. Everything was all right
Until a drunk kid blew the light
All I remember is headlights approaching
Next thing I knew, on my own blood I'm choking
The car exploded, and I'm looking down on it
When they told my wife, she had to vomit
Now I'm flying through the clouds with all the angles
I think about it, someone I wanna strangle
I wanna live to see my children have their kids
I wanna hold them like my father did
Why was I cut out? They say he has a plan
Well this is torture. I don't understand
How can I watch my family cry
And just fly through the sky at look at them like ""Bye!""

Why'd I have to die? (I wasn't ready to)
Why'd I have to die? (God, I'm asking you)
Why'd I have to die? (This is bullshit!)
Why'd I have to die? (What about my kids?)
Why'd I have to die? (I was a young man)
Why'd I have to die? (I don't understand)
Why'd I have to die? (I don't want heaven!)
Why'd I have to die? (No, this can't happen!)

I'm up here watching my own funeral
My family's dressed in black, so are my pals
Everybody's crying. The casket is shut
It's gotta be; I was blown the fuck up
I see a preacher I never knew acting somber
Hitting on my wife. I can't take this any longer
I see my parents. My mother's hysterical
I wish I could return, perform some kind of miracle
But all I can do is wait for them at the gates
And I will, no matter how long it takes
I hope it's forever, and they live full lives
I wanna see my daughters grow and become wives
I'll probably have to watch my wife remarry
'Cause I was taken so young and unfairly
What kind of plan is this? Keep your wings
I don't want anything that heaven brings!

Why'd I have to die? (I wasn't ready to)
Why'd I have to die? (God, I'm asking you)
Why'd I have to die? (This is bullshit!)
Why'd I have to die? (What about my kids?)
Why'd I have to die? (I was a young man)
Why'd I have to die? (I don't understand)
Why'd I have to die? (I don't want heaven!)
Why'd I have to die? (No, this can't happen!)
Why'd I have to die? (I wasn't ready to)

For kickin' 'em in the face when they on the ground

Droppin' knees on their head when they down on the grass
I'm sorry for stealing cars from those who need it
Stick the barrel to they forehead and tell them to beat it

Fresh rims, all shiny and new. Fuck you. I want it

I stole me a Yukon truck this mornin’
Need some excitement so tonight ain’t borin’
Took it to the car wash and waxed it down
Everybody knows Carjacks the Clown *laugh*
I was spittin’ at two fat chicks who walkin’
Parked in a no-park lane, we talkin’
And I’m like, what y’all doin’ tonight?
Suddenly it’s all bright, red and blue lights
Damn, this truck ain’t mine. I hacked it
Got a gun and cocaine in my jacket
Get out the truck, bitch. I gots to bail
I ain’t tryin’ to see my ass back in jail
High-speed chase, this cop is on me
More and more join the scene, an army
Hit the side street close to Mama’s
Drove across the front lawn of 
Jumped out the car, flew across the wall
Most were too fat, ‘cause it was tall
But two of ‘em still was right behind me
(“And they got tasers”)
 Don’t remind me!
I hopped three fences. The shit was hectic
This is too close. I must correct it
Dipped into Ma’s house as they ran by it
She cooked me lasagna. You got to try it

But fuck goin’ back. I can’t waste my time
I need a clean getaway when I do crime
I sell dope, but I ain’t a toker
They call me Dopey the Joker
Female cop stop me, I’ll choke her
Pull my shank out and belly poke her
I never had, but I talk the shit
Got a bag full of dope, and I’m walkin’ quick
Cop pulls up, asks where I’m headed
To the titty bar, ‘bout to peep some neden
Why, you wanna join me? He didn’t laugh
Pointed to my bag and asked me, “What’s that?”
I know the routine, so now I’m runnin’
He’s runnin’ stop as he points his gun in
I keep bookin’ ‘cause I ain’t stoppin’
This bag of dope here, I ain’t droppin’
I ran into a clothes store, but I ain’t shoppin’
Evadin’ the law, it’s on and poppin’
I changed my clothes and grabbed a wig
I put on a dress. “That lady’s big”
Shaggy scoot me. I played his mother
Kissed him on the cheek so I don’t blow my cover

Dead man
Walk, walk, walk, dead man
Dead man

Everybody walk way for the walking dead
The exception the rules and all they said
It’s back to the lab with your scientific mumble
I’m alive, even though I break off and crumble
Let me sleep forever and have a nice dream
‘Cause if I walk these streets, you’ll hear the night’s scream
Trust me, I don’t even have a best friend
To find your ass murked and dumped in the west end
I’m a dead man watchin’ you face to face, shit
My breath’s so bad, you can taste it
“Look out, here he comes” “Oh my God, it’s him”
I stomp when I walk, big six foot 10

I be the dead man walkin’. Hounds are barkin’
When will I fall so all y’all can chalk me out?
No doubt I’ma walk it out
That’s what I’m talkin’ bout, bitch. Everybody shout

This dead man walks between evil and good
The purgatory I’m livin’ in is misunderstood
Through the raven’s red eyes, Beezlebub is watchin’
B-L-A-Z-E. The dead man will
Walk it out, moon walk, and side step
Glide up and step into the keeper’s crypt
You kept knockin’ on my grave until I finally came out
Rose up above you and snuffed your flame out
The clock on my neck tells backwards time
And that Ouija board ain’t no ho, you’ll find
I know of demons that will come through and won’t go back
They’ll pull your hair out your head. It won’t grow back

I be the dead man walkin’. Hounds are barkin’
When will I fall so all y’all can chalk me out?
No doubt I’ma walk it out

Walk, walk, walk it out (Dead man)
Walk, walk, walk it out

Walked all the way around this planet twice
Lookin’ for a way on how to pay this price
All across the deserts and over all terrain
If I’m dead, why do I feel so much pain?

I be the dead man walkin’. Hounds are barkin’
When will I fall so all y’all can chalk me out?
No doubt I’ma walk it out
That’s what I’m talkin’ bout, bitch. Everybody shout

Don't come haunting me, taunting from my tree
'Cause I'mma clown that ass and show you how horrid you can be
Evil is afraid
So you really must think you're something scary
With all that talking in my skull shit, walking through my wall shit
I caught a ghost in a jar, it's still in my car
You should've seen my homies faces when I showed them at the bar
I'm crawling through my walls, the same place it does
But the light's pitch black, c'mon bring it bitch! Whut?!
I stare it in its soul, melt it in a bowl
Feed it to my seven cats and neighbors pitbulls
If it chokes me when I sleep thinking it's unique
It's gonna see some real terror from this horrifying freak
One was in my blender, I lost a couple fingers
In the end it wasn't really there, that's all I can remember
Yes I live alone, begging ""Bring it on""
If you f*cking think you scaring me, then we'll get it on
Evil is afraid
Don't .....
Evil is afraid
Hallowicked moonlight
Evil is afraid
Diggin up your coffin
Evil is afraid
With ....
Evil is afraid
Hallowicked Halloween
Evil is afraid
....bloody...
Evil is afraid
Hallowicked Halloween
Evil is afraid

I'm not afraid of your bloody body
I don't care that you headless buddy
F*ck a ghost Devil death everybody
Crawling out your grave, they're still muddy
Evil is afraid
I'm not afraid of your bloody body
I don't care that you headless buddy
F*ck a ghost Devil death everybody
Crawling out your grave, they're still muddy

Tonight,Bang! Pow! Boom!,2009,"Tonight, fuck what you talking about
Me and my crew getting up going out
And we`re about to shine
`Cause it`s our time
Then everybody`s coming back with something fine

Tonight we barely even got any money
But watch us beam, pulling fine honeys
Shit`s tight, get up, Let`s light shit up
Every place fresh tonight is getting hit up
Tonight I`m like: «Fuck this, we`re having a blast!»
Get in our way and I will put your neck in a cast
Fuck the bullshit, tonight ain`t stale
Tonight`s we set hell and score some tail
All there butterflies fluttering free
One of these beauties coming home with me
And then we gonna fuck until the sun come up
And go to sleep at noon, Bang! Pow! Boom!

Tonight, fuck what you talking about
Me and my crew getting up going out
And we`re about to shine
`Cause it`s our time
Then everybody`s coming back with something fine 

Fuck the club, right?
We`re living scrub life
Everybody`s hype, cause tonight`s the night
We can party in our car with the sounds I bump
Everybody sits up front from while we hump
Girl I don`t give a fuck where, I know we`re the shit
`Cause we all got each other right here to hang with

We can hear the house party on the southwest side
In the motel 6, suite 235
We can sip some booze, skip the ruse
Faygo in a pimp cup with fake-ass jewels
`Cause tonight`s the night, we can let `em swang
With a Boom! Pow! Biza-a-a-a-ang!

Tonight, fuck what you talking about
Me and my crew getting up going out
And we`re about to shine
`Cause it`s our time
Then everybody`s coming back with something fine

Picture us fresh as fuck and dumbfounded
With so many hoes, we`re surrounded
We envisioned it and now we found it
While you`re sit at home and straight pound it
Tonight no one`s gonna hold us down
They are getting stabbed in a forehead and kicked around
Everybody`s got game and tonight we let loose
Hoes get seduced, producing neden juice
Tonight the party is where ever we at
Panties coming down to the floor and that`s that
And bet, every one of us gets blown
Like Boom! Bang! Pow! Explode!

G-get the fuck up
Let`s get the fuck out 

Tonight, fuck what you talking about
Me and my crew getting up going out
And we`re about to shine
`Cause it`s our time
Then everybody`s coming back with something fine",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-tonight-lyrics
Scrubstitute Teachers,Mike E. Clark’s Extra Pop! Emporium,2012,"*gunshot* I let one fly in the class I'm teachin’
Shut the fuck up when the Duke is speakin'
I don't give detention on the weekend
You give me shit, I’m handin' out beatin's
I ain't afraid to get hands on with that ass
Split your little fat-ass wig in class
Don't push me, kid. Take your fuckin' seat
And less proceed. Who got the weed?
What do you normally do with Mr. Duncan?
(Science) Well he ain't here, so fuck him
You bitch, how old are them titties?
Damn, too young. Egg foo young
Now, you can shoot dice in the back, but
Any money exchange, I needs my cut
The rest of y'all, eyes to the front
I show you how to juggle while rolling a blunt

Listen up, class

Now, listen up, class

Listen up, class

It’s Willie. What to do?
I’m your mother fuckin' substitute
I got a headache and just wrecked my truck
So shut yo’ asses up
Let me school you on some real shit
J. Edgar Hoover used to suck dick
Elvis Presley put coke up his nose
And Martin Luther King had a couple o' hoes
The school board, I can't call it
Half of ‘em on drugs. The rest are alcoholics
I don't know why you study so hard
Ain’t no fuckin' jobs
I can  What's the problem, slick
Before I sleep in the park, I'ma rob a bitch
I got the guns and some bullets that are hooded, G
I wish a mother fucker would try to bully me

I've written my name on the chalkboard:
“The Southwest Strangla, Underground Lord”
If you run your mouth or don't do what you're told
Straight the fuck up, I'll knock you out cold
Leave you on the floor unconscious
To remind anybody else who want shit
Some of you hoes look good. I said it
See me after class for extra credit
 in my Thermos mug
Straight A's for slackers and skippin' scrubs
Today's assignment: How to cook meth
Cheerleader team comin' home with dick breath
History is all lies. Fuck sports
In your letterman coat, you're nothin' but dorks
Tell your mom it's time for parent-teacher
I'll bend her over the bleacher like “Uh!”

And at a dime a piece, that's 280

Got a way of corruptin' the misfits
So I'm spreadin' out to many different school districts
After the scrubstitute's done takin' attendance
Tell ‘em put they hands on they desk and empty they pockets

Screw ya, how to flip a no and cut a key. Don't get shot

Addicted to the noise as if you were a feind
But you could care less as long as if feels good

Walk On By,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 6",2019,"Imagine this

Let’s? say you’re walkin’, New York to LA
What? kinda bullshit would you face along the way?
You couldn’t do it, not without a mother fucking gun
‘Cause ain’t nobody out there tryin’ to help anyone
Shit,? you’d be lucky if you made it out of Brooklyn
Without? getting that sack on your back tooken
Fags pulling over all along the route
And? people all on the jack move for your tow loot (Checkin’ in)
Weirdos in vans, racists in pickups
Stick-ups, always gettin’ got for your get-ups
Police are ridin’ next to ya and flexin’ on ya
And? fuckin’ with ya all the way to California
Hope you can dodge cars, ‘cause people are crazy
And at least two will try to hit your ass on daily
People drivin’ by, throwin’ bottles, bustin’ your head
But you ain’t about to stop walkin’ across this land
You on a mission

I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be
This world is for you, but this world ain’t for me
I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be (And there you go)
This world is for you, but this world ain’t for me

Walkin’ through St. Louis, some ganstas stop ya
Rock your chin so hard, your knees buckle and drop ya
Rob for your headphones and walking stick
But you keep movin’ on, another loss, chalkin’ it
You seein’ redneck rebels wavin’ flags up high
And they teachin’ they kids to do the same when they die
Triple K, cops, evil eyes, knee-high boots
And little towns full of folks who won’t tell if they shoot
You just walkin’ through. Locals like, “Who the fuck?”
And then Hillbilly Buck pulls up in a truck
And straight up ragdoll bumps your ass all in the street
And says “We don’t like strangers,” and he boots your teeth
By the time you hit Utah, you’re fuckin’ hitch hikin’
Only homos and lunatics take to your liking
Families ride by with they doors on lock
The world’s closin’ in, but you ain’t gon’ stop
You keep walkin’

I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be (And there you go)
This world is for you, but this world ain’t for me (Right there)
I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be (And there you go)
This world is for you, but this world ain’t for me

You cross mountains on foot and almost freeze to death
And the one that nobody gives is a fuck
You get to Vegas. Pow! You get shot in the leg
You don’t know how it happened. You don’t care anyway
People all up in your face tryin’ to sell you drugs
You walk right through rumbles and wars, duckin’ slugs
People pickin’ fights with you, too many to count
They been ripped off your shirt and dug your pockets out
The savages trip you. You get back up
Now you’re huffin’ through the desert in some Walmart Chucks (Damn)
You finally reach the West Coast and get kidnapped
By a serial killer, the fuckin’ worst of the pack
But you fight back. Fuck that. Kick him in his face
You escaped his van, and now you’re back on pace
You wonder how this could be as you reach your goal
The place we call “home” is out of control

I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be
This world is for you, but this world ain’t for me
I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be
This world is for you, but this world ain’t for me (Right there)
I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be (And there you go)
This world is for you, but this world ain’t for me (Right there)
I walk on by, like I got somewhere to be (And there you go)

Zen of Love,The First Six,2014,"Ladies and gentlemen
Let me ask you this: What is love?
The many mysteries of love can all be answered by the one and only Zen of Love!
Only he can reveal all of your inquiries about love!
(Question)
All day she let me
Hit it whenever
She used to get mad
When we weren't together
Now I can't reach her
She's with her homies
When we're together
She won't even blow me
(Answer)
Because she loved you yesterday (yesterday)
But that bitch don't love you anymore
(Question)
I have a girlfriend
I met her online
I talk to her nightly
Ten o'clock, on time
She calls me her boyfriend
It says on her Facebook
Vanessa Hudgens
That's how her face look
(Answer)
She's not at all who you think she is  (who you think she is)
That bitch is a fat dude with a beard
(Question)
I have been married
For seven years now
We have grown distant
So it appears now
But out of nowhere
She's suddenly happy
She wants to take a
Trip to Miami
(Answer)
Because she feels like a dirty ho (like a dirty ho)
That bitch fucked your homies, Bill and Joe

Love is power, and power is love
Let the Zen of Love guide you on your path to love
Have you found it? Have you lost it? Only the Zen of Love knows for sure
And only the Zen of Love can tell you the truth about love
(Question)
I have a girlfriend
Goin' on two years
She don't want a baby
That is her true fear
She goes to college
Teaches at dance schools
So I wear a condom
But I don't think that's cool
(Answer)
Really, she's lookin' out for you (she's lookin' out for you)
That bitch has crabs and syphilis

Bitches (Bass-ment Cuts),Bass-ment Cuts,UnKnown,"*Baby crying*
Hey, hey, shh. Be quiet. Be quiet. Ay ay ay ay ay, shut up. Hey, shut up. Hey! Hey! Hey, shut the fuck up! Hey, shut the fuck up! Hey, bitch, come here and take care of this fuck- You want me to ki- Now, shut the- shut the fuck up!

Bitches, hoes, sluts, and skeezers
Skanky-ass whores, I can't forget your either
You can say I'm degrading toward women
But they always seem to let me travel up in 'em
Will I hit a woman? What you think?
I'll hit a fucking bitch like her name was Frank
In the 50's, when you're necked, you got lucky
Today you'll put a gun up to they head, and you'll say ""Fuck me""
A mother fucker like J don't need a gun
I just whip out the pipe, and I watch 'em run
Up to me, through me, sayin' go through me
Nine months she's at my door, and the bitch is trying to sue me
You know I ain't havin' that bullshit
So I sent the bitch home with a fat lip, yo
V-I-O-L-E-N-T
Dumb dumb, you can't even fuck with me
Outta women I respect, just a chosen few
And one of them bitches sure as fuck ain't you
Pimping, playing, hauling, balling, bitches by the dozens
Like Jeff Allen and his fucking cousin
Stacks and stacks, so many to pick from
Callin' 'em up so we can go and dick 'em
Driving to my house during the talk zone
And then after I hit it, I'll make your ass walk home
You're crying but I think it's kinda funny
That I wouldn't give your ass no bus money
At night I have dreams that I'm waxing
Superstar, freaky ass, big butt Janet Jackson
I don't even need to tell you what I'd do to her
I'd come at her so fast, my dick would go clean through her
I'd fuck her sister, her aunt, and her mother
The only Jackson that I wouldn't fuck is her brother
But I can't have Janet, so I'll take what I can get
A strung out, ragged-on crackhead bitch
And they bodies so shitty
Skinny as fuck, and she only got one titty
I'm headed to the suburbs to find some
So I brung along my boys to help me grind 'em
Bitches, bitches, bitches, and more
Rapping with a bitch at the grocery store
The way she talked gave me an erection
So you know I had to fuck her in the meat section
I gave that bitch all that I got
She had her eyes closed so I fucked her with a lamb chop
Nobody can mack like J does
I'd fuck a girl that's sober, leave her with a buzz
I'm gonna get me a bitch from Thailand
'Cause all bitches over there do is pray to their man
Yo, 'cause bitches here are too fucking sad
Come home and find your freak in the sack with your dad
Saying they were lonely and needed to be held
Fuck off, bitch, that's why your eye got swelled
Yeah you beat her ass something crazy
You woulda killed her ass, but you was kinda lazy
Every time I see a bitch, she's always crying
That's the main fucking reason that the fists are always flyin'
Cause you ain't a god damn baby no more
So why don't you grow the fuck up, you sorry-ass fucking whore?
If you drive a piece of shit and you're not rich
Than you gots no women, explain that, bitch
That's why I always dig the crackheads
Cause them bitches think your rich as long as you ain't dead
Yo, I gots no problem anyway
I can have any bitch, 'cause I'm Violent J
So before you make that hitch
Be sure it ain't with that average bitch

Hey man, look at that skank over there
Have you ever seen an uglier bitch in your life, man?
It looks like somebody socked her in her fucking face with a bag of fucking rocks
Man, look at that Hey, bitch you look like you got hit by a train, ho
Hey, fuck you, come here and suck my nuts, bitch
That bitch's crawling off the streets man, ho
Hey. Hey bitch get the fuck off my car, fucking skank, look at that
Hey, bitch, you ever been smacked before, ho?
Come here, let me smack your ho fucking ass",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-bitches-bass-ment-cuts-lyrics
Immortal,The Marvelous Missing Link (The Outtakes),2015,"Ay, homie
It’s a good day to be alive
You know what they say
Every day above ground is a blessed one

I got hit by a car when I was fourteen
Cracked my vertebrae and broke my spleen
But I’m happy to say I’m still alive
I’m still alive, and I did survive
Well, I fell out a window, twelve floors
And all I received was a few head sores
And I’m happy to say that I’m still here livin’
Still here livin’, like Jeremy Piven
Well, I got stabbed in the back when I was 28
They rushed me to a hospital and made me wait
But I’m proud to say that I did survive
I did survive, and I’m still alive
Well, I drowned in a boat. We went under
The boat sunk in the rain and thunder
And even though I was dead for an hour
I came back, double the power

I’m still alive (I’m still alive!)
I’ll never die (i-i-i-immortal)
I’m still alive (i-i-i-immortal)
I’ll never die (i-i-i-immortal)

Won’t die! (You won’t kill me, never)
Won’t die! (I’m gonna live on forever)
Won’t die!

I once got malania, a fatal disease
I was sick for two years, at least
But then I beat it, and now I’m great
‘Cause being alive, that’s my fate
I once accidentally got soaked in gas
And tried to light a cigarette, big flash
Yeah, I was burned alive, and that’s the key word
Alive, ‘cause I did survive
I was sitting in a pizza joint when a semi crashed through the glass
And crushed my ass
And thank God they fixed me right back up
‘Cause I’m alive; I ain’t jacked up
Well I once went hunting with my uncle, Paul
Got shot with an arrow right through my skull
They pulled it out, and the hole healed nicely
And I’m alive, so take my advice, see?

I’m still alive (I’m still alive!)
I’ll never die (i-i-i-immortal)
I’m still alive (i-i-i-immortal)
I’ll never die (i-i-i-immortal)

Won’t die! (You won’t kill me, never)
Won’t die! (I’m gonna live on forever)
Won’t die! (You won’t kill me, never)
Die! (I’m gonna live on, forever)
Won’t die!

I was killed in a’ avalanche, they assumed
But I wasn’t fucking ready to be doomed
Yeah, I was frozen for two months
But I survived, ‘cause you only live once
I once got hit by a train and derailed it
Tried to cross the tracks, but failed it
The shit fucked me up, something bad
But I’m alive right now, and I’m glad
I once tried to skydive, but my ‘chute didn’t open
Like I was hopin’
They said I bounced three times on the concrete
But I’m still alive, ‘cause I’m sweet
I got struck by lightning six times
I think it helps me to spit sick rhymes
‘Cause I’m alive, I’m alive, bitch
I’m alive, I’m not dead in a ditch

I’m still alive (I’m still alive!)
I’ll never die (i-i-i-immortal)
I’m still alive (i-i-i-immortal)
I’ll never die (i-i-i-immortal)

Won’t die! (You won’t kill me, never)
Won’t die! (I’m gonna live on forever)
Won’t die!
I’ll never die (You won’t kill me, never)
Won’t die! (I’m gonna live on forever)
Won’t!
I won’t die! (You won’t kill me, never)
Won’t! (I’m gonna live on, forever)
I’ll never die (You won’t kill me, never)
(I’m gonna live on, forever)
(I’m gonna live on, forever)

Bloody,Incredible Collectible Collection (Worthy of an Erection!),2017,"Ah, ah
Schizophrenia, ah (Woo!)
Paranoia, ah

Bloody
In my darkest room (So dark)
Wet and sticky
Clumps of icky
Blood (Blood, blood)
Blood (Blood, blood, blood)
Streams are dripping
Got me tripping
And I hope that she's still breathing
And comes back to life
’Cause this hunter's knife I'm wielding
Is stuck in her side
And if she dies

I’ll be bloody
And be all alone (All alone)
Her face I smothered
Walls are covered
In blood (Blood)
Blood (Blood, blood, so much blood)
Splattered ceiling
Drips I'm feeling
As they come falling upon us
On my forehead
Hoping more will join us
Like her mom and dad
I would be so glad

I'm in an old beat up white van, no windows
Beware, suburbia, me here to murder ya
My occupation: One, sock your face in
Two, strangulation. Three, decapitation
Full days spent torture in my basement
Decoration, order placement
I once kidnapped a fat hooker, later  a skinny whore
Buzz her up, give me more, doesn't help anymore

I hope the bloodshed on me
Don't wash off and stays
And I hope to have this feeling
Kill the pain
Cut her veins
'Til it rains
Mash her brains
'Til the blood
Sprays all over my face
Blood sprays all over my face
Blood sprays all over my face
Blood sprays all over my face
Blood sprays all over my face
Blood sprays all over my face
Blood sprays all over my face
Blood sprays all over my face

Homies (Street version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Violent J)
Let me ask you this about this life we live
And let me try to swerve some of this attention you give
To them distant ass relatives over ham dinner
If they really missed you so much
Why don't they just call a ? (Muthafucka)
If you wasn't blood, would you still have love?
Or infact does the blood make you think you have to love?
Look I probably love my family more then anybody here
But my homies are family too
Third cousins get outta here
Who was you with when you got tattooed?
Who was you tripping with when you did them mushrooms?
Who the fuck threw up all over your car?
And then felt worse then you about the shit in the morning? (Friends ya'll)

Who loaned ya money, homie?
Who owes ya cash?
Who taught you how to use the bong for the grass?

Your homies standing on his back while you kicking his head around

And now my homies are holding me back so I don't look soft

Well that's my home boys, excuse me, my family
And when we conquer the world

Puff it and pass it and I give it to my homies ya'll
Hit it and quit it and then I give it to my homies ya'll

Welcome to the House of wickety Wax
Fools on display like plaques
With nothing to do but relax
I get bored, torture them all with thumb tacks
Folks walk by, give ‘em the eye
They don't say “hi.” Inside, they cry
There’s a wick comin’ out the top of they dome
One of these days, they gettin’ the bone
They got only their evil ways to blame
With a dumb look on their faces of shame
They once had game, but now they’re lame
Can’t move their eyeballs, diffuse the same
Shaft up their ass underneath their clothes
Punch ‘em in the face, flatten the nose
I piss on these hoes when the doors are closed
It’s their own damn fault they got hosed

Some are female; I molest the freaks
They don’t have a neden hole unless I carved it
When I’m hittin’ it, I’m like, ""I beg your pardon""
I don’t walk by without slappin’ a face
Flickin’ an eyeball, total disgrace
Because they can feel everything I do
 In our House of Wax, we got room for you!

Slip and slide with my Twinkie

Come see the wonder, the show of your life
See me breathe fire and swallow a knife, right

It’s probably two or three in the mornin’, rain pourin’
I’m lookin’ through the windows tryin’ to make a scorin’
I move to the next house, wipe off the glass
I can barely make it out, but I see a chick’s ass
Move my way around the back door and then try the side
Finally find a window that can easily be pried
A cat stares at me as a slide into a laundry room
I hope the thunder doesn’t wake ‘em. It’ll all be over soon
I creep through the house. It appears she lives alone
I can’t believe how lucky I am. Let’s get it on
Slowly opened up her door and stare at her for an hour
Weilding a knife, soaking in the power
And now I’m standing right above her. Her senses must’ve woke her
Suddenly she screamed. I tried to choke her
She dug her thumbs in my eye sockets. It hurt badly
Then she took my own knife and stabbed me

Fuck. I’m tired of walkin’
And that’s the reason I’m out here stalkin’
Waitin’ for the right ride. Opportunity beckons
In a flash, a matter of seconds
I can have me a new whip - hopefully somethin’ sweet
In exchange for a body in the street
‘Cause fuck leavin’ a witness. I got homies in the pen
That’ll never do that again
So I’m waitin’ behind this tree for the right chance
Here come an Escalade. Time to dance
He’s chillin’ at the light. I jump out with a pistol
In front of the truck, I’m like, come on. Let’s go
Get out of the car. Suddenly I hear the doors click
He’s got a scared look on his face, but then he floors it
And rolls right over me. I’m like mangled meat

Hooker,The Marvelous Missing Link (The Outtakes),2015,"I'm pathetic, I’ll admit it
Ain't no hoes that'll let me hit it
I tried so hard, spent so much cash
Makes no difference, I get no ass
I go to the titty bars and make it rain
Get a lap dance, but it ain’t the same
I even tried all the dating websites
It only led to more lonely nights
But just as I had a date who no-showed
I seen this hottie, so my car slowed
It was a hooker, and I had fifty bucks
So my dick she sucked
And

I fucked a hooker, and I liked it
Cost me a fifty, but she could ride it
I fucked a hooker, and I liked it
Cost me a fifty, but she could ride it

Call me John, and I'll say, “That's right”
I had a hooker on my dick last night
And yes, she was a meth head
And yes, she stunk up the bed spread
And yes, she had syphilis
But I wore a rubber when I split the guts
I don't give a fuck. I got no time
To date and buy hoes expensive wine
I ain't tryna buy you a piece of steak
With this hard-earned money I make
But I pay for the neden. Thank you, Miss
Fuck for an hour but never kiss
You're probably thinking that I'm dirty
That's okay, ‘cause I think you’re nerdy
The same damn ho that you fucking love so much
Charged me fifty bucks
And

I fucked a hooker, and I liked it
Cost me a fifty, but she could ride it
I fucked a hooker, and I liked it
Cost me a fifty, but she could ride it

What can you buy with a fifty spot?
You can get some neden, if she’s hot
It ain't you fault she needs the cash
It’s a fair trade; you need some ass

Hey baby, you want me to suck your cock for fifty bucks?
You want mama to come sit on your lap, honey?
Come on, baby. I know you got fifty bucks. I'll  your butt for ya
You want me to get that brown eye? Come on. It's only fifty

I fucked a hooker, and I liked it
Cost me a fifty, but she could ride it
I fucked a hooker, and I liked it
Cost me a fifty, but she could ride it

(Just fifty bucks!)
You want me to  your mustache for you, honey?
(Just a fifty spot!) (Hell yeah!)
Come on, baby, you want  felcher?
(Oh yeah!)
Fifty bucks, baby

I know you want some pussy, baby

Into Thy Light,UnKnown,UnKnown,"A presence can be felt(4x)
By those who have fallowed the epic saga told by the Insane Clown Posse
It is a presence synonomus with the crumbling of time itself
Thus emerges a being so powerfull that it can exist between both the land of the living
And that of the dead
He goes by many names but is known to the living only as The Wraith
He walks upon worlds forgotten and desends from heavens faded to grey
To witness the death of all mortal things. So that he may guide the departed upon the path
That they have chosen (Shangri-La)
Here is the story of the path to Shangri-La
The sixth jokers card (The Wraith)
Only now will we truely understand the meaning of the saga, for this saga all along each jokers card
Has actually none other then......the echo of our lives
Hurry up show's startin
I can't believe they're still having it
I beter get my butt in there right now
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the sensational and amazing...
Carnival of Carnage

But boys and girls and everyone we've got a carnival for that ass
Tens of thousands of freaks sideshows and fools
A carnival who together lives by their own rules

Something dark and wicked this way comes (this way comes)
We told of oddities crawling from the dark
And a carnival which we can all belong
I dwell upon the streets and I can tell you this
I see some circus Juggalo shit going on
People drawn together by rare and scrubby music
And we even gather once a year to put it down
With tilt-a-whirls and merry-goes and carnivals of Faygo
We're just trying to tell you all about the light right
Now all the Jokers Cards have fallen with spectacular array
So when the Wraith is calling walk into the light, right
I hold a bloody axe, dress in hatchet red
We speak languages people don't understand (don't understand)
I send Faygos via punted clear across a stadium
In fashion only fuckin Juggalos could ever demand
I got ninjas in my backyard wearing Anybody Killa paint
I'm thinkin ""What the fuck is going on?"" (thinkin ""what the fuck is going on)

Now all the Jokers Cards have fallen with spectacular array

The crows have overlooked (they looked)
We gave you all they gave (they gave)
The carousel will spin on through the night (through the night)
In Oz I'd be the Wizard cause I'm overwhelmed
But we just hoped the Jokers Cards would point you out to the light
So you'll be tight, right

Super Duper,Phantom: X-Tra Spooky Edition,2015,"I woke up one morning, simply rolled out of bed
I wasn’t groggy for a change, not even in my head
I went to take a piss, and my aim was perfect
Didn’t hit the seat or hit the bowl when I squirted
I felt refreshed and rejuvenated as I got dressed
I swear to God, I felt like wearin’ an “S” on my chest
I went to read the morning paper and didn’t need my glasses
Scanned the whole page and read it all in two passes
Felt like a million bucks, jumped in my truck
Snapped off the gear shifter when it tried to get stuck
What the fuck? People honkin’; morning traffic’s a bitch
By myself, I pushed a truck to the side. It was a cinch
I must admit, I surprised myself. That was a feat of strength
Started joggin’ to work, and that shit was quite some length
About 15 miles, I made it there in 10 minutes
Starin’ at my watch wonderin’ how the fuck I did it

Super duper (Na na na na)
How did I become a shootin’ star?
Super duper (Na na na na)
Float through the sky, lift up a car
Super duper (Na na na na)
This whole day has been way bizarre
Super duper (Na na na na)
We like you the way that you are!

My factory job sucks. It causes bodily harm
Soon as I got there, the pressing clamp caught somebody’s arm
Bust on the scene. With my bare hands, I pulled it apart
5,000 pounds of pressure, molten metal and sparks
I saved his life without so much as a burn or a scratch
Everyone crowded around me like 
How did you do it? I told them all I’d be right back
Went outside for a second to keep myself in tact
Stared into the sky. That’s when somethin’ told me I could do it
Spread my arms, and jumped up in above like I knew it
I could fly. At first, I was shaky and scared
That shit was weird, but soon enough got my head cleared
Soared like an eagle. I got it down, became an expert
It never entered my mind - fuckin’ returning to work
I flew between all the trees and all the buildings uptown
Whizzin’ right through the clouds, dippin’ back low to the ground

Super duper (Na na na na)
How did I become a shootin’ star?
Super duper (Na na na na)
Float through the sky, lift up a car
Super duper (Na na na na)
This whole day has been way bizarre
Super duper (Na na na na)
We like you the way that you are!

I flew all night throughout the city’s lights
High atop the buildings, the view is so tight
I tried to look for crime, but really didn’t see shit
Just some hookers and meth heads, but that’s really it
With my incredible strength, I lift abandoned cars
Flew ‘em through the sky and dumped ‘em in the junkyard
After the night, I returned home and jumped in my bed
With so many ideas  my head
But when I woke up, that’s when I felt groggy as hell
Pissed all over the toilet seat, felt shitty and stale
Walked in the kitchen, feelin’ as slow as molasses
Picked up the paper, couldn’t read without glasses
Walked into the yard and tried to fly, but no
My powers only lasted a day? This isn’t so
All my super plans tucked away on the shelf
Guess I’ll have to be straight, livin’ like everyone else

Super duper (Na na na na)
How did I become a shootin’ star?
Super duper (Na na na na)
Float through the sky, lift up a car
Super duper (Na na na na)

And people get killed for they assumptions
I wanna scatter all my bodily functions
All over the wilderness, and I'm a luncheon
Let loose! I'm a bomb ticking down to the end
And when you catch my shrapnel, you know it ain't pretend
And trust, when I combust, I intend to offend
You know it's pressure when you see the fucking 
Let loose! The fucking time is now for action
Bury your claws in the mud for traction
We the bullets in the clip, who with our fashion
Run for your life, or be the world's reaction
Let loose! 'Cause this is my time to shine
My light burns retinas. Ninjas go blind
Explosive chemicals inhabit my mind
And I'll explode explode at any given time I can find

Killa paint, Im thinkin' ""What the f**k is going on?"" Then i see the platinum
On the wall, and i realize the Carnivals been right here all along, so lets
Bring it on
With tilt-a-whirls and merry goes', and carnivals of Faygo, were just trying to
Tell you about the light, right. Now all the Jokers Cards have fallen with
Spectacular array, so when the Wraith is calling, walk into the light, right
The crows have overlooked, we gave you all they gave, the carousel will spin on
Through the night. In Oz Id be the Wizard, 'cause Im overwhelmed, but we hoped
The Jokers Cards would point you out to the light /So you will be tight/ Right

The Zipper,The First Six,2014,"What's that, though?
The Zipper
The Zipper? It looks raggedy and rickety as fuck
Why don't you go on it, man? You can tell us what it's like

Well this lame local fair comes to town every year
With the same lame rides, as if anybody cares
But you still go, 'cause you know,  ain't shit else to do
So you smoke a couple joints and head up with your crew
You walk around, and the carnies try to call you out
""Come on, throw a dart at the balloons, what you got?""
You just walk by knowing (uh huh) the prizes ain't shit
Even the  bears got the cheap-ass stitch (Bitch)
But what's this? In the corner, the Zipper, a new ride
But it's not new; it looks old as fuck, but still you slide
Over to it, 'cause anything different's worth checking out
You're the only one in line. You strap in, and any second now. It's...

The Zipper! (Woo)
It's wonderful! (It's incredible)
Fantastical! (Woo)
Astounding! (Wow!)
Amazing! It's...
The Zipper! (Woo)
It's wonderful! (It's incredible)
Fantastical! (Woo)
Astounding! (Wow!)
Amazing!

And it's over, complete ecstasy for a minute (Ah)
You can't fucking believe it. Right away, you admit it
You start rantin' and raving about how fuckin' live it was
It blew your fucking mind, and you still feelin' the buzz
You run over to grab another ticket from the booth
Because you found euphoria, and you know it's the truth (Yup)
Now a couple of your friends grab a ticket as well (My dogs)
But they don't understand; the ride looks weak as hell
But you guys get in line, and you're runnin' with the quickness
You're extra geeked now because your homies 'bout to witness
This magical wonder ride of rusty old parts
But they can fucking feel it too, as soon as it starts. It's...

The Zipper! (Woo)
It's wonderful! (It's incredible)
Fantastical! (Woo)
Astounding! (Wow!)
Amazing! It's...
The Zipper!
This shit is wonderful!
This shit's incredible!
This shit is breathtaking!
Amazing!

And like that, it stops. You're all three goin' crazy
It took you through the heavenly gates; this shit's amazing
Now you're buyin' up as many tickets as you can
Back in line, it's only your crew, and you don't understand
How come everyone ain't ridin' it? How come the fair is hidin' it
Way back in this corner spot, when that shit is  hot?
This time, your whole crew's gettin' on it for a spin
You're fucking doing backflips ready for it to begin
You give the tickets to the carny, and you all pile on
Everybody's mad excited. You all got your smile on
Then the carny says to you, ""Three time's a doozie
Read the sign: 'Ride three times, and your life you lose,' Eh?""

The Zipper! (Woo)
It's wonderful! (It's incredible)
Fantastical! (Woo)
Astounding! (Wow!)

Party in the Woods,"Forgotten Freshness, Vol. 5",2013,"Uh, somethin' bit me

I’m deep in the woods at night, but I'm not scared
Fact is, I'm part of what’s there
Impared, drunk, I'm feelin' alright
Say “Fuck it” and never go home, we all just might
In the forest, we sleep with the insects
All up in sects, trading respects
Moses couldn't part a sea of us, baby
With ABK on the stage. Fool, you crazy
We firin' the shot. It's our time
Even piggies don't cross our line
Throwin' 40’s at the helicopters flyin’ above
They lookin' for trouble but findin’ nothin' but love
Danger, danger, Shaggy's on a golf cart, drunk
Up in the woods, a street punk
With 10,000 others, just like me too
Deep in the woods, cries of “Whoop, whoop!”

Crows dancin' in the clouds above
Trees clappin’ they branches and showin' us love
These days belong to us!
They belong to us
These days belong to us!
They belong to us
“Hey, who the fuck ate my hot dog?”

Goals get achieved when we in the woods
Kids are conceived when we in the woods
Shit you can't believe when we in the woods
Wicked Clowns take stage, and they steal your goods?
Fuckin' bullshit! Devil's henchmen sneakin' in
We got ninjas in the trees, watchin' for thievin'
They get dealt with, and the party continues
We rock in the woods, nothing like in the venues
And look a this hottie's butt-naked-ass body
Fuckin' under the blankets, our beer breath stankin'
Toss me a cheeseburger. I'll steal your blunt and peel off
Ran into a tree stump and broke the wheel off
And you real soft, passin' out, you didn't see Twiztid
They did the fuckin' new shit, and your missed it
In the woods, you can hear the bump all night
We family together, and We'll Be Alright

Crows dancin' in the clouds above
Trees clappin' they branches and showin' us love
These days belong to us!
They belong to us
These days belong to us!
They belong to us
“Whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop!”

In the woods at night, find me up in the club
Chaos throughout the forest, nothin' but love
(“Hey, where the fuck are you from?”) The loon district
The place where that hatin' bullshit is restricted
Body slams in the woods, slam dancin' in the forest
We become muddalos if the rain pours
So the fuck what? I'm still slappin' this mud-duck butt
It's all good. I don't give a fuck what!

Crows dancin' in the clouds above
Trees clappin' they branches and showin' us love
These days belong to us!
They belong to us
These days belong to us!
They belong to us
Crows dancin' in the clouds above
Trees clappin' they branches and showin' us love
These days belong to us!
They belong to us
These days belong to us!
They belong to us

Oh, the stagecoach was a headin' through the mountains
This day they called the Wells Faygo express
The cargo, so I hear, Faygo old-fashioned root beer
The tasty drink with creamy head goodness
“Look out! It's a holdup! It's Black Bart!”
“Oh! Save me! For my life I fear!”
“Oh, hush up, gal. It's that famous drink I want
That case of Faygo old-fashioned root beer”
“Stand where you are
Black Bart, you are through”
*gunshots*
So, the stagecoach went on headin' through the mountains
And old Black Bart went off to jail, I hear
The Faygo Kid. Which way did he go? Which way did he go?
He went for Faygo!

The big one-liter bottle is now on sale at participating grocers”",https://genius.com/Insane-clown-posse-party-in-the-woods-lyrics

I’m so damn sick of this bullshit, I wanna vomit
Ran into a dark alley, trippin’ and screamin’
It was there I transformed into a demon
Started stompin’ smashin’ homes and car crushin’
Punching through building balls and bum rushing
All the innocent lives I could possibly kill
Top story: Man loses all his will

I fucking join pilates, to peep out hotties
Quit after two classes; there was no fine asses
Got me a new reality show, I must brag
It’s called Strangulations, with Shaggy Shaggs
On the first episode, it’s gonna be dope

It’s time to get your shit right so we can all meet in Shangri-La
Know it seems like a long ride, but it ain’t really far
You got your homies, juggalos, fam, we standin’ tall
The climb might seem forever, but I know that it’s a longer fall
Some think this is the end, but we have just begun
We be the type to rise and fight, not turn and fuckin’ run

I say we bring it back. Let’s show ‘em how we do
You can blame everyone else, but love, it comes from you

Well it is all right, the incredible ghetto hero
I came up from below zero, let’s get one thing clear, though (What?)
The struggle was real, my bubble was ill, a hustler skill
Some people do it for the rush and the thrill
But I did it to feed my kids and pay a couple of bills
Dreamin’ for times to be different, prayin’ that my life would change
Just take a look at me now, shinin’ like dimaonds in rain
17 is upon us, I know they don’t really want us
To succeed, ‘cause they jealous, but fuck ‘em, we overzealous
One thing I do not embellish, my team is hittin’ that relish
We came straight up from the cellars, now we higher than eagle wings (Whoop)
Livin’ out all our our dreams while makin’ the people scream (Whoop)

Let’s take it back ten years when I was broke
No one took me for a joke, ‘cause I had my homies close
See, what that means is I could do anything
Like follow all my dreams and accomplish all my hopes now
You couldn’t touch me with a pole, ‘cause I’m on a cloud
Floatin’ looking down at an ocean of
People that are lookin’ just like me, who show this love like me
And diamond cuttin’ 17
One seven ain’t just a year we reppin’
It’s a number up in heaven, and it’s rainin’ on us heavy
So, when we say that we seventeenin’
It means that we all gleamin’, and the shine don’t stop beamin’, baby
Oh, I love feelin’ what I’m feelin’
If it’s stormin’ diamonds on me, then I’m droppin down the ceilin’
So, hop on in and take a ride
I hit the three wheel motion, and we’ll be off into the light, come on

We livin’ in the 17, watch the diamonds fall
And spread a gleaming light over us all
I’m feeling happy as can be because I finally can see
My back is no longer against the wall
I’m in a place where my face can see no hate
I’m straight, just had to wipe the bullshit off my plate
Now I’m lettin’ good vibes blow, releasin’ my inner glow
Unstoppable, here we go, we makin’ ‘em all say “Whoa”
Psychopathic got the magic that you lookin’ for (Uh huh)
We run beneath the streets, inside the earth, where diamonds glow
Can’t no one stop us, ‘cause they’re too busy bein’ amused
We represent a hurricane of diamonds in our crew
So many obstacles, enough to make your body numb
Born and brought up in the slum, but raised to rep just where I’m from
So when we shine, it’s like a shine there’s only good to come
Like brighter days for us to gaze into the Hatcher sun

I went from a pile of coal to a pile of gold, listen
Lyte’s making it possible, possible, do you see that?
Do your opticals conquering obstacles, better believe that
Time to leave back that bullshit and proceed farther
Here if you need all my team, slaughter
Look at it, I’m livin’ my dream, larger than life
And I’m soarin’, roarin’ like a lion
Endorphins are pourin’ in my brain. You’re snorin’, I’m climbin’
It’s rainin’ diamonds, I’m shinin’ and blindin’, you haters don’t mind
Do you fake us? ‘Cause grind is my nature
Perfect time, and I’m signin’ those papers
Nothing’s greater than this, never changin’ my mood
And I’m doing exactly what I’m claimin’ to do, aimin’ at you
And I’m bringing it through your eardrums, 17’s the year, son
I’m here fun, Psychopathic, shit, we ain’t near done
We don’t fear none, got a clear run, it’s time to pursue it
If I can do it, you can do it, now move it and go improve it

Shimmering clouds (Woo!) glistening sky (Awesome!)
The Duke is happy, but you’re dissin’ me (Huh?) Why? (You’re jealous)
Are you jealous of me and my fellas? (Yup!)
Bet you wanna ride, but your pride won’t let you tell us, huh
Shing shing, diamonds rainin’ on the hatchet man
Droppin’ entertaining facts, shit’s the plan
And jewels fallin’, sun’s causin’ all these immaculate reflections
Beams gleamin’, glarin’ all directions
No rejection, just affection and compassion
Sexin’, ah, ‘til my erection comes splashin’, ah
It’s what it’s like it’s like, baskin’ in the heaven’s beam
A 17 never seen
My  clean, it’s gotta be, I’m stressless
This angel is dressless, my wang hole’s her breakfast
Everything is sparklin’, glitterin’, shingin’ as we rhymin’
In the hurricane of diamonds

Where everything pops
Bass heads and drug rocks
Farmers inside bakin all the cream cheese
But fuck that shit, a ryda got needs
2 jacks and a 9 in the back
Where those hoes at, I'll wipe them off the map
Kicked in the door, bitch get on the floor
Took them in the back room open the drawer
Get on your fuckin' knees, turn around
You gettin' stuck fuck, don't make a fuckin' sound
Vo-tec centers got emptied in his face
Drawer got took, the house got kicked
My pockets got lined, everything's lovely
I love the way a ryda gets down for his money
What rydas do for money
A ryda gets dirty and know they get greedy
Bitch run your pockets, I'll rob the whole city
What rydas do for money
A ryda pulls gats then jacks yo stacks
Bitch run your pockets, or get popped in the back
There's many different ways around to earn yo green
You a ryda, you dunno, Yo it's a money thing
Stackin' yo chips, makin paper
Cause I'll make ya hand over that bank, yeah!
Jackin' that shit arouse in the rap game
It won't make a damn difference, it's all the same
This way or that way, it's goin in my pocket
Can't nobody stop it, to me it's all profit
Put your hand down what's yours is mine
Make one wrong move get stabbed in the spine
My pockets been lined and everythings lovely
I told you I can die for my muthafuckin money bitch
What rydas do for money
A ryda gets dirty and know they get greedy
Bitch run your pockets, I'll rob the whole city
What rydas do for money
A ryda pulls gats then jacks yo stacks
Bitch run your pockets, or get popped in the back

Sally McNally,Willaby Rags Magical Bag of Poop,2018,"“This shit’s fire”
“Last? year, detective Dick Lubanus of Tallahassee Florida’s Cold Case Unit dove into the 1988 murder of Sally McGuinness, who went missing after a night on the town. Three weeks later, her body was discovered, beheaded, in a wooden ravine, just two miles from home. Would DNA technology unavailable at the time of the murder finally reveal who was responsible for this heinous crime?”

The? sick dude waits, looming. She enters the room to doom
He makes her get nude. The dick rapes her
And then takes and consumes a full broomstick up her butt
No? bullshit, he duct tapes it shut
His? dick skeets, she’s deceased, at least at peace
He retrieves meat freezer keys
And? opens it to a cold breeze, throws her in
Frozen, no degrees, so he’ll have more when he please

“Don’t miss Darkness Falls, Thursday night, the ID track”

It was a muggy midnight lightning storm (Lightning storm)
Bored? with my wife, my penis wouldn’t perform (The norm)
Stretched out on my couch, it happened to me (Happened to me)
Her story appeared on the channel ID, Murder TV
How quick she ripped and tore out my whole heart was a trip
Her picture crushed my soul down then sucked it right out through my dick (Loogie spit)
Her hair bouffant, eyeliner all heavy and smudged (And smudged)
Told me she was a head banging hair metal true 80’s slut

Re-enactment dramatics
Bullshit tactics

Only two real pics of you?
One from ‘86, the other Christmas ‘82
You still split this wig, boo, couldn’t hack it
Feathered hairdo, and leather jacket
Hot rock babe, too blurry old pics
Shown quick, left me with a furry swol dick
You’re not just some dumb dead bitch from the past to me
Speaking that shit is blasphemy

Wait, keep that dead girl. She’s beautiful

Since I seen you on that murder show, dreams keep comin’ back (Keep comin’ back)
I dream you’re not from back then, you’re from right now, in fact (Not wack)
We’re roasting smores, then comes the big reality check
We leaned to kiss, then your head falls right into flames, rolls off your neck
Why did that fucker have to kill you so cold? (Kill you so cold)
Why are you from the 80’s if you never got whacked? (You still be )
That re-enactment of your death was a shame
You can’t replicate sweet dead Sally McNally, pal, you learn

Who was she? Tell me anything! She looked like a stoner, drinkin', probably headbanged!

Her crime doc, for me, meant a strange life change
Content, for my wife, estrangement
Feeling a little deranged and bent
I set myself down to Sally’s killer’s arraignment
Now my ass down to Tallahassee
Found the gala quite classy. I’m in a suit and tie
I had to shoot the guy in the back. Quick, I dashed
He’s dead now, with the devil’s dick in his ass

Broad daylight, I’m graveyard shoveling
You don’t give a fuck with the love I’m in, no

I’m Dig Dug, boo. Let’s get you a bub
I’ma sleep with your boney bones and give ‘em love
I hope that miss McNally is coming mummified
You feel me, Sally boo? Give me something I can ride
If we super lucky, it’ll be a hole there
A hole anywhere. Fuck, I don’t care. I’m trying to go there
Bitch, at least give me something to hump in
Just a clumpin’, a fuckin’ lump or something

Damn. All bones. Just like my life. All bones

I wish there was more left of you than just bones (Than just bones)
As you and you killer in that poor room like I did won’t bring you home
If you’d have had a daughter, that’d be the bomb
I’d be a wang-a-tang-a-bangin’ that bad bitch out backward, picturing her mom

I’m back home. I guess I’ll never get with ya
Sweet dead metal head, I’ll never forget ya

Sally McNally, not just another dead name
A dead face, and reference to a case, then erased
No, baby, rewind, baby, be mine
I like your hairdo. Let me get near you
So, you met with disaster. No one has to know
Me and you, let’s right a brand new forevermo’
Let me hear your laughter, a little gigglin’
Baby, live again. Let’s get them titties jigglin’
You ain’t a dead bitch. You’re just dead wrong
Or maybe dead dumb if you ain’t headstrong
You only die when you’ve given up. Try gettin’ up
Who gives a fuck? Fly around and live it up
How real are you? Feelin’ part two?
Three, four, five, six, bitch? Start to
Let’s mix, switch autofix, quick
Fix all those chicks, give ‘em pole dicks
Dead in ‘88, I said, “lady, wait”
You made it through to ‘92, I’m remindin’ you
Hard on the dillas, billion dollar billas
Resurrectin’ like Shangri-La pillas
So dead that dead talk, dead is ‘85
Born again, arive, how about a tenant drive?
665 round trip, you bare to dip
And don’t forget, shit’s over in a blip

“That’s all you get, bitches! My bag is empty, just like your skulls! What the fuck are you still here for? Get the fuck out of my beautiful, flawless, rotting, dead face! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Goodbye, shitty-bitch shit heads! Hope you enjoyed playing with the poop! You still here? How about I kiss your lips good with the blade of my axe? Oh shit!

I got me a plan to get the stinger out
Just a little ‘squito, so I flick it off my ear

Never ever thought a little bug could make me die

Sippin’ on my head my head, twistin’ through my brain
Drivin’ me crazy, nuts, insane

What you call a bug, but I call it death
‘Cause it makes me choke and cave my chest

I can't move. I think I broke my fuckin’ neck
It's no surprise I'm layin’ there paralyzed
Lookin’ up into the sky helped me realize
About us. The bugs form a Devil's face
It must be a mirror image of the human race
And God damn, here it comes, the deadly swarm
I can tell by the howl of the wing form
The air is warm. The woods are so still
When the bugs creep out the sky for a kill
Broken neck, I'm prayin’, ‘cause I'm a goner
I can see the ‘squitos creepin' around the corner
I lay still and hope it doesn't notice me
But it can sense all my blood flowin’ heavily
Looking up just to see its deadly jaws
I think I, I think I, I think I shit my drawers
But this time, the swarm left me alone
So I lay and watch ‘em suck through the dead bones
The night’s swarm, hunting for a blood rush
And come crashin’ down through the wooded brush
And I'm dead. Stuck me, sucked me through my stomach
Blood is gone, skin and bones, as my body plummets

The swarm is here

The swarm is coming ( not)
The swarm is coming (What you gonna do?)

I’ll take the last of that flat Faygo bottle that you find (Brain Rays)
And turn it into a fine, divine wine
I’d say my full sign set in at 28 (Brain Rays)
I could tsunami all the water out a lake
I ain’t even gotta touch a bitch to make her nut (Brain Rays)
I’ll make a virgin’s neden blew out like a slut’s, loopy

Mind Beams versus Brain Rays
Both abilities straight crazy (Crazy)
Focus on and do anything
The mental mind war

“History ain’t gonna mean shit when I wipe your mind out...”
And delete your memory, like what happened (Mind Beams)
A chrome man-, chrome mannequin and got a boogie napkin
How you gonna be respected is the hardest (Mind Beams)
When I make your asshole never stop fartin’
All I gotta do is concentrate in full (Mind Beams)
Liquidate your eyeballs and spill ‘em out your skull
Send a asteroid through your forehead through the sky (Mind Beams)
Focus, and make your age triple multiply

“Don’t matter. Even as an old man…”
I’ll turn your ass into a loopy bag of flesh never seen (Brain Rays)
By turnin’ all your bones into cream
And all the organs in your body: liver, kidney, every gut (Brain Rays)
I’ll have ‘em all come shootin’ out your butt
Set fire to your baby dick and freeze your nuts froze (Brain Rays)
Swell your tongue up so fat, it explodes
Make your dick suck in and flip inside out. It’s tucked up (Brain Rays)
So you can’t forget you got fucked up by them brain rays

Mind Beams versus Brain Rays
Both abilities straight crazy (Crazy)
Focus on and do anything
The mental mind war
Mind Beams versus Brain Rays

“Very unimpressive. I heard about what you like to call…”
Your brain rays, shootin’ through them ray ban
And if you gank who, ‘cause them shit is lookin’ gay, man
Why my sunglasses intrigue you so, who the fuck knows?
There’s only room for one of us around here, so who goes?
I feel your brain rays trying to deflect my mind beams
But you failed to protect the back of your neck behind scenes
I just socked ya, mentally clocked ya
Now you rock a camel’s hump on your back. Handle that, partna!
If that was creative, I would say it. It wasn’t
But check out how your left leg has three feet all of a sudden
Indeed. Ain’t that some shit. I’d be pissed, but it only means more
To kick you in the ass with. Now I hit you with the classic, uh
Your shades fall, now your face small like a baseball
I expected jelly bean size. But saw your tries deflected!
I respect it. You and I and my mini mind, know what I see?
Yes, telepathically, and I do agree
Me and you must take advantage of the damage we cause
If we put our heads together, then the planet’s ours
Spendin’ dough, bendin’ hoes, standin’ ovations
With just each other, we can be the Head Bust Brothers!

Mind Beams versus Brain Rays

Detroit Car Jackin’,Phantom: X-Tra Spooky Edition,2015,"“Detroit has the most carjackings of any major city in the United States”
“Leave your keys in the car, bitch!”
“Ah! Okay! Okay!”
“Leave your keys in the car! Let- L-L-Leave your keys in the car!”
“Do whatever you want! Just don’t hurt me!”
“Get the fuck out!”
“Most carjackings occur between 8 P.M. and midnight, and twice as many men get carjacked as women.”
“Aw shit, man.”
“Get out of the car. Don’t fuckin’ move. Don’t think. Just get out.”
“Whatever you say, man. Just take the keys.”
“I’ll fuckin’ blow you out.”

I’m takin’ Woodward downtown. It’s been a while, a lot of changes:
New Walgreens and CVS. There’s still a lot of danger
Waitin’ at the light, I saw a gun and a stranger
Now I’m fuckin’ walkin’, and he’s in my Ford Ranger
Through the scary tunnel underneath the train station
To Mexican Town, I saw a couple on vacation
With just a broken bottle, I robbed them of their keys
“Our car is parked right over there - the Seabreeze”
To jack or be jacked in this town, I fuckin’ get that
But why’d it have to be a bitch’s ride? I ain’t with that
I could barely fit into the seat of this toy
The steering wheel was stuck under my gut. Oh joy
I’m riding with that top down. I’m the one who got clowned
Eject Taylor Swift. Any good CDs are not found
I went to pick up Shaggy. Sometimes he ain’t got no heart
He said he’d rather walk than ride with a Mary in a go-kart

“Detroit’s east side has the most number of carjackings.”
“Wait, hold up! Give me the keys! Give me the mother fucking key!”

Carjack, carjack
Of fuckin’ Detroit (Murderous!)
Fire in the streets
Burnin’ up, burnin’ up
What happens now
When Carjacks the Clown
Pull you outta your ride
And drive it all through the town?
Whip it around (Hey!)
Whip it around (Uh uh)
The Wicked Clowns (Hey!)
Whip it around (Uh uh)
Whip it around (Hey!)
Whip it around (Uh uh)
The Wicked Clowns (Hey!)
Whip it around (Whoop whoop!)

Took the bus out to Taylor, but they closed 
I seen a used car lot. It said to visit Walter
Walter was old with a white hoagie mustache
I said I’m looking for something fast and got much cash
He said he got a Corvette for 45 grand
That’s what it’ll take to put the keys in my hand
Well don’t I get a test drive once around the block?
As he kept talking, I just whipped out my Glock
Walter started cryin’ and hung his head low
He just handed me the keys and said “Go”
Michigan Avenue, my slicks were loud
Every time I hit ‘em, they would pop the crowd
Until a van of thugs surrounded my ‘Vette
They took the car, my , and my cigarettes
Now I’m walkin’ down Jefferson all the way home
Damn, it feels shitty when you’re given the bone
But what’s this? Monte Carlo parked on somebody’s lawn
Keys in it. Let’s get it. Once again, it’s on!

Carjack, carjack
Of fuckin’ Detroit (Murderous!)
Fire in the streets
Burnin’ up, burnin’ up
What happens now
When Carjacks the Clown
Pull you outta your ride

“More than 35% of carjackings in Detroit end with homicide.”
“Hey, I told you don’t fuckin’ look at me, man!” “No!” *gunshots*

I can't believe he 
I can't focus
I can't do this
I can't do this!
I can't!
I can't!

Listen to me. I can't. I just can't do it
I can't believe it, I knew it, screw it
I can't say why I blew it. I can't get used to it
I can't stand it. I can't say there's nothing to it
I can't get over it, under it, around it. I can't get through it
I can't deal with this right now. I can't take the pressure
I can't say I can't. I can't resist the 38 hidden in my dresser
I can't. does that make me lesser? Does that make you fresher?
Are you a you-can-do-it professor?
I can't. No. I can't, and I won't
I can't stop doing dope
I can't row a boat. Is this a joke?
I hope it don't float like That's All She Wrote. Oh my God
I can't cope

""You run around with losers, you will end up a loser, unconsciously. If you're around cynical, negative people all the time, you will become cynical and negative.""
""I spent most of my time trying to escape the helpless reality of my life by getting high""
""Look at life knock you down. What are you gonna do about it? How long are you gonna sit there and say 'You know what they did to me?' How long? Who wants to hear that rap?""

I can't wait. I can't front
I can't life. I can't believe my eyes
I can't look in the mirror. I can't deny
I'm nearing my demise
That's why I can't stand the sunrise
And I can't stand the new high rises
Poppin' up like surprises
'Cause time just flies by my eyes
I can't stand to wait the days are byin'
I can't stand the maze I'm in
I can't stand the walls I'm climbin'
On the low, I can't stop cryin'
I can't stand, and I can't stand here long
I can't stand this song
I can't sing, I can't dance, I can't take a chance
I can't... I can't take a stance

""The biggest killer of brains is lack of belief, and when we don't believe in ourselves, we start to doubt our abilities. We start to doubt what's possible""
""The future's unfolding for you right now. The future's unlimited for you right now.""

Fuck that guy. I can't stand him
I can't stand the demons in my neighborhood
Fake smiles looking for fat necks of blood
Fuckin' up our function, munchin'
Crunchin', lunchin' on somethin'
I can't wait for that. I can't pay for that
Fuck you. Sorry, I can't take it back
I can't be fakin' that
I can't take the pain in my God damn achin' back
I can't make it crack
I'm tired. I can't take a nap
I can't even slap a fat ass
Without the owner slapping me back
I can't have that
Who says I can't stab your neck?
Something happened in my brain
Some kind of bad snap

""Start focusing on being consistent and building momentum, as opposed to consistently building negative momentum.""
""It's easy to be on the bottom. It doesn't take any effort to be a loser. It doesn't any motivation, any drive, in order to stay down there on the low level.""
""And when we surround ourselves with people who inspire us and lift us up, when we have accountability partners, when we find great mentors or coaches who can keep us guided on our true North, that's when we start to build this momentum that anything is possible.""

Juggalo, enjoy your youth

If you hate something, don't you do it too, not you

Small my table, sits just two
Violent J as I'm scrub Joe Bruce
All these ninjas storm my room
And you dare say one belongs to you, not you

This is not for you

Oh, this is not for you
Never was for you, fuck yeah

Your old shit was so much better
Your new shit is so much better

Dedication, clown love is true
But with no power, what can I do?
But there are some who will accept Joe Bruce

I'm the Beast, I have my claws around your neck
You carry me all day, I'm clung to your back
I whisper negativity all in your ears
With my claws dug in your chest, drummin' up fears
I allow just enough air for you to get by
My demands, you will have to live by
I cover your eyes so the sun can't shine on ya
You mope around like you got a pneumonia
When your day comes to an end, and you're trying to rest
I position myself firmly on your chest
So when you're trying to breathe at night, my weight is right there
And I stare at you face to face, give you a nightmare
I'm pullin' on your hair, and I'm shockin' it white
God speaks to you, but I block it with fright
Who am I? Some kind of demon or a heathen
I'm all up in your ears, forever misleadin'

""Shit, I live in the dark"" (I'm haunted by the Devil)
""I live in fear"" (They said it's in my mind)
(Nobody else can see him)
""I feel like my chest is getting crushed"" (Nobody hear my cries)
""And I feel like this all the time"" (I'm haunted by the Devil)
""Every fuckin' day of my life""(Somebody tell me why)
""I live with this"" (And I can see the Devil)
""I live in the dark"" (The Devil in my life)

I cause headaches, bed shakes, your legs feel like dead snakes
Your skin itches real bad and shreds flakes
Every decision you make, it quickly gets shot down
By my voice in your ears layin' the plot down
I tell you nobody can help, don't bother askin'
You feel that heat, you're in Hell's fire, baskin'
Who am I? I'm that poison that eats you
I'm the one in between you and the God that seats you
I'm a liar, but you believe all that I'm dishin'
And always will, as long as your link is missing
I fill you full of fear, I fill you full of tears
You carry my weight on you for years and years
Who am I, and why am I always winnin'?
'Cause you're always sinnin' and fail to be forgiven
Truth is, you could get rid of me if you wanted
But you don't know how, so you're forever haunted

""Shit, I live in the dark"" (I'm haunted by the Devil)
""I live in fear"" (They said it's in my mind)
(Nobody else can see him)
""I feel like my chest is getting crushed"" (Nobody hear my cries)

""Every fuckin' day of my life""(Somebody tell me why)
""I live with this"" (And I can see the Devil)
""I live in the dark"" (The Devil in my life)

""It's like livin'"" (I'm haunted by the Devil)
""With a filter on"" (They said it's in my mind)
""Makin' everything staler than it really is"" (Nobody else can see him)

In which I think he might be interested in
Perhaps, performing on

Good, wholesome country tune
And I think he would be perfect for it
Um, please have him give me a call

While they slip my graffiti on a pavement
Grumble like I never do
Shotgun pointed dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a sunset
You wanna get high? We gonna touch the sky
Throw a ""Wicked Clown"" up, we proclaim the name
We don't show no shame, 'cause we across the lane
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest path
They figure I'm a trigger-happy killer, so they step back

Leave the crowd bald 'cause it's the place that I be, yo
Never have to worry 'bout my crew getting jumped
And if we ever do, Legs Diamond pop the trunk
We don't go for playin', unless you playin' with my balls
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all

20 years on stage, but I still get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
And we all gettin' rowdy in a Hatchet Man -party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
Big bad-guy from a four-leaf clovers
Hit yo bottom like a venomous cobra
Sharpen my axe up and then I'm coming over

Suckers causin' static, cause we still be disagreein'

A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Juggalotus got hellfire, can't deny it
Fuck the fake-weed, if it's legal, I don't buy it
I ain't got time to fuck with these hoes
Blow my fucking dingaling until my dick explodes
That's the way I am, every ninja be different

If I was the president, then I would state facts
And rule to fucking world with a solid-gold axe

Shine it up good, kickin' through the neighborhood

Quick to grip around it, and then I'll have it chopped

...
How horrid to be buried alive
Imagine the terror of being trapped in your own coffin
Your heart beating wildly, every gasping breath
Using up your valuable oxygen
My hand popped up out of the dirt
Crawling out with broken wrists that dont even hurt
My blood won't squirt it’s rusty.. dry
A milipede made it's home in my eye
I'll get by till the wicked Halloween
I’m howl-ing straight dogs follow me
I'm coming home dead man walking
My feet flop Clown Walkin' might make a beat drop
Spend twenty-five years I'm chewing on gum
Wait, I got none I'm chewing on my tongue
Walk, oh my leg snapped off at the knee
I beat a kid in the head with it and stoled his candy
Drag myself all the way to my old block
There go my old house, I go ""knock""
Trick or treat, some chick opened it up
I stabbed her in the gut, started choking the slut
What happened to the wicked shit
Cuz we all walk in Hellawicked
Yeah, it's time to get blood
And we get blood in it!
It's time to get blood
And we get blood everywhere!

Extremely often, I’m laying in my coffin
But this Halloween the lid's comin’ off son
A dead ninja got work to put in
And quite a few assholes to put a foot in
It's been twenty years, I wonder where my bitch at
My dick's still intact, I wanna hit that
Ain't shit buddy, and this ain’t a costume
I only live under the light of the Moooon!
Lookin for the bitch in the phonebook
But my only one good eye, it won't work
Finally found the address, I'm going there
Lookin like a big Yoda, but I dont care
Rang the doorbell with a dead ass rose
Long ass worm hangin outta my nose
My bitch got older, look like mick Foley
I killed her, cuz I refuse to die lonely!
Come on bitch!
What happened to the wicked shit
This real Wicked Hellawicked
It's time to get blood
And we get blood in it!

Hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes

I love hoes that love me, even the ugly ones
Hoes and they panties, sweet than candies
Long titties, walla balla king kong
Titties fat like pumpkins, or little itty bitties
Hoes make me jump up and clap my heels
When they blowin’ my balls off and feedin’ me meals
I love hoes’ smell, cinnamon perfume scents
Jackin’ off in your window, see me hoppin’ the fence
I love old ladies. They did the most fuckin’
And young hoes fantasize about dick suckin’
I love hungry hoes with crusty toes
Painted up, wet juggalettes, fresh from shows
Give me pig tails, pony tails, tease your shit up
Either way, I nut on your titties and then get up
I love it when hoes get mad, a new side to ‘em
It only makes me wanna do ‘em. I love hoes

Boo thang
You and that pootang
Make me woo woo, singin'
Bring that goo that spew out my wang
And leave my knees weak
I'm screamin', please freak
You make my meat skeet what you eat
Like a sweet sugar treat, cream fillin'

Hoes take you to court because they diss your dick
They can be scantless, wicked, and sick
I chase hoes. Ho chaser, ho catcher
I’m like a mother fucking blood hound: I smell her and fetch her
I love hoes that fuck outside and ain’t scared of it
And always polish your knob because they love it
I love hoes with accents, hoes that’s hood rats
Hoes that graduated, top of the stats
I don’t fucking care. Middle-aged moms
Young and old hoes are the mother fucking bomb
I love hoes with the artificial hair and boobs
I cut heads off gay poser dudes
Little mama, keep droppin’ babies out of your neden
You’re the reason we’re alive, and ain’t nobody forgettin’
Hoes that wash cars, hoes in the rodeo
Circus hoes, I’d love to get a hold of those

Boo thang
You and that pootang
Make me woo woo, singin'
Bring that goo that spew out my wang
And leave my knees weak

Blow that shit up, get lit up
I'm up in the bar, underground rap star
I don’t sing like a bitch, I don't slam a guitar
I'm 2 Dope, drunk as fuck, a straight ten
Bitches get dicked down, nut on, and spanked
Lean back, spent, I don’t blow 
I piss on other proof, that's all that I need
I smoke bits of vodka, wetting my whistle
I'm drunk as fuck again, waving my pistol
You scared of me, I be the S2D
With the ""SV"" on my chest, woo wee
Who wanna get fucked up with me? Straight shots
Got a little brave, stood up and god popped
I knock hoes out when I'm up in the club
My bad, bitch, come on, it's all love

Pour it up and gulp it down
Order up another round

So saucy, real saucy (I drink to that!)
Pour it up and gulp it down
Order up another round
We saucy, get saucy
So saucy, real saucy (Let's drink to that!)

I stopped the car and stepped out with a bottle of Pooka
In the streets with my pants off, waving a Ruger
I'm fucked up though, yo, I'm all the way live
Every speed limit sign says a hundred and five
White Castles and Jägerbombs for breakfast, startin’ off my day
Any other way is soft and gay
I fuckin’ love my homies, man, I mean it, I really do
That ain't just the brew either, dude
I’m fuckin' pissed off though, man, fuck this bullshit
And if you think I'm drunk either, bitch, you don't know shit
I’m passed out on a lawn chair on someone's front porch
Sun beamin' on my face like a blow torch
My piss in the morning shoots harder than a fire hose
I aim for the sky. Where is blows, it goes
Fuck y'all idiots laughing at my
'Cause I was drunk, but I spit this masterpiece

Pour it up and gulp it down

Pour it up and gulp it down
Order up another round
We saucy, get saucy
So saucy, real saucy (Let's drink to that!)

One minute I'm dancin', next minute I'm fightin'
I'm locked in a choke hold, hoes scratchin' and bitin'
They throwin' me out, I'm too dang drunk
I'm screamin, ""That's right! What the fuck you thunk?"" (Punk!)
Bitch shake it, another drink, make it
I paint my face so it's no mistakin'
Who the fuck I be, alcohol by the pound
Double fistin' 40 bottles and smashin' 'em down
Bitch, I thought you owed me some money or somethin'
Hit me with a ten spot, so I can hit me with a hen spot
Tip the bitch, nah, I trip the bitch
They throw me out in the ally, but I pay no tally
I'm a homeless drunk, a boneless drunk
Beat me with pipes and bats all you want
It don't matter, off to jail goes the big drinker
On the back of the cop car, an SV sticker

Pour it up and gulp it down
Order up another round

So saucy, real saucy (I drink to that!)

Goin' Trick-or-treatin' in my... Murda Cloak
Goin' Trick-or-treatin' in my Murda Cloak
H-H-Ha-Hallowicked

I woke up I don't remember fallin' asleep
I feel the same wicked hungers callin' from deep
They tell me to hunt devils in they robes and slippers
Take some bow clippers, a black cloak and scissors
Now I'm standin' in the backyard full of regret
Staedy sweatin' once I do this ain't over yet
In and through the back door everybody's asleep
I see they tidy and neat, I'm 'bout to bloody they sheets
It's gonna be a blood-splatter expert field day
Because I'm killin' today, to take this feelin' away
They told me you people are here to ruin our cause
Nevermind screwin' your drawers, ya gonna have to repaint the walls
'Cause its a hunger, and I'm hungry like I'm homeless and its Thanksgivin'
Thank you for the sacrifice your life is what you givin'
No forgivin' me you hate the homiciadal insane
You hatin' nothin' with these scissors in your brain
Now watch your eyes bleed

It's the simplest life...
I can't stop myself, I need some help
And with nobody left I'm killin' myself
It's the simplest life...
I can't stop myself, I need some help
And with nobody left I'm killin' myself

Sometimes I wear my Murda Cloak and tune into the news
I like to watch they speculation 'cause they always assume
They found a shoeprint, a nail, and a (?) up there
When the fuck these stupid piggies gonna learn out there
I tied a bitch up, I duct taped the bitch face
I threw her in the trunk at home I found her suffocated waste
I had to cut the bitch up, just meant to shut the bitch up
I never fucked that ho they said I did, man she was a slut
I'm sick and tired of they lives, thus everybody dies
Break into some homes, I see a spoon and bloody eyes I'm nutty, guys
But you can't see the darkness I do
Maybe I'm heartless, it's true, but every part is 'cause you
My daddy beat me with a seven, I had then brought home a hooker
My daddy beat her shovel, threw her in the cooker
Next day I hate to say it, but you know what happens next
He served my plate and in the meat I found a Kotex, Oh my God

Thunder loud enough to shatter brick walls

Tornadoes of fire being chased by enormous tidal waves

I just wanna tell you
From the depths of where my heart used to be
You ain't shit (Bitch!)
Fuck yo bitch, suck my dick

Plummeting into a dungeon of nothingness
I'm 'bout to suffocate, fearless like Fred Fury
Born a legitimate, born to eliminate
Spirits around me allow me to levitate
Drugs in me  that's how I meditate
I ain't show up to my funeral, made 'em wait
I got the stain on the game that I gotta make
(Bitch!) I know they feeling it
Ouija just killing it
Look what we did with it
Put the sauce on the wicked shit (Bitch!)
Y'all should be fucked, shit, bitch, cunt, happy we did this shit
Handzum with a hatchet talk to my elastics
Psycho with schematic automatic static
Tell me
Where do I start, because swearing's an art
Hatchetman on my heart means I'm wearing the part
We don't care about critics, right there on the charts
It's the spot that we bear, it's to claim  smart
Everywhere that you go, don't be starin' your mart
They say juggalos hard, and you know that they are
And they know every Card from the second it start
They dissect every secret, they checkin' the arc
You can see my mug in the CDs that you might purchase or pluck right there coat
Or within your  was there from the start
Blarin' our music and wearin' our art
Tearin' through duckets and hearin' the heart
We there for a part
Caring the hardest is sharing them Cards
 pussy like I'm on a hike
I'm lost in the pussy looking for the light
I beat up the pussy like a prison fight
I don't like fat pussy, but I do tonight
I'm fucking your butt if the pussy ain't tight
I burn through pussy like coke in a pipe
Fuckin' your girl's pussy's like rockin' the mic
Shit's pussy, simple as riding a bike
I master cuss words that you ain't even heard of yet 
(Woo! I'm the nature boy!)
I'm psycho psychotic, I know how a murder get (Bitch!)
I slaughtered a lot of hoes, but never heard of 'lettes 
(Woo! I'm the nature boy!)
I'm funky and dirty and sick and sleep 

Cuss words, let 'em roll (Fuck cock!)
Mother fuck shit God damn asshole (Bitch fag!)
Cuss Words let 'em rip (Slutty dick!)
Mother fuck you, damn shit head bitch (Bitch!)
Cuss words, let 'em roll (Fuck cock!)
Mother fuck shit God damn asshole (Bitch fag!)
Cuss Words let 'em rip (Slutty dick!)
Mother fuck you, damn shit head bitch (Bitch!)
[Verse 3: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Fearless Fred Fury don't fucking forgive
Your feelings ain't foolish, you're lucky to live
You need a machine for the heartbeat to give
You'd shit yourself cryin' and droolin' a bib
Fred is no friend of foes
I'm stompin' in your nose
Set fire to your clothes
How come I fuck all your hoes?
Lets oot a couple o's
Knock off some liquor stores
Drink gasoline and smoke
SQUEEZE your neck 'til it's broke
SQUEEZE your neck 'til you croak
Hump her neden until it smoke
'Til her daddy have a stroke

 (Bitch!)
Own a slab in Roanoke
Plus my pad in Okemos
Got one in Cuba and Aruba and Compton (West Side Loc)
Never let them tell you nope
Know your roll, don't ever hope
Gotta love yourself
If you won't let you love yourself, then just elope
Your career's a stale-ass joke
Cosby won't cuss, but loved to grope
Piss my pants, let my nuts soak
Out my zipper, my dick poke (Yup!)
In London, I'm known as bloke
Clean my bitch booty with soap
Violent J, my fucking loc
Got me a lap dance with the pope
 (Bitch!)

Cuss words, let 'em roll (Fuck cock!)
Mother fuck shit God damn asshole (Bitch fag!)
Cuss Words let 'em rip (Slutty dick!)
Mother fuck you, damn shit head bitch (Bitch!)
(Come on!) Cuss words, let 'em roll (Fuck cock)
Mother fuck shit God damn asshole (Bitch fag!)
Cuss Words let 'em rip
Mother fuck you- (Ah!) uoy kcuf rehtom
Cuss words, let 'em roll (Fuck cock!)
Mother fuck shit God damn asshole (Bitch fag!)
Cuss Words let 'em rip (Slutty dick!)
Mother fuck you, damn shit head bitch (Ah!)
Cuss words, let 'em roll (Fuck cock!)
Mother fuck shit God damn asshole (Bitch fag!)
Cuss Words let 'em rip (Slutty dick!)

Who U Know?,UnKnown,2016,"Scary, super scary
Bitch boy, neden hole, it's Halloween
[Verse 1: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Tell me who you know that'll chew a?dead?body in half
While?sitting cross leg in a blood?bath and laugh
Stretch and pull on the intestines, 'round his fingers they loop
And fall asleep and dream of baby poop while layin' in the goop
Who you know that be freaky enough that he plucks his own
Eyeballs out his dome, then cuts a slice in his balls
And replaces 'em all, so he can see the bitches in his man hose
Swing his fuckin' hose and nuts out his nose
Who you know that paints his face like a clown and ties up colorful
Balloons into a puppy pup, then stab them wounds, a yuppy fuck
Up in a vacant building, far from that richie's home
And takes to wielding a hammer, splatters his cuts and splits his dome
Who you know that show his penis to policemen on patrol
That cop is shock, he take a slingslot, plant a rock in his skull
In full control, he doused a  in petrol, then call Metro for the show
A burning bigot hanging from a fucking telephone pole
[Chorus: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Who you know that's like me?
'Cause I don't know a soul, I don't know (A single soul)
I'm the only one I know, I don't know me, 
I don't know much
But I know what they know, I don't know me, 
on Halloween?
That much I know
[Verse 2: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Tell me who you know that's from the city of flames on Angel's Night
Grabs ahold of some  throats, and strangles 'em tight
If everything goes right, and I strain with all my might
The eyeballs go deranged, then explode and blow they sight
Who you know whose judo will throw you to Pluto
So brutal, I was mean, killed at 13, but grew, though
I screw holes in your toes 'til you told me all that you know
You explode, let your bluff blow,  and chew my noodles
Who you know seeps out the sewer drains, right up into your veins
This venom I speak, sneak right into your brains
This Halloween, I deem, followin' my dream
All hail the mightiest presenting of 17
Who you know that hold you back within a potato
To snatch, snap off a finger or slice off a slab of your back
In fact, I'm lovin' the thought of shovin' my fuckin' glove
And randomly rippin' off somethin' for the oven and grubbin'
[Chorus: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Who you know that's like me?
'Cause I don't know a soul, I don't know (A single soul)
I'm the only one I know, I don't know me, 
I don't know much
But I know what they know, I don't know me, 
on Halloween?
That much I know
[Verse 3: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Who you know that rides a unicycle down Vernor Ave
Completely naked, covered in blood, chewing on a human slab
That ain't the half, it's Halloween tonight, and my sack is full
Of something heavy and bloody and wet, I'm draggin' it slow
Leaving a long-ass red trail, swervin' in the street
Must be some kind of meat, the smell is sweet, I'm yellin' ""Trick or treat""
It's fuckin' four in the mornin', I'm tootin' my horns
Plug in my yellow clown wig, ravens above me soarin'
Who you know that do like I do, jumpin' roof
Of buildings, chuggin' gasoline, and don't care to proof
Because the truth of the matter, is that if I fall, I splatter
Release the bottle to the darkness and wait for the shatter
Uh! A lethal height, I couldn't gladder
Fall backwards to begin my descent, like ""Fuck the latter""
Halloween, I got bad dream, you wonder how my day went?
Asked that who they said, then next morning, they'll scrape me off the pavement
[Chorus: Violent J & 
Shaggy 2 Dope
]
Who you know that's like me?
'Cause I don't know a soul, I don't know (A single soul)
I'm the only one I know, I don't know me, 
I don't know much
But I know what they know, I don't know me, 
on Halloween?
That much I know. Who you know that's like me?
'Cause I don't know a soul, I don't know (A single soul)
I'm the only one I know, I don't know me, 
I don't know much
But I know what they know, I don't know me, 
on Halloween?
