Slam,Bacdafucup,1993.0,"Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

Well it’s another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I’m cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I’ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that’s how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet’s first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild
Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon
Buck, bye tough guy, oh my god I’m so high
Cause they say I rhyme, they say I look like a gremlin
But what does it take to make a kid make a million children SLAM

Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

I’m the nitty, nasty, gritty smashing, never slow gassing
Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion
That I provide, I abide the 
U.S.G
Besides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde
Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you’re not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It’s graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it’s all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM

Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

I’m a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance
Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I’m so confused
Excuse me, for example I’m an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I’m not watered down so I’m dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
B-boys make some noise, and just, just SLAM

Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

Last Dayz,All We Got Iz Us,1995.0,"South suicide Queens, all niggas
Gather up all your arms
And get ready for this New World Order
Shit is about to change, motherfucker!

I’m America’s nightmare
Young, black and just don’t give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
So fuck a 9-to-5! And whitey tryin' to slave us
With minimum wages, slammin' my niggas up in cages
Changin their behavior to spittin' razors, that's outrageous
Smokin' roaches is hopeless
We want lazy sofas and sculptures
Lady chauffeurs who fuck us, full house and royal flushes
Roll with the rush, it's that Afficial Nast
Got bitches with pistols and cash, we livin' in the last
My theory is ""fuck it,"" sexy niggas get abducted
My corrupted is conducted, through ghettos, sippin' Amaretto
Hand on the metal, foot on the pedal, never settle
He wore Carolina Herrera, dirty Donna Karan sweaters
Ralph Lauren leathers and suedes
Gold plated guns and grenades
To blow up; I got news from the informers
I'm trapped in corners, bustin' shots at Time-Warner's

My man big Ty, he know how to get by
Get high, do a jix, then be fixed to be fly
Some mid, cross and up and downtown action
And when he stick he keep a grip and move with traction
Keep mad alibis, a plan to stay wise
And wide-eyed, livin' in the state of Southside
Crooked jakes and fakes, snake niggas all out for papes
All who wanna overtake, you leave them with drapes
The white sheet covers, this heat smothers
The street, eat brothers, six shots rang, duke got banged
We all ready for these wars
We all want more, these the last days—get yours!

32 shots inserted in Glock's, you heard it for blocks
The murderer who gots convertible drops
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
‘Cause it be off the hook, crooks, crack
Cheeba spots, and sellin' rocks
The cops around the clock, it’s hot
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it

Thinkin' about takin' my own life, I might as well
Except they might not sell weed in hell
And that’s where I’m goin', ‘cause the Devil’s inside of me
He make me rob from my own nationality
That’s kind of ignorant, but yo, I gotta pay the rent
So, yeah, I'll stick a nigga most definite
A degenerate, if I get caught I'm innocent
‘Cause I don't leave no sticky fingerprints
For the cops, they only good if they dead
And all that badge and the gun shit be goin’ to their head
To make bread I gotta steal for sport
So I stole the show and made some pennies for my thoughts
And if this fuckin' rap shit don't pay
I'ma start sellin' drugs around my way
Killin' my own people in the USG
Shit, they gonna get it from somebody, I'd rather it be me
Besides, you can't tax dirty money
And you can't trust nobody (Nobody!)
No one (No one!), I'm a scorpion
And I'll probably bite the bullet, ‘cause I live by the gun

Big heavy-hitters, 25-to-life bidders who just came out
And pullin' flame out, take aim, blow your brains out
It’s life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
In South suicide Queens where niggas act up
Nigga, back up, Afficial Nast, throw your fuckin' gats up!
It’s life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
We never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
Afficial Nast motherfuckers don't give a shit—word up!",https://genius.com/Onyx-last-dayz-lyrics

Nigga ribs is touching now they stuck in the island
Motherfuckers is smiling but nobody smiling
‘Cause where I'm from, motherfucking niggas be wilding

You colorful like a bitch
Lala you signing and dancing, you bitch!
You need to loosen up your clothes nigga
And leave the dancing to them hoes nigga
Hip Hop started out on the block
I fell asleep at the wheel, the shit crashed into Pop
When I speak, the hood got the ears up, Spock
And I’ma leave my mark and you gotta get hit with the Onyx
Nigga you know, nigga you know, nigga you know
Am I wrong? Hip Hop need a face lift
And what better face than the mad face to get?

Blades and nunchucks, brazing gun shots
When I’m done they can rake their guts up (motherfucker)
This heat turns your face to slush pup
Ride to Hell, this is Satan’s bus stop
Got a hot bitch cuffed up
Take the drugs, love, you get raped and butt fucked
I snort speed then I Wakedafucup
Kinda of off topic but hey
I’m somewhat crazed and drunk off Jamaican rum shots
(White noise) White boy’s cables cut off
Angels dust drops, how that taste?
D.O.D. mad face, closed case

Niggas got no taste, but when I look at them fuckers, it figures
We hard body karate, Killuminati niggas
I’m Picasso, an apostle, Hip Hop deliver
Y'all niggas Pop so I'm popping shots in your liver
Try and copy what I got and I’ll copy your chopper
Niggas claiming they heartless, we'll put 2 in yo mama
Brains leaking and your head leave you looking like pasta
Ain’t speaking cause you dead on the floor, an imposter
See I’m obsessed with this sport, lesson, I’m core
Repping with the Onyx, niggas back with the force
We back in this war, we back in, of course
So all y'all boot-legged niggas, get yo' ass to the store

Throw Ya Gunz,Bacdafucup,1992.0,"Take ’em up, take ’em out, bring ’em out dead
Shine ’em up, shine ’em up, shine a bald head
One gun, two gun, three gun, four
You’re mine, it’s all about crime
Onyx! Onyx!

It’s time to get live, live, live like a wire
I set a whole choir on fire (Uh!)
Well done on the grill, Chyskillz kills
The no frills that try to diss me, they get crispy
(Ha, ha-ha-ha, and we do it like this)
And that, get back I attack tracks
Cause they can burn in hell shit for all that I care (Yeah!)
Beware the bald heads, the dreads dead if they there (Ooh!)
Stick ups assassin,’ tracks a new reaction
(These fuckin’ niggas shoulda made the All-Madden)
Onyx is wreckin’ shit, slip slide step quick
Super on the tenant, the kids crash like a rented
The shit they write is black and white, well mine’s got
Mad color, ain’t that right my blunt brother?
(Word up! Raze it up!
We do it with the crew that don’t give a fuck!)

So throw ya gunz in the air
Throw ya gunz in the air
Buck buck like ya don’t care

Uh oh, heads up! Cause we droppin’ some shit on ya now
Chyskillz, Onyx, Tec-9 for a while
Keep ya eyes open in a fight, I’m a swell ’em
The hardcore style, rowdy and wild hits I’ma sell ’em (Sell ’em!)
To all competition slide back then listen
I’m kickin’ all that shit to the doormat
Claimin’ this domain, cause mad pains
Blood stains, long range (Got gats!)
Crazy clips, I sink ships, cut faces like a pirate
I’ve never caught a slug for the mad shit that I did
(Heard?) You got the word so observe
I shatter and splatter bodies and bones and bust nerves
(Open!) I always leave my barrel smokin’

Throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don’t care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don’t care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don’t care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don’t care

I hate your fuckin’ guts, and I hope that you die (Uh!)
Sticky Fingaz’ name and my life is a lie
Plus I’m havin’ a bad day so stay outta my way
(And what the pistol packin’ people say ya better obey)
Just in the nick of time, I commit the perfect crime
Rip my heart out my chest, put it right into a rhyme (Yeah!)
I don’t feel pain cause it's all in the mind
And what’s mines is mines, and yours is mine
Don’t fuckin’ blink or I’mma rob yo’ ass blind
Onyx, is rippin’ shit, I got the Tec-9
So what the bumba clot, boy, buck-buck, buck-buck
It’s a ca– tastrophe, fuckin’ with me G
I’m a bald head with a knife
I want your money or your life
So, so, so, so

Throw ya gunz in the air

Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck-buck like ya just don’t care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck-buck like ya just don’t care

Straight up nigga
Motherfuckin' Southside nigga
(Word up)
Brooklyn, what?
We gonna do it just like this man
Straight to your whole area
(Yeah!) 
Word up!
 (Yeah!) 
Word up!
You know what we fin' to do
(Shut 'em down, shut 'em down)
(Yeah, yo! Word up, yo!)
It's time to take over the world!

Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (Yeah)
Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (What!)
Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (Official Nast')
Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (Yo, yo, yo)

Shut 'em down, start the violence we wildin' wildin'
Slain rapper's body found washed up, on Coney Island
When I rolled up, this nigga heart slowed up, that “killa” froze up
When I pulled up, jumped out with the pump-pump 32 shots and ducked out
Then I broke out, left that cat for dead his body smoked out
Cause when I fall out, y'all killas got kill me kid I'm goin' all out
Life's a bitch, fuck it! Got a gun, bust it!
The gameplay, gotta play by the rules of your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest
Have you layin' where the dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin in the eyes of Death
Ask
 the Lord for forgiveness, when I did this, there was not no witness
But he should understand, cause even God got a shit list

Yo it's beatdowns anonymous, I spits like a shiny silver nine'll bust
Niggas fine to bust, we the kind that rush
Those that, hold back, taking your whole stack
Grimy street cats, niggas baldhead, like Kojak
Go gat for gat, quote that, in fact, you can smoke that
Uncut black dust, making your whole, fucking skull crack
Better know me, one-three, one and only
Could be never phony in any ceremony, I'll tear you homey
(Shut 'em down!) Sonsee's taking your time, making your mind
Baddest nigga on the low defecatin with rhymes
Breakin your spine, got you movin from the flurry time to worry
I'ma bury the bullshit, feel my full clip!

Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (Uhh!)
Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (What!)
Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (Uhh!)
Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (Uhh, uhh)

Aiyyo I bet you this motherfuckin' double barrel'll blast this face
Be on the lookout for a basketcase
Niggas pumped you up to watch you get beat, had you thinkin' shit is sweet
Now you up shit's creek, cause your shit's weak
How much is your life worth to someone important, cause I be extortin'
Kidnappin' for ransom is some shit that you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gorton, niggas was gettin' robbed
The guy from Yonkers High stayed on his job, with his own little mob
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon? Worth makin my shit go boom
'Til your own doom, fill them graveyards, til there's no room?
Fuck you know about a pine box? Money goin out with nine Glocks
Autops' between that same nigga, when they pull out spray nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew? I ain't gon' rest, it don't take a whole lot to fill up your vest
Then watch your lungs as they spill out your chest
You best get on some, act your age shit, you a little kid
That run for faces, more niggas get killed like that than a little bit

Ayy man Sticky! F–I–N–G–A–Z the crazy cajun
Blazin' bullets for days and days and grazin' amazin' I'm the guy that's lacin'
Purple Hazin, hard to be phasin' LORD all this hell that I'm raisin'
God of the Underground, I'm gunnin em down with a thunder pound
We gonna (Shut 'em down!) We turn shit dumb quick when the gun click
Lyin' in ya rhymes is worse then lyin on your dick
In the morgue admit it dogs I'm the Rottweiler my Glock holla
Fuck cocaine killa I sniff gunpowder
So all you real Willies throw your Roley's in the sky
Now all my crooks, rob them players outside!
I'm so hype, I'll take yo' life, better have my dough right
And fuck Five Mics, I don't need no mic!
What?! Bring it! Shut 'em down!

Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (Yeah!)
Shut 'em down! Shut 'em down, shut 'em down! (What! What!)

Yeah who want mine? Bent outta shape, one time
Play the mall, starin at your bird of all sunshine
Watch my shit shift, niggas in the back, wigs lift
You know the stats God, don't even ask pa, back slit
Raw drug raps, thug hats and mob hats, spit on that cat
This yellow love nigga fuckin with a rich cat
My shit bad, 5 feet 6, with a crisp hat plush
Throwin down on thirty bricks, niggas is with that
Though, federados locked my man yo, hit lotto
Three-hundred thousand dollars in the bottle
Bitch snack is Heiml technique, rover in the robe, gold link
You know the code 'Rique, suitcase money, stow heat

I've got the filthiest shit, human ears ever heard!
And even if you wash my mouth out with soap
I’ll still be as disgusting and despicable!
Unpredictable, liable to flip my lid!
My moms dropped me on my head, when I was a kid!
Back then I lost all my marbles, today I lost my job
So unless it’s Armageddon somebody’s bound to get robbed
Watch out! This could be you I believe
With a gun in your face, it’s better to give than receive
I'm more than meets the eye, energize
Make your blood pressure rise. Mad Face ain't no disguise!

Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey

We Don’t Fuckin’ Care,Wakedafucup,2014.0,"We don't fucking care
Who the fuck in here?

Yeah, I guess I'm the guest of honor, I'm guilty
I guess, your honor, why niggas wanna test my honor?
It's honor among thieves, I run with petty crooks
Scheming on niggas like ""Yo, that baby shook""
But he looked to the ground when he look him up and down
Be my Brooklyn side, you let the crooks inside
And pride could be a man's worst killer
I'd rather starve than be a purse stealer
The worst feelers cause we coming from a dark place
I see the light, niggas running up on park place
Every night you got the narc chasing
The feds place every night, it'll have your heart racing
Half my niggas facing time in the system
""Never-gave-a-fuck"" type of niggas don't listen when you tell 'em
Fall back or you're gonna be a felon but they keep on rebellin'


Hello, I'm Fergie-Fergie, diamond teeth looking pearly
Rallying with the worst, the lord better have mercy
Boy, I could get dirty, you rappers never concern me
Talking about you the best, your vision is getting blurry
Nigga, I'm the God from Trinidad spitting curry
Eating you rapping niggas and spit the stem from the cherry
Cause you niggas is through, I put you niggas in suits
Popping your top off like you niggas is coupes
You best gon' know my team, my crew niggas is suits
Willie Lynch with the flow, I put you niggas in noose
Get thrown of from roof like you Bishop from Juice
40 below Timbs, I'm sporting my Bishop boots
What comes out of that is known as the deuce deuce
I pew pew, you pume when I'm spraying the perfume
The Devil is wearing Prada, I'll put him in dirt room
The Devil you know you gon' holla, you leaving this Earth soon
Like right about now cause you just passing your curfew


Why should I fucking care? I never had shit
Moms gave birth to me on a pissy mattress
Pops disappeared, nigga taught me magic
My idea of fun growing up was doing bad shit
The first slicks that I hit was 
No friends, I come around and niggas haul ass
As far as I can 'member I've been on the wrong path
I would rob Peter and take all Paul cash
Though I'm glad I was born cause I like that
Where all them sheisty niggas? Gotta see behind my back
My face the last thing you see besides my strap
Birth take 9 months, but with a 9 mill' you die like that
So I'm looking out for number one, the world made me selfish
Praying is fucking dumb, we all going to Hell, bitch
But I'm immortal, live forever like a shellfish
Only the strong survive, preying off the helpless


Bars demolish your show tunes
Best by far with Onyx and the Snowgoons
Been tragic, my raps been magic
I pitch rocks with one arm, I'm Jim Abbott
You been slacking, what happened? I've been rappin'
Gem snatching and laughing at all your men's fashion
P, the best is go guess
My flow crap on niggas, 
you dress like Mos Def
Fuck all the dumb shit
I'll rip your arms off and use them shits for drumsticks
Your momma in jail, your father is frail
Your sister a call-girl,  sell
Sean don't know better
A whole lot of cheddar, Raekwon no Lo sweater

Aiyyo, fuckin bitches man.. (worrrrrd up)
See that's what happen man
When you fuck the dog-shit out of bitches
Muh'fuckin hehahahh...


If ya got a girl then you better believe
She got a, dick up her throat and a trick up her sleeve
But if ya don't take my word, take the word of another
I love my girl more than I love my own mother
Until I caught the bitch in bed fuckin' my brother
Now, pussy to me, is a stick and a bone
I fuck it and she suck it then I leave it alone
Then get out the crib 'fore her man come home

Ding dong, ring a ling a ling
Honey I’m home, scumbags and candy
Feelin damn dandy, crazy drunk off the brandy
Headed to the stairs, tip tip toe
With these squeaky ass stairs kid you gotta move slow
She wasn’t in the room, where could she be?
Wait a cotton pickin minute, I hear the TV
I slid to the den what did I see?
What you saw?
I seen a nigga hairy stink ass (word??)
And my girl on her knees (OHHH SHIT!)
She was suckin' the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Hey man, I was just watchin this, it was monotonous
I couldn't figga the nex niguh dick in my girl's esophagus

Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)

Yo that's my motherfuckin word
Man I was trickin on this bitch man
I was buyin this bitch diamonds and the whole shit
Motherfuckin Moet yaknowhatI'msayin?
I was proppin this bitch up in Def Jam
Niguz was like yo, yaknowwhatI'msayin? (???)
Yo a bitch ain't shit man that's my motherfuckin word
Yo Suave, yo Suave, yo Sauve
Yo how do you feel about that shit man?

A freak is a freak and a hoe is a hoe
If your bitch get this low that shit is absolutely zero
A hoe I had before was claimin love, I was blind see
You can say like 
Mary J., ""Just Remind Me""
Was buggin when she started suckin fuckin peppermints
Blow jobs got better
How the hell you miss those hints?
I don’t know but then I got the shock that almost blocked me like an obstacle
My girl lip lock a niggas cock like a popsicle
Quick, my man flipped the silencer tip
Now let that dumb bitch go to hell and suck on the devil’s dick
Yep, you know money felt the steel
He should ate that pussy then it coulda been his last meal
So don’t let my girl suck your dick
Even if she’s suckin the next nigga dick

Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Afficial Nastee Niguz (repeat 8X)

Picture this, picture that
Your girl’s holdin the next man’s glands and comes back tell you that “I love you”
Bacdafucup, break the fuck off
Bacdafucup bitch or I’ma smack your wig off
Smack the cum out your mother fuckin mouth
I got proof- How?
Cause it landed on my couch

She was suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
She was suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)

Sometimes I feel like a nut
It melts in your mouth, not in your butt
Oh and
tell your girl to stop changing her lipstick
I’m startin to get rainbows around my dick
I got caught in the act, you pulled a gun, I gave chase
It ain’t my fault his bitch take in the face
Shit, she the one who found Jack, the black vagina finda
Hmmm big ain’t it, lick lick so good God I almost fainted
Suckin da next nigga dick

She was suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
She was suckin the nex niguh dick (worrd?)
She was suckin the nex niguh, suckin the nex niguh
Suckin the nex niguh (she's still suckin his dick)
She was suckin the nex niguh dick
She was suckin the nex niguh dick
She was suckin the nex niguh, suckin the nex niguh
Suckin the nex niguh dick

Fuck it I don't need ya, let the welfare feed ya (word up)

All We Got Iz Us (Evil Streets),All We Got Iz Us,1995,"Nigga you heartless?
You ain't heartless
You don't want no part in this
You ain't got it in ya
I’m born to be a sinner
As I move through these evil New York streets like grease
And some kids get caught up all up in the crime rate
Couldn’t hold your 9 straight when you was busting your whole clip and hit nothing
Your whole block got hot up, only two niggas got up
Came down fast, caught the cash and the product
Caught you pants down with your clothes off
A nigga never knows, a nigga never doze off

Ya got your rhymes niggas? Bring em, we stomp that
Its concrete combat where I'm at
A crime covered city
Where there's no time for pity
We coming from the village
Of the unprivileged
Blood soaked bills through murder actions
Transactions all illegal
I smell the cheeb like a beagle
Evil stalks and lurks, dominate and do works in my dwelling
Niggas spilling shells and compelling to bust melons
We just fugitives and felons so ain’t no telling

These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets...

I see the world through the eyes of a nigga on a brink
Drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
And I’m trapped in these evil streets
Driving some scuffed up ran down beat up ass Timbs
Some kid pulls up with chrome dipped Bugatti rims
Now I’m thinking it’s three in the A.M. , I’m walking, he in a B.M. drop top 3
And don’t even see me, but you gon' believe he saw my gun in 3-d
10 blocks later I'm trying to work the CD
Spotted 50 dipped on the BQE
Cause ain't no way them pigs is bagging me
Next up is Sonsee, we Afficial Nastee

For niggas that force the issue, my man’ll toss the pistol
And of course I hit you, let that loss be with you
The more L’s the higher, streets of fire
Make ice hearts in men for a worldly desire
It’s the black attack born on the corner
Nigga grew up fast to get that loot up, ready to shoot up
And he do anything to achieve it
Ya better believe it
Run with a band of thieves who retrieves the goods
Stacking stacks and push a nigga shit back like they should
While we was gone some shit done developed
Now parlay, sit back and watch Armee swell up
Yeah, punk niggas

As we move through these evil streets...

Only nigga that could kill me is the nigga in the mirror
And when I cuff a mic it make my fighting words clearer
I’m naked without a gun, it’s like something is missing
That was my employer when I ain’t have a pot to piss in
So listen
Keep a gun even if it’s not needed
Better that than to have none and be in deep shit
We mold on niggas like Bacteria grows
Foes be lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose

Nigga, we kill niggas for Polo and Hilfigers
It’s all for real ill niggas with steel triggers
Ain’t nothing over here pumping soft, shit be jumping off
On the reg
Don’t beat me in the head with that, go ahead with that
I think back, me and my man’s brother, we robbed somebody grandmother
Pulled out, the bitch ran for cover
Keep niggas guessing with a face without expression
For niggas stressing, I leave a lifetime impression
It shines like fluorescents when the flame comes out
It’s all about what you got when your game runs out, shit is hot
You can get burned with heat, we take turns to sleep, you better learn the street knowledge
Damn, you can get shot for five dollars
It’s live wires with no signs of survivors

When I go buc buc, you better buc back
(Buc buc buc buc. Buc buc buc buc)
So put yo middle fingers up, niggas say fuck that
(Fuck that, fuck that! Fuck that, fuck that!) 

When shit pop off, niggas ain’t never around
We pop off, we don’t care whoever’s in town
Never trust, it’s never us if the cops ask questions
Never trust a nigga, even pop my best friend
Your end’s coming near, your niggas come in here
With that tough guy shit, the tough die quick
So wake the fuck up from the dead, you bitch niggas
Or get your hair done, roll with official wig splitters
The kick-back from the pistol will break your wrist
Then I’ll put you six feet in the ground and take a piss
I’m disrespectful, yeah, I know, but fuck you
I know a couple niggas that’ll kill you for a buck or two
For five bucks they get live as fuck
Five years on the island, can’t survive the cuts
So buc back, put yo middle fingers niggas up
And fuck that if you feel just like me


When I buc back, y'all niggas running like bitches
Im like fuck that, always keep a gun in my britches
It’s none of your business, nigga, where the fuck Sticky been?
I show up at your place of business with fifty men
Better let Sticky in, ‘fore I get ticked off
Pockets get ripped off, jewelry slipped off
I screw face niggas when I walk by them
Those two faced niggas, they won’t even try him
Cause niggas know, I ain’t taking a short
Fuck a witness, he won’t even make it to court
Yeah, Forte Green, Big House is Brownsville
From here on out, nigga, it’s all downhill
My four pound feels heavy as a motherfucker
And you don’t wanna test it

You can get stuffed in the trunk in the rear
Niggas gettin dunked in the pier
Rollin' thru the truck with a blunt in the ear
Think it until you make the dope, you're no high roller
I can sip two beers, I can turn bipolar
Schizo, crazy, I'm flipped, I warped
That's why no more fuckin' with prescription drugs
Everybody got stuck on that road to stardum
But the banks aren't empty, shanks aren't empty
My brain's all safety, I'm locked to the beat
Neva fall off, even if I loose my feet
I work all day, so I sleep all night
Then wake up with the Bentley with the football lights
That's how I took yo wife
Told ""baby, we can kick it like a football high""


Sticky fingers, God of the underground
Girls be like ""Oh my God"" when I come around
You waskally wabbits, now I gotta gun 'em down
First you wanted beef, now you givin' me the runaround
I'll take yo pride, you'll give me my respect
See if you can cash this reality check
I'm half from Ret, but rest assured
When it come to ya'll niggas, less is more
Yeah, I took the hustlers oath
They said money don't grow on trees, I'm raking the doe
Make something outta nothin', that's my upbringing
We don't play God but we got the club swingin'

Coming out the fucking cracks like snakes boy
Word to mother
All my niggas in Queens and ya dont stop
All my niggas in Brooklyn and ya dont stop
All my niggas Uptown and ya dont stop
All my niggas in the boogiewoogie and ya won't stop
We gonna set this shit New York style

We don't throw gang signs in New York
We just be on some shit in New York
New York City, shiftee low down gritty
You punk niggas yell pity and smell shitty
NYPD can suck my dick
This is the way we rip shit from the bricks
Walking like a zombie smoking blunts in the lobby
I  be rollin with more niggas behind me than Khadafi

Attention, fuck all that slippin and itchin
I’m rappin, loot snachin, stayin greasy this shit ain’t easy
I’m comin rawhide, serious as a four five
Them damn streets are eager to claim all lives
But fuck it, it’s my home hate it or appreciate it
It’s the torrid 8 million story orientated
Designated and made for the real renegades
So I never been afraid to stomp, comp, then get paid

This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York

I’ma stay on my job, cause that’s my adventure
I was bred to be a big gainer who contained a percent of the
U.S.G. which make me switch like a schizo
Where I roam it gets so hot but never blow my cool at no spot
If the heat got too much I’ma slide down south
Outta town bound, either home or away
New York hold shit down on keep locked  we rock all night
And if Zoo York niggas wasn’t part of your shit, your shit wasn’t right
We known to start shit up from trends, to riots, to fracas
And big enough to fuck up anybody that wanna attack us
And that’s cause the five boroughs are deep
Most of us are peeps, true Zoo York niggas we play for keeps
(
Wanna be a part of it
--New york is always starting shit)

Fuck that, I’m the nasty native New Yorker
The full of shit talker
The dark street walker
Sign of the time stalker
Bringin it back to reality, this is for my niggas in NYC
Not since '76
Since the Knicks won the championships
Has there been some more shit like this
So back up, get off of that soft or wack rap style
My shots ring loud, and panic the crowd
Blowin’ up
Get up, my sounds downtown
Hold ‘em up
Give me everything right now
So fuck the mayor, fuck Rudy, Ray, and the governor
Ya’ll niggas couldn’t walk my walk, my talk’s ruggeder


Yeah, I’m from the place where criminals is born
And Sticky Fingaz ain’t never led a nigga wrong
Representin New York City and for what it’s worth
Yo we the triflest mother fuckers on the face of this Earth
So if you don’t like your life fuck with a nigga from New York
The instincts we got is to shoot first then talk
But what seems to always gives us away is our ""niggery"" walk
And I speak from experience, so pleader take heed to advice
We sellin guns and drugs and sex or anything for the right price
The crime rate’s so goddamn high, we had to name the shit twice
Cause tourists be scared to death to visit the criminal’s paradise
Home of bloodshed and tears and for souvenirs there’s fears
It appears nobody cares so say your prayers
Or you gonna get double crossed and set up, either head up or shut up
Cause bullets ain’t got no names and anybody could get wet up
And end up on the front page of the Daily News papers
But while crooks dressed in Brooks and behind  desks in skyscrapers
And I never bought no shit, but then I never took no shit
I’m a kleptomaniac, I think I got a fuckin' habit
So lick shot to all the boroughs and ghettos across the nation

The Tunnel,Wakedafucup,2014.0,"Yeah!, yeah
We take niggas back
You know what im saying?
It's sunday night
Westside Highway
27th and 12th avenue
The notorious
Home of the jux, home of the robbery, home of the bodies
The illest club in New York
The Tunnel

Yo! Let's take it back to the tunnel
Where the hoods will run upon you
For the jux son, as soon as they play ""Shook Ones""
The wars of Brooklyn, always roll deep ""Who Shot Ya""
Somebody getting rocked to sleep
Security making take your Timbs off in the winter
Had to walk through the metal detectors before you enter
When you get inside, might be a homicide
With that New York Hip Hop, somebody might get shot
This is where they snatch jewels, razors splash you
Flex screaming out in the club, don’t let em gas you
Niggas taking pictures of money you know, cash rules
Bitches giving head in the unisex bathroom
This is hell where the criminals dwell
Half the goons in the club just got home from jail
Other half couldn't come, cause they couldn't make bail
It's colder than westside
+It Ain't Hard to Tell+
In The Tunnel

The Tunnel
(Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel
(Let's take it way, way back)

Posted up, goons ferocious, jewels cold as fuck
Those who dream about scheming, we woke em up
My Fort Greene niggas was born to squeeze triggas
My Queen’s regime was at the bar deep chillin'
The tunnel was the place for all the street niggas
You know it's real, you can go in there, see people you know from jail
Home at last, hold the stacks and throw a hand
Moments of silence, Big L was always there
And Chris Lighty ran The Tunnel, he was the man
I seen Diddy by out the bar and shut it down
Please believe, free and Nitty didn't fuck around
I walk the crowd with timbs on, because my style
It's New York to the fullest, we don't bow
All these dudes who want the crown, are fuckin' clowns
The Tunnel was proof
Street niggas run this town!

Sticking niggas at The Tunnel was how I used to eat
Soon as you set foot on that cobblestone street
And this is the same spot where Hype shot Belly
You could get popped, end up getting shot in your belly
Come through stuntin' like your ass is bad
You’ll get juxed up, send out in a plastic bag
This the grimiest club in the whole city
I'm talking stick up kids, murderers, NYPD
Westside the 26th down to block from the projects
Just walk in to The Tunnel, you get shot up and Carjacked
I party with killers, rapers, and lifers
If it wasn’t for the bitches you would think it was Rikers
This back when, I never smiled a lot
Was on my NY State of mind shit, around the clock
And it wasn't just niggas from NYC
It was C.T, D.C, V.A, P.A, N.C, L.I, M.D, N.J
At The Tunnel!

Sticky, Mega, and Fredro Starr
Black ski masks, hoodies and crowbars
Hip Hop purists, prestige lyrical flow gods
Grew up in the tunnel we came here to expose y'all
To the most dangerous night club in the whole world
Unemployed, ex-con, thugs thuggin' with no job
Chains snatchers, stick up killers who came to gold rob
Pocket knife Gem Star boxcutters to blow y'all
Drug trafficking coke, pills, and hydro jars
Fly diva hoodrat dime bitches with no drawers
Fingerwaves, braids and shades giving out blowjobs
Rap around the corner the tunnel line was so long
Skip everybody, Brooklyn niggas was so strong
The ice grill era, face bite and get stoled on
Punch you in the face and give you a fuckin' nose job
These bougie clubs and day parties control y'all
The real recognize the real we don't even know y'all",https://genius.com/Onyx-the-tunnel-lyrics
Whut Whut,Wakedafucup,2014.0,"We comin' thru, coming thru
Like what, what
X4

I'm going in like a deep cut
Nigga better keep shut
Before you get your ass stomp down and get beat up
Watch how nigga's creep up, right up on your G, what
Rappers better get they security fucking beefed up
Straight up out the darkside, upper east barkside
Lookin' for a mark, nigga's coming out the archives
Attention so thick, you could cut it whith a sharp knife
Not to mention my clique, we starving apartheid

My middle name is fuck that, cause everything is fuck that
Imma bust first, and bet the nigga's won' bust back
Cause they be dead, trust that
Nigga kill a tough act
Cops kickin' down the door, the coke you better flush that
All you nigga's suspect, don't wanna make me upset
Pockets on full and it still ain't enough yet
I'll beat yo ass in public, nigga's better cut checks
I bring it to your face, and nigga's wanna change the subject
Whut!

I'm playin' with the chrome piece, waving at your dome, peace
Nigga when it's war, my soldiers don't condone peace
Have you where you can't even walk on your own street
Owe a nigga money they be runnin' in your home piece
Heat up in the north face, so don't need a north face
Screaming fuck the law, keep a gun, cause I lost faith
I'm a fucking lost case, forgot about my court case
Bodies in the trunk, we movin' cross the cross-state

Nigga on some real shit, I take you on a field trip
Bury you six feet, won't have a guilt trip
Do you in real quick, soft as a quilt kit
All my guns filled with hollows, leave you tilted
Tryin' to get a meal tick, if I gotta steal shit
I'm out of my mind, or I'm absolutely brilliant
I come with the ill shit, that nigga's can't deal with
When it's a full moon, that's when Sticky Fingaz kill shit",https://genius.com/Onyx-whut-whut-lyrics
Veronica,Shut ’Em Down,1998.0,"(Yo what's up baby?)

Muthafuckas is dead, son!
(Yo yo, calm down nigga, calm down!)

(Just tell me what happened, god.)

It had to be about eight o'clock (Uh huh, uh huh)
When niggas sprayed the block, it's mad hot
Yo half the spot got locked
(What? Who got shot?)
My little nigga Bill from down the hill
We had a one three five
I heard he might not survive (Aw, damn)
He caught one in his leg
Two shots hit him in his upper (What?)
Part of his chest, two inches above his vest
Heard you next (I'm next?)
That's the word in the projects
(What? Them niggas ain't no threat
They'll whole set'll get wet
Yo go get the AK, and my two nines with the silencers
And at seven thirty, y'all niggas meet me at Veronica's)
Aight, no doubt, yo be safe, yo nigga I'm out
{Let me talk to him, let me talk to him}
Yo yo Stick hold up, yo yo yo Stick, talk to Son
(Aight, aight) Don't even wet that done, yo I'm bringin mad guns
{Ay yo Stick, that's my word
It might be them niggas from Riverside
Cuz I heard they knew somethin
About how my little nigga died}
(Who who, little Dave with the red car?)
{Yeah, he had beef up there
With the same ones we seen at the strip arcade
With the scar by his head}
(Aight aight, get the big shit, no bullshit, it's time to flip
And I'll see y'all niggas later, be safe)
{No doubt, aight kid}
Then they jumped in the Expo
Aiyyo 
Son
 slow down, we got mad techs yo
Fuck that I'm vexed yo!
Yeah I know, I know but chill, let alone and chill
We meet the gods so we can bill on these niggas for real
It was a half an hour drive 'fore they finally arrive
Veronica came to the door, she smiled and said

Hi, hi! Step inside, get out the rain get dry
Sticky's in the back playing pool by the sauna

We stepped in the back all I smelled was marijuana
(Yo what's up?) Yo nigga what's up
(You know I don't give a fuck
Them niggas time's up
You got them two nines or what?)
No doubt, I bought it all out

Yo Stick, what's up with this bitch?

Wake up motherfuckers!

Oh shit! What did I see?
Five niggas pointin guns at me 
(.?.)
 and Sonsee
*Fuck that! Shut the fuck up!
Nigga get the fuck on the floor!*
Hit me dead in the jaw
With the chrome four four

Woke up the next mornin, couldn't hardly sleep last night
Oh shit my two nines is missin, wait something ain't right
Where the fuck that bitch go? Damn that ho!
Wait, I know, that bitch in the kitchen praly makin me something to eat
But still wearin my heat
Fuck it I'mma wake these niggas up so we can go hit the street
I went downstairs, couldn't believe my eyes
I seen Veronica with three guys twice my size
They all had guns but I was gatless
Last thing I saw was the kid with the scar
And then I seen blackness
Remember thinkin', how the fuck they know?

They tried to poison the fetus
We gonna check it out like this
All hail
The high exalted
Yo
My mother fucking name is Fredro Starr
You know what I'm saying?
I'm up here with my man Sonee the money the motherfucking Greeza
And my motherfucking nigga Sticky the fucking Fingaz
You know what I'm saying?
Yo Son
Step to your motherfucking business nigga...word up

I’m not the type to be flabbergasted, but all my 
data’s
 mastered
It ain’t a madder bastard, 
boom I had it
, niggas get plastered
Soon as I bring what I got in store for this war
Who want it? We got what you're looking for
Fuck ya gonna do now money?
Cause it’s the, Sonsee Seeza, Mr. Chocolate bust em like a blister
I get downright depriving on nigga’s   p-rop-z’s; gimme all of these
Ya’ll niggas is puss
What’s the matter, I thrust, bum rush and batterize and assault and catapult
Like a bolt I shock shit
The faker hurter, word to murder, ripping the madder shit to make you BACDAFUCUP further

Hold up the press, here comes the mess
Worship the best, or die like the rest
You have the right to remain violent
Anything you say can and will be used against you to kill
I’m a tyrant, striking like a viking
A knight in shining armor, death before dishonor
The ruff rhymer, suicidal like Nirvana
The end of your world is just beginning, there's no winning in my inning
Cause dead things cannot effect the living
So I drift into the winds of the ghetto bad weather
I’m lost in the desert but the storm blows me on
Never talk to a stranger, everybody’s in grave danger
Me and my peoples just shout out anger

Fuck that, we better off dead

I’m considered less than a God, but more than a man
I can knock down a mule like Conan the Barbarian
With my mental powers and my sixth sense
That can raise a dead crowd into a live audience
(so get the fuck out the way)
Or what? Get your ass cut
Cause if you goin to jail they’ll probably make a pussy out ya butt

No doubt
Here’s the clique which is known as a black stone
Hard
Fuck around and we’ll shatter your track bone
Scarred
You get for life, I’m concise, niggas get done up precise
Cut up fine and fucked up real nice
Be ready to meet your maker
And die like the Lakers
Faking jackers smack ‘em backwards with the front of the black gat tactics
Straight from the desert-(queens)
Where niggas is desperate
So I'm taking mines from the entrance to the exit
 (2X)
Get a life?
Fuck that, we better off dead

Cover me, I’m going in
Move ‘em in
Take em out in the time when niggas seem to always fight a lost battle
Its too late to pray I'm selling one way tickets to hell
""Now, run, tell"" is what you punk niggas yell like
Ahhhhh
That’s the sound of your bitch ass hurting
Blindside attack your back with Steel Curtain
Sticky come out, come out wherever you are

So now add all that up to the fact that I’m a nigga that could just beat your mother fucking ass
To hurt your feelings
Cause your shit is trash
‘Chu need people like me, cause they not worthy
Construct my coalition, it’s a demolition derby
To all the spit you talk make the mic smell like saliva
Yuck, you need to retire, resign
I’m ahead of my time, in my prime, one of a kind & out of my mind
And ain't nothing in this world free so me I’ma kick it paid style
I ain't got no smile, I was abused as a child
My moms gave birth to a crazy ass wild one
Bust out her pussy with a motherfucking gun
And started talking slang
Even joined a gang
In suicide scums
I sold jums to the bums
I was the hand to hand man pulling in crumbs
Then I started dealing, robbing and stealing
Got knocked for a killing now I’m known as a villain
So if you want problems I’m ready and willing
And I’ll get up in your mouth like a fucking filling

Judgment Night, HUH! HUH! HUH!
Judgment Night, in the echo of a gunblast
Judgment Night!!!
(Verse 1: Sonsee)
 over here and bust the mic crusher, sucker duster
Sonee Seeza the money greaser cooler than your freezer
(He's a breezer)
I hits it up; bam, boom, bing, slide
I seep through the crack and I make shit get wide
Bona fide art to start the part of a smart top chart seizure, this more than a leisure
Pinch every fuckin' grain in your brain like a tweezer
The sinister scene shaded the slick scheme theme for the misdemeanor offender
The back bender, the corny nigga, the bullshit riff-ender
Never perpetrating so ain’t no perping in the dark I'm lurking
Gears are working, niggas  hurting
Used to be a gambler when I was a scrambler
Now I'm branded a shorty black mic damager, whose just here to state my fact
And react
And saturate brains with a plate of hot wax
Intertwining, combining, underlining, shining Sonny's in light right now and wow, great timin'
(Hook)
(Verse 2: Fredro Starr)
Come inside, run and hide
It's the iller men, I'm drilling them with adrenalin half past the minimum for filling them with the ugliness ruggedness
Under the rug thugs in this, Freddy Scruggs loving this
Trapped in a daze, in a blaze, in a spell in a realm of a seance
With black ghosts with guns coming through the project walls with AKs
Through darker days
One dead to the sun
You really want some next shit?
Some blood on the X shit?
Watch me wreck shit then I exit
But yo I keep 'em hollering, screaming out for mercy
Mind of the lowest epitome, ghetto mentality
So blast it as I hit your head you're lead to misbelieving
Got the toxic rock shit made the nigga Biohazard

I swear to fuckin' god I'll raise hell and make the white man call me master
I'm 666 and need to repent to the pastor
So fuck the radio they closed your ears  but read my lips, I rips
And if you eat my words I'll leave you strung like
Um, um, um
It was on the tip of my tongue
But now it's stuck in between my throat
I can't breath for a lick
If Onyx ain’t the top pick, you must be suckin’ a glass dick
And if it takes the death of me to make history
The whole world will remember my misery
I know what I'm trying to say but words get in the way and render me speechless
Oh Black Jesus I'm crying inside
Couldn't give a fuck if I live or I died
Cause I'm just a slave who's brave
But fuck pickin' cotton, I'd rather see my grave, so I meditated before I was created
And the gift of the first power made me reincarnated
Now I'm back from the deceased but pussy niguz increase
Oh well, that's just another nigga that gotta get greased
So if you wanna talk shit in order to avoid a fight
Say what the fuck you wanna say, just spell my name right

Rob and Vic,Shut ’Em Down,1998.0,"It's a story about two brothers, Rob and Vic
Grew up in the world alone
God forgot about them, hmm
Forced to fend for themselves
In the Rotten Apples of New York City
This story takes place, in 1993
[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz, 
X-1
]
How many vigs did we get so far?
I couldn't care to count, just snatch 'em up quick
If he scream, I'mma put him out
I put the heat to his face to shut him up
So I can dig him out, went in his pockets
And got the cash in some big amounts
I looked him dead cold in his eyes without carin'
If money speak, that explain the voices I've been hearin'
You ain't really have to kill him
Yo God he moved, but I lied
Damn, there's our sixth stick-up turned homicide
So? That's the way our momma died
Is you with me? I'mma slide

So we slid, had to get our gameplan together
Cause this little bit of stickup loot ain't lastin us forever
Desperate, on the edge with no place to go
We can't go back to the hood we stuck up everyone we know

For the love of money!
People will rob from each other
For the love of money!
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money!
People will kill their own brother
[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz, 
X-1
]
Now everytime I hear a fuckin siren, my heart skip a beat
I'm paranoid, every face I see I think he after me
Supposedly
We was supposed to be gettin work from this large cat
But since we know where he rest at. We goin' Bogart!
Son frontin' so hard
Heard he had a hundred G's alone on his Gold Card
His crab wife showed me mad cash in her blouse
She said he the mad stash at the house
Couldn't pass up a jooks like this anyday
Anyway
On our way there I'm feelin' bad vibes
Yo kid don't say that
That's when we bumped heads
With vicks that we stuck from way back, up on Atlantic
The way them niggas lookin' God they drivin' mad frantic
Yo don't panic, trust me, I jump back and bust 
three
Shots through they windshield, they ain't wearin' shields
Hit the kid behind the steering wheel it's the way I feel
In a state to kill I wanna watch him die
Wait and chill, we got bigger fish to fry, two L’s later
In a Bed-Stuy elevator, got off the fifth floor
Water hit the skull, ready kick the door
Off the hinges
Bust shots by entrance
Only thing I saw was a nigga four-four
His gun jammed!
He tried to run and
Reach for a knife, shot him in the leg
So think about your life
And tell me where the loot's at
He said, “I'll tell you just don't shoot black!”
With the sight of fear, dragged him down six flight of stairs
To the basement, and in someway, he had a trap door in the pavement
Smacked him with the gun, kicked him out the way
Had to be at least five hundred K
Now hear come the bitch, talkin bout her share of the wealth
So we put her and the husband out and we went for self

For the love of money!
People will rob from each other
For the love of money!
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money!
People will kill their own brother
[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz, 
X-1
]
Yo, we fuckin came off! The plan was splendid
'Cept we got all this money, and can't even spend it
Shh, let's disappear and be outta this place
So much dirt and shit we did it's hard to show our face
So we bounced out of town and went down to Miami
Cause most those cats we crabbed was like family
Now me and you beefin', nah it can't be true
It all started when all we had was just me and you
Now a whole different person is what I'm startin' to see in you
'Member when we had the new Lex
With the two Techs,
 rollin' to the duplex, drinkin' Stout
Thinkin bout, what we gonna do next, we used to work tight
Half-assed cars, down to dirt bikes
Hopin everything will go right, with the snow white
And in number spots that flow all night
Up to this day it was all tight
Man, fuck that!
You my little brother and we came out the same pussy
But I'mma kill you, you dummy, you fucked up my money!
Nah, the money fucked you up
Tryin to say the money changed me?!
What you think, I'm your brother, you got a gun in my face see
How can one tiny mistake, make you wanna erase me
Fuck that! You cut a side deal, that's why they raided the block
Now how the fuck I'm 'sposed to know the undercover was a cop
Son you been fuckin' with them niggas!
Look just put down the gun and let this bullshit slide
Nigga I ain't puttin down shit
I'm tellin' you let's just chill man
Fuck that nigga!
It don't gotta be this way man!
What nigga?! It gotta be this way!
It don't gotta be like this man!
It gotta be nigga!
Then go ahead and pull the trigger!
Think I won't?! Fuck you!
You know you ain't gon' do it!
Fuck you!

No! No-o-o-o-o!
For the love of money!
People will rob from each other
For the love of money!
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money!
People will kill their own brother

Don't let money change you!",https://genius.com/Onyx-rob-and-vic-lyrics

Shit’ll hit the fan from the hand squeeze the trigger
Attack of the bald heads, sleep if ya wanna
Beds is burned, ya step to this you’ll be a goner
Bitch ass niggas not respected but neglected
Move on ‘em, move on ‘em things’ll get hectic
So watch ya pockets, hold ya, ho
Ya get hurt up, that’s the word up, fuckin’ with Fredro
Understand god damn, who the hell is that little ass man?
The kid with the scams for all the tight jams
Shootin’ at the stands, sometimes I grease the fans
Ain’t nothin’ worse than a bitch ass
Or which ass nigga that’s fakin,’ lies for attention'
Try to ride a nut for a scratch so stop itchin’
Wishin’ perhaps I play the right guard
Tryin’ to gain yards but I’ma hit ya with sacks
Two to the temple straight to the brain
So simple and plain, ain’t a mother fuckin’ thing change
But a hole in ya motherfuckin tank
I would like to thank my nigga
My nigga, my nigga

Smack the taste out ya motherfuckin’ mouth

I be with the crazy criminals from the pistol projects
Beatin ‘em down, who we suspect to fake moves
They play the bitch ass
Your choice is dead or death you choose
Make a bitch nigga silent as a bad case of strep throat
Wild crazy klepto keepin’ ‘em all petro
Duck kids on the block gettin’ hot with the rocks
When the time hit the clock I knock ‘em right out they Reeboks
That’s my word
I hit a slick city kid or a herb from the suburbs
Bullets can’t discriminate so I won’t either
Make you holier than a bible if you not a believer
This ya worst dream when ya face my team
Bend a bitch nigga over like the house of pain make ‘em scream
When I get you I say “Gimme that bitch ass
Slice ya throat with glass, get you a cast or a ditch fast”

Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bitch ass nigga
Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bitch ass nigga

Move back motherfuckers, the Onyx is here
My name is Sticky Fingaz, I’m the nigga in your nightmare
Forget the crowd cheers, I live off fears
It’s the beast in me, even the music couldn’t sooth me
It’ll take more than U-Haul if ya tryin’ to move me
Ya see I wrote the rhyme, but it’s the weed talkin’
(All ya bitch ass niggas best just keep walkin’)
Before I spit in ya face, Onyx is the master race
Ain’t nothing sweet about me G so stay in a child’s place
With God as my witness, I broke the law
And had bitch ass niggas in jail washin’ my drawers
Hit the floors and do crazy calisthenics
Then when they try to flip they take a trip to the paramedics
(Cause ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bitch ass nigga)
Talk a lot of shit, throw a punch and run
I have blood on my knife and a body on my gun
So listen up, son, don’t act wild
Or I’ll cramp ya style with a bullet and a smile

Cause ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bichasnigga

Yo

These streets is tryin to kill me
My best friend, could be my worst enemy, this game is deadly
This ghetto might murder me, or lock me up
Twenty-five to life, throw the key

You know what happens in the actions of the inner city tale
When your thoughts fail and have you scared to death
Biting off your fingernails, not enough, numbers on the weight scale
Got, niggas cuttin throat just to make sales
Even if it take the last of me I'mma fill my pockets to capacity
Anything that takes cash, fuck job huntin
Put on a face mask kid, I'm out to rob sum'in
If you home or not, I put the chrome to your knot
One shot to the side of your face, let me up inside of your place
Gimme the funds up out of the safe
Hit the fire escape, high-divin gates
Flyin from Jakes, I'm dyin for paint

These streets is tryin to kill me
My best friend, could be my worst enemy, this game is deadly
This ghetto might murder me, or lock me up
Twenty-five to life, throw the key

Yo, I'm caught up, stuck in the tangled web
Where they'd love to see me dead, mail my mom's my head
So the tricolored silenced Rugar stay off safe
To take off a face, just in case, a quiet lace
Plottin, for your knot-and, your spot-and, your block-and
Anything else, you got-ten, hopefully you stinkin' rotten
So eyes open, don't sleep
Cause once you do you goin deep, mo' money mo' heat
Police, wanna brutalize me to death
And my foes wanna see me lose all my breath
Maybe friends, come wanna merk me for my beans
And bitches that gave me skins, wanna watch my end
Cut open my chest, and see my heart
Pump the last ounce of life -- for livin, it's a price
Til then, when it's over, kamikaze
Strictly, I'm takin all you motherfuckers with me!

These streets is tryin to kill me
My best friend, could be my worst enemy, this game is deadly
This ghetto might murder me, or lock me up
Twenty-five to life, throw the key

When I die, I don't want none of my niggas to cry
Just dress me in a black suit, and a black tie
Pass me by to the darkest cloud in the sky
No time to waste, we got the drugs in the briefcase
We stickin up the whorehouse, we takin everything
We want the pussies to the diamond rings
You want the sun to shine? We want the rain to pour
Official Nast' to put your body on the floor
*BLAM BLAM* *BLAM*

OH SHIT I'm HIT! I'm HIT! They just shot me in the stomach!
UNNNGGGGGGHHHHH! *BLAM BLAM BLAM* *BLAM BLAM* Who want it who want it?
Niggas trying to kill me, and they caught me by surprise
That's when I blacked out, my life flashed before my eyes *glass breaking*

My whole life I ain't never give a shit
My mentality was *clip cocked into gun* get shot or gimme a Gam
If the gun ain't jam, I woulda bust you
I don't trust my own mother, how the FUCK I'mma trust you?
I did some things that I sorta regret
But I can't bring them niggas back kid they already wet
As a kid I went to jail cause I sold crack
I'm holdin trial in the streets cause I ain't tryin to go back

Oh SHIT! What happened?! Wait, now I 'member!
And where my gun??! I musta dropped it when I jumped out that window
*broken glass* Ahh, my stomach, where them niggas I don't see em
I gotta make it to the B-M, and try to stop this bleeding
I ain't trying to die, I got mad blood spilt
(""Aiyyo there that nigga go! Kill him!"") Oh shit! *BLAM*

I left behind a widow and a bastard kid
The streets was tryin to kill me, and it did

These streets is tryin to kill me
That's why I keep a Mac-Mil this shit is real to me
This shit is deadly, this ghetto might murder me
Or lock me up for twenty five to life throw the key, I'm low key
So niggas don't notice me, a half a key is worth
More than a pound of weed, I die for my seed
Kill for my family, fuck this world
Cause this world don't understand me, I'm sick mentally
I'm drinkin Hennessy, mixed with Tennessee
Shit is stressing me, niggas praying for the death of me
But til they bury me
When sixteen shots enter me

Cause in the streets I live through it, it’s more than music
Whatever I’m spittin’ on, I put my life into it
Got a reputation on the streets of keepin’ it rough
There’s just too many of us, you get rushed, you get bust
What! Big trucks, chrome rims spinnin’
The mad faced niggas got money so now we grinnin’
Pull your sticks out, we the group you listen to, kid!
Niggas told me my music helped ’em do a bid
I’m the voice of the ghetto, the heart of New York
A fiend will give his last hit, just to hear me talk
Niggas paid for their mistakes, death is the price

""Aight listen"" - Rakim
{*needle rips across a record*}

What’s the matter with my brain?
I can’t think clear, oh it’s the hair
Run and get the razor gotta make it disappear
There, now I got an open mind, plus some grease to give it shine

Bald heads and hoodies, black jeans and boots scuffed
Move by the millions and children stay rough for the
One for the road, sell outs 
get wetted
Wild to rip and conflicts get deaded
Gats and backwards baseball caps
When I react I set traps, no haps they get jacked

It's attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)

Most times I get dirty, down low
Scandalous, crazy conniving, wild, suckers know I’ll smoke em like the bloody buddah
Bless bald head style, 
triple zero
 against ya grain I shaved em close and nicked em
Cause it’s just another victim

Shhh, what, what’s up? Listen do you hear what I hear? 
Sounds like an intruder comin in the rear
 nah I wanna kick em
I got the Glock cocked I’m with it, now they gonna get it

I got ‘em, I shot ‘em, he hit rock bottom
I flip it, get wicked and wild when I spot em
DS knows best, yep I pack a heater
Twenty bags of cheeba, slow up ya damn speeder
 We rush on 'em hard (Bring 'em out dead!)
 Onyx rush on 'em hard (Bring 'em out dead!)
 Bald heads rush on 'em hard (Bring 'em out dead!)
 Stinkin, what the hell was they thinkin?

The bald heads..
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
.. bald headz, ATTACK!

I got news now,  for crews  no way no how
(So GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY NOW!)
Smooth as a baby’s ass, headed for the body blast buddy
Escaping through the ghetto, 
kicks muddy
Wilder than Wolverine, run with the scheme team, meaner than Mean Gene
Obscene and heads clean, so well aware, farewell
There goes the big bell, and that means see ya hate to be ya

My clean bean production, so damn disgusting
In the cut bust ya gut and head bustin
Ain’t no escapin the madface invasion
Hot ice and cold steel pressin up in your grill
Word to God I get odd, and even
Leave a punk dead out
Slice up the scalp, man I’ll leave ya head in shreds
Attack of the bald heads, attack of the bald heads

AIYYO!!! What's goin on with the world?
Yesterday, seen a bald head girl
WHAT? MOVE!! You heard what I said
I wouldn't be caught dead without a bald head
Make one false move and I'mma fill ya with lead
Cause there's enough dum-dum bullets for ya whole bum bum-rush crew, who should I do?
Attack of the bald heads, WE COMIN THROUGH!

Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads

2 Wrongs,All We Got Iz Us,1995.0,"Bottomline, overall we gotta get this motherfucking cash!
No doubt man, that's what I'm saying man
Illuminati I heard they trying to really just hold shit down
They trying to shut us down God!
They trying to shut us down, cause we rock, on the low

Two wrongs don't make it right but it damn sure make us even (7X)
Verse One: Fredro Starr
Fuck peace I want justice
I’m a nigga with a gun and a right mind to bust this, fuck this
I’m mad at the world hell, I got a vengeance
My first offense I caught the life or death sentence
The real black army’s in jail with no protection
It’s killing me calling these facilities correction
System that is getting us, come on my fellow prisoners
Time to go to war, we’ll be dead if we stay listeners
Time to get the tek and go step to the president
U.S.G. citizens, fuck American resident
And yeah I got a speech impediment
I speak slang, for my niggas who got hanged
{​*DJ cuts and scratches ""So throw ya gunz in the..""*}​
They say 'Throw Ya Gunz' was negative, I say fuck them
They the ones who put the guns in the ghetto for destruction
This is oppression, the deception, killing our own complexion
What we need to do is point the guns in the right direction

Verse Two: Sonsee
Yo it’s only getting worse, I’m a burst in controverse
And tell you where I’m from it’s the savage man they curse
It’s the illest, biggest, experiment. What are we guinea pigs in the cages of the projects?
Cause we the ones that’s feeling it
They gave us guns and drugs and watch us bug and rub each other out
So stop doing what they love
Retaliate, it's time to get big and bombard
And flip this shit like the Food of the Gods
They say we got the animal mentality, show them the raw reality
If you real, you ain’t mad at me
But if you is, so the fuck what?
Me and my peeps came to claim the brown man’s cut
Which was really ours; this the hour, better do what I do fuck those nuclear powers that be
We gotta form our own ground
Dominate, infiltrate, and feel great til it burns down
And when it burns, it’s going up in blazes
We gotta do what we shoulda fucking did since the dark ages

Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
I have a dream, that I must reveal
So I pinch myself to make sure it's real
First we gotta destroy and then rebuild
Even if it mean that I'mma get myself killed
Don't make me no difference, I done wrote my will
And talk about what they did to us is dumb
What we need to be talking about is what we gonna do to them
I’ll get revenge if it’s the last thing I do
When I start speaking in tongues the Holy Ghost couldn’t save you
So do you want answers?
Yeah I want answers, and I want the truth
You want the truth? You couldn’t handle the truth
Cause they got us brainwashed so we the minority
But when we kill em off we gonna be the majority
Preach on
See I was raised to fight for what I believe in
I won’t forget, can’t forget, I’m trying to get even
And if the whites speak up, then I'll lead my people
Cause two wrongs don't make it right, but it damn sure make us equal
I'm inciting riots, so let's start the looting
And whoever cross the walls I guess we'll just got to shoot them
Cause in this revolution I loathe my enemy
I'm agnostic plus I got no identity
So lovers of life don't keep your hopes up high (WHY?)
Cause it's just a matter of time before it's your turn to die
But until then, when you stop breathing
It's time to stand up and fight for what you believe in!!!!!",https://genius.com/Onyx-2-wrongs-lyrics

Know what I'm sayin? Lil sumptin Zoo York style we just vibin' Smoke mad L's, wide open, we gone vibe

I ain’t never had so many death threats in one year, but talk is cheap and it’s comin out my other ear
Cause as sure as there’s a devil in hell I’m still here
To come first but not least from the east so I'm here!
Cause that’s the last straw now your ass is mine
You bit off more than you can chew so now I gotta draw the line
See first of all we most definitely the number one with a bullet, Billboard category
And I got ESP, you’re barking up the wrong tree
But I’m not crazy, don’t flatter me
Or I’ll get arrested for assault and battery
And I can't stand cops; goddamn don't they annoy you?
I need to blow off some steam, let’s have a battle royal
And who’s my challengers? The more the merrier
No, not you, you’s an amateur, just empty the register
And if if was a fifth then we’d all be stoned
But if I don’t drink and drive then how the fuck I’ma get home?
Beats me
And I can’t stop smokin weed cause I ain’t no quitter
But since it’s killin my brain cells maybe I should reconsider
You wouldn’t dare
Nah, but all the non-fiction niggas is you in here?

Most def most def
Do we go all out?
Most def most def
Smoke blunts till we fall out
Most def most def
True indeed, no quest most def
Do you pack heat?
Most def most def
Do you know the street?
Most def most def
If you sleep you get beat, most definite
True indeed, no quest most def

Fredro Starr, I’m mad as hell, I bust a nigga ass, a mother fucker will swell
I rock the jail, jump bail and smoke the L
Come on make my day, come on, take me away
Yo F that bullshit, we rob and steal shit while niggas kill shit
The skills that light that spark the blunts that bite back
So break the buddah bone we get down to the gristle plus the marrow
Now ya fuckin lookin through the barrel
I get George the Animal, kick ass on annual, you need to read the Afficial Nast manual
Rubber check Charlie bouncin checks on your check list
The black vagina sexist here to set this
Eat ya ass for breakfast while you eat my dust plus I flex this
Afficial Nast niggas there is no doubt

Do you get cash?
Most def, most def
Do you think fast?
Most def, most def
Are you ready to blast?
Most def, most def
True indeed, no quest most def
Onyx is the best
Most def, most def
Cause our shit stay fresh
Most def, most def
Do we smoke stress?
Hells def
(A fight breaks out)

You got 1, 2, 3 MC's to rip mad degrees and then seize these G notes
I’ma drop the rope that makes MC's croak
Murder one wrote resulting he choked on my rhyme he tried to quote
Hope he don’t resuscitate tryin to repro-duplicate
The great one Sonee, rappers I humili-annihilate
The jig is up
I’m gettin up my weight there’s loot to take and none of my victims will recuperate
I got too much getaway style to be seen on any trial
I’m a drifter keepin shit harder than five penals  nigga
If a punk sorry excuse of an emcee step to Sonee it’s R-I-Pieces
Believe it's, the heaters, the one it’s the Sonee
Sees the paper I gotta get it, I’m addicted
Grabbin assets I dig down pockets all the way to your goddamn ankles
Give me all that green stink shit, thank you
Smellin those crispy bills gives me chills in my soul
Before I know I’m outta control
Gimme a joint to hold and watch and learn asshole
Lights, cameras, action, where’s the L’s? Roll em
Debts I’m owed them, eyes I swollen, spots I hold em up
And I can’t give a fuck at times when I struck no luck
But if I ever got jammed for a scheme I’ma scram
I’m goin out like O.J. but I’m stayin on the lam",https://genius.com/Onyx-most-def-lyrics
Purse Snatchaz,All We Got Iz Us,1995,"There’s no sunshine in the city
That’s the way it’s goin down
People killing, people dying every time I turn around
There's no sunshine...

I run with purse snatchers, drug dealers and trespassers
Incriminators, and parole violators
I raided with regulators, invaded the instigators
Passed the procrastinators, rolled on retaliators
Broke in a home with burglars, partied with murderers
Ghetto big wheelers, I sold coke for dope dealers
Ask the stash dealers, harass the cash peelers
Did time behind bars, riding in stolen cars
Forty-deuce flicks
  posing hard, rollin large
Pick pockets I picked, pistol packers to bitch smackers, back of the alley attackers, waiting for the crackers
Smugglers, muggers in the gutters with rug cutters
Running up on niggas for butter leathers or whatever
Chain takers, train hoppers, clockers, block watchers, cops and robbers
Big hitters, counterfeiters, quitters, money getters
The beaters with heaters, the bleeders, the speeders, and 2 seaters
Crime testers and crime confessors, yeah peer pressures
My guess is as good as yours why niggas be taking drawers
Rapers and zipper rippers
Fake rappers and over actors
Bottle throwers, the buddha growers, high rollers, cigar smoke blowers
Bowlers, pool players, slashers, bashers, crusaders
Hallway solicitors pulling out on project visitors
Schemers and scandalers, big dreamers and pan handlers
Ready to run up on a Rockefeller
Put the Glock in the teller and tell the bitch to give it up
Hurry up, hurry up


To me, 
USG
 living, is one gigantic ring of concealing
Double dealing, drug fiending, selling and scheming on the next being
Fleeing from the cops, court proceedings
Illegal operating, law violating and death escalating
We all need our dollars straighten but we can't be tolerating
Man that's frustrating, that's why we be demonstrating
How we be law breaking, cash taking, drug juggling hand to hand
Stand and lookout, many struck out to keep from struggling
Embezzling, extorting, man slaughter and assaulting
Mass shootings, ‘nuff stabbings, gangs feuding and females boosting
For child supporting, or self done abortion
Everything costing, we all lusting for this fortune
So we'll still be rowdy and rioting and looting
And regrouping until we see some more improving
It'll be mad human deletion, seeking completion
Why nigga?
Cuz every day is killing season


I pledge allegiance to the streets and blame God for the creation
Of this pitiful earth that's filled with temptation
(Birth) was my invitation, (death) will be my initiation
Now I just got off probation, so wish me congratulation
But I'm still under investigation, for psychic evaluation
Facin incarceration and isolation over some color discrimination
So I need your participation in the caucasian assassination
Time is wastin, it's a sticky situation!
Tryna stop our reproduction, to kill off our population
And it's no exaggeration, so whoever's in association
With the nigga retaliation I need your total cooperation
We in hours of desperation,
 
and for your information
A confrontation will be fought by (THE YOUNGER GENERATION!)
Cause we got determination, now all we need is organization
So I use my concentration with a Jim Crow education
(Cause) if history repeats itself your destination's the plantation
To overcome this observation depends upon the communication
Then without an explanation a hesitation will have a reservation to be lynched from a tree for decoration
So, because of these altercations we need to make some alterations
Let’s begin with the manipulation of this whole Goddamned nation
Hold up it’s time for my medication so it’s the end of your conversation",https://genius.com/Onyx-purse-snatchaz-lyrics

Niggas should have known not to trust that bitch

If I was you, I wouldn't piss off them gods
Cause they hit you with their pistols and they stick you with them knives
Whacha sniffin' crystal while you twitchin' with yo eye
Niggas ride  stitches for they eye
If you snitch you get sentenced quick, me and my conscious
Bitch niggas must be on barbiturates
Caught you with that bitch you with, six what I hit you with
The more people you fuck over,  the more is you get
Don;t get caught up in a situation
Get stuck while you sit and waitin'
And the bitch you datin'
Just a stipulation of the chick you scrapin'
Or the one you holdin' hands, or that bitch you matin'
You proud to be, see, my first bitch, she lied to me
Found out all the shit she hide from me
The whole time, though this chick was gonna ride for me
I put the gun to the head, let her die with me
 (x4)

Since the day we met, I don't even ride with you
Fuck , you kiddin'?! I would die for you
I used to love you, bitch, but I can't love you no more
What you parading around town like some goddamn whore?
You cheated on me, you wasn't loyal at all!
If anybody gave you some rap, you gave him the drawers
It's no wonder you got raped by a pack of niggas
Now with these all you is is just ass and titties
Used to sound so beautiful, used to feel pure, used to make me feel good about going in raw
But you ain't been the same er'since you move down south
Heard a bunch of ATL niggas champed  you out
I got pictures, videos, tweets won't quit
Even heard you been suckin' some R&B dick
Damn, you was my hip-hop bitch

Baldheads and guns blaw
Where you gonna run say ah, oh
Which way did he go? You don't know
You move too slow, boy you blow
My style grows on you like hair
Where my Queens niggas? We right here
Is you out there? Yeah

Just watch us spark this hit and get ill
We won't yield til we hit  50 bil
So grab a hold, get a grip, it's time to shake it up
For rappers and routines that make bricks

Amnesia couldn’t make me forget about where I came from
And even if I left the slum I’d still be a hoodlum
Cause good things come to those who take ‘em
And I'm fed up and filled with so much anxiety I gotta scream
To let out all this frustration that's built up inside of me

Come on and scream and shout, just let it all out

These M.C.'s shoulda rehearse
They keep comin around like auto-reverse
For them our shit’s the worst
We disperse and then they hurt
But first to cut, then I burst they verse to quench my thirst

I made mad money but I spent it, now I'm broke
So I'm searching for somebody to put in a chokehold
And I can't wait to wrap my bare hands around they neck
And squeeze until I fuckin strangle 'em to death

Yo, you smell that?
Yeah, that's me, I'm the shit
I'm in effect like WIC checks  and you a TEC without the clip
There goes my rhyme again, pass me my Heineken
Where’s the weed? I need it, it’s my vitamin
So light it then get high
Reach for the sky, you won't survive, you won't get by, you gotta die
Your style is a gimmick and you know that you can't be what we be
We Afficial Nastee Niguz


When I was born I never thought that I could be like that
Growing up in the back block, selling crack rocks to black cops
I pack, cock Glocks and clock phat knots
Nickel and dime, petty crimes, packing plenty nines and knives to stay alive
Surviving and getting mine
Thoughts of the ghetto minds said fuck the books
See I’d rather run the street and fuck around with the crooks
And got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and deffer and better
This is my bread and butter my brother word to mother

More niggas grab the mics, talking 'bout they gonna set it
When all the rhymes you make is fake as synthetics
We just dead it, plus your style is old as a relic
So burn em up money, cause you gets no credit
You want it? Here it go
Nigga know the Armee, or we gonna be on the straight d-low banging M.C.'s
So keep it live up in here
I swear nothing less, we possess your best record buy
Most Def, Most Def

Sticky Fingaz, earn money from mugging on trains
Where I grew up in Brooklyn New York, moved to Queens in my teens
My pants are busting out the seams with this gun in my jeans
Without it I wouldn’t’ve lived this long in my wildest dreams
And I'm a star, my spotlight’s police high beams

As I be gradually (distorted) like (gunshot)
Glowin, blowin, flowin, goin, fast at it like Jesse Owens
Make you throw in, the towel, I will
Do all sorts of moves through all sports
Rhymes blew all thoughts, all crews to dust, it's us

Fire flee up on your clothes
And like 'squito up on your ho
In case you didn't know, I stay free flow

For every bitch that show me love, two bitches tryin to take me

Your insides cryin, rip your outside in

About my no low, I never drive slo-mo
Faster than Go Go, if it ain't me it's so so
Kick in your door, wavin the four four

Hit you with the low blow, you can't go toe toe
I rub elbow, with niggas in cell blo', and New York City hellhole

I'm on a run, I'm a fugitive, play low key
Broke out of jail, they ain't built a cell that could hold me
I help from the inside, escaped through the sewers
Swim a mile and a half, almost drowned in manure
I had to lose my scent, cuz I know they got the dogs out
I ain't going back, fuck that, I'm going all out
Cops won't be happy, till I'm inside of the ground
See a freeway, I need to hitch a ride to town
That's my only chance, jump in front of a car like a dummy
He slammed on his brakes and stopped two inches from me
Jumped out the whip like you aight, you aight??
And took his car and his wallet without much of a fight
Ran through a light, crash right through a roadblock
Almost spun out, fuckin' ran over 4 cops
The heat is on, I ain't trynna let these pigs get me
The A the only thing between me and the city


For all the pain, nigga smoke gas
Another night with the smoke from the tear gas
Yo we mobbin'
Niggas got gas masks, cops comin' duh
Niggas gotta tear'd ass, they wanna put
Handcuffs on my black wrists
You better know what the patriot act is
Federalies got my name on a blacklist
They wanna see a nigga fry like catfish
In the streets niggas dyin' like it's deathrow
Hundred mad till the very last breath yo
On some real shit, I don't give a F yo

5 am cops at my door
Best go find out what they knocking for
This could be problem we couldn't afford
But they won't find the dope cause it's under the floor
Looking at my Rolly, it's about that time
Before I leave the crib I gotta cock that nine
We roll deep, need two or three sprinters
Looking like the Last Supper when we eat dinner
Paparazzi make me lose my cool
Don't try to play me cause I'm not that dude
Fuck the law cause my name ain't Jude
I'ma a born leader, I don't follow the rules

I got a short fuse
My sticky fingers, I leave your face bruised
Who can pay when a nigga pay dues
Ain't no way, ain't no way we can lose
I'm a watermelon, chicken eating, blunt smoking, Henny drinking
Gun toting, always creeping, dice rolling, now we scheming
Might blow for any reason

Double crossing, don't believe it
Still battling inner demons

Weed in the telly, that's another 250
Wet towels at the door but the weed was too piffy

I'm a problem child, I be throwing tantrums
Drank too much and threw up in the Phantom
I'm known for coming up with anthems
That make niggas start throwing up their handguns
Don't get my way, I start stomping my feet
Having a fit, breaking everything in my reach
I gotta breath deep and count to ten
1, 2, 3 fuck that shit

I burn you like raw sex, you just a small threat
Wit a small set, so forfeit, I'm out for more checks
Cuz whatever that it takes to make these papes, I'mma walk this
I'm worthless, I'm back to sellin cracks behind the churches
I hurt this when I work this, I’ll beat you fuckin senseless
Cause sleepin on the benches got me swingin at the fences
I bring it down like gravity with a ghetto mentality
To feel the agony of the Afficial Nastee Armee strategy

The city never sleeps, so don't sleep on us
I put niggas to rust when my gun bust and plus you get rushed
And when the pressure’s on you just bitch up
If you had plans on conquering this you need to switch up
Get up
Nigga you shoulda got up, obey my orders cause shit like that’ll leave you shot up
It’s a dead man’s party leave your body at the door
Unlawful entry, my introduction to the century
An entity is what I plan to be in the industry, enemies in my vicinities
Get assassinated like a Kennedy, my gat's the foolproof remedy

It’s Sonsee, black, I’m pullin ya bad news out the pocket of my khaki’s
Attack me you get splashed; Afficial Nastee back me
So what the fuck is wrong with your dumb ass?
Trying to put shit on our name, you gonna get numb fast
This rap industry can do without ya
But I’ll haul off and smack the dog shit out ya
Look and see my image again when you start hemorrhaging the deal
It’s cloggin up what? The blood he didn’t spill
It’s massive, disastrous, plenty closed caskets
And as this world turn we burn crews to ashes
Niggas tanks is empty, so get gassed up and smashed up
That’s my word! Come with that bullshit and that’s that ass yup

Getto mentalitee

I trash niggas who can’t speak what I’m sayin
All City, Mega bomb, I ain’t playin
Just slayin emcees and makin niggas freeze with all these lyrics for me to squeeze
Niggas please don’t test me, just let me be with my city
Nastee, Officially keepin niggas wit me to hit me with the Ballantine  40’s
And bag the bad shorties
I got drafted because the fuckin Armee caught me
And it’s all out war, niggas fall out for reasons now known
Check this shit, I got the illest, the realist, hard for kids to kill this
Until it’s, my turn to fall I’ma fill this brick wall to keep the crabs out of my sector
Injector, and I’m correct the J Mega

The hell with wounds, I won’t leave a scratch to patch
This is war, way worse than a grudge match
Big P.I., no one’s bolder, a universal solider
Chump, shoulda listen when I told ya
I'm ill, like fire marshall Bill, insane
Flip, squash and kill lyrics burn like acid rain
Born in the gutter, buck wild, far from butter
A bugged thug I used to mug with the rug cutter
Rugged and raw, gritty cause I’m hardcore
More mighty than Thor, always aiming for a faggot jaw
So hard rocks that’s fillin’ flocks, clear the block
My mic’s a Glock, I keep plenty styles in stock
The way emcees react when I attack
Get me away from him, he’s a maniac

It's a conspiracy, I've been framed
They call me Nigga so much, startin to think it's my name
Light skinned and ashamed, cuz way back in the days
They raped my grandmother's mothers, when they was enslaved
They hung my grandfather if he misbehaved
But my ancestors was brave and most of them real
Stronghard black sweaty slaves workin in the fields
Four hundred years later, I learned about my roots
And how they traded in they white sheets, for badges and blue suits
So I’m taking recruits to set the fuckin score right and start a fight
A fight, a nigga and a white, and if the nigga don’t win then we all jump in",https://genius.com/Onyx-getto-mentalitee-lyrics
Here ‘N’ Now,Bacdafucup,1993.0,"Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all

Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all
Knock 'em out and tell them what we all about!

Here and now I got what you want so come and get a sip
So I can rip scripts of lyrics makin MC’s feel it
I’m devious, devastating, furious and I can mess you up somethin ludicrous
Ain’t nothing you can do to this
Stop the huffin and puffin I’m snuffin niggas out
I’m makin them stiff and fillin ‘em with lead
Stuffin bloody bloody bloody blood clot that I am not
Left kids in a stack with the big phat sixteen shot, duke listen
Kids is missin in action and that’s not faction, fiction
Eliminate suckers with 
snub traction
Cause I gets the chills on a mid-summer night
Yeah I could fight or in the winter I’ll make your ass hot like a light
Bulb rub a dub dub, three bodies in a tub
OK, go get the men, with the white gloves
You can call it business, or um, personal
Onyx is burstin whoever want to feel the terror
And to all ya’ll crews, whatever
Cause the place is here, and the time is now
Chorus: Sonee Seeza
The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) ..

At night time I kill ‘em bloody, I’m a canine
Search and find the dead mindful blast fast
Roughin ‘em up, toughen ‘em up as as it is it what was a damn murder?
Dead as a dog’s dick, I drag
A drastic ass kick or bacdafucup the ass kick
Blast with my strick-9 rhymes
Crimes is crazy, easy baby, mess around get drowned
And have that ass in Baisley
Props is props, unorthodox so watch
Where we live we get beat up by cops
But that can’t stop the kids who stole hip hop
Roof to roof top, drop the anchor
Dead! Dead on arrival forget the fame
The game is survival, you know my name
I throw blows in the world of the rap war
Tap jaws of crews, bruise ‘em on tour
Chorus:Fredro Starr
And the place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

I’ve come to suck your blood upon the microphone
Gaze deep into my eyes, I’ll make you turn to stone
It'll be Night of the Walking Dead if you don’t leave me the hell alone
Cause rap ain’t no game, but I’m playin for keeps
I live in the rotten apple, the city that never sleeps
Stop, you tried to steal my style and got spotted
Niggas can’t get it, cause niggas ain’t got it
Been a bald head since the age of ten
Plus I’m a ruthless crook and I was born in Brooklyn
So a stick up, it’s a piece of cake
For the kid with the sticky fingers everything I touch I take
So don’t make me angry, you won’t like me when I’m angry
All that frustration starts to change me
Then I scream 'til my voice gets hoarse
It’s time to face the music and the Red Cross
You can fool some of the people some of the time
The beats gets the heart, and the words get the mind
I’m livin proof there’s no hope for mankind
Chorus: Sticky Fingaz
The place is where (here), and now is the time
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

Point blank range, I take aim, blow your brain out the frame
Eight shots'll touch ya, spit ya physical structure
Motherfucker this is lyrical destruction
Path of disaster face Nast, comin at cha full blast
And capture grabs your last, breath like the asthma
Couldn't care less, you approachin near death

Trapped in America, assassinate your character, slaughter ya
Twenty more holes, in your Nautica, FUCK ALL OF YA!

Livin like a nigga with six months to live
On the edge of life, wouldn't think twice, to make a SACRIFICE

Tear his ass to his spleen, this is Suicide Queens
Where gats bust, cutthroat, cross collateral

I never fuck pussy that's yeast infected
Fuck a brain fry, make me think irrational
If I even think you schemin, YOU KNOW I'M BLASTIN YOU
I'm too raw; what is you - out you gourd?
I cut through any challenger, top notch or amateur
You'd rather be in the projects butt-ass with a hundred G's cash
And no gun, than to fuck with Sticky, Fredro 'n Son
You lookin at one desperate nigga, you shouldn't mess with
I had a doctor scared to remove a bullet from yo' intestine
'Member when I tested, this nigga manhood
To see if he was a true nigga, so I pulled out my gun
Gave some dramatic ass speech then, pulled the trigger
{*CLICK*} Ha hah! Barrel empty, joke on you Jack
He cold pissed his pants, blew his cover, he a New Jack
You know where I'm comin from, most my niggas pump 'n jump
And when it's time to dump and run, I never jump the gun
Or get cold feet, I hold heat
Y'a niggas don't know me; in six hours I made up four years
Got high shit for your ears;
Sorry somethin that I never felt yo, fingertips made of Velcro
You talkin shit like it's a little game
That's now how we get down - 'beef' is my middle name
So don't die over nonsense, I ain't got no conscience
Come out your face you gettin shot
Everything I'm spittin hot - I need fame without the bread
Like I need a hole in the head
Add insult to injury, you can't fuck with me
Guess that's not your cup of tea - I'm every star I meet
If you are what you eat, fuck the rookies, rejects
Plainclothes and detect's
I had a hard life, grew up too quick
But kept it tight with my true click, startin a new flip
Fuck you frontin for?  I seen your bag
With your tail between your leg
Afficial Nast in the house that mean you DEAD!

You takin a RIDE, in the ambulance, you catch mad damages
Cock the hammer shit, leave you Los(t) like Angeles
You ain't brick, or stucco, or paper machete
Whatever you got, get taken away, YOU'RE BAKIN TODAY
Trust that, it's time to crush cats, when I bust raps
I rush tracks, and oft' act, BUCKWILD!
Army comin through here nigga, TRUCK STYLE!
FUCK YOU! FUCK THE JUDGE! FUCK TRIAL!
I'm givin niggas shattered egos, I keep foes
Or a pet bet they small threat, MAKE 'EM EAT THOSE!
Deep goes my depth, sleep hoes get wet
If that ain't enough, we come through and hose your shit
Hit you with the FIREWORKS, you see the stars BANGIN
I really BANG YOU, and prepare you for God's ANGELS
It's not on humble, but some shit you can't come through

With nervousness, for your services

Cause they up to no good, fuck the dirty cops
Wanna slam me on the hood, dirty cops
Tried to rob me for my rights but I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know

I'm on the block with a couple racks on me
Dirty cop tried to put a couple packs on me
Use his 
knife stick
 to fuckin beat the black off me
Then I ran, bumped him made him spill his black coffee
Better back the fuck off me, I know my rights
Sais
 the kid had a gun and ya know that's hype
Tried to throw me on the ground on a cold ass night
But fuck a dirty, cop you know that's right
They only make like twenty three a hour
At the chinese spot, always eatin sweet and sour
This where you find the cops, in hot pursuit
Late night tryin to find a prostitute


Dirty cops is good if you pay 'em off
Cause they could kill a nigga they won't even lay him off
Tryin to plant drugs so they could send them way up north
Keep the money comin in it's like sprayin off
Cause you see, police won't bug a nigga
Won't fuck with me but put the drugs on another nigga
But miss a payment, then find yo' ass up the river
Keep my dirty cops paid off like whattup my nigga?!
If it's there word against yours, then dead it
Now you got a felony and a court case schedule
Get a good lawyer my nigga is what you better do
Should've paid the dirty cop now you in federal


Yo you dirty cops on the block watchin with binoculars
Wanna talk to us well piggy we ain't tryin to talk to ya
It's obvious you really got the low low on my shirt
Actin like you tough cause you know your a homo when it hurts
See you robbin drugs at work so you could sling 'em on the side
Pull me over with no warrant to investigate my ride
But I know my fuckin rights so I ain't lettin you inside
Every time you write a statement yo I'm bettin it you lied
You the, only motherfucker let you serve and protect
Walkin with your chest out like you deserve the respect
All the laws that you push you got the nerve to forget
Tried to arrest me for this verse cause every word is a threat

Get ya hustle on, go 'head
Get ya hustle on, y'all go 'head
Late night hustling, Im caught up in the hustle

Three a.m. - hustling hours
You better get your money, you ain't fucking with ours
We built it up from the ground up, like the towers
Keep it uncut, we don't fuck with the flour
Late night dope sales, open door sales
Homes in the hotel, cope with cartels
Oh well, the feds ridin' my coattails
Throw away the key, throwing me in the cold cell
United States Ghetto getting money out the state
First week strong, a hundred thousand at the gate
Ain't no love in the street, my thugs throwing slugs where you sleep
And niggas pull the rug from your feet
South side, nigga, from the heart like, 'what up?'
Dark side, one thirsty first so blood up
Homie got sent to the isle up north
Bet it ends up being no talking, head up and shut up

Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Go 'head, get your hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Better get your money, you ain't touching ours
Hustle hard
Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Go 'head, get your hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Hustle hard
Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Better get your money, you ain't touching ours

All I sell is cocaine, I'm a drug dealer
Nah for real, I'm a motherfucking drug dealer
By my work soft, cook that up
You need a nine, straight drop, I hook that up
I gotta streets keep calling, it's off to me to quit
Just when I think I'm out, they need a brick
Back to the hood again, all black hood again
When I'm round the fiends, know the coke good again
My hours is from twelve to twelve and
365, 24/7 I'm selling
I get a rush just bagging that cane
Smoking Mary Jane, packing that thing
All I do is hustle, fuck a 9 to 5
Start at 9, make 6 by 5
It's an all day process, even on a Sunday
Koran on the dashboard, bring you what you ask for


Niggas got shooters, got hoes, got hammers for sale
Got coke, got weed, got grams and scale
Got anything you need, ain't no way in hell
There's something money can't buy even in jail
In these streets i'm the landlord, niggas gotta pay rent
Live on the top floor but came from the basement
Niggas try to come at me, foul, catch a flagrant
Hustle so hard I don't know where the day went
Move work turn bricks to bags, get fixed for cash
Even did some licks for laughs
Chicks on smash, selling pussy, pimp that ass
Kids with masks demanding where you hid the stash",https://genius.com/Onyx-hustlin-hours-lyrics

Oh, shit!
Yo, y’knahmsayin?
That shit just shot duke in the face

Nigga gotta be dead
Fuck that then, let’s rob that nigga, man
Take that nigga watch and get the fuck out of here
Fuck him!
(Aiyo, young brothers out there)
(Shouldn't be sticking up people y’know?)

Gimme the money, gimme the money
Here comes Sonee the greaser
Seize the hostages
My conscience keeps tellin’ me I should just
Hit ’em high, hit ’em low
Everywhere I go there’s no
Coppers could stop us
The pros, our motto is

Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

8 o’clock in the morning time to wake up
Another brother getting paid in a way it’s a stick up
No time to even take a bath
Strictly cash tax free quick fast
Grab my Polo, jumped in the Timberland boots
I got Audi, time to get rowdy
Shiftee, low down gritty and grimy
I guess I got to find my crimey
Sticky Fingaz, yo, that Sticky Fingaz
Jetted to the ave in a half of a second
He wasn’t at the spot so the stop I was checkin’
Met him on the way, tucked away was the weapon

Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

Single handed me and Mickey Billy took a trip to Linden
Picked up some cheeba and brew, yo what else we need? (Nothin’)
Now we on the E-train back to Archer and (Sutphin)
Oops, it’s our stop, the 40-deuce get loose
See three other trooper and they tried to call a truce
One had a link, the other a goose
You know what we took and you know what we left
But the third one played a punk, he dissed his posse and stepped
With Sticky on the loose there was nothing he could do
So I pulled out the old taped-up .22
But that was only petty, skills a Philly get ready

Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

Yeah-yeah, hand over the money
Don’t get like “doc, what’s up, doc?” This is Muggs Bunny
Ain’t nuttin’ funny, ha it’s a stick up
Sticky got sticky and tricky with the wallet
But this ain’t El Segundo
It’s just the four, bad, brothers from the ghetto

Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

You could feel the place rumbling
Got it tumbling
We 'gon back it up, make it come again
We're coming in
You can feel the bass rumbling
Got it tumbling
Niggas jumping up, we got it dumb again
Time to throw your guns again
Shots for the dead and gone
Niggas dead wrong took your chain
You got deaded on
Broke killers, dope dealers, what I'm repping for
Them broke niggas, that's why I keep a weapon for
I keep repping 'til I get reprimanded
Way I shoot with the left, niggas think I'm left-handed
Niggas get left stranded with the TEC-9
When I connect 9, leave your body laying to collect time
Never let nobody disrespect mine
Watch the way you walk, when you hit me on direct lines
Cause anything you say, can and will be used against you
And this that gangsta shit, that you don't wanna get into

Fuck all this rhetoric
Gunshots let it rip
A steel plated point blank
Vest is what you better get
Death is how we settle it, fuck your confederate
20 years later same nigga, just a better whip
Y'all niggas delicate, one hit your head a split
I don't work for peanuts
I'm a tiger, not an elephant!
But for nothing I set it quick just for the hell of it!
Just to beat your ass is worse than out-of-court settlement
Ain't nothing changed but the Glock and the caliber
You funny ass niggas is not in my caliber
Coming at me crazy you get popped in the cabbage, bruh
Niggas need to stop, before I ""cock back"" the hammer, BUCK!
I scream so much, I type in all caps
You couldn't fuck with me, if I was writing your raps
You wouldn't know gangsta shit if it fell right in your lap

As a people as the police do daily

Ayo the world’s in a crisis, ISIS
Shit is cold as ice is, where the fuck Christ is?
Political activists like Mark Dice’s
We law breakin’, run in the stores takin’
TV’s and playstation, a slave nation
We doom on the bloomberg, we’re just the bullies
We’re the Giuliani, we get no respect
They put guns in the hood, what you expect
Like a pack of cigarettes, I can get me a Tec
And a four fifth, they don’t wanna go to war with
Rap music, what we bangin’ at the law with
So keep your Glocks high, aim for the ceilin’
Here comes them villains, gotta stop police killin’
So pardon me, as I blast this, fuck throwing a black fist

I'm a convict believe me you’re one too
We convicts, can't leave unless your passport approved
Who is you, fuck the rules, fuck the news, it’s a lie
If you’re ready to make your move let out two in the sky
They gon’ have to call the national guard
Smashin’ ’em hard, you gon’ get sent back to your god
Can’t let these motherfuckers send me back to the yard
If I got a hundred million niggas with me, that could be hard
Cuz I just gotta pick the guns up, to make ’em put the guns down
Enough is enough is enough, black kids gettin’ gunned down
Wherever is your son now, the system corrupt
And when the sun down, you know that the shit gon’ erupt

Every night I’m gettin’ stop-and-frisk
When I walk in the drugstore they think I’m here to shoplift
I’m just pickin’ up Percocet prescriptions
Cops always tell me that I fit the descriptions
So what, I got prior convictions
And can’t leave the house less it’s under conditions
In other words, I’m a changed man, but they think
I’m doin’ crime every time money exchanges hands
I’ve never been on Gangland, got tats on my neck
And they think i’m in a gang, damn!
So what I got on blue laces? And I’m fightin’
For my life, cuz a nigga got two cases
I guess I got these crackers shook

Ah, and we do it like this
Ah, and we do it like this
Ah, and we do it like this

Days like scenery rap in our radar
Got no time, my problem is debater
Due to circumstances my mind trip
Grab a stage and puff, puff that spliff
Dance with the ladies, fellas and kin
The one who claims is not your friend
To be concerned of taking a earn
No use in cheating, and don’t you act stern
Mindless brother going to rot
A freshly dip from that old rap pot
The big bang theory marching our theory
A mother's heart is a heart that's weary
All show-stoppers, national known
Better hold yours cause I'm holding my own

Some say Ty, some say Tyrone


Well, here's a little something for you all to learn
Money to make, cheeba to burn
First you feel the high then you feel the low
Down on your luck and you know how it goes
Now you sitting down at home watching cartoons
Fred Flinstone, Tom & Jerry too
Had three kids and a beautiful wife
But then you went crazy and stabbed them with a knife
Now you sitting in a jail sitting in a cell
Feeling fired up, but you going through hell
Oh, I'm that brother that makes you all shiver
I'm the MC that always deliver


I’m a smooth fellow, back is not yellow
Playing it safe like a game of othello
Mellow as a cello, never bulges like Jello
Papa got a 40, I sip on my mellow
Put it in a order,  slaughter
Jimmy had a nickel, Fredro had a quarter
Start moving, rappers is improving
Party so loud the mannequins start moving
People are enjoying jiving around
A country sound that’ll make you get down


Check me out to distinguish, all the time genius
Hit 
suave
 

Tryna get small
Better dress warm cause a brother like me takes the place by storm
Leaving no ends for brothers I doubt
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
Should respect like the Pope and leave your mouth open
Pull the biggest drive cause I got the longest rope in


Check it out everybody, a new fly tune

People, people jumping around
People, people getting down
But all they hearing is my high tune sounds
Back in the days, people used to say
That's the crew was lazy
But then he got a gun, had him on the run
Now they calling him crazy


Check one, we don't care how we gon' slay it
What to learn and what to obey
How to feel great when you’re feeling blue
What to do when your day is through
My nigga make, make things to get
Yeah, it’s time to get righ, it’s time to get nice
You gotta get ready for the sacrifice
Ain’t no half stepping, ain’t no weapon
 gets all the respect


Cool Suave and I’m on the mic
Kick fly raps cause you know I’m like
I’m hyper, this the cat that’s best to go sniper
And I’mma have to get piper
Just like a typer, coon kind of brother
Cool Suave is the late night lover


What’s a man to do after living in fear
Reach for a gun at 20 years in life
Shit, can’t see his wife
She gets caught for trying to slip in a knife
That’s not for me as you can all see
So ain’t no gun around that table
But I’m barely here living and able
Throw up your fist, shall get bliss
Blast, now you in a body cast


Smooth as ballet on a warm sunny day
Smooth operator like Sade would say
Hit the bass in your voice, tone like 
Get on the mic, put on your dance shoes
Quest for the fire burns my desire

We being hunted (All black men be aware)
But we will not be the present

When you dealing with this motherfuckers)
Gather all your arms and get ready!

Bulletproof, window blast on shatter
They wildin’ out, like black lives don’t matter
The other day be, yo, the beast try to play me
It’s war zone, in the hood they brought the navy
Arm wrest, protest to stay seven
Guns that kill the strong black men like James Evans
Daytime, we try to keep that shit peaceful
Nightfall, I’m out lootin’ with the people
Police shootin’, tear gas rubber bullets
The end of the world, ain’t no other way to put it
Pearl Harbor, lookin’ like Okinawa
Even through the thick of it all, we smokin’ sour
Repeat felons, gotta send the street yellin’
Fuck that, I have a dream speech to tell ’em
Excelling lives, world news Wolf Blitzer
Don’t be a sheep and let the wolf get ya

Ayo we strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
Yo we strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
We strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
Yo we strike back, strike back, strike back, strike back

I trust none, just got a new forty
Ain’t scared to bust some, I do accordingly
Disorderly, the custom, the outrage city life like Ukraine
Cops shoot my youths like, Saddam Hussein
They shifty, we shot ’em down, kick ’em like Liu Kang
Dare ’em to buc bac, what what, my crew bangs
It’s no game, P’s waitin’ to take ya life
Burglaries, murderers, meet the viper when I strike
Blam-blam on the bama open
Like a open ’em like with the hammer
If they crooked meanings see I ain’t got no type
Hit ’em up, officer O’Connor, I’m Obama
Lit ’em up, ya dig? Pigs feel the karma
No drama, I’ve been a terror to this darkness
But due to my dark skin, I’m a movin’ target
We strike back, here’s one for Pow, one for Martin
One for Rice, one for Bellin and another for Eric Garner

Ayo we strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
Yo we strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
We strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
Yo we strike back, strike back, strike back, strike back

The court system ain’t got no honor
Only I can judge me and may hail burn the marijuana
Word to Obama, where’s my change? Man that shit
Ain’t been abolished the problem is, we’re still enslaved
We at war, with five-o
My eyes sore, you can see the pain in my soul
Demonstrate, entire state, stand up hands up
Surrender and you still get blamed up
Silence, it gon’ be no more compliance
The new alliance, we ain’t against use of violence
They don’t care you can get shot like a dog
Cuz these cops think they on top of the law
These ain’t no lies, why you actin’ all surprised
There’s a million more, crooked cops takin’ their lives
We survived, bust shots to rotten apple
Stay in your map, it’s a trap, you being shackled

Ayo we strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
Yo we strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
We strike back. Take one of mines, take one of yours
Yo we strike back, strike back, strike back, strike back

Gettin phat like this is easier said than done
Raise up, rise and shine
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this time
Now it’s time to get phat and all of that

Ah hell, the phat rap scripts tips scales
Go longer than endless trails, play my part stay sharp as darts and nails

Ahh shut the hell up and don’t hold me back black

Flip That Shit,"Cold Case Files, Vol. 2",1993.0,"Aight aight aight y’all know who's in the house y’all know who's in the house
Yo all y’all motherfuckers get the fuck away from the mic
Get the fuck away from the mic
You know what time it is
The notorious Biggie Smalls in the house (say word up, say word up)
Word up for all the bitch ass niggas
They got Third Eye from the group holdin’ the house (yeah yeah yeah)
We got naughty by nature in the house (yeah yeah)
We got them vile-ass onyx niggas in the house
And it's about to be a big thing

I wanna speak up on a beat down (beat down)
Glocks heating up the motherfucking streets now (streets now)
This time I break apart only the small and phony ones
Who's home? Bony ones
Can't fuck with the only ones
Ask the rody holy ones
Ass whipped fast, slow ass
Don't have, broke
Heard a nurse pulled a steel toe out your asshole
Even apachii's on your path
And with your punk ass boyfriend you get him to inspect your ass

Who would you expect
A real nigga 
Was a straight big shit
Like today was tomorrow yesterday
It ain't just your neighborhood I hold
So when I roll there goes your whole motherfucking zip code
A real nigga coming up
With the rumour
If I can't suck you later
Then bitch fuck you sooner
I’m playing trooper like a party pooper
Shoot ya and the timber boots
You got more from under my skin super

So you flip the shit
Ayo you flip the shit
I don't want that shit
Nigga you flip that shit
No, no, you flip that shit
No you flip this shit

Nah, you flip that shit!
I don’t want that shit, nigga you flip the shit!
Ayo you flip the shit!
Nah, nah, nah man, you flip that shit!
I don’t want this shit, nigga you flip that shit

All you niggas better leave the fucking state, no need to masturbate
Fuckin' with Biggie, it's time to castrate
It's clobberin’ time
When I rip rhymes I quench thirsts like Very Fines
And I'm still thirsty - niggas wanna hurt the six-pack maniac
Tote TECs, and MACs, black
Check the stacks, what the fuck?
I throw uppercuts like Riddick Bowe
And I'm wicked with the slow-flow, y'know?
I'm pressing hard, I'm leaving creases
Cutting up bodies and talking to the pieces
It gets deep, kid, deep enough to touch the bone
Brooklyn's own Al Capone
Get stoned off the blunt when it's filled with the skunk
Get drunk, and do a demolition to punk
And all chumps, that scream that my shit don't thump
They catch lumps and bumps, I put the shaker in your rump

Ayo you flip that shit
No, you flip that shit
I don’t want this shit, nigga you flip that shit
No, you flip the shit
Ayo, you flip that shit!
I don’t want this shit, nigga you you flip that shit
No, you flip that shit
No, you flip this shit!
But I don’t want this shit, nigga you flip that shit
Ayo! You flip that shit
Hope you flip that shit
I don’t want that shit, nigga you flip that shit!

Ayo special request
End up being jest
That's my nigga Wess
My Budacest motherfucking bee's nest
Bet, watch you stick when I wink and I nod
Third Eye's raw
They take 
Have you heard of this murderous
Gun slinger nigga swingin'
I’m into bringing drama
Run to mom-dukes
I smoke Buddha, I’m smokin’ blunts of the skunk
And I get funky like vanilla yo
Hit your box 
Intelligent militant
That’ll lose 100%
Fuck your stuff cuz that's nonsense
 Cemetery 
My nigga Wess is on a mission
Uh oh
I don't be bullshitting
I'll stomp a mudhole in your butthole
I rip and I flip that
Quick like you should've let me get that
Man I don't want it, take that shit back


Ayyo, gimme that shit ya fuckin' bald-headed bastard!
What, the evil nasty acid?
Yeah, the shit that burn they asses!
So ashes to ashes?
Blast with the ghetto gas!
And I'm going, niggas knowing
I'm showing my Razzamatazz-manian Devil rebel style
Niggas know we fuckin' wild
I'm wild, I'm wild, he's wild, SO WE'S WILD
So capture the rapture!
The black disaster --

-- I swear to fuckin' god I'll raise hell and make the white man call me master
I'm 666 and need to repent to the pastor
So fuck the radio they closed your ears but read my lips, I rips
And if you eat my words I'll leave you strung like umm
(Um! Um!)
It was on the tip of my tongue
But now it's stuck between my throat
I can't breath for a lick

No plates off the lot it costs a lot
You forced to watch hands take they hand off the Glock
Money don't stop long as I stay hot
Cook it up, chop it up, put it on the block

Yo, word up kid, there's mad money in this
Grab the mic, handle your business
This here is for Official niggas only, no beginners
About my heavy metal, run the ghetto, where my sinners?
You feel me in my crazy world, I only deal with sinners
Hearin local reports from out the vocal laws up in the game
You violate nigga, I swear I tear you out the frame

With the same routines run with y'all gats to smithereens

Official Nas, and L-B fam

I back slap you, with my other platinum plaques
You whack rap hopefulls, have you noddin like the dope do
Any member of my crew'll roze you
Number one spot, took that
Onyx show, book that
Got a bet, better know where to put that

I smoke weed in cars that cost more than your house
I got a fly chick with gats, hold coke in her blouse
I'm talkin about a hundred g's, show sold out
So you see that, you better shut your mouth
I used to scheme on niggas that had more than me
Now I'm that nigga and niggas scheme on me
I got a ghetto mentality
If a nigga front, I'm gattin 'em
I never had nothin, now my rolex is platinum
I be the same man, rich or poor
Wildin out at the club, time to hit the floor
Outside I got the infa, in the Ferrari cockpit
Fuck partyin with y'all, we already got shit
You rockless, nina you ain't got no props
Let me see you at the awards this years, I blow your spot
Even at a rich event, you can still get shot
Fuck that, as of now Onyx back in the mack
We guaranteed to start fights everytime we rap
Yo, who got next? Who got first?

Woke up this morning, I’m still living
Came too far, I ain’t quitting
This will be the greatest day of my life!

?? day that he’s gonna make it but he pulls through
Cause he’s a fighter and what don’t kills you
Makes you stronger, he never gives up
And always kept it real and never gave a fuck
The boy got heart, he never backed down
Up against the odds, you can’t count him out
Brush his shoulders off, back on his feet
Gotta stand up, cuz he don’t see defeat
It makes him go harder, he loves the hate
Say “he can’t do it”, but he don’t break
He a soldier, a rider
And he don’t stop – he a survivor
He keep grindin, keeps going in
Cuz in his mind, he knows that he can win
He gotta lotta pride, let a ??
Came too far, he from the southside


No matter what happened in my past I’m alive today
I’m strong and I’m healthy and I’m wide awake
Got the whole world in front of me – it is mine to take
Any struggles I encounter it’s a test of faith
While I’m here might as well do something great
If you are not living your dreams then your life’s a waste
You ever wonder why you can’t see your own face?
You need to look outside, you lookin at the wrong place
Don’t put off till tomorrow what you can do today
What tomorrow gives me is always today
I ain’t perfect I made some mistakes
I got the soul of champ so my spirit don’t break
I feel blessed just to be in this place
I’m going hard, giving out way more than it takes
And I swear Imma make it worth the aches
Ain't no gift like the present, I live for today!",https://genius.com/Onyx-greatest-day-lyrics

Follow my footsteps, used to ante up for a nickel sack
From Vange Hill to Moon, you touch me, I got to get you back
Roll in the stolen V's with he-ho chase you
Cop a six months time, and 3 years probation
Repeat offender, bender, no retreat, no surrender
I'm the number one contender
I got a new game plan, strictly sportin name brand
Layin in the pound hunted, floatin through your town blunted
On some shit that give you burnt throats
Amputated all the turn coats, and get cremated
Never been B-rated, my 5 plated, is how I dead fights
I have your family driving in the daytime wit they head lights

(Keep Shinin)I'm daily thinkin of a life gleamin
That life we in, how to obtain, and what's the meanin
(Keep on Shinin)The fact that cash rules, these last days
We the last crews, my present wars and my past crews
(Keep Shinin)True soldier, no matter the goal
We gettin closer, for bitch ass niggas, it's just about over
I'm in it for the long haul, this goes out
(Keep on Shinin)To all my true livin dogs and my 'so-called'

Don't talk about it, make it happ'
Don't fake it chap
The Hennessy act, got you light gat
You wanna block, trying to hold a nine
Son you livin on my time, don't try to Overshine
Play your p, play your position
I stay with G, stay on a mission
Precisely, good, wit game I'm nicely
Shifftee son, still shiesty
You in your eight fifty, 
ridin shotgun
If you can count your money, you ain't got none
And bitches beat they game tight
Baby, get the name right, see G. comin, like a train light
And niggas be don pretending
But I'm armed and bendin, so they can get the John Lennon
Hundred dollar gator players
Silk shirts and champagne
, don't know a thing about the damn game


My artistic creation, or decoration will set the nation
With infestation of lyric lacin, for all occasions
Engagements and events, for big dollars and cents
Makin niggas past tense, it's consequence
All I see around me, makes up the place
But if you don't hold down your space, you quickly get erased
Don't waste a thought, thinkin I ain't
Gon' be bringin the goods and grands home
Till my body's dead and stinkin
Watch as I back draft, on the last class, I trap, crash
Catch the hash flash, when I puff the black wrath
Learn the slicks of the trade, to be self made
Those who slept, stay where they started and got played",https://genius.com/Onyx-overshine-lyrics

I jump off the stage with my chain and my watch
Get back on stage with my chain and my watch
Where New York at? Damn, we miss Big Pop?
Got West Coast love, wish I could bring back Pac
I’m in the back drop, the haters gotta love
I keep a Glock in my “Rock & Republic”, make me pop off in public
Broad day people watch and do nothing
They stop and start running and gunning, then cock it and dump it
Now niggas wanna change the topic or subject
Hip-hop ain’t dead yet, it just got shot in the stomach
They throw their gats like us, when they act like us
But nobody on the corner got ratchets like us

My skateboards is luxury cars
See women are from Venus and men are from Mars
I shot for a sky, missed, now I'm amongst the stars
And I ain’t no alkie, I know my limit
Shit, I always stop drinking when the room starts spinning
When I’m up in the spot I command attention
My name’s Sticky Fingaz but my hands be itching
From Carhartt to Chrome watch surprised i'm breathing
I sleep with the sunrise and wake up in the evening
I'm on the prowl like I never say vows I’m too wild

A lot of things have changed since I grown up
Half my brothers got locked, half got blown UP!

We just hangin on the corner, puffin trees just
Tryin to stay warm, sippin Easy Jesus!

I think it was September nah, maybe it was November (what?!)

When my fam is dyin over money and gettin incarcerated (yeah)
Just to be a statistic, it's sadistic
Too realistic, we goin this QUICK!

It all began when Shorty Rock took the law in his own hand
Sick of seein his moms gettin beat up by his old man
So he did what any kid woulda done
Went into the closet, got his pop's gun
Who need enemy when you got family?
It's hard to get a job when you look like me (WORD UP!)
See people don't just rob cause they on unemployment
Some do it for the pure satisfaction enjoyment
Brrrr, it's cold, this world is freezin
Folks gettin murdered over no apparent reason (NO!)

Some say the bigger the gun, the more damage it do
I say the smaller the pistol, the better it shoot
I give a holla to my niggas in warfare
Sticky don't care, if don't nobody else care
And um, I'm always quick to reach for the Glock
So if you run up in my spot motherfuckers get shot
In these streets niggas drivin fives gettin set up
Forgive but don't forget your benz'll get wet up
Niggas come around frontin, don't believe 'em
You ain't no killer you be layin there bleedin
Cause nigga you know me
Don't make me blast you up and snatch your ass out the b
And bitch niggas don't blast back
They like ladies, they take their ice chains to the casket
And since we all came from the hood
Got our name from the hood and our game from the hood
I think it's time to kill for our good, time to heal our hood
Be real to our hood
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That'll take 380's to school and get crazy
And to my sons tryna make ones
Sellin cracks on the blocks, watch out when the jake comes
And to my real thugs get up, I know you fed up niggas
But keep ya guns up

Fuck rap music, this is gun clap music
Fuck rap music, this is gun clap music
Fuck rap music, this is gun clap music
Load it up, cock it back and blast to it
Fuck rap music, this is gun clap music
Fuck rap music, this is gun clap music

Feel Me,Bacdafucup Part II,2002.0,"Just to let you know this is recorded 9/11/2001
The day the World Trade Center blows up
Shit is real, son. Shit hit home, kid, word up
Uh, yeah, hope you can feel this

Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
I’m cryin’ through my heart

When I first heard the track it made me cry
Brought tears to my eyes and I don’t even know why
My life ain’t nothing but anger and pain
Tatoos on the back of my arm should explain
Blood, sweat and tears, ten years in the game
So many times all alone with the gat to my brain
It’s 
Me Against the World
 nigga, I feel the same nigga
I’m 
Ready to Die
 too BIG, I feel the same
I’m America’s nightmare – young, black and rich
Man, I’m paranoid, make me wanna clap my bitch
A hundred miles an hour, wanna rap my whip
Asking God “Shit, where we going after this?”
I’ma thug, a thug til heart be stop
Til they pick me off the street nigga, murdered a shot
My wars, my words, the only thing that I got
And I live by the gun and I die by the Glock
Sixteen shots, fuck that I’m takin’ them all
I’d rather die on my feet then live and crawl
My gun got powers like the 48 Lords
The “Ghetto Superstar” die see my face on the wall
And don’t forget me

Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
I’m cryin’ through my heart

Growin’ up in Brooklyn, times was rough cuz
Poor as we was it couldn’t get no tougher
On my ave. most of us was not blood
But as kids we shared that block love
But that faded, when my brother’s got arrested
They thugged on the block to hard, we was ejected
To the creator: was it you that made moms pick Queens?
So her baby son could race the world, when he created things?
Why her elders always heard the sounds of sirens?
Plus they ignored the divine guidance
Why was the time I was born 9/16?
Turn it upside down it’s the same thing
Why do I have a M-16, and the 9?
Will I have to go out, blazing one at a time?
When you took moms baby carriage, in the early stage
Was he too ill for this world, and you made a mistake?
Did he come back as me, to do something great?
To keep the fam strong and straight, help my brother’s escape?
And have baby sis and us, living on an estate
Do it big or die tryin’, is that my fate?

Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
I’m cryin’ through my heart

Who really cares, what the world think about me?
If I die right now, is you comin’ with me?
When I’m broke, who the hell got money for me?
Can’t even trust half the team runnin’ with me
I only know three people that’d kill for me
Break the 6th commandment, make blood spill for me
Life and death the only thing that’s real for me
Cuz I was born into the world with a guilty plea
Now shit hit the fan, is you ridin’ with me?
When the whole world watchin’, 
All Eyez on Me
Swear on a stack of Bibles, testify for me
Look the judge dead in the face and lie for me
If I go to prison, who gon do my time for me?
Start the revolution, get the chair, fry with me
Go out in a blaze of glory, guns to the sky with me
I’m all alone in this world, all I got is me

Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
I’m cryin’ through my heart
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
I’m cryin’ through my heart
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
I’m cryin’ through my heart",https://genius.com/Onyx-feel-me-lyrics
Belly of the Beast,Turndafucup,2012.0,"I'm a product of my environment
OG's going into early retirements
This is the art of war, black diamonds in the Audemars
Shit I talk might start a war
Dro Starr the golden child De La Hoya
Some might stick for the bread Stella D'oro
Public announcements for public houses
Playing with their freedom, touching thousands
Rich folks send their kids off to Yale
Poor folks send their kids off to jail
So fuck taking lemons and making lemonade
We can take a half an ounce, turn it to a 28th
My bitch can't dress and never less than Ralph Lauren
A nigga can't drive a whip unless the whip's foreign
We in the club, throwing tax free hundreds
20 niggas jumping out of three black Hummers
Stop putting fake grilles on a whack three hundreds (Chrysler 300)
Niggas ain't trying to see Max B numbers
Hold your head, son, this murder Redrum

One for the struggle, two for the pain
Three for the kids out mugging for change
Cause the bills don't stop, the bills don't stop
It's the belly of the beast and we hungry

It's Sticky Fingaz, you know I'm bout to black out
I never go to sleep, nigga, I pass out
And I don't wake up, I come to
I'm scared to death cause everything I think come true
I got a lot of things, but no sympathy
I keep the ratchet pockets never on empty
I'm in that Bentley, please don't tempt me
High powered lawyers, I beat an attempt B
Look at my face, do it look like I'm joking?
It beat them nosey niguhz, get they nose broken
Sometimes the hardest niguh be the most soft-spoken
Pop off guns, get thrown in the ocean
I'm not a gambler, a hustle nigga cashed out
Before I'm broke, I pull that guns and that mask out
As a kid, I was raised in the traphouse
Like a rat throwing rocks throw a glass house",https://genius.com/Onyx-belly-of-the-beast-lyrics

Last niggas that I tied up was up at Koch

Made ’em wire me my money right there on the spot
That’s a Cartier watch? Nigga take that off
That’s a iced out cross? What? Take that off
Know what’d happen to your daughter, I don’t make that call?
Better take me to the bank or get your face plucked off

Gangsta,Bacdafucup Part II,2002.0,"You my wife with no papers, my gangsta bitch
First time I got caught you tried to shank a bitch
You scared to get down, she a bust all rounds
Smoke a Newport, cut me half, bust me down
Catch me lookin’ at another chick she curse me out
Dead serious, but at times she act silly
Jump out the truck at the light to get the philly
Rollin’ it up, chasin’ down the ice cream truck
I waited half-an-hour for your hair to get braided
She leavin’ dirty messages on 3-way pagers
Told her how to roll, she low and spit razors
She hit triple six first time out in Vegas
Never got shook, when feds knocked down the door
She hid the coke, a scared chick would’ve flushed it all
And we can live it up, eat lots of shrimp
Or get grimey with a quarter bag of potato chips

Cause she’s straight gangsta-a-a-a-a
Gangsta-a-a
Cause she’s straight gangsta-a-a-a-a
Gangstaa-a-a

I need a down chick that wouldn’t mind loading my clips
And wouldn’t blow her mind if I showed her a brick
In and out of the grind with the focus of chips
Blowin’ one time with her controlling the whip
Wait up for me and make sure she doubled the flip
She a sophisticated thug bitch that move her hips
She catch you for her set up you when you move your shit
Or most of the time, she throw the cold shoulder to guys
Smoke in the ride, hoodie low over her eyes
She know she a dime, baby nine shot to her thighs
Gotta be live, help me count doe in the five
And when I’m gone for weeks, turn them OT moves
She don’t trip, she’s the gangsta she knows the rules
Givin’ me hell is not hard, it’s something to lose
God for bid I slip up and land in jail
My murder mami put the house up to make the bail

Cause she’s straight gangsta-a-a-a-a
Gangsta-a-a
Cause she’s straight gangsta-a-a-a-a
Gangstaa-a-a

Behind a real nigga there’s a real bitch, she lied to me
See, my bitch walked right beside of me
I’ve been in situations and seen her ride for me
She licked my gun wounds, even did my time with me
Ain’t nothing she can’t have, I gave that girl ery’thing
Tatooed her name on fingers for wedding rings
Are you that chick, do you rep Sticky?
We split it down the middle, everything 40–60
Are you that chick for rich or poor?
The only one I eat out the only one I hit raw
Keep you, covered in ice til you start shivering
The Baby Phat Gucched up out with pink Timbalands
Me and her, we like Bonnie and Clyde
I hold the heat and the money, she drive the ride
She make other bitch’s mad
Cause she more bitch than they ever been
It’s beautiful and intelligent
Talented, droppin’ heroin

Cause she’s straight gangsta-a-a-a-a
Gangsta-a-a
Cause she’s straight gangsta-a-a-a-a
Gangstaa-a-a

She build with me, she kill for me
With blood, shed tears, you still with me
She real with me, smoke fry with me
Look the judge in the eye, straight lie for me
Count bills with me, you’ll kill for me
With the blood, shed tears, she still with me
Cause she build with me, she kill for me
Look the judge in the eye, straight lie for me",https://genius.com/Onyx-gangsta-lyrics

He was just going to the store to get some ""Swisher's""
Get a couple scratch off, sat a long day, worked his ass off
Ain't doing nothing just minding his own business
Trying to get home and watch the ""Heat"" play ""Memphis""
Off the street he saw the one's out
For some reason, they running at him with their guns out
The store owner saw he had a gun
So on the low he picked up the phone and he called ""the one's""
And he ain't even have a chance
They would a bullets in his body, up and look like they made him dance
Shut down like a wanted man
Like his face on a wanted poster reward a hundred grand
Police killing niggas gotta stop
The next day in the headlines: ""Another cop shot a cop""
They just thought he was another nigga
To their surprise, this nigga was a cop, he was undercover

Have a liquor store interests, alarm sound like ""Don't Be a Menace""
Unarmed and defenseless, this killing is senseless
They claim he had a concealed weapon
That was just a paper bag with his Guinness he paid for
Still got shot with acuteness, everyday blackless
Black males on the hit list, filmed by eyewitness
Justice is blind, that bitch always find the pigs innocent
Yo, how was it legal to abuse me?
Bodega, choked me to death for a loosey
Make my brain bleed at the Wayne Greek (?)
I needed first aid at the right 'A'
Murdered for being black guy on bright day
Fuck dirty harry, crooked cop make my day
Cause if we targeted your children like that
You'd hate our race, cop, you already do that, bitch

Let's say I'm just an ordinary man, married and all
I'm a father, pay taxes, and I abide by the law
But damn, why I let my kid go to the store
Feels like, I just shipped him off to war
And I don't know if I'm ever gonna see him again
Or if some cop gonna kill him and take his freedom
My son is not gonna stand on you and take your beating
You a cop boy second, but first we men
Bless, full of youthfulness
Best thing I ever bought him was the bulletproof vest
Best thing I ever taught him: give what you expect
If I'm mourning by the morning It's gonna be some more death
And I swear on the bible as I testify
But turn that shit to the page that says a eye for a eye
I'm burning up a rage and I'm not gonna lie
Somebody gotta pay, gotta pay with their lives

So when you speak to me, imagine there's a gun in your face

That's gon' be the case
In a trunk I got mask and surgical gloves
Besides, Who's gonna care if I murder for thugs?
If I'm chilling with my family (Hammers on deck)
If it's just my bitch and me (Hammers on deck)

This ain’t for the week hearted
Time to restart it
Bring it back and recharge it!
And regardless, we gon' kill this weak artist
We the streets hardest, here to peak this week chart list
Charged with  cause Onyx starts rioting
And niggas never get tired of fighting
Onyx gets the crowd exciting
Ignite niggas up, and only allow niggas invited
Got indicted for two counts of acting reckless
Snatch your necklace
You know I got the toast back at breakfast
United States ghetto
Where every nigga, in their waist, got the metal
And you can’t escape the ghetto
We’re all trapped in
We’re all into action
Ready for any interaction
We’ve got the gats when we enter the premises
Two shots make ya family reminiscent

When they jump off, take one for the team
One for the team, take on for the team
When they dump off, take one for the team
One for the team, take on for the team

When they jump off and dump off, take one for the team!
For the bloodline, the  the DNA, the genes
Pledge allegiance any means 
Best proud to hold my believes
And my peace from the streets
A lot of queens for regime stand solid
Our dream is just to dream without progress
Profit with my profits, building with disciples in the process
Snowgoons souls turn blacker than the Onyx
Master the abolics and the violents and vomit
Death talks similar to climate
Climate to the summit, to drama come next
They see your jewels, tell you running
No deep than your mind, you don't want it!
 your mouth cause cheap moment,  get confronted
You're not a thug, cause you come from it
You gotta hold down, you  now
Where you gonna be when it go down?


I thought it was rap for hip-hop to call on me
I'm   everything on the song with me
Stage all crazy, niggas don't wanna perform with me
So I started thinking it's something wrong with me
But no! I got a feel in the show!
Kill a man, you're a murder
Kill them all, you are God!
I was raised behind bars, born in the yard
And they take me that long to be all 
Now who you know that it's hard as me?
Divine intervention, nobody fathered me!
I'm a psychic, you don't want to start with me
I could tell your future, it's gonna end horribly!
I'm always in the crowd cause I dive on my fans
Niggas don't wanna battle, cause I rhyme with my hands
Hit you with the punch line, all open here

Black Fatigue,Against All Authorities (EP),2015.0,"“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”

When you're dealin' with the police - get on point chap'd
Black fatigue, civil war, city under siege
We under stress, better get a gun and a vest
Fuck the jake, they should be under arrest
How many black lives do they gotta take?
Marches do we gotta make, out of state?
Sometimes you gotta take matters in your own hand
So get your guns and hold the fort down, just like homeland
A couple Tecs, molotov cocktails
Niggas got Glock shells, the size of ox tails
We lettin' off the Kalashnikov, ambulance drop
The stretches off, I might get a stretch up north

“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”

Black fatigue, no slack (blablaaaat click clack)
The streets catching a fire and the bodies that are stacked are blacks
Jaded authority, parade on slaying minorities
I'm craving and brave enough to snuff the majority
Of these figures, demons in uniforms
Protect and serve as much as the reality of Unicorns
You! Not of the norm, I've been sworn on the corners
Ready to war - they scared of my aura, it's enormous
Routines stop, well my routine's cocked
Blast! Trip & Get your whole blue team shot
Mind illest, militant vigilant swinging tha shotty like I pendulum
Injured 'em, officer down, had to dismember him

“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”

I need my point blank vest metal plate in the chest
It all black fatigue cuz I never can rest
From the blood in my veins to the blows in my flesh
You gon' need a eye witness cuz I never confess
I got guns waiting to shoot but we're gonna need more
Just call me the spook who sat by the door
Damn right we gonna loot it, burn down the store
But not in our hood it's time we come into yours
We see it on the news but all of us fucking living
Fuck these politicians, all of 'em fuckin' bigots
Brothers getting sentences, all in the double digits
Even white boys is calling each other niggas

“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”
“Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em”
“This is war”, “Cops are gettin’ blasted”

Mad Energy,Turndafucup,2014,"Give me that energy
Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
I feed off your energy
Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
Mad energy

Who you know that can lift a crowd up off their feet?
Make em go so crazy it spills out in the street
I’m like a hundred thousand volts of electricity
To hell what they talk about it gotta be me
I murdered the best I’m so loud I’m heard by the deaf
I got that boombap you can feel right in your chest
You ain’t Jimi Hendix don’t play me to the left
Hold up give me a sec let me catch my breath
I’m 180 over 125
I’m too wild that’s why my blood pressure’s high
Feel like I can touch the sky

Give me that energy
Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
I feed off your energy
Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
I need that energy
Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
Pick up the energy
Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
Mad energy
Mad energy

That’s what’s missing from the game
Onyx get it crunk that’s some wacka flocka flame
So let’s do it New York influenced
Ooh god damn I’m about to lose it
Can’t control my zip-up bout to blow off steam
We get it amped up like the whole club on amphetamines
This is how they want it high performance
I go all out on stage when I’m on it
Pick up the mic and then I ? my aggression
Gotta get it off my chest it’s like I’m benchpressing
So pump pump pump pump me up
Feed off the energy straight from the crowd then I jump
Jump jump jump jump jump jump
Everybody say hell yeah


I’m like a CBGB moshpit
I just returned from the future seen the apocalypse
Fuck being told what to do fuck your politics
Fuck your Patron I’ll make you swallow a hollow tip
Then I light up a chronic spliff rest in peace Uncle Howie
Throw your guns in the air on some Onyx shit
We stage dive where piranhas swim
Walk across the hands of my fans like the water that the messiah did
We make the wall sweat fire kid
Uncontrollable police blow up the show wearing riot gear
We break atoms and defy science here

For my one stop niggas that be huggin’ the spot
Sittin’ on crates, gettin loaded, get that cake
Dodgin’ drinks, spit and hafta cover they face
Kick some tye, big truck with tricks inside
In too deep, tryna sell bricks from the side
See no games, with real niggas from other hoods
Car titles get lost, some niggas get jooked
But God forgive me if a nigga cross the fam
Holdin’ the heat, the streets’ll make me force ya hand
From my wild crew, sets the new guns off the roof
To them slick dudes, hot and they workin the phone booth
Cuz Lord knows I’m gonna reload and bust back
Incredible gats, indicted for a federal rap
They ain’t duck low enough, shots shredded they hat
Murdered and gone, nigga it’s a medical fact

Gettin’ money for tuition, go to school and she strip
Kill in the club, when niggas dicks get hard
Murda mami set you up and niggas bricks get robbed
Help her soul if a chick try to set my team
I’m tying her up, rep till the death of Queens
All my staircase niggas keep flippin’ the jun’s
All my outta state niggas keep gettin’ them ones
Guns in the air, hit you with invisible Glocks
That mean you never see it comin’ nigga, 52 shots

Catch a rat nigga, leave his Bentley sittin’ on bricks
Bloody ice-pick fights in the yard ten times
Outta ten, step to me and ya life get scarred
Shoot-outs in broad daylight, bustin’ at feds
Dirty cops with a ki of coke, bring ’em out dead
For my jail niggas, stashin’ bangers deep in they cots
For my grimy niggas, hidin’ under cars from cops
Empty the Glock, hitchu with disposable gats
Bust you, wipe it off, throw it away, it’s a rap

Cash to blow, trees lit, glass of mo

Lockin it down, the game got me leery to smile
Movin too slow, gettin tired, pick up the flow
Passin go, two bricks to get in the goal
Pushin that weight, front line like Michigan State
Jail board, punk players gettin bumps on their face

Lovin my life, that's why I gotta spit it through mics
Halftime, smoke break, I need somethin to light
Game over, niggas goin home losers tonight

Runnin the block like a runnin back duckin from d's
Get knocked on the fifty yard line with hard time
Side lines flooded with drops, cops is the ref
New York is like a contact sport, we play to the death
Money to floss, hoes play off a nigga cost
Only rollin with the winners, not the team that lost
The game is wild, I'm like Ray Louis on trial
Flagrant fouls, hit with techs in the fort down
Connects get intercept for their coke in the first round
Be the game most rival thug, rhyme on thug
Blowin ya amps, Onyx is the Eastcoast champs

My team dirty, scuffed up timbs and black jerseys
Bulletproof pads, face masks and no mercy
Cooler full of henny and sprite for when I'm thirsty
I'm a sore loser, toughened up, learn to win
If a clip hold a hundred I'll put a hundred and ten
The game face bald head niggas done it again
Celebratin, takin pictures out in front of the benz

How many nigs did we get so far?
I couldn't care to count, just snatch 'em up quick
If he scream, I'mma put him out
I put the heat to his face to shut him up
So I can dig him out, went in his pockets
And got the cash in some big amounts
I looked him dead cold in his eyes without carin'
If money speak, that explain the voices I've been hearin'
You ain't really have to kill him
Yo God he moved, but I lied
Damn, there's our sick stick-up turned homicide
So? That's the way our momma died
Is you with me? I'mma slide

So we slid, had to get our gameplan together
Cause this little bit of stickup loot ain't lastin us forever
Desperate, on the edge with no place to go
We can't go back to the hood we stuck up everyone we know

For the love of money
People will steal from each other
For the love of money
People will rob from their mother
For the love of money
People will kill their own brother
Don't let money change you
[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz, 
X-1

Now everytime I hear a fuckin siren, my heart skip a beat
I'm paranoid, every face I see I think he after me
Supposedly
We was supposed to be gettin work from this large cat
But since we know where he rest at. We goin' Bogart!
Son frontin' so hard
Heard he had a hundred G's alone on his Gold Card
His crab wife showed me mad cash in her blouse
She said he the mad stash at the house
Couldn't pass up a jooks like this anyday
Anyway
On our way there I'm feelin' bad vibes
Yo kid don't say that
That's when we bumped heads
With vicks that we stuck from way back, up on Atlantic
The way them niggas lookin' God they drivin' mad frantic
Yo don't panic, trust me, I jump back and bust em
Shots through they windshield, they ain't wearin' shields
Hit the kid behind the steering wheel it's the way I feel
In a state to kill I wanna watch him die
Wait and chill, we got bigger fish to fry, two L’s later
In a Bed-Stuy elevator, got off the fifth floor
Water hit the skull, ready kick the door
Off the hinges
Bust shots by entrance
Only thing I saw was a nigga four-four
His gun jammed!
He tried to run and
Reach for a knife, shot him in the leg
So think about your life
And tell me where the loot's at
He said, “I'll tell you just don't shoot black!”
With the sight of fear, dragged him down six flight of stairs
To the basement, and in someway, he had a trap door in the pavement
Smacked him with the gun, kicked him out the way
Had to be at least five hundred K
Now hear come the bitch, talkin bout her share of the wealth
So we put her and the husband out and we went for self

For the love of money
People will steal from each other
For the love of money
People will rob from their mother
For the love of money
People will kill their own brother
Don't let money change you

Yo, we fuckin came off! The plan was splendid
'Cept we got all this money, and can't even spend it
Shh, let's disappear and be outta this place
So much dirt and shit we did it's hard to show our face
So we bounced out of town and went down to Miami
Cause most those cats we crabbed was like family
Now me and you beefin', nah it can't be true
It all started when all we had was just me and you
Now a whole different person is what I'm startin' to see in you
'Member when we had the new Lex
With the two Techs, rollin' to the duplex, drinkin' Stout
Thinkin bout, what we gonna do next, we used to work tight
Half-assed cars, down to dirt bikes
Hopin everything will go right, with the snow white
And in number spots that flow all night
Up to this day it was all tight
Man, fuck that!
You my little brother and we came out the same pussy
But I'mma kill you, you dummy, you fucked up my money!
Nah, the money fucked you up
Tryin to say the money changed me?!
What you think, I'm your brother, you got a gun in my face see
How can one tiny mistake, make you wanna erase me
Fuck that! You cut a side deal, that's why they raided the block
Now how the fuck I'm 'sposed to know the undercover was a cop
Son you been fuckin' with them niggas!
Look just put down the gun and let this bullshit slide
Nigga I ain't puttin down shit
I'm tellin' you let's just chill man
Fuck that nigga!
It don't gotta be this way man!
What nigga?! It gotta be this way!
It don't gotta be like this man!
It gotta be nigga!
Then go ahead and pull the trigger!
Think I won't?! Fuck you!
You know you ain't gon' do it!

All for you to see how wild the fuck that i be
You too fly, too high, off the lot and coca
The only shine you won be getting is the shine on your eye
Word It's critic, do you read it, you did, it occur to you
Your pitiful, they murder you, get rid of you, like niggas do
Yo, where i'm from, no love lets you come from
Niggas wanna get dumb - i got that
NY streets - where it's hard at
Me and my peeps might spark at ounce stack
Nigga roll on get your shit thrown back
Nigga got gay since real go back
Niggas our age don't live long that
Figured you paid - you stripped all that shit
Every nigga is touchable
Can I hit you one time? Mites keep busting you
Little shorties be bugging too

Can't We Just Hoes? (worrrrrd up)
Aiyyo what about the hoes? (Hoes?)
Yeah you know, the hoes
See that's what happen man
Hehahahh...


If ya got a girl then you better believe
She got a Swallow for a Babies and a trick up her sleeve
But if ya don't take my word, take the word of another
I love my girl more than I love my own mother
Until I caught the girl in bed Sucka my brother
Now, Poonani to me, is a stick and a bone
I take it and she spread it then I leave it alone
Then get out the crib 'fore her man come home

Ding dong, ring a ling a ling
Honey I’m home, scumbags and candy
Feelin damn dandy, crazy drunk off the brandy
Headed to the stairs, tip tip toe
With these squeaky ass stairs kid you gotta move slow
She wasn’t in the room, where could she be?
Wait a cotton pickin minute, I hear the TV
I slid to the den what did I see?
What you saw?
I seen a hairy stink smelly ass (word??)
And my girl on her knees (OHHH!)
She was suckin' the nex Ding dong (oh!)
Hey man, I was just watchin this, it was monotonous
I couldn't figga the nex Ding dong in my girl's esophagus

Suckin the nex Ding dong (oh!)
Suckin the nex Ding dong (oh!)
Suckin the nex ring a ling a ling (oh!)

Yo that's my word
Man I was trickin on this  man

Yo a girl ain't things man that's my word Yo, Mr. Jockey
Yo Suave how do you feel about that man?

NOW! A freak is a freak and a hoe is a hoe

A hoe I had before was claimin love, I was blind see
You can say like Mary J., ""Just Remind Me""

How the hell you miss those hints?

My girl lip lock a (Bleep) like a popsicle
Quick, my man flipped the silencer tip
Now let that dumb (Bleep) go to hell and suck on the devil’s (ding!)
Yep, you know money felt the steel
He should ate that (Bleep) then it coulda been his last meal
So don’t let my girl suck your Ding dong
Even if she’s suckin the next ring a ling a ling

Suckin the nex Ding dong (oh!)
Suckin the nex ring a ling a ling (oh!)
Afficial Nastee (repeat 8X)

Picture this, picture that
Your girl’s holdin the next man’s glands and comes back tell you that “I love you”
Back up, Back Up break the heck off
With Your Big Butt You Little Slut or I’ma smack your wig off
Smack the bust out your crusted out coco
I got proof- How?
Cause it landed on my couch

She was Suckin the nex Ding dong (oh!)
She was Suckin the nex ring a ling a ling (oh!)

Sometimes I feel like a (Ding!)

Oh andtell your girl to stop changing her lipstick

I got caught in the act, you pulled a gun, I gave chase
It ain’t my fault his hoe take in the face
Watch This, she the one who found Jack, the black vagina finda
Hmmm big ain’t it, lick lick so good God I almost fainted
Suckin da next Ding dong

Suckin the nex ring a ling a ling (oh!)

I dreamed I was broke

Then I was back at the mansion when I awoke
And some bad bitch I barely know givin’ me dope

Yeah… yo
From that basement in queens we get Franks and Beans
Now we taking major money out the bank we kings
The deals on the table
Couple milfs for the label
Couple flat screens
No more stealin' free cable
Used to bust down on cigarette to smoke
Now we blow and smoke in cigarette boats

This close to sellin’ crack
I made my own way

Purple rain I heard you paying
This drive shit make me wanna Kurt Cobain
I never thought we make it

Pissing in the driveway and drived for days

They don't have running water in their homes
There's no way to get it to them
 rumour there's a huge explosion
Mass murder, burned to death in their farm
The atomic bomb, thousands of people

Last days 
Hun'ed mad soldiers

Originally livin' on dead and broke, and headed for prison
I see the division, they just want you up in the system
Swearin' the Bible as if the course of judgement was Christian
Eye in the sky
GPS is see what they doin'
Changin' the money  off American union
We headed the movement and vote with hund'ed manner recruitin'
We comin' and shootin', burn it to the ground and we lootin'
To hell with the bitchin', we in the house to make the decisions
It's still politicians that give us hopes for higher ambitions
United the snakes, we riotin' in 51 states, there's no mistake
We're harped, they're makin' man-made crates
To target new blood, the revelation's horrible cuz
They inventin' new sicknesses to market new drugs
And there's things you gotta do when you not the popular vote
Blow up your own building, blame terror, take control

Walkin' over shell cases, Illuminati pale faces
Seein' symbols outta Free Masons
Radiation red light district, Nah
Against authorities, now the minorities is majorities
Rules of engagement, cracks in the pavement
The benz is my slave ship
Shackled by the monthly payments
I'm on arraignments, fightin' indictments
Citin' riots equal to lie-ins for those not in compliance
We the tryants, this is resistance
We voted for change, in the hood, not a damn difference
Life after hip hop is live nation
Fuck inauguration, hun'red mad lighten up your congregation
I'm into bomber nation, literally Obama nation

To save your life, gotta say goodbye
Destroyed the planet, gotta pay the price

Doomsday, chaos will turn men into savages
Murders and massacres, chapters of Bible passages
Brimstone fiend, gotta bring no glee
Satan's lovin' the pain, the world covered in flame
Nothing remains but smoke and the ash like the towers
Or planes the government lost its power to reign
And the people still alive, see the evil in they eyes
Evil men oblige, we ain't equal in they eyes
Darkness rise like the ages before Edison
They told me my whole life, heaven would never let us in
I guess hell got a couple new residents

From queen two, with the brake dust from the R's

For haters who wanna decide that it's war
Auto shells have niggas wanna slide on them floors
Sixteen from the four, say hi to the lord

With a bad bitch every night, not for nothin'
Top down rollin 'dro when the cops is comin'
