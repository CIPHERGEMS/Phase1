Roll Wit The Clan,Things in tha Hood,1994,"[Hook] {x4}
Roll with the clan and get that ass rolled over riggy roof
""Barking like a dog named Rover"" - MC Breed 'Ain't No Future In Yo Future'

[Verse One]
I'm getting up early in the morning so I can ride out with my homies
And stop around the corner looking for hoochies that can bone me
And then I'm out
Float...float on
And you know I gotta keep my sounds cranked holmes
I'm 6'4"" material, pulled out stereo, don't you wanna ride with me?
Greedy Greg in the back steady giggling
Till 5-0 pulled up then he stopped sniggling
I had no love and I showed no fear
The light turned green, peace...and I'm outta here
I'm headed to the liquor sto'
Gotta cop me a O.E. drink till the stores closed
Cause it's gonna be a long day
And the sun beaming down on my locs in my face
Homie Swift always keep his 380
Just in case a homie in the hood wanna act shady

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yo, I'm ready to hit the block non stop and get my mob on
As I float...float on
And my homie keeps call
Ready to hook up cause the block is shot from the bottom to the top
I guess there's nothing else to do, but um
Go and hit the club till 2:00
And uh
I guess I'd rather play it like that
Cause the hood that I'm front, I'm prepared to watch my own back
But in fact
Pop has to be in by 6:00
Just to keep the money coming in thick
I'm rolling in a Cherokee, girls can't see me they think that I'm Poppa Breed
But it's cool
Cause I creep sweet through the after set
Waiting for the first girl to break her neck
And I'm ready, ready for whatever
Peace to Breed and DFC lives forever
And I'm out


[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yo we finally, made it to the hot spot
And all the girls all around cause they love to see my 6'4"" drop
No drift, no scraping
16 switches for they girls and they babies

With they big ole' butts in them daiseys
And them big ole' stomachs looking crazy
Now I'm with mail, money grip and I'm home
Good looking out to my homie Tyrone
Mama ain't bought me a damn thang
But you don't see me throwing signs or slanging 'caine
So I'm straight I ain't got nothing to prove
I got mine, now it's your move
Or better just yet hold your butt and like plug it
Cause I'm a light skinned pimp and the girls be loving it
Now listen close to exactly who is speaking
I'm the C.A.P. to the O.N.E
I'm not down for the count I'm knocking them out by the dozen
And for your health, protect yourself for you love it

Dig a Bigga Ditch,Things in tha Hood,1994,"Eh yo! creep with the t double-e from flint
This crazy mother fucker that's always been
Fuckin' up as i bust shots and lots of clips
And, breakin' these niggas down fo' they shit
See, i give a fuck about a bitch, switch

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch

Which, won't take too much time
So this stupid mother fucker can't drop the dime
I'm, back to the street
(with what nigga)
With gangster shit and dope beats
T double-e's fin to get my cash on
So i get my blast on
Grab my clip and dash home
So it's on in the city where i slide
Forget about the troubles and get nine to five and get high
Chillin' with the dfc
And i got nineteen niggas behind me
Ready to get busy
Who is he
I'm making it plain
So you stupid mother fuckers won't forget my name
It's like, murder, murder, and movin' up on my hits
And always keep a nine up on my side and fuck that bullshit


Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch

Peep, I'm representin' to you, snipin'
My nigga tee don't give no fuck about a fight
It's the one, two, three, ghetto life sound
Boom, boom, boom, they all fall down

Now here's a little story about a nigga on the run
Never leaves the pound without packing a gun
Paranoid, unemployed, but making bank
Strapped, standing up on the corner slangin' dank

It's the dfc, in the c-i-t, y
F-l-i-n-t, i
Take these niggas on the warpath
Poppin' em, stoppin' em, drop em in the bloodbath

Niggas got to clown
So, every since i got back i've been puttin' it down
And straight fuckin' up shit
And it don't quit
Now I'm the mother fucker tellin' you to get to dig beyyatch!!
This is fo the husler's yo
Capone with the light skin, tone with the flow
Here we go, check one, two with this
Dick in yo mouth as we do it like this beyyatch!


Straight bumpin' in the '68 chevrolet impala
Bitches wanna follow, swallow
Deez mother fucking nuts!!!

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)

I'm starin' at the corner in my room at night
I picks up the pen so i make my shit tight
And i write, daily to keep my rhymes dope
And big man's think that can hang when i quote
Choke ho's as i cough those with lots of dick
To, let 'em know I'm down fo my shit
Yo ho, ass i might blast
But first i want yo cash
Then yo bitch, no switch
What it is, twitch
No i don't want yo bitch
Cuz bitches ain't shit
But mother fucking ho's and tricks
Roll where the streets meet at
Where hood meets hood, with bat 'n strap
Ready to peel a cap and rat tat tat tat goes the nine
In the c-i-t-y where i slide
I break a mother fucker when i gots to
With my Glock too
Many niggas ball and make it hot
To stop, and grab your cock and pop
And do the wok
We cop thirty six and slang dope on our block
And keep a down bitch in yo corner
And if you disrespect then fuck nigga you's a gonna

Things In Tha Hood,Things in tha Hood,1994,"[HOOK: NATE DOGG]
Things in my hood ain't changed
Everyday it remains the same
Things in my hood ain't changed
Everyday?it?remains the same

[VERSE 1: AL BREED]
Now?guess who's back with some laid?back tracks
(It's DFC puttin' Flint on the map)
Yeah, it's just another thing in the hood
Flossin' for rap and makin' snaps when we could
We used to roll Trues and Vogues
Six by nines on the line of the back window
But now it's all about them Ds
And hundred spokes ain't no joke when you're hittin'
Three-wheel motion, now lay back when I'm coastin'
From city to city and ocean to ocean
I guess until I hit some land
With the trunk full of funk
And a drink in my hand, yeah
And I guess there's nothin' else to do
DFC comin' straight to a hood near you
Rollin' in a six-tre, girls can't see me
They know that I'm Alpha Breed

[HOOK: NATE DOGG]
Things in my hood ain't changed
Everyday it remains the same
Things in my hood ain't changed
Everyday it remains the same


[RUBEN CRUZ]
A liquor store on every corner
And barbecue is the only aroma
Mister, mister I see you
Walkin' with a [???] or two
Every day and it goes on like this
Livin' in our neighborhood

[VERSE 2: T-DOUBLE]
Well it's a knock at the door
Man what up, yeah who is it
It's this homie 'round the corner
Wanna know if I can visit
So I head downstairs to the dweller
I mean the cellar
Where the whoo like propeller
It's like really doe
Ain't no biggie doe
You don't hear me doe
Put 'em in the back of the van with the stereo
And let the bass get him, split him in half
[???] and laugh, it'll be his last laugh
Now who is that creepin' late night in the smog
But I don't give a, 'cause I'ma handle with my dawg
It's like six-four material, pull-out stereo
Don't you wanna ride with me
But it's cool, hangin' late night on the ave
Laid back in the cut with my locs up and my deuce-deuce
'Cause things in tha hood ain't changed
Runnin' around in a circle doin' the same old things


[HOOK: NATE DOGG]
Things in my hood ain't changed
(It ain't changed, you know what I'm sayin')
Everyday it remains the same
(You either roll or get rolled over)
Things in my hood ain't changed
Everyday it remains the same

[RUBEN CRUZ]
Rollin' in the ride and we're out to play
If you feel this feelin'
Come and feel it with me
Mrs. Jones I see you hittin' on a switch or two
Every day, every day

[VERSE 3: AL BREED]
Now it's time for some late night, homie
Let's stop by the package store
Let me know if you really wanna roll
Really doe, hear me doe and let me go like you know and
Bust a crack in the window for the smoke
And ain't no jokin' I [???] for the simple fact
That I [???] so now I'm sprung
I feel I got the potion when I hit this three-wheel motion
And I pose for those
Now that's how I roll with my homies
I got my blinker on right and I don't feel lonely
I'm headed back straight to tha hood
And I'm feelin' real good


[HOOK: NATE DOGG]
Things in my hood ain't changed
(They never will, you know what I'm sayin')

F.A.N.G.,Out 2 Get Rich: The Album,1998,"[VERSE 1: JAKE THE FLAKE]
I hustle 24-7, night and day
Makin' that fast cash
Money, mackin', murder
With two AKs and a ski mask
Hittin' licks on tricks
'Cuz they really don't deserve the shit
The niggas that I'm cliquin' with
Got you paranoid and nervous, bitch
Falsify, niggas die
Bouncin' to they homicide
Then witness they drivebys
Bunjee jump they suicide
Flint Thugs they multiply
The life we live is do or die
Double O Seven spies
Private as the GoldenEye
Focused on the dope game
Steady toastin' Champagne
Speedin' in the fast lane
All about my scrilla, mane
Hazardous to your health
I'm more deadlier than poison
Shootin' up yo' hood is all good
When I bring my boys in
Petty motherfuckers talkin'
Screamin' like they big shit
Run up on this clique
Get the pistol whip and hollow tip
What you know about hot lead
Leavin' these niggas left for dead
Gotta get my piece of the pie
And plus my whole loaf of bread
Organized like Y.B.I
Bitch niggas get petrified
Fuck with me, I bet you die
Watch how many necks get tied
Creepin' from the blind side
Lettin' niggas brains hang
Everyday life of a Flint All-Star Narcotic Gang",https://genius.com/Jake-the-flake-fang-lyrics
Underground Slang,MC Breed & DFC,1991,"[ VERSE 1: MC Breed ]
Big city lights, big city name
Where the only thing you know is the dope-dealing game
Makin that money just as fast as you can
And this pride is yours in bein a (dopeman)
Rollin big cars and carryin big knots
Niggas pushin Benzes with the drop-tops
Bitches all around, all over the place
Eyes open wide for a sap to chase
They just lookin for a fool to pay the rent
But bitch, you're dead wrong, you won't get a cent
Girlies out there, they don't know my name
MC Breed and that's me and that's one and the same
I went from pushin ki's of pure d caine
To writin def lyrics for the Underground Slang

(Money bustin out my socks) --] Kool G Rap

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
The U-n-d-e-r-ground
Punk, don't make a sound
DFC comin through like: move!
Cause ain't shit for my posse to prove
Poppin caps don't matter, brain cells scatter
We head away on a 20 ft. ladder
Free as a bird, time to pass go
The posse break out, and T's drivin real slow
Lights start flashin all in my face
Red said ""Fuck it,"" and began to race
Went 20 miles up, ridin through [Name]
T looked at me, said (peep the gas tank)
To hell with it, pull on the side of the road
""Get our of your jeep!"" - man, you are cold
I yelled out the roof: ""Fuck you hoes!""
We paid 20 grand for bullet-proof windows
2 ounces of dope in my fix-a-flat
2 rounds of ammo for my personal gat
Killed a 8 Ball, I'm ready to go
The sounds of flashing nine made my blood flow
( *shots* )Jumped on the roof and sprayed the beamlight
20 dead cops who ain't nothin nice
People don't know us, and they call us a gang
But we fo' raw niggas from the Underground Slang


The Underground Slang

Man...cold 40s, man
Lay back, uknowmsayin?
...some of these girlies out there, uknowmsayin?
The homie Red, uknomsayin
Cash T, Technology, me MC Breed
The whole DFC posse, uknowmsayin?
Standin for the 'Dope Force Connection'

Ain’t No Future In Yo’ Frontin’,MC Breed & DFC,1991,"Intro : (Flavor Flav)
To the beat Ya'll
Ah yeah
(Ya don't stop)
Sound good to me

[ VERSE 1: MC Breed ]
This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back, my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say ""How Breed?"" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)


There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at [Name]
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', ""Eric Breed is gettin' over""

There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'


There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 4: MC Breed ]
Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'

Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that

(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

[ VERSE 5: MC Breed ]
Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors


Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Hey man, let's start this party up, right?

Just Kickin’ It,MC Breed & DFC,1991,"1-2, 1-2
Yeah
My name is MC Breed
I'm down with DJ Flash Technology, right?
And what we're doin here together as a team, the true-doers
Is what we call
Kickin it
Ah-ha, I said
We kickin it

[Verse 1: MC Breed]
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-Back in '86 when I started this
I said, the people told me: ""Breed, you're not an artist""
But now it's 1990, I'm servin em well
With the rhymes, rhythms, style and clientele
Concert after concert, one after the other
A man with the plan, plus a hustler undercover
A president, a guy of his own
Said, I knew I was proper, and I knew I was strong
But all it takes is concentration, rhyme calculation
Enough crew members to carry a nation
To be exact, yo Jack, I rehearsed
The cat wants your tongue, but I be catchin it first
And I'm kickin it


(Ah yeah)

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
Said, it's real necessary, not lack of control
To be at the tip-top with nothin but bankroll
To develop an actual skill, son
You gotta be born a natural real one
Not high up on a pedestal, just a born idol
To me it's just a typical man-made title
To remain an architect and stand, in fact
You're startin to sweat, to eject is your best bet
Certified legal, not against the law
I'm not irrelevant, but terribly raw
I got on-the-job knowledge and puttin it on paper
No bun for those who b.s. the baker
That's right, the mack Eric Breed is all that
It's pretty simple, not to mention a fact
Causin major upsets for you so-called vets
Who was there in the beginning, now you're sittin in check
I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)
Yeah, I'm kickin it

Now this beat is so dope
Yo Flash, get busy one time
Uknowmsayin?


[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
Nigga-da-nigga-da-nigga-da-ni...
Not once do I think I need to change my mind
Technology's here with me to co-sign
Yeah, for the occasion, Breed's invasion of death force
Sit back, relax, Techno cuts of course
Yo, the B-r-double e-d, and it's me
]From the city of F-l-i-n-t with Technology
Servin on the wheels of steel and we're real
And if you squeel you're killed, pimp, that's the deal
Big Breed, I'm servin at the top of my mind
But his wax is just like 'jax, so then grind
It's like MC Kickin-It, one time like this and that
Step back, Jack, goin black for black
Yeah, not wearin a Kangol, but maybe a cable
Thick shades, now you know, no lookin like Kool Moe
Yo, the rhyme that I'll be kickin will collect
D-d-d-all respect, so why should I fess?
And I'm kickin it

Da-bigga-da yeah
Huh, and I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)",https://genius.com/Mc-breed-and-dfc-just-kickin-it-lyrics
