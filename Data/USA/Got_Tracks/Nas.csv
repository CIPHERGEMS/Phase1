N.Y. State of Mind,Illmatic,1994.0,"Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
And black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Ether,Stillmatic,2001.0,"Fuck Jay Z!
(What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Brace yourself for the main event,
 
y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greetings
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome,
 
come out of my throne!
I got this locked since '91,
 
I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame,
 
kept my name in his music

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a 
camel
 
and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo
, 
and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called 
Blueprint
 (dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips,
 
why don't you let the late great veteran live?

I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy,
 
a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please!
 
You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat,
 
compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G.
 – 
and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!",https://genius.com/Nas-ether-lyrics
Life’s a Bitch,Illmatic,1994.0,"[Intro: AZ and 
Nas
]
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one,
 cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go

The World Is Yours,Illmatic,1994.0,"(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (It's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls

We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw

Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian:
 
half-man, half-amazin'

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, 
slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang,
 
begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops,
 givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple,
 
I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in 
Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks

When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged
—
plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man , one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man , one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big , one love
To , yeah, one love",https://genius.com/Nas-one-love-lyrics
If I Ruled the World (Imagine That),It Was Written,1996.0,"Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, 
no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, 
these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with 
diamond Roles
Your people holding dough
, no parole, 
no rubbers
Go in raw
, imagine 
law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""
[
Chorus
: 
Lauryn Hill
 + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world
 (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, 
Lost Tribe of Shabazz
, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast
, 
dime sexes
 and 
Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl
, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, 
I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, 
purple M3's
 and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons
, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies 
or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons,
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em baby!",https://genius.com/Nas-if-i-ruled-the-world-imagine-that-lyrics

Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done
, 
won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser;
 
police got me under pressure

Represent, represent
Represent, represent

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, 
my brother Jungle,
 
Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it;
 
Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death - the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in your system every night, now

Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing

Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know'm sayin'? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, God, what is it?
(It's like…) Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas
, 
then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite
, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace God!) Peace God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: Is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real!
 
Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Halftime,Illmatic,1992.0,"(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm a ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Aiyyo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime

(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out

(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime
(Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost

One Mic,Stillmatic,2001.0,"One time, yeah, yeah

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!

All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)

I call it, yeah, yeah

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

Affirmative Action,It Was Written,1996.0,"This is what, this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about?
Word, time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy
, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got an ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like 
Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moët Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, 
from BK to the Bridge,
 
my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in 
Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with
 
visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it, times three, we got 48, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see

And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'?
I be tryin' to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool to ask?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris' with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of ""Me & My Bitch"" by Biggie

I Can,God’s Son,2003.0,"I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world,
 
in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, 
Lena Horne
, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person,
 got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be) (Now, go)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose
 
to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my Queen""

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Bye Baby,Life Is Good,2012.0,"I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us

And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After bein' blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops

My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floatin' like I'm on the North 95 Interstate

And expand the lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven

I Gave You Power,It Was Written,1996.0,"Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me

Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watchin' Kathie Lee & Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezin' executioner
Winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxin', my bitches, they be laughin'
They high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tacchini
Flippin' mad pies, low price, I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip-hop's got me on some ol', sprayin' shots like a drum roll
Blankin' out, never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
Watchin' crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holdin' government names from Ness

Up early, trustworthy as a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin' out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'mma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon-roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up
It's off the hook while I just wrote a statement
Like I'm facin' twenty years in the basement
Chillin' on a VI with Mumia, for wearin' chrome
I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone, I'm thrown, yo

Yo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation

A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy
Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed toward the peasy haired brick houses
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transporting thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped
Watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin' mad feelings
Peelin' off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'

Get Down,God’s Son,2003.0,"Get, get, get down!

Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?

Yeah, word
Got some Rémy Martin
And some good-ass cigars, check it out

Ayo, late night, candlelight,
 
fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck,
 panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, 
I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key,
 my jewelry in HD

Silent rage,
 pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon
Maserati, 
pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car,
 rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact, haha...

(Nasty) Nasty kid

(Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah...

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Saying, ""It was Nas I used to hustle with""
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist, past this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, 
I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors

Wrote My Way Out,The Hamilton Mixtape,2016.0,"(""I wrote my way out"")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and ""I wrote my way—"" out

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power—just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean?

Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and ""I wrote my way—"" out

I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt

High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin';
""Oh, you think you smart?""—Blaow!—start bleedin'
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, ""Pssh—you'll get 'em right back.""
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
""Damn, you got no chill,"" fuckin' right—I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?

(""I wrote my way out"")
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)

Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings?

From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM'

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out

Cops Shot the Kid,NASIR,2018.0,"The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
""Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!""
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, ""Ree, put your hands up, black boy!""

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests

Kanye West

No Introduction,Life Is Good,2012.0,"J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like ""Mister, spare-a-quarter""
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen, I got a gun
Sixteen, I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

""Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!""

I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

""Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!""

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis, this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha

Got Ur Self a...,Stillmatic,2001.0,"Woke up this mornin' (yeah)
You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in 
Belly
 with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, 
your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want

You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, 
son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 
'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, 
put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that?
 
Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off,
 rich kids go and cop 
The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya
 (uhh)

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

Trust,UnKnown,2012.0,"It's like a cold story.. repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind, yeah
This shit be real, man..
Shit's crazy out here..
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?
That's my niggas over there, word

If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me
It’s a lesson every premonition
Lot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust,
 shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

It's been so long, can’t remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off
I see your moms, she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It’s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder, will it change? Let's ride…

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust,
 shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word ""fresh"" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust,
 shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?

You’re Da Man,Stillmatic,2001.0,"Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas – too real, Nas – true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since ""... Barbeque""
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the crafts of the streets
But look at me now

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man",https://genius.com/Nas-youre-da-man-lyrics
What Goes Around,Stillmatic,2001.0,"Yeah..

Ayo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

In hospitals, shots riddle the block, little
Children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' Rest In Peace
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
""Life is short"" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses – it's all poison

Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices

When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they're gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial
Hateful toward themselves, denyin' even their blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods
But I overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

Yo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

Never to worry, all the wrong-doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse, but we'll get through it, y'all, be strong!

The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday ""hell-day""
‘Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

It's all poison: all of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MCs? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C
This is the problem, ‘cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name? Where you from?
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies and they could never be wives
He never used a condom; give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on a nigga's dreams
They leave; when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' their seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em they're spendin' money on trees
I pray for you, deadbeat daddies
'Cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you: now you old and you gettin' shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings, be healthy, remember:

What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga

Light it up, uhh

The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne
 
with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it
Write it, across the stomach spell ""God son""
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind

Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah… light it up
Light it up, uhh

Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail,
 makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood,
 blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, 
it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation,
 cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness

You believe in your own lies, can't be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior, I target that
You impressed with what they wearin', I started that

It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me
So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve

A Queens Story,Life Is Good,2012.0,"Uhh, 
rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors,
 eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU
, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...

Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(
You all know how the story GO!
)

""Any other real niggas in the world besides us?"" I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, 
I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, 
hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling",https://genius.com/Nas-a-queens-story-lyrics
Rewind,Stillmatic,2001.0,"Listen up, gangstas and honies with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog—whatever they call you—God, just listen
I spit a story backwards—it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga
Now he back to square one
, screamin', ""shoot don't please""
I put my fifth back on my hip, it's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""go he there""
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, 
it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap
, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""no hell,"" she talkin' about, ""me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said: ""Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill.""

*Beep*
Ayo son, ayo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen, man, this dude right on the block
Right now, man, I found him, right now
I see him right now, let's kill him!

If Heaven was a mile away
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
If Heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (flash?)
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens
Would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power?
Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him
Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?
Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard takin' this, racist planet
Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, ""Nigga, get on the car!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!""
Thinkin' I'ma lose it,
 my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard
And God, your young soldier's not so bold but needs you
This world's my home, but world, I will leave you

Nigga, what you think, I'ma stop 
building?
I'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days, in the hallways
Makin' fake gold caps
With the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks
Free of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the Earth

You trapped in your own hell
Every day I wake up I'm blessed
Every day you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed
To all them niggas runnin' around
Talkin' about, ""I'm fucked up,"" ""I got to get on,"" ""I got to…""
""I'm in the grind,"" ""I'm fucked up""
Yeah, we all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up
Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money
Got nothin' to do with nothin' material
I'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart
In your own world, baby, in your own existence
To my moms, look at me, baby

Book of Rhymes,God’s Son,2002.0,"Alchemist, you know me, man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it

How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass— (Nah, let me start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called ""Vagina Monologue,"" 
it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, 
he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes

Oh shit, Tina!
I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn
No, this rhyme is weak
This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here

Gandhi was a… what the fuck?

Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest

The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life
Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares
(Nah, that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real
I can't fight you, ‘cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that 
Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap

This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit!

Hah, you a funny nigga...

Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that!
I musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this?!

I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful?
Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you ‘cause all you do is smile
And things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset ‘cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention
I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant

Déjà vu,It Was... Remixed (Rare Unreleased & Remixed),UnKnown,"Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamour, glitters, and gold
I unfold the scroll,
 
plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, 
police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat, 
nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Booster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle
Holdin’ weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Gettin' props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle,
 
niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back and do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, I presume the unpredictable
Gun salute life rapidly, that's the ritual

Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...

Blunts, thugs and alcohol, what a mixture
Just picture, ya life as a whole judged in court they convict ya
They telling you your state of mind, like you worthless
So he curses, his mom saying Bible verses
That's all she works with
But miracles never leave the churches
Instead, it hits the pockets of the Preacher just to purchase
A house, with a swimming pool, labels me a sinning fool
I'm just a nigga who inherited a winning jewel
To be a trendsetter, whenever subject to
Respect this and all respect due is the essential
To street life, hustlin’, the struggle, broke ghettos
Boiling coke settles slow inside a glass kettle
Darren Levy on my TV, lifestyles of living easy
Got my crew tense, plottin’ to jips, to get whips with BBs
Pushing cakes, knew anorexics with ten plates
Celebrating elevation in the seeds that we make
So How You Like That?

Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

Escobar life,
 gems and raw Timbs
Gators for pretty boy haters
In Vegas with chicks trickin’ fortunes
I'm glistening, housing cops whistling
Still I'm drifting in a high, blunts is like insulin
95-I, I drive high, zoning
Stash box zone in my trunk, I flash knots, teeth golden
Look at me now, Ma
Blowin’, but how far?
Cars, cash, and bitches got me out more
And things you never dreamed I can vouch for
Snake niggas slither on their A-alikes
I ain't a Christian, but I find that we pray alike
Never the one to ask for the time to a saint
A mask and nine, I think, will make my problems sink
Down a canal, similar to how we drink
Distinct diamond-flooded Sphinx shines on my links
Drug money, snortin’ bitches, in the end of times
Got my nine, 'til I flatline, nigga, give me mine

Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? 
It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, 
hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'
Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'

shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building—
come out later wearin' camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men
Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had 8 partners growin' up, 8 turned to 7
7 turned to 6 niggas, got 2 in heaven
6 of us holdin' it, now it's 5 rollin' thick
The 6th one's parole flipped, 5 niggas went to 4 quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', 4 niggas still hangin'
Years passin' and slang changin'—3 of us now, 4th nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit
Fake shit—beat his ass down
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is 2 of my best friends
And we all goin' out to the death for these ends

Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs
Hoodrats flashin' they tongue
Young thugs blastin' they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave
'Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's easy
To score but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors

What would I do if I could suddenly feel
And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile
I might lay back for a while
Tell me what, what, what would I do if I could feel?

I was young, I was survivin' the times
Waitin' for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hopin' I'm next

He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house buyin'
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy just gettin' some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seein' hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinkin', ""Wow, she moved me!""
Same girl then right now's a groupie
Back then she was like the star in a movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes 
were dookie
Eric B man lookin' like touch it, he shoot me

I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder, could they tell? How did they know?
Sixteen years later, here I go

But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees

But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more

I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, 'cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever

know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams

Just like a rose

They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas

I done went to hell and back
, you always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em, right?
You resent me every time I make a million, right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar

Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more",https://genius.com/Nas-roses-lyrics
Queens Get the Money,Nas,2008.0,"Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper-chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations
Over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters
They daddies faceless
Play this, by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray ""Please God, let him spit that 'Uzi in the army lining'
That 'shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining'""
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming
This is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his nine at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that ""nigga"" shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image, spit it
I'm Huey P in Louis V
At the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett
And you ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of Earth or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils
That brought down the Towers",https://genius.com/Nas-queens-get-the-money-lyrics
Watch Dem Niggas,It Was Written,1996.0,"They never realized how real Nas is so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'd be sticking you
The mag' inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways

Now, how can I perfect this? (Uhh, what?)
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, 
driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to ""Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school, not far from The Apollo
My 'fuck tomorrow' motto
 
through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado
, 
word to Cus D'Amato

Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways

Some niggas watch you (Uhh)
See you when you think you on the low
, ain't hard to spot you
You swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself 'nobody's taking mine'
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, ""Where's the hundred grand?"", stripping her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffing ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, 
just a reminder:
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could've passed out, your coke is gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do (What, hah)
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh)
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh-huh)
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways (Uhh)",https://genius.com/Nas-watch-dem-niggas-lyrics
Simple Things,NASIR,2018.0,"And I know where I'm going to

I'm lookin' in Longevity's eyes
I play with Infinity's mind, Forever's my guy
My pedigree, above your ass, you'll never see I
I love the past, but see where I'm goin', I get to fly
Never sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase
Without production I'm worthless
But I'm more than the surface
Want me to sound like every song on the Top 40
I'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me
I drop lines prestigious schools read to their students
Look at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music
Was lovin' women you'll never see
All you know's my kids' mothers, some celebrities
Damn, look at the jealousy!
Lucky me, I meet some beauties
Make you wanna shoot me
Hate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie
Facts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes
Get married 'cause we wasn't that match, my G
Don't attach me to the games, I'm lucky, I'm blessed
One of my exes could be your next, dog—trust me, don't test

It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life
It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life

Rollin' dice, throw no aces
With my gangsters, we discussin' buyin' acres
Other safe bets, nothin' regular or basic
Ridin' back to back, me and Jungle in some spaceships
Where the squad at?
You can see us on the ave, chop it up as always
Stand up Queensbridge, now the world know us
Everybody sayin' my humility's infectious
I just want my kids to have the same peace I'm blessed with",https://genius.com/Nas-simple-things-lyrics
Black Girl Lost,It Was Written,1996.0," Hello?
 Whassup, girl?
 Ain't nothing - this nigga in here stressing
Talking that old off the wall, back to Africa shit again
 What, that God Body shit?
 Yeah, that dumb shit
I'm trying to get up OUTTA here
 I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumping tonight
 Word, f'real, where?
 You know, where the real niggas is popping the Cristal
Not that White Star!
 Ha hah! Word, where the real niggas at?

Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby, baby, listen

A young, wild, beautiful love child
You like 'em thug style, link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink, a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel, looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (So fine..)
To see ya prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man
But you juggle way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear, get your fuck on
Following week, you back there, but what you stuck on?
Weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up, ma? Fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo, it should be a throne for us
But for now, that's a whole different zone from us, word!

Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

Like Isis, he got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up, girl, instead, you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trifless
To get his mind, all you do is give him something priceless
'Cause in time, he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed
(Deceit, yeeeahhh)
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you
You never listen to this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past, though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree

Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

Where are you focused? On legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo, you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop 'em off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost
(You should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn, look, there goes a black girl lost

You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong

Destroy & Rebuild,Stillmatic,2001.0,"This is a journey into the world's most largest and notorious projects: Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers

He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile
Depressed has a complex, his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ahh, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
(But it's so hard) to put a coward's name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood,
 don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy (far.. far away)
(Backward ass niggas, man fuck them niggas
Go head with the program man proceed)
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, 
you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you, a cheque's due for me for your fame
Mega, I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name
 (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown: ""How that sound?"" Poor thing!
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

""The Bridge is over,"" my dick!
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'!
Braveheart to the graveyard! 
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood - rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real!
Ayo Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or don't even rep this, man!
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets man!
Yo niggas is in the grind! Where you be at man?
Niggas be buckin'!
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man! Stay out the magazines!
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth!
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin':
That means the cowards get out, and real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side:
Hating me cause I'm beautiful!
Real niggas in Queensbridge:
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby!

To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw

I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man

Undying Love,I Am...,1999.0,"Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evening from Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin' with some nigga
Mumblin' shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbin' his dick, toastin' wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through

I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?

Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger cocked the Glock, and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""
.. we elope

Dance,God’s Son,2002.0,"One more time, one more time
Uh, one more time
Uh, one more time

I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin'
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But Mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have—

One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up
For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have—

One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

I love you forever, Mom
You will always live through me, always
Uh, uh, uh, yeah",https://genius.com/Nas-dance-lyrics
Still Dreaming,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006.0,"And as the sun sets
And the night falls
And them ho's call

He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving ""Shorty, hi"", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

Some people really (Still dreamin')
Some people really (Make you scream out)
Some people really are (Still dreamin')
Still dreamin' (Wha-wha-wha-wha-One-two one two)
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
They are still dreamin'(Wha-wha-wha-wha-One-two one two)
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
Some people really (Yeah)
Some people really (y-y-yeah)
Some people really are (Ugh)

How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye
We on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on


She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual
‘Cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards",https://genius.com/Nas-still-dreaming-lyrics
Be A Nigger Too,UnKnown,2008.0,"Turn your radios up
You are now allowed to listen to the radio
The real niggas are back on the radio

Uh, no slackin', no beggin', no askin', no fastin'
No disrespect to Islam nor Imam or Pastor
No answers to questions the media's askin'
Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists?
They love it; puttin' old niggas verse the youngest
Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggas
There's verbal books published by niggas, produced by niggas
Genuine niggas, so I salute my niggas
Not mad 'cause Eminem said, ""Nigga,"" 'cause he my nigga
Wigga,
 
cracker

we all black within, okay?
We all African, okay
Some Africans don't like us no way!
A killing happened in Johannesburg, yesterday
Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked
Some say N-double-A-C-P, keep us sidetracked
But I don't buy that, I buy Aston Martins
Faster cars than, NASCAR cars
 and, sparkin' while ridin'
Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich
With this N-word jargon I'm just startin', bitch!

I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too?
To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers

Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too
They like to strangle niggers, blamin' niggers, shootin' niggers, hangin' niggers
Still you wanna be a nigga, too? True

Wake up in the morning, shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on the nightstand
, I'm the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you
If that means I can't sleep a whole year, I'ma get you
I'm official not ""A-Tisket"" or ""A-Tasket""
I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet
They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed
Don't forsake us, you all are fake bloods like move make-up
I flow tighter as Tootie's braces
, who be hatin' us?
I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust
'Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters
Clique still movin' like Freemasons
So if I'm on the flow for the law, there's lodges all across the nation
Nas is bred for the plan, to hold the Grand
Dragon's head in my hand

Thugz Mansion (N.Y.),God’s Son,2002.0,"I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey
A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks
Missionaries pass out papers that read ""Love God""
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, 
no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide,
 no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion",https://genius.com/Nas-thugz-mansion-ny-lyrics
Doo Rags,The Lost Tapes,2002.0,"Pushin' drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah
X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicidal feds on the blocks where I played b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
'Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil
'Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin' niggas swing razors in the front row
Then out in the streets, the car show, 560's, chemical Afros
Acuras pumpin' Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin' lip gloss, big door knockers peelin' they earlobes
So where them years go?
Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here though, so

The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin', ""Join the armed forces!""
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigga crawlin' in the corporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin' police uniforms, Confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin' to the music I chose
And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tootin' they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago
Loaded-up llamas, children with fo'-fo's and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle, yo

The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin' hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin' till awareness started penetratin'
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggas
Turnin' nothin' into somethin' is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggas in chains
From Green to Sing-Sing I'm wantin' y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got ""God's Son"" on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected
From Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo, because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin' caps, not for the waves, obeyin' no laws
And it's like that

The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time

Nigga, hit some of this shit, nigga

I'm tired of these niggas, niggas stealin' beats
And niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit
Niggas wanna take everything from a nigga, man

Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'?
Just like niggas can't do what you do
Right, right
You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know, all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East coast/West coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
Word
Fuck it
What is it, what is it, God?
Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
And get paid, and just, let that be it
All these niggas talkin' all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens

The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal, not fictitious
I rock the cable '86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on the top of the sand
In the heat of the moment
Like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes
Chrome kitted up, calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats, quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move, get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run, the lead travels
I come through, it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the fam'
Crew, Firm affiliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars
Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout - murder material, serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo

Nas is coming

Nasty Nas is coming

From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game? You got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, The Bridge say ""shake dice and kiss it""
Sip Cris', push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen, y'all
Nas, y'all, fly gangsta, wavy hair, teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk
Links truck, rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond Rol', hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive, he struggling for the phone, fo-fo blow him
When homicide comes, these three words are sung

Nas is coming

""When I flow for the street.."" - "".. who else could it be""
""Nas..""

Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers
, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, 
the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin'
Livin carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood

Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair,
 still slingin', got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin' 
Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five
, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

Baby girl she's always talkin', name droppin', hangin' late
Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy,
 craves shoppin'
E poppin' Ecstasy takin',
 won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations
Lustin' men, many hotels, 
Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin', she the same person
Never matures, all her friends married doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess she's in her second childhood

Shootouts,It Was Written,1996.0,"Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open let your Gi-Glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down
Ayo the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now

Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God just save the life that the Devil sold
See It Was Written but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two to four
Niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord
Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Somethin' in the air yeah
Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin' - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-Cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five

Shootouts is similar to Wild West

Grow stubble on the face for once without a smooth cut?
Grow a little gut, can't even enjoy the fruit of my labor
Before they call me Luke and hand me my lightsaber
The ruler's back, you can tell by the trumpets
Prince of Wales sent me tea, biscuits, crumpets
Jewelry cost more than the car, car cost 200

Jay Elec doesn't write it
HOV couldn't write it, he vacationin'
Jungle the only brother I take shit from
Hassan give me lines, we talk all the time
So I guess if he inspired my song it ain't mine
Let me make this clear, they fear the gifted
Some say Shakespeare never existed
Wow, now, look at the amount of resistance
Attempts to chisel my face, from the mountain you guessed it
Bitch you guessed it
There, did I answer your questions?
So, now that's out the way let's get back to my message
Now I'm 40 and a little change
Ride around, sport a new Benz, a little Range
Havin' fun, my little man gettin' big
He and my daughter down, when we talk it's real
Nothin' is watered down, young boy swag
I'm here today as well as the 90's
But the past, like my ass, is behind me
Ignite the pyrex
Try to bite this, get Nasty Nas-itis
Arthritis when you try to write this
Asking why is the Feds at my niggas?
Why the Feds at my niggas?
I know by now I should be talkin' bread, crack, and figures
But not stressin', knot stressin'
I'm survivin', I'm survivin'
It's funny when I catch cops textin' and drivin'
Who questions and penalizes them?
One day we'll have their ass in court and we'll be tryin' them
Hey yo, it's love for Detroit, Mo-Town, Motor City
Dilla lives on, it's like he wrote it with me
The soulful sample complements my rhyme so well
Slacks by Zegna, or YSL
Matchin' the Saint Laurents, I'm fly as hell
Hands in the air, the season of Nasir

The Set Up,It Was Written,1996.0,"Uhh.. (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Q.B. since 1933 (no doubt)
To nine-six
 (nine-six motherfucker)
Check the shit

Nine-six, Escobar 600

Check the shit
My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Beamers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on the dosa
, I called Sosa
""Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge, I'm bout to go loca""
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two MACs inside the Volvo
What up, God? I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav' gotta soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down, kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo
What up, son? These niggas done started somethin' wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name, holdin' the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point 'em out, smoke a Phil' then chill
I laid back, Escobar status
Knowin' The Firm got it cornered, we on it
Shit we was born with

Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo, it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back, let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo, it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
We finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back, let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

Hold it right there, pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders
He's stuntin', after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus
And Vicious, lookin' delicious, handle yo' business
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco of all ages
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him ""Don't grab, boo""
(What up, boo? What up? What up? What up?)
They started chattin', was only 'bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed him pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and 'em
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said ""Say no more"", we started rollin'
Before we got in, they must have shot him
Security wildin', there the girls go, hurry up, we out in
The 940, me, Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy

Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo, it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back, let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

Suspect,It Was Written,1996.0,"It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner, people swarmin'
Three in the mornin', I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck!""
Niggas is buck, mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo, he should've ducked""
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for real-a
I'm all high, i
t's late, I'm lookin' down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop ya life clock
, t
he beast'll time ya
Cell to cell, suspect ass nigga, you fail
First time locked in Comstock
, 
my mind blocks the frail
Burstin', blastin' at your forty cal' shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch, why tell?
We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities
Queens'll be the death of me

To the suspect witness: Don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight

You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
Suspect witness, don't come outside

Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Givin' the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests, feel the essence
Try to test this scientist, able and reckless, slaughter
Nautica down, frames look petite
Ten millis, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancin', sippin' the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rollin' two Phillies together, make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The weddin' of a freak and a beast
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, 
niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you with, lucci or drama?
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya

Suspect witness, don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight

It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized

Decipher my deceiver, make him a believer

Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'

Stillmatic (The Intro),Stillmatic,2001.0,"Uhh, y'know
I still run with that, that blood of a slave, boilin' in my veins
It's just hot - until a nigga can't take it no more
Blood of a slave, heart of a King - turn my voice up

Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt
They thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin'
Never backwards stupid here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced directed by
The Kid slash Escobar; narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning - nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crips to Pirus, this is survival

I carry the cross

Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea,
 then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death and I'm buggin'
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mother's life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path

I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; 
.30 cals,
 10 millimeters
.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on
'Posed to be Earth

From here on it's a new day
Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate

Blunt Ashes,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006.0,"Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories
I'mma get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated
Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that
While I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah

The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, 
the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swings

As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ash tray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossing in the grave like, ""This is how you repay me?!""
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said ""No mountain's high enough,"" fly stuff
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell
Gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside


John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery
It interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals
She's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!
Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington
Someone is sabotaging 'em
Watch out for the traps
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange


I could smell old bogey cigars
Long record perfumes, smelling just as sweet
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top
Like Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby – know what I mean?
Yo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout
Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar
For playing Mammy in ""Gone with the Wind""
And she didn't get allowed
Wasn't even allowed to go to the premier
Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint
Man, you know they were strong back then, man

Just a Moment,Street’s Disciple,2005.0,"Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here
This for my dogs, stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Criping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching

As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

Yeah and can we have another moment of silence
For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence
From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying
And can we please pour some more liquors
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

And can we please have a moment to mourn
For Pac, Biggie and Pun, 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home",https://genius.com/Nas-just-a-moment-lyrics

Tilted brim like Goldie talking
Pryor listening, my prior women had no remorse
When they tried to end on no discourse, no discussion
I'm all alone and all the people with the big hats on went home
So what you gon' do now, Goldie? Your bottom left you
It's up to me and you, Goldie, through introspection
You ain't Goldie, you Nas, and my heart ain't cold as it was
And I go through multiple love triangles over and over enough
I talk to my boxing trainer, he's my logic explainer
Conversations through our combination
He told me, ""Stick and move,"" and ""Different rules apply to different women""
Some women's into licking women
Some women's independent, some women want brothers who educated
Some women want Benz's, leather seats that are perforated
Some do malevolent snake shit
Yo, you can miss me with that fake shit (
Peace king

Dialogue superb, flyest cars on the curb, word
When I evolved, a higher God emerged reserved
More subtle, come from the stress and the struggle
Young then, obsessed in the bubble about it
Took advantage if a woman allowed it
One of the foulest, some would say I was childish, money-driven
Mischievous, I perceived it as livin', gifts and ribbons
Any kisses on the lips was forbidden, I was on it
She curvy, then shorty was cornered, no worries
For the naughty, it was higher performance, or was it really?
The games that I was playin' was silly
Similar to them days when I was packin' that milly, it could've killed me
Caution never crossin' my mind, she callin' cryin'
Me, I'm more concerned why she ain't fallin' in line, was buggin'
Grew a lot since they said I was stubborn
Guess it's real, even players need lovin'
When you enamored by female companions, there's no standards
Once you hit and it switch the dynamics, that's the damage
Reflectin' on first impressions, what's she expectin'?
Why when men don't follow directions, it's deception?
[Verse 3: Cormega & 
Foxy Brown

I was intrigued by fine women, I realized
Some were drop-dead gorgeous living a lie
Oblivious to beauty inside truly defines
Will you walk with me or are you there for the ride?
For better or worse, every blessing and curse
Understand exotic sands come after the dirt
I was dealing since adolescent
Thinking my girl was my possession, I stand corrected
It takes understanding and affection
Time is money, I need growth for my investment
I don't like attention unless it's a woman
With majestic grace like an empress in Essence

Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome

Follow; I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late
 Malik Sealy
The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

Learn to try it like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin' outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, 
you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em

We Will Survive,I Am...,1999.0,"Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

To my dogs.. wherever you are

Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

(Thug Life never die..)
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that

.. always survive.. but why?

Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggas just stay alive",https://genius.com/Nas-we-will-survive-lyrics

Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian they read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (God damn)
And my mystique got 'em tearin' my clothes

Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'

If he cough he might die, passin' me trees
The liquor bottle's almost empty
We about to collide, with the enemy
Only way you die if it's meant to be
You fuckin' with a general
No discussion is the principle we bust and it's the end of you
Now we knockin' on your mama door
Like we came to fix the sink; my kind of war
Death, angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog dog, the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas

Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared?
Do it like this niggas right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start
""I shall - stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never, cooperate with the law
Never snake me I always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death I swear""
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance, to the alliance
Of underworlds killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green, and pass it around, pass it around

Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns

She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure

And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Something in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by

Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talking this divorcing shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too

Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, 
we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, cooling off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level
It's not unusual
To see photos of dead homies funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene

They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are

Do I mean it like a slave master, nigga?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes
Take off the bracelets
Savage when broke, smoke sour diesel, 
need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreaming of
Between cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes,
 
trying to get it like Medellin

They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, 
we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rapping for fame
I got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains
Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They calling it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king

They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, 
we are the slave and the master

King’s Disease,King’s Disease,2020.0,"Yeah
Hello, ladies and gentlemen
Hit-Boy

I made the fade famous, the chain famous
QB on my chest match the stainless
Amazing Grace, I'm gracefully aging
Without masonry, I made more paper to play with
No rap in my playlist, sold dimes on my day shift (
King
)
So, can I breathe? Can I walk? Can I speak? Can I talk?
Can I floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?
Family gossiping, pocket watching him
Jealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (
King
)
'Cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing
That you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping
The stupidest part of Africa produced Blacks that started algebra
Proof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh
Nostalgia, how I remembеr things
Remember crowns, remember, kings
They want your reign to cease (
King
)
You a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely
We're so ""Say less when I speak"", y'all estrogen speak
Respected by kings only, address me as chief
Invested in things only a vet would
Only lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps
You mad at my niggas and any woman with interest in me
You could've made it (You was good), look at all the time wasted
Now you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics
All you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit
You should want every brother to make it out
But brothers want trophies, they troll for clout
Rap is weird, weird flex, but okay
You ain't as ill as you think, you just okay
You got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top
Stop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness
It's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless
My life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? (Why me?)
Real kings everywhere, stand up
It come with the game (

The Black Bond,Life Is Good,2012.0,"I pull a string on the lamp and shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and
Alky on the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving nogging
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden
Nah bitch, Nas is In the real deal
Food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags
Full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes saying ""Nas, you're one lucky bastard""
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past ya

Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrods in England
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the Tundra
Get humbled or disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks, you must wanna die
But you fronting, why? When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's a (?), and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
It’s like I'm allergic, to Nonoxynol 9
Give it to you raw so you can feel it",https://genius.com/Nas-the-black-bond-lyrics
Rule,Stillmatic,2001.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, every day is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, ""dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town""
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must open up his eyes
To the set backs and rise
Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds, is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo

All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now

All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that man, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is like
Whatever you want out of life
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
Even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on
That's what this country's about

Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothers on lockdown on their cot feel it
It's real in the field, the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood

Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies looking proper
Look good enough to be taken shopping
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night (End of the night, babe)
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearing my medallion

Think y'all got to ease up though, you know

Not cows with four legs
But cals with more lead
That add up more dead
It's on nigga, I'ma bury 'em
Niggas don't want beef they vegetarian
Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarean (woo!)
I push ya grown ass back in your mother's womb
You need 9 more months
Your crews 9 more punks
You rhyme on stuff and claim I ain't sign y'all up
If I sign y'all I'm on dust
Yeah we from the same hood but nigga WHAT?!
When y'all was tryna rap y'all was makin' me proud
Man now you fucked up down on your luck, runnin' your mouth man
Why don't be a real man, say you need a little help
And I might help your ass off the shelf
But no, you're bein' disrespectful

Gangs of New York

Back together with the master plan
The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man
I'm in the streets like old graffiti
I'm hearin' wankstas talkin' greasy
Whether broke or rich my friend
Nasir bring that career to an end
And I'm bored with you MCs B
Y'all beneath me
And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouija
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on
And I blind y'all 'cause they call me

Pinky heavy man, big stones in the wedding ban'
Smell of brimstone back from Hell again

This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio
What does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual
Extreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world
Man that is righteous, faithful and keeps law
Will surely live declares the sovereign Lord
And you are none of the above
So you a sucka for death
, 
if I'm a sucka for love
And y'all wanna know why I don't gotta answer niggas
'Cause I truly understand these niggas
Scared of me so they talk about family members
Like I can't point out your grandma to niggas
Damn you was my man like crew
, dog
Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog
The Q is the borough of true Dons
Any disrespect nigga we choose arms
Will it be Gilmore or Crowe's?

What you hear you ain't ever hear 'til I repped it
Iridescent heroes essence, please clear the exits
I chase demons outdoors, force 'em to hear the message, air 'em out
Heard some people discussing my whereabouts
Yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
Never seen much, but yet I'm never in the house
Move in style, wild, exciting when I do step out
Y'all been rhyming for years and Jungle made a hit
""Oochie Wally"" I did
Sold a million records
Had 'em embarrassed
Signed to Columbia
Blew a check, he was laughing
While y'all in the studio bragging about your past and
Thinking back on trips on Manhattan
Dad was rolling hotels like The Plaza
Black bellhops holding
Rich people bags, tip their hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine holding doors for them

To rappers who never sold crack, telling other people's lives
Never shot nobody but be shooting people in their rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talking about when they're writing most of their lines
And I ain't notice it
Trapping was what was happening with bolder cliques
Around me I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckers ain't had no say so
Whoever put you in the position to have a say so should be questioned theyself
I'm silk shirts, summer time sunny, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster
City girl love maker
The matinee watcher
The good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper

Become a byproduct of yourself all for the paper regardless
The markets see you as a old-ass artist
The McCartneys live past the Lennons, but Lennon's the hardest
Stay on your path, stay on your craft
They just want you to switch your lanes up so they can hate on your ass
What's in a name? What's in a name? Suffering and pain
Guts, blood, and tears, aim straight, game face, king's grace
I came in this thinkin' you was gon' be this great thing
'Cause I seen the greats do it with a great queen
What these kings have in common? They had women who solid
Malcolm needed Betty, I met some queens who wasn't ready
They envy the unhappiness of the greats
They don't have a fulfilled life yet, so they searchin' for ways
To feel what Sam felt, play the hand Marvin was dealt
A Vandross, here's the cure, the antidote
A thousand milligrams, make sure you don't overdose
Turned to a businessman, used to serve 'em in the cold
Cold game, don't get exposed, stories get told
You glamorize the game, it ain't a glorious road
Rest in peace Kobe and Nip, that's off the rip

Kings honor kings, straight from my pops to my son's shit
Steak tartare bloody, mercury levels from raw fish
Sushi for lunch, waiter at the table, the cork twist
I'm studied like a book by many
They give me looks of envy, I took the Bentley
White chick like Liz Taylor might get the Bentayga
On my Rick James behavior
Life is school for the soul and I'm in life seven already
Life's simple but heavy, incomprehensible shit
Everything from sexy to deadly, I done been through that shit
Still goin' deeper like I grew a new inch on my dick
We looked at robbin' as a way of resolving our problems
My moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving
And whatever they was down to do, I was with 'em regardless
Turns out I was hungry and was hittin' the hardest
Decisions was sharper, my predictions was on it
No fortune teller, just going off regular signs
Niggas often tell ya they moves
Without a word, just reading they mind
Wasn't needin' no nine
Corner executive born in ghetto hell
Where metal yell especially over necklaces
Life lessons is karma
Whatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya
Could miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor
That's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back
Play the Clue tapes for old verses
Messin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas will rise 'em up
Like they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I need a witness, drinkin' three at night on some Bridge shit
Wearin' shorts and Timbs, summer night on some Bridge shit
Party with gangsters, gettin' right on some Bridge shit (Yeah)
Like MC Shan and Marley, I be on some Bridge shit

Yeah
Like Jabari, I'm on some Bridge shit
Shooter live on
Kings live forever

Out of luck, no constructive plans
My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand
You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man
Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't
But every church in the world can't save our children
I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be
Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately
Them bullets had some other names on it, a brother was blind
I hit the L, then we yell out, ""It wasn't my time!""
I loaded up shells, one by one, you smelled blunt from my room door
Little Nasir was at war
And little did I care what you saw
Crew deep with a few heat, now it's time we settle the score
But in the projects, I visit Muhammad, in linen garments
Preaching Man, Woman, and Child, the living Prophet
And I'm similar, Nasir Bin Olu Dara
Visqu Allah, fist full of dollars in the dice game God
The Ice King, God, the Black Christ, elegant stance
Clothes fit me like a crime boss, the medicine man
I see the world collapsing, young pregnancies
Young girls are unfastening they Sasoon jeans, no prophylactic
All this fashion and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary
N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me
Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with money bags
Stop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast
And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York
You show off, I count off when you sample my voice
I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens
Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding?
Is he H to the izzo, M to the izzo?
For shizzle you phony, the rapper version of Sisqo
And that's for certain, you cloned me, your wack clothes line
I'd rather Sean John, bore me with your fake coke rhymes
And those times, they never took place, you liar
Un was your first court case, you had no priors
You master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick
Have you surrounded, you and them faggot you down with
While they riding NAS, trying to boost their careers

That's the answers to the puzzle I gave you, now here's a promise
My next few albums, instead of projects
They'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics
Come in my hood, but bring the guns with you, it's dark
Headed through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx
Headed through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts
New Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town, every block
I'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page
Did crimes and headline on stage
I signed a contract, so here it is, you have it

Black Zombie,The Lost Tapes,2002.0,"Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day,
 
there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reparations
, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

Ayo, we trapped in our own brain, fucked behind bars
We've already gone insane
We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
'Cause whites ain't got none leading them,
 the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet
Let's all get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

You scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel,
 
Bismillah al rahman al rahim
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is ungodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
{*roaring*} .. 
That's the sound
 
of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas.. c'mon, uhh, peace...",https://genius.com/Nas-black-zombie-lyrics

Velvet bow ties
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
'Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my masterminds

It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you lame
And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, ""drive home""
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said ""Goodbye""
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs
That I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon' be
But I'm a mastermind

I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King of New York shit only last 15 minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury
I'm low, smoking Blueberry with a ho
That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it
Squares, they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too

You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo yo yo

Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, 
loving cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work

It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbing niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash

It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end

Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull
Another thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite
Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast
Snook was one of ‘em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this

The video slots broadcasting Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube, MySpace
When this ignorant shit going to stop?
They monopolizing news, your views
And the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky, number 5 on the dial
Secret agenda, frequency antenna, 
Dr. Mindbender
Remote control, soul controller, your brain holder
Slave culture
, game's over
What's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation
Pimp the station, over-stimulation
Reception, deception, Comcast digital Satan
The fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells lies and 
fox-trots
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)

Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And 
unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching

The Fear Factor got you all riled up
O'Reilly?
 
Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, setting them up
MySpace, pimps, hoes and sluts
Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us
What is their net worth?
They're going to try to censor my next verse
Throw them off the roof neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse
While I'm clicking my mouse, while they kick in my house
They figured us out
, why a nigga go south?
It's either he caught a body
Don't sleep, they're watching
I watch CBS, and I see BS
Trying to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga want to invest in PBS (see BS)

unplug from the Matrix doctrine

Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box

They say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill
But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton?
The back 
door deals on oil fields?
How is Nas the most violent person?
Y'all don't know talent if it hit you
Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol
I use Viacom as my firearm
Then let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon?
Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n
I'm dealing with the higher form
Fuck if you care of how I write a poem
Only fox that I loved was the Red one
Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one
Red rum, political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum
Murdoch owns Fox, not A-Team with Baracus
And he hates Barack cause he march with the marches

I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth
Not the biased truth
Not the liest truth
But the highest truth
I will not be deceived
Nor will I believe in the propaganda
I will not fall for the okie-doke
I am tuned in...

Watch what you're watching
Better watch because they're watching
Watch what you're watching

Dedication to my children, my child, Destiny Jones
To my niece and nephews, Suree, Malik, Jabari
The world is yours
Acknowledgements: first off I wanna thank God
And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out with this
Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1

January 28, 1968
Born into this world, William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island
Scientific rhyming invented a new style when
He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like full
The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying
""It can't get better than this""
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap
18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap
Fort Greene, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote
""Smack me and I smack you back""
Sounded like the answer to the ""I Ain't No Joke"" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot
At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx
Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one
Before similar voices were King Sun
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized
Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

Unauthorized Biography of Rakim
Epilogue: Mother was a jazz singer
Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown
Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique
That's the end of the group, went on for solo
Dropped ""The R"", then The 18th Letter, then I think something, The Master
Was signed to Aftermath
Scheduled to release an album Oh My God with Dr. Dre
The album was dismantled because of creative differences

Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in Pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at the Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossin' with Stoute, he had the 'gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin' her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hittin' it raw, tastin' it, wildin' out of my character
Tapin' it, Tyra Banks face and Faith's lips
Givin' head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me 'bout her husband's affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the lye to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sportif
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin'
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adaptin'
P-11's, ACP shells for blastin'
Caught him with his Spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burnin' her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out existence
His maid cried ""No"", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought ""What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision""
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet a-gain...

Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screamin', yo we almost crashed
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass

Ma, I'm sorry who the fuck I am, I can't trust my fans
Out of luck, no constructive plans
My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand
You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man
Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't
But every church in the world can't save our children
I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be
Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately
Them bullets had some other names on it, the brother was blind
I hit the L, then, we yell out, ""It wasn't my time!""
I loaded up shells, one by one
You smelled blunts from my room door, little Nasir was at war
And little did I care what you saw

All this fast shit and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary
N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me
Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with MoneyBags
Stop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast
And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York
You show off, I count dough off when you sample my voice
I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens
Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding?
Is he H to the izz-O, M to the izz-O?
For shizzle you phony, the rapping version of Sisqo
And that's for certain, you clone me, your wack clothes line
I'd rather Sean John, you bore me with your fake coke rhymes
And those times, they never took place, you liar
Un was your first court case, you had no priors
You master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick
Have you surrounded, you and the faggots you down with

I used to be at The Tunnel twenty deep in a huddle
Razors on us that'll make skin bubble, Moet, we guzzle
Chris Lighty let me in a few times with nines
That's on God, wish you woulda walked by
And bumped me hard or just looked at me wrong
My chain on, try to book me, you gone
Goons, Italian leathers, couple bottles of Dom
Took risks, this ain't what you want, there's rules to this
Don't get it misconstrued, my suit gamе is crisp
Silk, linen, chiffon, Dior to Diadora
But I rock custom more, that hustler aura, tap in
Razor cutter, nineties, eighties lover, raised in gutters
Raised above it, they made it up out the hood subject, I made you love it
Crazy, I knew this chick, she had a blue Benz
A Jersey penthouse, she used to pimp girls that would turn rich men out
Her coke habits was so savage
She hear voices and see ghosts on the average
Of her stepdad, he raised her from a carriage
She was twelve when he passed, she's been in hell since that
Her grandma raised her, I met her in Kingston, Jamaica
Where veteran kingpins bought acres, rest in peace Louie Rankin
Original Don Dada

Come here, come rude bwoy
Uno waan ramp with bomboclaat me
Come, come on!
I murder people fi fun
Murder uno bomboclaat fi fun

Peace signs in the air for son
Put his name on the street sign there where he from
Whenever we hear his bangers, flare up a blunt
And praise God, and pray we all prepared when He come for us
Just opened my new office, West Coast branch
Place my teacup on the saucer, it's Esco, man
Bossed up, nothing feels better than doing deals with my brothers
It's surreal, how I feel, y'all should love us
Life is a test so congratulations to your success
For having patience, you deserve the best
You know how they do niggas, the IRS
People I ain't even met take it out my check
They the biggest gangster, I respect the jooks
We buyin' big boy mansions, they respect the crooks
This for my project niggas and blue Benzes

Bridging the Gap,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"[Intro: Nas & 
Olu Dara

The light is there
Yeah yeah
You see I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City
Where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir
All the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive

Let's go!...
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Chuck Berry
 of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

Nas

He'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man alive

Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""
[Chorus: Olu Dara & 
Nas
]
I was born in Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Moved to New York City
Where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir
All the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive 
(Tell 'em!)

Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout all the places you gone to
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
 (Yeah)
Madagascar, 
Paris, Greece
 (Uh huh)
But little Africa is where we live

Not safe to drive, narcos are lookin' (Woop, woop, woop)
No secret compartments in the ride, so keep pushin'
We get stopped, hide it between the seat cushion
Either that, or just tuck it inside your boot
Don't throw it out the window yet, son, that's all our loot (Not yet)

Swept the block where they hung out

Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, 
plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range

It's a lottery, it's loaded,
 
hope I can see all the motives
Before she make a fool out of me

I should know 'cause I'm older
Wasn't meant for me, fuck it, we ain't agree on no subject
We look good together when we was out in the public
You used to brighten my day, had me hype as a kid
First, good morning, good night, now she leave me on read
I'm disappointed, it's different chicks who want it
Can't lie, for a minute, I was sick to my stomach

You need to stop, breathe, think
Before you say the wrong thing

I had to let you off, might have to take a loss
I might have to take a loss, take a loss

Beautiful fly girls caught my eye

Just to figure out, you wasn't dreaming in the first place (no)

If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Claim to, I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata, persona's that of a non-needer
Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless
To my G's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up, a phoenix caked up
Trying to take what I'm eating came up
A dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy, mild, wild hardly
A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that, how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My story is I'm from the home of the thieves

America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention

Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive, Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder, black cop, cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas

Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
This is not what you think it is
America (America, Americaaaaaa
This is not what you think it is)

Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor, took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby, let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700s
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit on the Senate, and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the Bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron like, ""Bring me my dinner dear""
She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far are we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be

Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trial, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from

Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too

Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another,

But, yo, if you got a plan, believe me, you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted, baby
That's my word

Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tourin'
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood MB cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a Le Tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
Look at the chain, I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever

Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever

Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
Gucci, Iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin', ""Damn, wish my niggas could afford this""
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried with your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you
The shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turned 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real

Everything will eventually come to an end

My Way,The Lost Tapes,2002.0,"Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin' my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on?
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin' to The Supremes, smokin' joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', backspins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bulletproof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin' cash in the air
Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond
I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)

(I did it my way) from the crumbs, roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) I call it how I see it, niggas
(I did it my way) if you don't like it, so be it, niggas
(I did it my way) I make my own rules, do my own plans
(I did it my way) gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can
(I did it my way) takin' sacrifices, kid
(I did it my way) you only gettin' one life to live

Yo, hoes in my focus slow me; roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin' my foes who phony
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, movin'
I thank the ones who said
""Shorty, go home, we about to be shootin'""

(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bulletproof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me

Drunk by Myself,The Lost Tapes,2002.0,"Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I?
Yo, it's ill

Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
MAC in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm, like Christión
Watching my life go
Can't do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, Hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin'
I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blasting A/C going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself",https://genius.com/Nas-drunk-by-myself-lyrics

Every Ghetto,Stillmatic,2001.0,"Uhh, yeah, uhh
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur

For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
[
Verse 2: Blitz
]
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow

My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely... hold me, it's gettin' darker

For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning",https://genius.com/Nas-every-ghetto-lyrics
I’m a Villain,Illmatic XX,2014.0,"[Intro: Nas & 
Jae Supreme
]
Yo, Nas whattup?
Whattup kid?
What going on Ill
I'm just tryna tell these brothers where I'm coming from
You know what I'm saying
Alright, kick it

I'm the nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing
Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson I'll have niggas undressing
I'm rolling with a mob and running from the cops
Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks
A marijuana addict,
 
if niggas want static
They had it,
 
'cause I flip just like an acrobatic
I'm always on the corners rolling up Sess
When I dress it's never nothing less than Guess
So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
I got it going on, my knuckle game is strong
Sip Dom Pérignon and then carry on
Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride
Stripping mad hoes and kick em to the side
See I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder
Start a lot of shit and shoot at out-of-towners
At every block party, I try to catch a body
All for props,
 
tell your pops call the cops
See now I'm on the run, but still having fun
Living by the MAC, my gear is all black
I keep killing because I'm ready and I'm willing and I'm a villain

What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?

I got beef with the President and still loving it
Trying to make plans to overthrow the government
It won't work cause niggas don't believe enough
They'd rather stand on the corners and receive a cuff
Around they wrist
, 
you don't like the sound of this
Rebel, but my country doesn't want me
They'd rather hunt me but you'll never catch us all
While you fucking with the dealers we'll be sticking up the malls
Full of anger, all about danger
Pulling out my banger, stabbing up a stranger
I hear Walkie Talkies in my sleep
And use a whole lot of slang when I speak
Walking with a vest, the projects is where I rest
And the streets keep me stressed
Staring at your face, wait for you to make a sound
That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up
All in black and put you in a box
A hard rock with a .25 in my socks
Aiming at your temple so take the diamonds off your hands
I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz
Prince of pistoleers, words are crystal clear
And this you should fear
The maniac keeps killing, I'm known as a outlaw 'cause I'm a villain


I keep bullets racing out the barrels of a Magnum
Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag them
An outlaw, although I never wear a holster
In every town you see my face is on a poster
Hear so many gunshots my eardrums should pop
Eyesight should stop from seeing mad niggas drop
To the concrete
, 
I got police putting chalk on the street
And this is done once a week
I'm out to kill like Navy Seals
I'm crazy ill and what I can't do my .380 will
I never play with a AK
Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught I'll do lesser time
Sometimes you gotta plan shit and understand it
See I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch
Without a gun in it, Nas is running it
I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted
My voice is like magic
My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic
So when I'm in your town, ""duck down""
Or take fire, whatever you desire
But I'm on point you might miss
Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this
So roll the dice, I'm stopping the bank
It's ill how I got the pen dropping the ink
No one can stop this apocalypse
On your record player a method layer so run and tell your Mayor
Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer
I'm the New York City slayer
I play high post and then lay low
Parlé slow
 
and wear horns, not a halo
And keep killing 'cause I'm a villain",https://genius.com/Nas-im-a-villain-lyrics
Silent Murder,UnKnown,1996.0,"{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

It's sort of like the conclusion to 
Color Purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one-time on pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop versus the block, shorties is schooled quick
Lesson number one: If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from, gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder,
 
I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a Prince in a Palace of Persia
The cognac plurger
 plus the trees
But who's the foul one to make his nose take a freeze?
And got enough gall to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters
Collect calls from lifers, Astoria wars with Cypress
Since I got a problem with the law-writers
I kick some more items just to explore horizons
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay

{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

They say the arms of Nicky Barnes would be enough to blast
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz?
Fuck what they teach in class, I'mma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
Living practice
, out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, folded up money and mad clips
Are stacked right under my mattress
To smoke a nigga like a Hughes Brothers motion picture
Niggas getting open, crews roping older niggas
April fools, they laugh, the jokes on the benches
Seeds outside, my nigga spoke on his sentence

{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

My right-handers never play too close to cameras
It's night time, scandalous, circle the loud gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The Beast making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
Time to get this loot countless
'Cause, son, it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and
Pakistanians are took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet, known for spending pies up
What's the flavor when your neighbors do jake favors?
Locking real niggas down and letting fake players
Roam around the projects, it's lyrical logic
I dilute, the weak can inject the right composite
When plotting on murderous schemes
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay

{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

And Cain killed his brother Abel
When God accepted Abel's offering and not his
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God
And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder
Drove him to murder",https://genius.com/Nas-silent-murder-lyrics
10 Points,King’s Disease,2020.0,"America the beautiful, gangsta's paradise
For a black man to be rich, you say we sacrifice our own family members
Like we're not savvy enough to make outstanding figures
And ain't nobody in no cult
I give so much, financially give away
But there's an aspect of that that's crippling to us today
Still coping and dealing with my environment as a kid
I trust no one today because what someone in my past did

King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started sayin' ""Peace King"" on my song ""The Flyest""
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, King

Took it from a street dude, you don't need to be a street dude
Get a lawyer, read your contract, and eat food
Become Roberta Flack or Lionel
When you catch flack, that mean they got they eye on you
Produce great results, they start to lie on you
Is it love for a Queens dude in Supreme shoes
Or did the street code expire with these dudes?
Especially now, I don't expect you to bow, but stand
Creating jobs, named my venture from after the land
I came from, that's unheard of
A hood that's known for murder now doing mergers
The streets is a lie, don't believe these dudes, jail or death is all you get
They tell you never move, but when they get money, they split

King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started saying ""Peace King"" on my song ""The Flyest"" (Peace King)
And after that, it took off like fire

They hardly happy for you, keep doing what you do
You can't please everybody, and not everybody is you
Don't try to force a square peg in a round circle, that shit'll hurt you
Don't try to fit in either, you're better off with neither
Few veteran speakers get medicine when you need it
Especially when we all need knowledge instead of sneakers
Stop hangin' on to childhood trauma, it defeats us
Our challenge is holding ourselves back, I hope you felt that

Queen, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing

The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
Y'all bunch of backward gangsters
Y'all signin affidavits
Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind of weird and it's scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper,
 I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way
, uhh

This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime
I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
[Verse 3: Nas & 
Both
]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (
I'm a warrior
)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (
I'm a warrior, yeah
)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way
, uhh
[Chorus: Alicia Keys & 
Nas
]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior) 
to my warriors
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Warriors, baby, 
KrucialKeys
! 
Braveheart y'all
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words: Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin'
Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha
Braveheart, Braveheart

Thief’s Theme,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
Check, one, two

Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writing, semi-automatic, no hyphen
It's frightening

The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with

I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain
Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain
Got ill up on the train
Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein
Might've pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino going
And I had to make a song, speaking on my old life
For the thieves who come out at night

U Wanna Be Me,8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture,2002.0,"Uhh, oooooh baby, baby
Keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah

Now slowly, thinking of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fucking pitiful
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (ho)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha)
I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a

Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be me son, I'm the one and only
But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concerning this mic profession, turn your direction

You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
And show you how to stay off my dick
That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection
You unlucky, I'm your fucking C-section
Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high
Realize, how many classics I gave you
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you


You can't be me, I'm trying to walk a straight line
Why they trying to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line
Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts
At the Player's Ball, Brioni suits, y'all birds watch
As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
Is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every MC reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't crying laughing, to the lions, throw your ass in
What the fuck was you niggas thinking?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inkling that you coming for the kingpin
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha

I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you riding with me
You keep asking, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying
[Chorus: Aaliyah (
Nas

You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (

Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his keys
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

Who Killed It?,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006.0,"Look here see, Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
""He said one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather and at this rate we'll never get her""
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's getting me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party, ""What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang.""
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said ""See you later.""
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silhouette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, ""The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president.""

Well what do ya say
Ya see?
Ya see?
Ya see?

Look here see, I know you got soul you're trying to hide it
How did you kill a man out in Cypress
One Eyed Charlie, he only hangs with the criminal minded
Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin'
She says, ""Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story.""
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, ""It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?"" She says, ""Bill Gates.""
What are ya born '77 or '78?
She says, ""Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times,"" claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? ""Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave
The Bronx."", now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc

Ah-ha!
Ah-ha!

Listen up sweetheart now we gettin somewhere
As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air
But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive",https://genius.com/Nas-who-killed-it-lyrics
Life We Chose,Nastradamus,1999.0,"To my niggas.. huh..
We all we got..
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..

It's the life we chose (uhh), where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know (uhh)
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
(But yo..) this life is the only life I know...

Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, ""Please daddy pay it""
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck

It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...

Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling with you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up

It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...",https://genius.com/Nas-life-we-chose-lyrics

For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's ""Godfather"" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way

If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard

If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining
- and dining, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning

Favor for a Favor,I Am...,1999.0,"Yo Nas
I don't think they wanna fuck with this
Gangsta shit, fo' sho'
Danger, danger
Check it out

It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the Super Sports rally
Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Comaneci
Now dey a motherfuckin' see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York
Comin' kama-kize, sparkin' this shit that keep me off the heezee
Game over, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here

Nuttin' but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin' but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas
Scarface get a call and we shootin' niggas
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin' to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin' cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfuckin' plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin' mind
Him and whoever standin' by, I'll tell these niggas, ""Let's go""
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin' mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin'
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)

Who Are You,The Lost Tapes 2,2019.0,"Hudson

Heard you got your master's
Did college up, never looked back, now that's what's happening
And it's good to see you made it out the hood
With a degree, a true man with passion
Now you could enter the so-called ""White Man's Society""
And go right past 'em
Looking in the Wall Street Journal for your face
But it's always absent
There he go, that's him
Eating flan and ambrosia, watch on his arm, golden, laughin'
Try to get his attention, but he's flinching
Guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so I mention
We were neighbors some time ago
He was kinda cold, in this restaurant, full of his kind and more
He sighed, tried to look surprised, I know
His side of the city where he resides, so
I had to go, I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes
Hate so-called ""intellectuals""
No balls, he suggests we vote
He stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks
He want to lecture folks 'cause he professional
And he suggest that we don't sell dope
And I guess it's true, but who the fuck are you?

Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

I'm Idi Amin, I'm Marcus Garvey
H. Rap Brown, I'm Muhammad Ali
I'm Reginald Lewis, George Washington Carver
I'm Nas with incredible music, let's do it
Thinking of a master plan
Sipping on disaster, smoking on gangster
Watching niggas argue, chillin' on my bar-stool
With my Hell Up in Harlem hat in hand
With a girl named Pat
She more than a waitress to order your drink with
She divorced a banker and bought the bar
She got an automobile, she give an order to kill
You get caught and robbed, we could see your walk is off
You could lose your rhythm when you outta the gutter for a while
You easily go to soft from hard
Now we all about hustlers, number runners, hoes and sharks
And we all know the code of the block
And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit
'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks?
Brother, don't start, go build your Noah's Ark
You could float to the end of the world, and pretend what you not
But I know what you are
While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot
While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot
Matter of fact, you're an easier target
And I respect everything you accomplished
But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense
So who the fuck are you?

Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

In our younger days we were so in love
And the thought of losing you was enough
Can't lose me

Who be the holy prophet, they watchin’ with all his posture?
His Rothstein goggle game be the dopest
, he gots to
Be from the '80s era
His tint is shade Carrera, Queens forever
Green pipe seats, clean Panamera
Amateur Hanna-Barbera characters know they envy
The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis
You pick of the week, voted-in rappers you go against me
You can't tantalize a call girl with just a roll of pennies
Can’t bait a lion in ya trap without a tranquilizer
You enterin' a boxing ring with no trainer beside ya
My Panerai watch glows like 
Avatar
Caviar black diamonds, can you imagine, y'all
Takin' from a rich man plate?
 Kick in his door
'Cause his war with the bloodsuckers of the poor
The first shall be last, that's just universal law
Pop the cork, the Perrier-Jouët pours, like this

Uh
I tell a story of a prince life and all his glory
It's killin' me softly
Somber like the buildings in Fort Greene
Hood monsters and niggas who walk mean
Hood niggas and they just came home and they grip they chrome
Can you hear me, is this thing on?
Test, one, two, gimme some feedback if y’all could feel it
For the home invasion dudes that be robbin’ dealers
Picture me runnin' inside they crib, rollin’ wit' ya
Mask on the face, tyin' up the sister
Lookin' for the bricks to get richer
Smackin’ up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds
A dirty game when you servin' 'caine
Got feds to watch, hoes to watch, checkpoints and roadblocks
Police barricades, batterrams
Doors off the hinges, wake up flinchin', who ratted, man?
Knew who it had to been, states, feds and housin' added in
Every department searchin' your apartment
Ransackin' it, found four ratchets
DEA jackets, we gotta escape the madness
Haha, yeah, escape the madness
Yeah, through the eyes of Pablo
That's how I'm lookin' at you, there's an obstacle in everything
It's all natural, I'm keepin' it pilin'
Keepin' heat with the silencers
Learnin' Greek and Italian, speak with kings while dinin'
Good with hyenas, meanin' it's hood when it's time for ridin'
Ties with suppliers from my days of the projects
Where I resided, a phenomenon
With the ambitions of a rider

Trying to figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, 
I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility
Critically analyze black lives and respectability
Why Prodigy mural get vandalized? Why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously
Demagogue democracy, in the fog I see the Mobb represented into the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Your enemy, dunn, was internal
A disease that needs a vaccination
Plagues black seeds
The industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs
Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees
First things first, this should be understood
Queensbridge, just ain't any other hood
It's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically
If it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing
The early '80s, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marley was changing hip-hop
Then Marley and Shanté caught a body, UTFO
She cold, ""Roxanne's Revenge"", she was 14 years old
Then came the Juice Crew
 
and the who's whos
G Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the Q-U
I was probably playing with .32s in the lobby
It's Queensbridge over everything and everybody
I wish the 'book never came out
And everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love
Except we needed to build more and get things correct
Now I gotta accept it, 'cause there's honor in death
Wish you was here with us P

Carry on Tradition,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006.0,"Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit
Niggas want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody trying to get rich
Now get rich niggas, fuck it

Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues
And Slyvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables

When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition

Now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moralless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?

When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition

Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now
From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em, I promise I carry on tradition

When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition

Crazy (crazy), ah (ah)
Yo pussy kill me...
Huh (huh).. yeah (yeah) yeah..
Huh, huh, huh, huh..

Pussy killed me when I was born (What?)
Pardon me, I'll rephrase it: departed mommy's womb decaying
I look at the bright side
The fact that I got a life side
Born '73 - September right Nas? (True)
Virgo child, the first thing I learn is money makes the world go round
On this small planet, it's ten women to one man; I wonder how we manage
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures (word)
Bitches even nastier, they throw at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky hoes lick a nigga's ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragging 'til her baby dad went nuts (stupid bitch)
Now he looking for me, two cars deep
Rolling up on nigga's, barrel out the window, asking, ""You Nas peeps?""
I can't have that, two four five, nigga grab that
Pass it to me, sucker-for-love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me in trouble
I pissing bubbles
I thought I felt a sharp pain, better stick to rubbers
When laying hooker after hooker, day out and day in
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name 'em
Just a thought: we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent, fucking entertainers
And basketball players, the bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all a save her, put your dick in her throat
You just the nigga that done wifed her (huh?)
She drove you crazy, now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, (damn) now you a life-er
And suicide notes you write her, pussy kills

Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking

Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real

My nigga James got married, same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was too stuck
Studied for her Masters, part time nurse
I'll tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, sike
'Cause James and me like I was with AZ like
Luke and Han Solo
Fucking with niggas' girls' forbidden, that's a no-no
It's death and we real niggas, civilized Gods
And their ain't too many niggas like Nas, I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheating
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life, even
Happy for James 'cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he's lucky, we clown some
Rolling up dutchies 
while watching Roy Jones in round one, he froze
Put his face to the TV, 'bout an inch close
Move out the way nigga, fuck's the matter with you, you blind?
He pointed to the front row, thought he was loosing his mind
She 'posed to be with her sick mother, left for the weekend
Was stressed when she was leaving
Now she's next to some nigga, cheesing
He's having trouble breathing (gasping for air, coughing)
He pictured 'em making noises, grinding him and kissing him
Yelling, ""Ain't no telling where her lips have been!""
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser than
Ten minutes later, then they start wrestling and screaming
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at that fight, you speeding
That's Vegas, this is New York, you bugging
I held up my hand for a dap but he wouldn't touch it
I'm like, ""When you started acting like that? This is dumbness.""
Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches
I ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped
He got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen
Neighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping
Me and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange
My comrade was breathing no more, they killed James

Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking

Oh what a thrill

Look here, I'm the God on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ashe with a tennis rack, tell the DJ, spin it back
{*beat reverses*}
Yeah, somethin' like that
Uh, it go
Savoir-faire yeah, radiate, conscience clear
About to have a monstrous year
Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep
Ladies, get ya harder than termite teeth
C'est la vie, I'm engaged
But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me
And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue
They were all put there by the squad
Look here, I'm the god on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ash on the tennis rack, tell the, nah
Everything I be in
Creme de la creme from the linen to the gold front rim
Cold stuntin'
Take a look around, what you found?
Like Master Ace, tell me the world's a faster place
High school students will slash your face
And these white nigga hoods, I'm talkin'
Computer rage is real
Get excited when I'm walkin'
Cause I'm used to dark shades and a limousine tint
Business managers scare me half to death
When they tell me every month what is co-being spent

Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see

I don't like when my girl try to pull a MC Lyte
Jumped out the whip, through the train
Leave me like D Nice
They say we used to resemble each other
Both last name Jones so we must be brothers
My yearly salary suffers
Cause I hate work, no play make Jack lame
And I rock parts on my head that are hotter than yours
Horizontal lines, designs your barber can't draw
Posters of Nas on the barbershop doors
Entourage, security galore
When was the last time you rode by yourself, superstar?
Got so much love I shot Cupid in the heart
I'm awakened by my own screams
Lucifer masturbated in my dreams
It means somebody is gonna get fucked in the worst way
And none of y'all hoes touchin' my wordplay
Janitors and men with eighty mil both feel the same grief
The men at work, blue collars of the old men
Shinin' shoes, shoe polish go through the same dramas
They wish for a better tomorrow
I thought only five percenters are conspiracy theorists
Thinkin' what the new world order thing is
But everybody does
The fear of the planet is contaminatin everybody's blood
Triliteral, Democratic parties
Anglo-American military alliance
Study at Oxford, scholars, they watchin'
NASDAQ, Dow Jones, got the world stocks in a shamble
Procter and Gamble
Toxins demand you understand who plans to jam you
Some random thoughts by the candlelight in Paris
As I struggle to be savvy

Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see",https://genius.com/Nas-foul-breeze-lyrics
My Country,Stillmatic,2001.0,"American born, American raised, American made

My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)

Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer
Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)

It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that foe, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20-inch, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot 'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back, but yo

Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun, shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
(But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business)
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel
[
Verse 4: Millennium Thug
]
There's not a bitch in sight
Or block bench, or black gate
Or gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

Poppa Was a Playa,The Lost Tapes,2002.0,"To my nigga
Brought me in this world
Ha, that's right, nigga

My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God
My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us
My pops maybe was late, but always came home
My moms would put us to bed, and she would wait on
Soon as he walked in the door, she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other
My poppa played the street all day
Mama was either home or at work
While we playing inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone
Peeping out the window, heated
But still, I didn't see it, mama hid it from us
We was kids, younger, 'til we got bigger, on to
Bigger things, that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and my mom's love

Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

So many kids I knew, never knew who Pop was
That's why I show my pop love
'Cause he was still around when I popped up
He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death, but stayed
Watched me crawl 'til I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fistfight, right behind me, he would stand
No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him
""What's this white shit on that plate and your face?
And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist
And, who's this lady I'm facing?
Dark skin, you not my mommy!""
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promised me things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell Mommey
He said one day I'll understand—
""Little me, what's in you is inside me""

Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town (Ugh, my nigga)
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

Pops told me hold my own, Pops told me value home
Could I help it, ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone""?
Who loved the pretty brown round, out-of-town-bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home, I played his latest recordings
And it's strange how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power
Our weed habits the same now
No white lines, or trumpets, just tight rhymes
And beats that's bumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now, see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together, then someone will get killed
I love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga
Although you felt you was wrong, I still feel you, kid
Life goes on...",https://genius.com/Nas-poppa-was-a-playa-lyrics

How to become the next world leaders, Bravehearts

Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind
, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
""Jesus"", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
The chronic's a fool, got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

Lake

My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's
I build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in Dix Hills
For fishscale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef, I'll snatch your seed from Chuckie Cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa
50 inch flat screen, Louie Vuitton holsters
My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler
Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga
Only killers know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police,
 nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton

Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war
Uh, and listen more and talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared
I don't care if no one's spared in..

For niggas up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was them
Instead of, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they was into dope back then
Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin
Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin it
They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars

We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars

Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy Bee battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggas was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggas talkin there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a pot? Yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin any crew
Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars

Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out

This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold, we live it
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in KB Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you

I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man?
Fuck it, I'll take one, 'cause stop me
But can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son
Another bullet pass by, missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let 'em kill me...

Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance

Beautiful Life,The Lost Tapes 2,2019.0,"Peace y'all, yeah
This one right here goes to my most loyal, loyal, loyal, loyal ones
You for me and me for you
We see things alike
We live alike, in truth

The craziest things already happened, get me
Could tell you 'gon be laughing at me or you laughing with me?
My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'
Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
Was she looking for fame? yo I hope she got it
Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target
All women should bid
For keeping real fathers away from their kids
These rappers talkin' real shit I lived
How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her
Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers
She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me
Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad
Tell you lames something, spit some game
Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain?
When you place blame, then you're defective
When you take blame, then you're respected
You gotta give me credit

Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah
Life is good, it's good, it's good

Uh
The craziest things just happened to me, get me
So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me
How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially
If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change
And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash
So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS
Somebody's stealin', I swear to God
Tsk, for now, I invest
To my incarcerated team who got life
It's not right but you still got your life
Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks
Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hilltops
Commercial pop artists get all the accolades
I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway
Probably not as half as paid as I should be
But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

Life is good, I must admit it (

Yeah, yeah

A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
Or extorted for my pay stubs
Lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em
And if I should spare that man who violated my trust
I gave him a pass
My man called and I value his judgement
I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes
Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
My younger brother knows this
Not Jungle, got another brother in PA
Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
I gotta say I got some fam across the USA
Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door
Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days
It wasn't my fault
I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York
Barely survived
Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth
How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
Akinyele, you knew
I was your brother 'til death
Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak
You was a dime, we was nobodies
Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi
I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets
We could all still kick it
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

Rest in peace to my brother Talik
Gone too soon
God bless your soul brother
He was wild
Some things we just can't explain
Life
It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
With your kids at an early age
First steps, first words
I can't see 'em cause you mad
Don't put yourself before the babies
Don't say crazy things to hurt that man
You hurt him enough
The good times outweighed the bad
When it was good, it was great
But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad
Okay that's how it is out here
That's life huh
You see we can't be selfish out here
We gotta live and let love
Let the light in
To the beautiful mothers of my kids
And all the mothers around the world

The big homies don't approve that
Felt and Dirty Red fundin' RK but where was you at?
We all tried to move crack
Nowadays I'm just showing my age
The new goons hardly heard of these legendary names, it's strange
The Bridge rappers influenced me, son
But if I was in the Juice Crew, we woulda won
No disrespect 'less disrespect served to me
You a gangsta groupie, gassin' niggas to murder me, nigga?
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
And that's word to Yammy, yeah
Deep roots, I ain't have to fake it yet
Old solid tree branches ain't breakin' yet
A vet

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

I got the je ne sais quoi, why bother
With girls who like to play keep-away with they toddlers?
She started with good intentions like a rich pastor
Bitch was bad, turned from good thing to disaster
Takes forever to build a rep, one second to lose it
She put her neck in a noose, snapped it
Hangin' on every word she heard come outta cougar mouth, super foul
Play your cards right, deuces wild, salute my pals
Fathers all around the board goin' through it
She got lobster appetites, lots of habits
Like frontin' when she need apartment deposits
Here's something, get you a starter
But pardon my pimpin', I don't sponsor
I don't buy cars, I coach you to win, know what?
If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon, still
And that's word to Will, for real

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

Life Is What You Make It,I Am...,1999.0,"Yo, 
Ill Will
, 
Ruff Ryders
What what, straight like that

You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life
I can say I did the right thing

You wanna joke nigga? Laugh when you get blown up (come on)
See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) Realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, 'cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)

Make history before you go
Fuck the misery, you living po' we gettin dough
Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is valuable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worst, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga

Money Over Bullshit,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006.0,"My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fully's
Brrrat, cars peel, the East Coast cartel
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, a maid and shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
King poetic, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count, QB, bitch!

Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet
Thinking about which nigga to target
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs
Black TEC on the table, Mag .44
Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door
Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas fish-made, y'all niggas is fifth grade
Niggas, it's fifty ways to dissect the General
If I give ya the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1: cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue
Rule 2: thought you knew don't fuck with God's Son
Rule 3: see, matter fact, I just wait
If y'all reach top five, then I'ma eat y'all alive
Each one of ya guys that claim Hip-Hop is still alive
Like y'all ain't in agreement with Nas
I said it's dead motherfucker, it's dead, bitch…

Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

From crack pushers to Lac' pushers and ambushers
And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous
From nickel and dimin' to trickin' them diamonds
Vegas, places in Switzerland
From 9 blastin' to I don't have to blast mine
They blast mine, black 9, you flatline, my cash climb
Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases
Five-star restaurant eaters; don't forget who your peeps is
'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl
Once even gave me a phobia, that I be in a spot trapped like Madame Zenobia's with this kid eyein' my Rollie, y'all

Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn

These Are Our Heroes,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"Nas: ""This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are
Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our
Heroes.""

Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, ""Ooh, he speak so well""
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, ""These are our heroes""

Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full


You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley , Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes

Nas: ""Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know
The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods . Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr . Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs
What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit
And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit.""
Male Heckler: ""Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though
Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in
My hood. What type of shit is that?""
*overlapping dialogue*
Nas: ""I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I
Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha
Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE.""

Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones

Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm
I'm gonna kill somethin', rap cats be real frontin'
Fuck shootin' legs, cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how 'bout that, close range with the gauge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day, my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you with me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin')
I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...

Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours, nigga
Get yours, baby
Uhh, yo
Yo

As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

Explorin' the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors, and this shit start weighin' on me

Little cute thing, said, ""What's yo' name?""
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain (woo!)
Ooh-ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
BLAOW! Ludacris in the how-oooh-ouse!
The needle hit the record, they was playin' this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh-on (
ugh!
)
Live forever like 'Fame,' let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back, chillin' in my b-boy stance (
c'mon!
)
Could be a little pop lockin' if your girl's top droppin' (
yeah
)
But watch for cockblockin' on my coochie stock options (
woo!
)
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip-swap; Nasty N-A-S, pass that
Honey in the black cause I'm feelin' her curves
He looked down at what I had and said, ""W-w-word"" (
ugh!
)
Why only serve one when we can serve up two?
Then at the bachelor pad, doin' what the Virgos do
And these women so shy but get loud undercover
So we can have sex but I can't be your loverrrrrr
Buck! buck! buck! buck! buck! buck!
Ah, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha ah ah-ah, SING! (
UGH!
)

Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand?
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo? (c'mon!)
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand?
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo? (ugh!)
We sippin on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though (that's right!)
I drop you off at Two-Fifth and Lex-o (rmmmm!)
Smash with the Virgo, you ain't got take your shirt off
Seen you convince your homegirl though
Ayo, ugh!

They got my voice for the record and my voice for the beat
Virgo crew, baby run the streets
So let's go (let's go), let's go (for the beat)
Let's go (Virgo crew), it's the Virgo
Let's go (Nasty Nas), let's go (Ludacris)

Hey Nas,God’s Son,2002.0,"The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in 
Set It Off
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, ""Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""
Nine push-ups, strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Patron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Filas
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tels
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know, when will they learn
Nas need a queen not a ho to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

One for the honies who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife, play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue, a woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ak
'Cause you point out my enemies
, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billie Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby

"A Message to the Feds, Sincerely, We the People",Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"Get ready, get prepared
This is prophecy
God is with us!

I walk the blocks like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hus-tle
*beat change*

A message to those who trapped us up
From federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough
Lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast
Look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens
Even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies
Pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers
Who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry and I'm not gon'
Stand just watch you die
I'ma pass you a .9, I'ma grab your hand
Come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king
Who murdered the Christ, the same regime
What God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate
Man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres
Plantations, see every race won

Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a MAC-10 over a TEC
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase ""Nigga, light that""
Hoes you fuck ask you, ""Where your ice at, dunn?""
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your click roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting, marinating
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

Money Is My Bitch,I Am...,1999.0,"{*Kissing*}
I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave

The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her
I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, 
slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you,
 heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you?
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

Highways are landing strips for planes to land
Before the Wright brothers planned aerodynamics

Parasites try to steal the culture (True)
While chem trails and satellites hover over
Feds is watching, real niggas ask this is so (Ask this is so)
Still the 5th is loaded (5th is loaded)
For these lawyers who be ripping soldiers off in court
They don't get em all, they just take your money and lie
Have you sitting up north (Foul)
Study the law (Word)
Get your appeal (True)
Soon you back on the street the shit'd get real (Facts)

May they ships pull up to the Sicilian shores

I know they're tryna watch me, a Russian oligarchy
Politically, it's principle they try to stop me
Powerful people will silence you, they try to mute you
Unethical ways put you in prison, try to roof you
Our youth is dead to us, they called us superpredators
Stupid words from the President's mouth, where are his editors?
Antarctica is 65 degrees
Global warming, they don't wanna believe
And they're hanging people on trees
And what the fuck is up with Gayle King?
A black male, a female thing, a failed thing
Journalism or internalism
Shirley Chisolm wouldn't play the victim
Eartha Kitt woulda been finished with him

Scorned woman wanna slump me, to fade me to dark

Y’all My Niggas,Nas,2008.0,"We use the word everyday
Now we don't know the capacity of this word
Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)
Because we did not break down the capacity
Of the same what (the same word)
Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness
We've been taught wrong

Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta, strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more
Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater
A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back
To be a Fortune 500 CEO, it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies is hiring blacks
Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads
Controversy surrounds who could say it and when
Some niggas are full time, some play and pretend
So fuck that, no apologies on the issue
If it offends you, it's meant to, it's that simple

Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

Yo, I was thinking a little bit
What would it take to authenticate my nigganess?
Ball ridiculous? 26 inches when I call up the dealership?
Aww, that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit?
We having too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients?
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with
Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons
Courtrooms full of goons, jail buses leaning
Handcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life
If you fight, they just give in, people used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries
Somehow Niger turned to nigga, and shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'Til Noble Drew Ali started dropping that consciousness

Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

My father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor
When it came to getting paper, who the hell was gon' train us?
Oppression couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use of ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one

Every word we use, it has a capacity
And if you don't understand the words you're using
And understand the capacity of it
You are using words that is creating a destiny for you
That you don't even know, or even conscious of

Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless

You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now

(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around

Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh

I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up
, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours

(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan

You Mean the World to Me,The Lost Tapes 2,2019.0,"Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in the meter cab
Gestured to her cell to tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She ain’t got no cash, and she strugglin' while walkin'
So I drive past, yo I say ""I ain’t no stalker wit yo big 'ole ass
Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift""
Who woulda knew it turn to this? now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn we speedin'

Now girl, you mean the world to me
Now girl, you mean the world to me

I’m a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in
I’m a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins

You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in

Baby girl had a son
He was three, yeah I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Nah, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie, that’s 'cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it’s a setback
I don’t respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave her man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you

Check it check it check, check check
Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call
If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure, fuckin' with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin'
Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin' your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin' V.I.P
With fly shorty P.Y.T
Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got
Or who you hang with, frontin' when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
Then you can fuck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin'? You turn your back they laughin' at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The bitch gross a lil' somethin' too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit
DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice
A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin'
Hope you're listenin', turn up your transisterin'
Hot 97, KISS-FM or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin' with your girl while you thinkin' 'bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex
I break it down, how to adress, the opposite sex
Problems or questions, I can answer them best

Project Windows,Nastradamus,1999.0,"Black hoods, cops and projects, sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare, vision blurry
'Cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood, but no signs say out
Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, 'til they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on

Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

Yo, if this piano's the cake, then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up {*puff puff*}, hit it up {*puff*}, now they dismantled
Think the whole world is crazy, got a nine, watch where you walk Two dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune, uhh

Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said, ""go and see the world for myself, and my brother should follow
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool
Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, speedin' like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustla's and hoes, drugs and fo'-fo's
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows

Oh, outta my window

Nas Will Prevail,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It ain't hard to tell, I excel and prevail
The mic comes in contact with the third rail
My raps react, they attack the wack just like a maniac
With this, see, I'm a brainiac
I'll call you tattoo, you never come off
I flip the script with a sawed-off, boss
A modern Shakespeare—reincarnated
Brains are elevated, I'm bein' R rated
This style is terror, drastic
Meltin' the plastic, and I eat mics just like acid
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
'Cause I be packin' like a Rasta in a weed spot
Hittin' your heart with a hollow-tip, verbally illin'
Minds manipulated, my raps are nickel-plated
I execute raps like I'm swingin' an axe around
This is a mic shut down
Notify the President that I'm bombin' your residence
And I'm leavin' no evidence
Voice box yells, lyrics'll excel
Rappers gettin' smoked, you can smell the hot shells
Your style is fake, snake, well dramatized
You might as well be a singer but ain't harmin' Nas
Here's the break, I can translate lyrics so well
I excel, it ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell

I got a case of vocal fever, I'm here to make you a believer
Nas wrecks the tweeters and receivers
Lyrics will explode, my brain overloads
Gimme a Grammy, competition is dead just like Sammy
I leave minds magnetized like slaves
Your style is old fashioned like waves
Holdin' a pistol at a pastor, pullin' the trigger faster
Tell him I was sent by his Master
But that topic's too deep for your ear
Here's the science you can comprehend clear
Advanced intellectual, a time bomb speeder
I'll know your whole card just like a palm reader
Non-stop, I'm bustin' heads like the FEDs, baby pops
This is not the Kindergarten Cop
Put on your blindfold, I'ma release and stand tall
I detonate bombs at the Policeman's Ball
This is art from the heart, I leave 'em marked for death
In each breath, in this game, I'm the ref
Already I'm ill but I can only get better
With lyrics as pretty as a nickel-plated Beretta
I master dialects of uncommon languages
A black man caught by the Klan couldn't hang with this
These are proverbs, copy cat attackers, huh
I'm wanted dead 'cause I'm a genocide to rappers
Battlin' Nas is dead when my brain reacts
You might as well have fell asleep on a train track
This ain't the same track that you're used to
This is rhythmatic, automatic, try it, you oughta have it
Slaughter your tape recorder, givin' thanks to my supporters
And keep flowin' like water
No matter the obstacle, Nasty Nas will prevail
Ayo, it ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell

Check it
I catch wreck with my intellect, suckers are incorrect
I'm gonna win 'cause you slept
On Nas, word is bond, I leave the microphone torn
False rappers, you need to write your own song
Metaphors are murder, man, hittin' like Roberto Duran
Hold the mic in my hand, my life span
Imitators will sweat me like gym class
Your raps are fat, shit, then I'll be Slim Fast
New rap recruits—I salute then delete 'em
Verbally eat 'em, because my ears don't need 'em
Nas is a terrorist, analyst
Swingin' my fists like a nigga breakin', possessed by Satan
You couldn't compete with a beat that was fast or slow
Brothers is gettin' shipped out like I was Castro
I can eat your flavor, but I'm not a candy lover
I use a Lethal Weapon, just like Danny Glover
Execute monologues, sabotage entourage
Mutilate mics like a maniac at large
I talk with slang, and use my brain
Generate pain, penetrate your vein
Move like a maniac, Nas is nice, son
Talk to your conscience and hit like Tyson
No competition, 'cause I cause wonders
Nas will battle rappers by the football numbers
A motor mouth killer, rhyme writin' thriller
Hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend
Don't sleep 'cause you might not wake
I speak deep, dialects I translate
Me and friends commit sins on the regular
Murder my competitors, and et cetera
Nas is a gypsy Egyptian
Flippin' the script and microphone manufacturers are victims
My voice makes your ear drums swell
It ain't hard to tell",https://genius.com/Nas-nas-will-prevail-lyrics
Fetus,UnKnown,2002.0,"Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am...

I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen

I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes

Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, ""If I am born, will I be safe at all?""
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said ""Stay calm,"" holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, ""At least that nigga ain't ugly""
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers

New World,Nastradamus,1999.0,"Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world

Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold
Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve,
 computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later

Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin' wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage

Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, something's out there watchin' you and I
More enticin' than Star Trek, StarTAC phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks?
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein' today

Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'

Hope- Acappella Version,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006.0,"Hip Hop
It will never die
Hip Hop
It will never, never die

Ghetto nigga strutting, with nothing but dreams in Queens broke
Mac-10s, you can smell the PCP smoke
Melle Mel told it real, in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember, we used to be close
Then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slipping in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, 
that black ice
Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, 
tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water

Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, {*shooting sound*}, forehead yawning
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit, back in ya head, find me
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild out there sold crack
Bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin 'em hoes, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray MAC-10 and a pocket full o' dimes

Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but FUCK them hoes
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin'
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My Uzi weighs a ton, your son less thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket
The peeps be like one (one)
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son

G-O-D S-O-N
I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen
With my testosterone, male hormone
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E
Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said
For me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's dead, who made this style, Solo or X
Are you UTFO's Doctor or Moe Dee
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryin' to show niggas ya rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga inchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia, the only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's okay, 'cause you dyin' anyway

Yo, this is for them high school drop outs
Niggas who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back
Bravehearts gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have a bike on a bench
Now I got the Jeep on this trip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip

Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot 'til the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin' from D's quickly knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm all about
To all my real niggas

This Bitter Land,The Land Soundtrack,2016.0,"This bitter land
Watered with my soul
The fruit it bears
Leaves me so cold
This bitter land
Does nothing for love
This bitter land
Brings pain from above, oh-oh

Yeah, running on the concrete across the train tracks
The devil is behind me
In the ghetto where's you'll find me, it's where I stays at
Cop shot us up, he get a medal then retire
But it never will define me
Write a letter to the president, whoever in control of the society
Tell 'em stop riding me, stop driving us into a suicidal ideology
Tryna feed my seeds
Getting high on weed, study my degrees
Stay fly, getting paper
With some dead white people faces in the circle of spaces around the green
I'ma lean, taking Percs It’s a bitter Earth
Is a nigga cursed? Am I blessed? See what I mean
It's a test, life is a test
Life is like a hood, hard
Trying not to fall between the cracks
In the cracks it's so dark, and the dark
Seems more appealing than the light in the land
Where you gotta fight
Catch a body in the night, we need a plan
To survive, to survive the land
Survive the storm, when it comes through
Either you're busy living or busy dying, look what it's come to
Look what it's come to, so what you're gonna do?

This bitter land is far too real
This bitter land, it does not heal
Cause in the land skies are grey
But we fight the storms that come our way
A boy who strives to be a man
Must push to lead with all he can
Oh, this bitter land
Oh, bitter land
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
This bitter land, can't stop my fight
This bitter land

Look what it's come to
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

It Never Ends,The Lost Tapes 2,2019.0,"Buckets like Gilligan
Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan
Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain
Got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown
Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown
Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles that make that hiss sound
They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends
B.I.G. shit
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

Stop waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
""What does he mean?
Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He still as hard as he was when he started out""
We count 'em out, we count 'em in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends
Do they love me for me or love me for them?

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
The world's out war, the shit never ends
Everybody packin'
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
It never ends, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
What will it take to end?

Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying or rather
Put my ears to the blaring cop siren
Am I here or in a hot dryer?
Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin'
Niggas should stop lyin'
Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying
To change, but you not risin'?
When will somebody real tell him he not Nas-in'
Cars, you just started drivin'
I've been ridin', been made it
You and your pretend stages

Nazareth Savage,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"*Man laughing*

I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggas, bird niggas speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple shells at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'ma guide you like a O.G. but don't talk, don't get it confused
Cause none of y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage

I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal. bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full of scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Coppola, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm Mike's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like Lawry's
Chicken-heads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage

Son's back with flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them guns come out
My cavalry woulda been through ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me

On the Real,Illmatic 10th Anniversary Platinum Edition,2004.0,"On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal

Yeah, finally up in this nigga
Let's pay homage to Illmatic
Let's put the crown where it's at 10 years
Never been done this real by nobody

To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, monkey do, shorty sipping sunny dew
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruising gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell 'em hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume and mad boom
And there's video taping blooming asses on the zooming lens
Rollin on you nondescript niggas, you're marked for death
Like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts

That verse is ten years old, nine and half years old
Street's Disciple, the rebirth comin at you this year baby, it's on baby

To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm 'bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sipping clear liquor with niggas, that talk sideways
Listening close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's 'bout the reed, counting everything the block see
We 'bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggas, loaded
Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggas
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again

Yeah, power to the people, death to the phonies
This beast to the mic one two check, y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you approachin me like how you, homie?
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smoking less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke 'til I spitted vivid expressions
Of hard living ghetto children, of a lesser God
Religion was fast women, expensive cars

""Picture us married, you and me,"" what?
""K-I-S-S-I-N-G""
""I remember the first time, girl you and me . . .""

This ain't no sucka-for-love shit
This ain't no Huxtable-kisses-and-hug shit
First night we fuck, shit, and don't call the next day
This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenumptial agreement
Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggas in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married
 (3X)
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigalo
It was difficult for me to find the chick I want

It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to
I'm getting married

Remember the Times,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"I think I can remember some...

Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch and screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker

Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
And all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind
But none of them could touch you

Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high


Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted",https://genius.com/Nas-remember-the-times-lyrics

You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggas from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks

That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson
After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggas they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you""
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple


Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope

Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', cocked? No
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me

There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feeling uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
Cause she's standing on the corner of 
Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

Yeah, nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing
Newcomer called Verbal Assassin running with
Nothing but the worst type, worst fight
When we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging
In my new car bought from entertainment
Champagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world
Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy
I'm grown up and thankful for lessons God gave me

There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my 
third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

Smooth criminal skill, locked in a human flesh shield
Watching niggas get rich beside me
Pushing a 5 B-Y me up in the passenger seat
But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom
Sipping Asti Spumante, dripped in, reality kicks in
I need the papes to start clicking
Got a connect out in Richmond, ain't nigga in the fam will pitch in
It's on, word is bond, that's my name, big Nas, all wise to civilize
From the Northern Hemisphere of the earth
Peace to my seed and thanks for her birth

Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless
Mansion, marble foyer
I can afford a closet in alphabet order
A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega
British Knights sneaker, my C so ill
That, man, I get chills when I look at my Christian Diors, they kill
D is for Dries Van Noten
Young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doing
D cups, tequila and blunts
Weed, women, and liquor
Depending on the day is a different mission
They not knowing, they wanna know what he got on
The QB Don went and got his Pete Rock on
Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up for him
My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him
Speaking of G, the gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it
.44s never could miss him, coming to see us
Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga
We blowing trees, tell me, don't it feel good, nigga?

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it?

Put that good shit in the air (Yeah)

Niggas in the hood don't live forever (My G niggas)
As long as we together (My QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (Yeah)

Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket
Fuck maintaining, that's lame language
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, I duck quick
Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out a magnum
And I'm the type who runs to the drama looking for who clapping
Nike boot, what I eat him, he like food
Pulled out the barrel
Four-fifths rip through bone marrow
Make his toes spiral the dirt
While his feet kick up rock, he's a sprinter
Police agenda, lock up niggas for three winters
When I attack I'm faceless like a iron mask
They get away quick, traceless, lying back, liars pass
I breathe deep like Lamaze class
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last
Stretched out or in a body bag, I ain't that
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it?

Rumors, DUIs, in and out of court
Different judges, assault charges hovers on your boy
Other niggas' wives lust to be under covers with your boy
Y'all don't want an angry Nas on your label
Y'all got plenty checks, CEO, man
I'm only 36 but if it's— point five on the table
I say with all respect my dude
Thank you, we had the best times but I'm about respect, I'm about the talent I possess
Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk then let you go
Could you imagine Nas the exec?
The artist on the masters controlling your release
Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me
So my product'll be a big commodity
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef
I used to open off making fifty G's
But now I spend that on a diamond to make her neck freeze
My larynx'll serenade the hood
I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good
TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt
Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit
Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get
More real nigga shit

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it?

Yo, 
Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah
Fist full of dollars in a dice game God
D&G glasses, cloth 
Kangols,
 guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking, fresh to my ankles, thankful
Gangster see gangster do, I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia
You screaming like you love war

Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop

Peace, fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em, fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
'Cause now instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far, your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you 'posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but

Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop

Peace, I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War cost money and man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me, you're not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block, what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their main niggas'll take the contract, surprise
So we play a mental game, intimidation
Got pussy niggas getting pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day and
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault or the safe
I got some niggas with acid, get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now

Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop

Pretty thug show no love its like when doves cry
Maybe I'm just too demanding, parked the Land
Mark Buchanan, fuck a job I'mma die scramblin
Digger gold, dig a bigger hole in ya soul
Que Pasa, Pablo's throne cabron
At the airport the Mobb picked me up in a truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck never scared to get stuck
So whats the deal Papi?
Heard the feds could of knocked me
Had the cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating, my name holds weight, we motivatin'
Hustling, as if God was dancing with Satan
The Firm waitin', to get ajourned cause we facing
Double life, thuggin for life, you taste it
The white numbin ya toungue
I bought it from Dominicans
A suitcase of benjamins swung tight in his fingers
Had the Firm gun slingers, hit the lights, grab the white
Murder everything in site, and jet in the Bimmers
Now im home with the phone screaner
Resting the stones in a jewelry cleaner
Checkin my mail reading my supoena
To the witness standing, I got remanded
Livin on the 4th building and can't stand it
Gotta fight my case from the inside
Niggas telling, I felt it coming when my pockets started swelling
But thats the game for ya
Hid a stash to ya lawyers
Supreme court, Queens New York will bore ya'
Suited up, booted up, with the jail cut
Million dollar bail what?

Days are shorter, next court dates around the corner
Money ain't the same, shit is outta order
Since the days of Rich Porter
Something gotta give, I ain't trying to bid
Now I run up in cribs, body shit, but no women no kids
In the Bridge where the murderers live
I used to make a quarter million monthly
I was ill until they sunk me
Killed the snitch with the pump 3 shots
Bought a passport off a junkie

The real New York, death to rapists and rats
The touch school to Brooklyn stories
The kings, the lifers, the lords of Queens
Or the stories on Puerto Rican righteous, I heard things
Know some people who know people
Getting money, the broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who live where you live and see shit the same

We easily mistake jokes for disrespect

Queens Wolf,The Lost Tapes 2,2019.0,"At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fightin' Italian rival gangs, they was sniffin' glue
I was skippin' school, smokin' green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hoppin' and snatchin' jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in ways
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the nights calling, the Benz engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pourin' and niggas ballin'
I put the .22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from?
This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? who laced it?
Previous night, memories who erased it?
Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, lunar, the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talkin' 'bout it
Singin' me praises, said I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screamin' out ""QBietnam"" the loudest
""Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team""
So that explain the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, nigga, my QU shit
Audemars watch, burn a peach Swish', new whip
Stoli' vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction

Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'

When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing

Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition

Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime

Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not for forever
At least to 140

Sometimes I Wonder,In My Ghetto,2017,"QB, the whole NYC
We gon' bounce to this
All my niggas (yeah, yeah)
All the ladies

Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

Top of the world is what I'm aimin' at
These niggas is flamin' gats at my circle
I catch you, my first reaction's to hurt you; I'll hit your bird, too
Two in your scalp, then you out, your thug crew is out
Blood oozin' out, some servin' caine
Knowin' nothin' about this murder game
It's easily told but hard to hear
When niggas finally find out it's real
That's when they heart pumps fear
The real remain, the weak will disappear
My words are 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear
911 style sits on your mind like chrome
Let's say your brain's a V12, put it in drive, let it roam
What color? Might as well make it the same as your dome
You need your thoughts together means destination is unknown
As we travel on this road, an infinite path
I get into this math, drop and get intense for the cash
Will I be subject to kill? Live my life by the gat?
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back

Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

I know a lot of fiends by their first name, livin' in Queens
A lot of cats gettin' stuck for they chains
Holdin' dirty guns, the young old dirty ones
Runnin' wild, nigga, I raise hell above ground
Live in sin, holdin' rocks, Benjamin Grimm
Figure once I got knocked, it would end—never that
They try to tell me I don't love my own
The thugs know, they ride my zone, like The Cyclone
Trademark for Coney Isle, yeah, they know me now
I'm givin' niggas fake hugs, phony smiles
Stack profits, you know how niggas on the block get
Try to give you dap just to stare at your pockets
Crews advance, nothin' new, just the rules of the land
You couldn't tell if they wolves or lamb (Ha, word)
You could fight like a few, there's a few that ran
Or you could feed them and lose your hand
What you wanna do?

Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

Blessings be to the ones who left us
To transcend into spiritual essence, in Allah's arms you restin'
To Him we pray for my peeps
Louie Lloyd Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sonny back in the day
""Get that money, yam,"" he used to say
Not only nice with hands but street smarts, he was twice a man
I try to understand life's deep plot, I think of Weewop
Shikeisha, they both was mad nice on the rock
They woulda went pro, but only God, he only knows why not
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers be not clean
You come around, he start snappin' on you, makin' a scene
Kept the lye, cool nigga, warm heart, and stayed fly
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face
Are you nearby or lookin' on, just from a distant place?
My thoroughbreds, Black Ed, quiet but real
Expect to see your black Jeep come fly over the hill
In the spirit of Richie Lou, tribute
Remind the world of the crime that NY pigs do, we miss you
Never forget you, Harry and Sonia
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier
T.J. Black, better known as Killer
I can't replace you, but in me
Havoc will always have a brother, my nigga
My man Will, until we meet again
You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here
I hope y'all hear my prayers clear

Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?

Rest in peace to my grandfathers, Papa Charlie...
(Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?)
Rest in peace to my man's Horse pops, nam'sayin'? One love
(If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?)
Can't forget Nana, my man L.E.S. grandmom, nam'sayin'?
(All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em)
They still wit' us, though; I wonder where they at?
(Sometimes I...) How near, how far?
Sometimes I wonder (What?)
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? (Can't go under)

War Is Necessary,Grand Theft Auto IV Soundtrack,2008.0,"War is necessary, war brings pain
But war is necessary, war brings peace
‘Cause war is necessary, get your warriors up
‘Cause my niggas are war ready
War brings hate (
Esco, 
 let's go let's go let's go!)
War is necessary, war brings pain (Esco, let's go!)
Get your warriors up
‘Cause my niggas are war ready
My niggas war ready

Staring at the face of my watch, its like a crystal ball
With the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck, ‘cause I know where the missile fall
‘Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich or small
Went to my man's crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up, his voice whispered, ""Nigga, ball!""
So I smoke the finest, 
(85 for the ocean liners?)
I do it for the have-not's, I'm at spot
That resembles screen savers on your lap tops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue FILA velour's suits
Boss smooth, the only thing I endorse duke
Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a lawsuit
All true in living God, we was here first
Parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts


Whose crew was realist? Shot up the movie theaters?
Times Square '88, whose crew was in it?
(Photographed was?) sittin' on wood wicker chairs
40oz 
in the lap, givin' off wicked stares
Punch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air
Hangin' out a Cutlass Supreme window like ""Bitch, come here""
Girls cussing back at us with the fattest asses
Like, ""Who you calling bitch?! Little black bastards!""
We had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad
Drug dealers in the crazy Jag looking crazy mad
They all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men
But we was all Black seeds as Fred Williamson
It was so simple, 
now I'm reflecting in this gold Enzo
Face it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy Riley guy bracelet
So now it's fly shit I'm draped in, customized shit I'm makin'",https://genius.com/Nas-war-is-necessary-lyrics

God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen

God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us

He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas

God love us hood niggas (I know)

'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh

Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimes now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me

God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)

Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs with guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by OGs in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood, I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh), in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most

God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)

Film,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I want y'all to see this like film
C-Sick on production, Nas on the vocal.. let's go

Lots of fog at night, red brake lights
The freeway beside a restaurant
Cold egg whites sat on my plate like
3 AM, this is a spot frequented by some made men
I'm high on hemp
A fly old pimp just walked in, his suit was shark skin
He woke me up from some of the thoughts I'm lost in
What fame does to niggas, change love to bitterness
Friends to fiends for the audience screams, ridiculous
Jumped up, paid my tab, got in my Benz and went
To my old housing tenement, visit my old friends
Some show love and some are envious
Some got the heart of gold, some venomous
At times I wanna go back to being penniless
Ignorance is bliss, I love being innocent
Ugh, but life's got me on the fence again
And all is real so all's worth mentioning

If I could press pause, or fast forward past the hardness
Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with
Memories real, still ill, now I appear crisp like film

Ice on gold from mossbergs to golf clubs
Ninth hole, the white rose, the life I chose
Bandanna over the eye, Dior sandals
Car doors rise with no touch of the handles
Capiche? Caprese salad’s on beaches and islands
Far from police sirens at least for a weekend
Then it's back to the streets creepin
I'd like to make a free toast of champagne on behalf of this nigga speaking
Add a splash to the Seagrams
Roll the hash for my world renowned goons this evening
As I circle the table like Babe Ruth
Louisville Slugger in my grip for a fake dude
Bat to the brain with brute force
Splatter my cream velour suit
They hit me with lawsuit
I slip in your whore coupe
Your bitch hate you, word to Jesus
Bet you never knew she toot yay and play with a gay crew
OGs hate to make way for the new
Young niggas want Polo ain't fucking with J Crew
It's safe to say I was once young and innocent
But look what I know now, is all worth mentioning


I speak to the street life
The executive chief types
The felons, young mothers with kids they trying to feed right
The botega wearers modern day Che Guevaras
Cuz I barely survived crazy eras
Honest, always make good on my promise
I don't talk it I do it you can hold me to it
I was born to this life I didn't invent it
But I'd be wrong not to take a few meal tickets
You and I are real different, we don't share the same beliefs
Fight in the ring or buy ringside seats
Either you like beef, or you like to spectate
Give me gloves, and I'mma do it how the refs say
We touch em and we come out tussling
The ghetto is my garden of eden
So I keep bobbin' and weavin'
It's intense so I'm hardly breathing
KO, and the winner is Nas, that's how the scene ends",https://genius.com/Nas-film-lyrics
Understanding,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, yeah, check it out
I see today's mathematics as being understanding, you know?
Understanding is having the ability to see things clearly
For what they are, not what they present theyself to be
It completes the cipher, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's also symbolic to the black child which is the best part
Ayo, son, represent

Now, I'm the average nigga in the street life, God
I try to beat trife odds, ride my L-E through the night fog
And park
, it's Buddha to be sparked, it's consistent
The beast smells the L because it travels long distance
Cruisin' in his Chrysler, pursuin' niggas in my cipher
Start wildin' like insane asylum on Rikers Island
Verbal assassin, I murder freestyling
One-two for the gun crew, three drinkin' Cristal and
I play the side 'cause the words of man kill
Proverbs buck out my grill, 
real as Ill Will
, peep the steel!
Nobody move, nobody die, why must I be high?
Bustin' in trife bitches, touching mic switches
It's like a hot spoon of heroin, a 
Don like Perignon
Females love the guns I be wearin'
Plant my seeds to live infinite, indeed in my sentences
I flow demanding, that's understanding

850 tempo, but rugged like a Pinto
Chop shop Hip-Hop, burn the block intro
High priests release voodoo, Déjà vu on this taboo
Illmatic
 shit and what have you
Chef cocaine cook
, no brainer, I got the proper diction
My competition bleeds words and weed blurs my vision
I'm freezin' in time, stop the rhyme
I'm sober in a stolen Range Rover, much crime
I, stick up America, Nas in your area
Disrupt the sound barrier, clowns get pounds of terror
A full whip for more clips then Clint has in his era
Dirty Harry, cold, black, the uncanny of Kojak
A Beretta stickin' up trucks carryin' Amaretto
Clever to entice 'em, herbs I'm micin' while I'm pricin'
Niggas like they're slaves, best behave, I'm the nice one
Nas, broken down from Nasir, means protection
Pop Dukes' resurrection, international hoes I'm sexin'
While you be fuckin' one section
Question: Does a lonely mic give me an erection? Yes, son
On a float like the Jetsons, futuristic rappin' mystic
Bust it, try and diss it while my finger's on the iron biscuit
I rhyme terrific, sparklin' like the Diamond District
It's understanding",https://genius.com/Nas-understanding-lyrics
Another Black Girl Lost,UnKnown,2012.0,"I'm pregnant, don't know who the dad is
I'm happy, but this shit's the saddest
I'm maintaining, still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest, my girls in Gucci glasses
How could you pass this? Your loss
But I ain't tripping - I'm still the boss
I won't be another black girl lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost
I won’t be another black girl lost

Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious
Chocolate colored strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick
Very mystic, bald stitches her wig
Kinky curly and dread, goddess gon' grant my wishes
Tantalizing touches, succulent skin, we should wed
Start off broke then stay together 'til we make it big
My queen is english, Sojourner Truth, I could learn from you
Never Ike Turner you, but look what you turn and do like
Get out of order, you're not a supporter of my dream
Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs
But she young and she speeding, honey now, what's the reason?
You just met this nigga, think you owe him a fucking threesome
So you lustin' to have a baby by a Denver Nugget
You don't love him, you want security, baby, your bugging
Financial liberty you're after, it's how you live
But the blood test shows it's not even his kid


Chanel bags, everything
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring
This her 3rd marriage, 4 carats
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it
Temptation, she can't let go her dirty habits
Mid 30's, spendin' dough at Magic
She's dancin', romancin', she's up at Mansion
She fucks all my mans, and they pop the magnums
So now what you gonna do, the morning-after pill is way overdue
'Posed to get married, now you embarassed
Who does this kid belong to?
Promiscuous, cuz' she got touched by step-dad, sex at
Such a young age, if you was a virgin, I'd get mad
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent
This song ain't to poke fun of you, to get laughs
I just love you, really love you
Here for you, wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you, be my lady
But first, I gotta see the baby


Ladies, I believe in you
We gotta stop this craziness out here, though
We gotta get right
Because when we both get right, we both take flight
Us real men need you, for real",https://genius.com/Nas-another-black-girl-lost-lyrics

Yeah, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'
Salivating at the mouth, South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be giving up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout 30 years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence

Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
Waves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition agin'

I got families I'm feedin', 'cause my mans is bleedin'
Every five seconds look in all directions
I come through prepared, I give 'em a call

Two niggas dead, Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day
Friday, somebody-gotta-die day
Saturday, put the gat away
Chillin' with your chick and a bag of haze
Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way
'Cause Sunday back to gunplay
Most shit start over nothin'
And get finished quick ‘cause the art of repercussion
Yeah, I seen it, a G going out indecent (when the block is hot)
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene (I gotta hold...)
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty
But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his 40s

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (yeah, word to mother)
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation (yeah)

A man rather die than live on his knees and starve
Cops steady askin' your man what happened
First he tell, then he stop, like he not really rattin'
Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off
(When the block is hot)
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggas' bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop
The streets lie (when the block is hot), so you better be cautious
Your man'll fry you plus everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin
(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm flossin'
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them
Queensbridge projects has taught him
And that's for life, you heard me right, I got the block

Sekou Story,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said

""Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now""

Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

The Makings of a Perfect Bitch,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggas in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress


I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath


Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words from a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt",https://genius.com/Nas-the-makings-of-a-perfect-bitch-lyrics
Imagine,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine we could all get along
Won't be long
Til that day comes
Mothers, stop cookin', take off your aprons
Father, stop lookin' at every sports station
Take a second
And think of every poor nation
Making weapons
They can't afford a plate, no proper healthcare
Over here in Section 8, a lot on welfare
Yo, the wealthy laugh, the market crash, economy's bad
How did we change it, newsflash about a power that's dangerous
How do we escape these brainless acts of terror
I'd tell you now, if Jesus ever comes, it'll not be better
Put our hearts in the right place
Humans of all colors
We stand up as one race, I promise you, one day
Imagine that

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

America, the
Land of the free
America, the
Land of opportunity
America
What's the point of having a Statue Of Liberty
If you turnin' refugees, back at sea
Music was made to move them
Even the devil he dances
I got a lot of questions
And I'm searching for answers
We taught to believe in religion, but religion's
The reason the Twin Towers are missin'
Listen
That was the past, but maybe now, you realize
The man above us the only thing
That keeps us alive
We breathe the same air
We bleed the same blood
Imagine our people treated equal, imagine one love (One love)

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world",https://genius.com/Nas-imagine-lyrics

To my niggas
What! What!

Looking back in time, when I had on my shine
I saw you standing there
I never tried to diss you, you didn't need your pistol
Why did you have to take it there
But then again, it was just my imagination
When my crew told me it was you that was player hating
Then we had to have that terrible confrontation
There's nothing I can do to help this situation...

Stay scheming (ya niggas kill me)
Niggas wanna get at me
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna get at me

Its been awhile since the last time we hung out
Full of weed, drinking henny until we all passed out
Stretch bently, Queens clique, pushing mean whips
And ho I'm with, glad who see she with
Shorty with the don
Me and horse switch cars
Jazz ruff for the six, this is it par
Thug nigga never thought I get this far
Who is that icing me from over there in the fog?
You got the mack god, you got the gat par
Dam, why they gotta do it to the black god
Everytime we chilling niggas want to act hard
My nigga Jungle known to slap a nigga back-ward
So we chill pay no mind, think about about shit
I'm for the love of it

I-I think you might wanna s-s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put the petroleum jelly on your face
Ayo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets that you knock their ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get them!

Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for?
My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin', my life get borin'
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin', but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, 
leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada, trying to stay away from creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger
, but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit

Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma

To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over
To look closer, told you: ""Y'all sloppy gangsters"", saying:
""Nas is this, and Nas is that""
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, 
guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say: ""That's the way you kill a man
Avoid the shooting"", hey {*echo* x4}

Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma

You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin

The transition from a young fool
Broke, still on his neck, he hung jewels
Live his life in the ghetto where guns rule
It was cool wasn't mad, I had to take out cabs
Made my first LP
 afforded H-Class, my face gassed
'
94, Sold out in every record store
Local hood rats who wouldn't speak
Now I'm who they're checking for
Shown crazy love, ran up on stage with 80 thugs
After the shows, my niggas robbed the bar and wrecked the clubs
Happy, no hating, more henny, 
more blunts circulating
My single in rotation on every radio station
Eyes popped when I drove my first ride on the block
Summertime, block parties, cookouts, 
I spend my knot
Truly, niggas was fighting over who was closely to me
Happy with the new representative of QB
To hit the top first you have to gotta fall before you make it
With for 4 minutes of your time, watch me demonstrate it

This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)

I was the main event on the TV for a while
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)

I was the main event on the TV for a while

Cayman Islands in the winter, summer bus rides to Great Adventure
I've brung New York back to real rap inventors
New crib, diamond rings, killers on my team
Infinitis for my girl for giving birth to my queen
3 g's worth of chronic a week
, promoters were mad
I stopped doing shows to spend time in the street
Loot declined, eventually so did my shine
Repo looking for my Lex, back then I wasn't buying
You can guess niggas started saying, with all the success
""Why is your mom still in the projects?"" I answered them vexed
Fuck out my face, pistol in my car, full clip
I read about Pablo Escobar and got on some shit
So called mans would plot on my chips, I was fronting
Niggas thought I was rich and got mad cause they was pumpin'
My assumption, niggas want me pumped in the casket
Kept the gun the same three-fifth a nigga got bagged with

This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)
(Mega popular center of attraction)
I was the main event on the TV for a while

Caught a case now, I'm home staring off into space
Flashbacks of all the jewelry, cars, crossing my face
Rappers I met, hoes on video cassette
No management, no more good life and no respect
Hearing crowds roar, crystal pouring mixed drinks
Haunted by the thoughts of second album sophomore
 jinx
Where did I fail? Death threats, woke up in cold sweats
Thinking about all these murders that know where I rest
From hanging with crazy cliques that's known to take shit
Bracelets, and all that beef now I'm involved, was paperless
My cars were auctioned off, now I catch rides with kidnap-niggas
Who snatch babies up to get back figures
Lessons from heaven, every night I slept with my weapon
To guard my family for a minute 
I forgot my profession
Not from Columbia or Nicaragua
Don't distribute coke from Antigua, that shipped out to Panama
Pablo Escobar's bloody reign came to an end
Far from my life; a kid who made his fame from a pen
Hit the studio and change the game again
Wrote down all the pain within, top of the charts, triple platinum
Got the fake love back, money stacks, more plaques
Had to see who I was just to know where I was at
Saw both sides of the game, all the ups and downs
This goes out to the future rap kings coming up now

This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style

Garbage man pick up the dirt, the birds don't chirp
There's this nice lady I know, she always speak
With her two children, headed to the school building
Then rush home again to lit housin'
And they are puttin' out the new ceilings
Cause her shits is leakin'
Water keep drippin' down, so she beefin'
Husband keep cheatin', he've been out all-evenin'
Good morning, police shifts the hood is on-in'
So they drive around all-day with bench warrants
Eatin' donuts and sippin' on coffee
Ooops! Sudden stop, it spills on the walkie-talkie
""Damn, this nigga is a creep""

With missin' front teeth twistin' blunts deep in the cut

Follow the light, it's just a great feelin'
And I love life, every minute is pure healin'
Can't you tell I'm much happy nowadays
No more child play, livin' life the foul way
My man just came home speedin'
Tryin' to catch up with 9 years of no freedom
The paper say, ""They finally caught him""
He back in, I guess street life got too borin'
Kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep
If you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street
Put on my 'lands and, leave the Phantom
Take the low-whip for a trip up to
 
Pan Pan's
Scramble egg whites and turkey bacon
""Ma, pass the hot sauce from out your apron""

And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho

Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh

A full moon up in the sky, that's a sign that
It's time to get my liberation, the perfect configuration
It's the birth of a nation, midwife black
Mother father, caucasian
My blood Indian, native
So now I'm contemplating being like Nat
'Bout to show you what I'm made of
I'm what racists are afraid of
No mule and the 40 acres
And despite that
Watch out for the traitors
When they say make America great again, do they mean make us all slaves again?
Don't be sidetracked

Is this you declaring war?
No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag
So you think I'm gonna run now?
No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back
This is me declaring war
This is me declaring war, war
This is me declaring war, war

Don't want to be a victim no more
Depicted as a criminal, especially when you're poor
Why doesn't the government order capital punishment
To officers
Who racial profile and put slugs in us
Makes me think they want us extinct
On the brink of insanity
We screaming for justice, they sending tanks, the man in me
Demand we protect the family, anarchy
Ku-Klux-Klan and him demanding he damage me
So my fantasy is every single one of us
Come against the evil divide of people, it's common sense
The fury, I hope the whole world hear me
No justice, so I became a revolutionary
No matter if you're red, white, black
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat

Is this you declaring war?
No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag
So you think I'm gonna run now?
No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back
This is me declaring war
This is me declaring war, war
This is me declaring war, war

Dear America, it's time for a better America
There's a little Nat Turner in every one of us
No matter if you're red, white, black
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat
War, war (war), war, war
Declare war
It's time
Let the spirit of Nat Turner live forever",https://genius.com/Nas-war-birth-of-a-nation-lyrics
Shine On,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006.0,"Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em

Yea, they dug me out the soil and the mines of the motherland
Now I'm displaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yea, guess that's how we got here, slave trade and the diamond trade
Every childs afraid when his mother and father get sprayed
Forced in the army, young killer brigade
Get's a new name, then he gets his nose glued
Till his mind can't take what he's going through
Lookin' in the dirt for that ice so blue
Then the royal family the ice go to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed
As I rap with my platinum chain
When you shop for me you think about the misery?
The same way we made apartheid history
We can do the same way to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine right?


My VVS glimmers on my chest, 200 thou encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how how people starve to death, when God blessed the land that lacks the harvest
The stones are quality, but their homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks, but she mad at me
Tear drop shape, ugh, perfect clarity
It shocks so many are killed annually
Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from they homes, mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives
Keep a Jesus Piece to be fly
But there was a time back in the day when they called that shine

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage

Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime
Check me out y'all

From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

It's yours
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin

One what?
One love, one love, one love, one love

Fake thug, no love
You get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though

QB since 1933
Street dreams are made of these
Everybody's looking for something

Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)

There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin' nobody, until one muthafucka fuck with 'em
And then all hell break loose

Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

Well known gangstas, entrust, that we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us, let's see
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motherfucker beggin' for more
It's Thorazine
Standin' here shakin', hatin' the haters, they watchin' my paper
Realize, a 4-5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop?
Nigga standin' there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show y'all muthafuckas respect
Plans connect
The twinklin' diamonds upon my neck
More Jazz than Hornacek
I blast, leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the Trench Coat Mafia
In a schoolyard, we make it hard
What's poppin' y'all?
We made our change; what's stoppin' y'all?
They spray y'all names Rest in Peace on the project wall

I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Sling them things 'til the very end, you better get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Giuliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit out of David Dinkins
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin', not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is death, umpires keep ice grills
There's no tomorrow, it's the bottom of the 9-9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My heart's full of braveness, so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen, startin' chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'

Yo, we here to eat food, my peoples be lethal
Shots in your body make you see-through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life bid, never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin' bigger
Celebs on the V.I., respect that nigga
Reggy on the regular, chops it up, like a editor
Come through one man gang like The Predator
If your wake, I'll wet it up, Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you
Air out your area, Queensbridge forever, what
Ill Will the label
Bravehearts, y'all scared of us

Yo, when those niggas ran, these niggas stayed
When those niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep QB, you ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin' and it's goodnight
Know how much force this is

Nothin' but horses, kid
We go to war for this

I slow dance with the Devil
Snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own pattern in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Fart through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart
Lot of blood gon' splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass
But y'all ain't never seen nothing
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit
Ya bitch been wanna polish the dick
The big Benz, I'ma model ya chick
With Zac Posen, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hiding my gun handle

Give it up smooth, I ain't begging ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate

Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financier, skull doo wrapped up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma TV's or first roll
Diversified dough in my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock and Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick, trick

Just Another Day In The Projects,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I had a dream I was a gangster, drinkin' Moets, holdin' Tecs
Makin' sure the cash is correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gun fights with the cops
Custom-made suits, hands full of ice and gold
Makin' thousand dollar bets on the dice I rolled
Girls workin' night patrol, the whore market
When I walk, niggas is rollin' out the red carpet
Now, how good could a black man have it?
Livin' like a king is a habit, I keep an automatic
The whole crew life is love above word
Rumors about the way we make niggas well heard
Nicknamed the ""Killa Clan"", soon to kill a man
If there's still a gram, I shake my left hand
And not do a minute on the rock
'Cause if I do a minute on the rock, the juries gettin' knocked
About girls I kept braggin'
'Cause I owned all the runner-ups in every state's beauty pageant
Inside my Lamborghini, pour you a Martini
Little kids in the streets, they wanna be me
I'm livin' in a mansion, hold a nigga's wife for ransom
I'm like a rich Charles Manson
A view, backyard, about 40 acres
You read about me in the papers
I hit the jackpot every night from all my crack spots
We attack cops for props
I got sons with guns, they all done crimes
They so wild, they even scare my ass sometimes
Other niggas on the blocks is so corny
I got my dime, I'm lookin like someone smoke for me
Bad bitches kissin' my ass
I got a few mill in the stash with beds made of cash
But on my head was a price
I made the bad-guys in Miami-Vice look nice
All of a sudden, I got raided, my crib was invaded
But, the Nas still made it ...
... To the getaway car
And now my drivin' skills gotta be up to par
The cops parked the car and sprayed till it was smoked up
That's when I woke up


Yea Nas, nigga
Word Life Kid

The whole thing was a nightmare
I fell asleep watchin' Scarface, layin' in the chair
Standin' on the block, it was flooded with cops
Through the parks was the D's and the Narcs
Watchin' me walkin' out my buildin
Starin' and hawkin shit, but I as fortunate
I usually be goin' out with the 9
Instead, I had 10 bucks to buy a dime ...
... Bag of weed, never cracks, I ain't with that
I bought Buddha, some Phillies and a Kit-Kat
Now I'm walkin' back, through the drug infested area
Which was filled with hysteria
When a cop yelled, ""Come here, black.""
I thought to myself, ""What part of the game is that?""
I didn't do no crime for you to be wastin' your time
With your antagonistic mind
He said that I was bein' smart and I better run
He looked like a Klans-man with a gun
So, I started floatin'
Police in Queensbridge, they don't be jokin'
I ran up my crib, in the nick of time
Rolled up a Philly and stashed the 9
Police later left, I was outta breath and what not
Somebody got shot, that why it's hot
I called my man and told him the adventure
And later, I meet him at the community center
I need a six pack of Beck's

Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the juxs at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens
All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices

Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin', ""God take me!""
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops separatin'
Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit

Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)

Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires
Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed

Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)

Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine

What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name, what the ugh
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown cat's through, blazin at his crew
I can't believe it achieve
Yo Cormega whatever whatever whatever

Pushin' a red lex
With many screams inside the headsets
So much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet
I keep red tech in the passenger seat
To match their heat
It's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep
It's on the kid
Whoever gets his first
It's going to kids dirt
My soldiers be cold blooded vultures
And cold blooded
Yo on the street we control hundreds
I drink polatas so all my people roll blunted
Your man froze when I rolled up
I symbolize death like a cobra
Attacks your life here it's over
Black you effed up
Never should've messed up
My black cocksucker scared to die tough luck
You know my steelo im like Al Pacino
Yo Nas Escobar grab the mic and flex a bar

I'm in the black limo
Jack Daniel through the crack window
I spot the fake red dot his face like a Hindu
Grab the symbol
Show examples to make examples
Essential amounts you owe to the fam crew
Firm affiliation paper chasing
Chip glossy rich pablo es cubano
Sophisticano
Yo blazing halos like shadow
Yo nigga im the castro
Im coming through on your wack crew
What you gonna do
Cormega pick the mic come through

Ay yo I get mines
Well enough to be considered big time
My crew a chosen few legit minds
Who live prime
Shorty's on some fly stuff
Admitted that can't resist mines
Mahogany complexion
Body probably dressed in
My ill tommy hill collection
When I be flexin', sketch it
My selection of words are type effective
When I rhyme words are verbalized remain present
In mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on
Recite nice on mics strike like a python
My gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on
My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming
Lounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt
Cats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming
Mega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon
Where my charcoal, new balance a lot yo
The narcs go knocked my man Marco
His money was marked yo
I regulate a sharp flow
But in my life bucaso
My mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo
I symbolize rive alive niggas
Ghetto's where I live
Considered my rhyme the oasis
Because rap was a desert
And I helped minds escaped it
Yo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet

Fake thug, no love
You get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low
I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak cats get played out
Get robbed and laid out
Prostitute turned snitch
I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range
Empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, thirty-two shots
Ya'll niggas don't want none of this

Ayo check it my man Joe Shan is downstairs
My man Georgie is lounging downstairs
My man Big Ice he lounging in Queensbridge
And all you real cats know what time it is
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
Now check the new verse
Check the new verse it's ill
Yo my millennium got people mind prisoner
Pain digital wood brain material
Rims spin sinister
Grin like John Dillinger
Iced out medallions my style will keep killin' ya
Misery and jealousy when you envision me
I'm getting mines and still livin' on the strength of me
You never bust nothin' or got ill touched nothin'
My baby face ice grill I heard something for real
In any cipher i'll serve em like a viper
I go for mines like I go for time on Rikers
Steelo like pacino benzino benz bilo we know
People we dope like mafiaso like gambino
Where Sergio Tacchinio took a jab in a casino
I like sony cause they saw my man keeno
Can't forget my home girl Faith Newman
She be boomin'
My people they representing
Every percent in
In my firm team
We so ill our people burn cream
Rhymes I design
Can make your mind turn fiend
I respect green I breath
For keepin Queen regulatin'
Nas be regulatin'
Smoother type regulations
Yo Escobar grab the mic just like you flex a car
You know my style son we in here ye ye

Yo no doubt Cormega get in for the firm biz
Straight out the bridge peace to my man Havoc
You know what I'm saying
I know you going through it right now baby
Don't wet it though
You gotta keep it going

Keep it flowing like that
Yo and to my man twin yo god bless your life
Yo my man harry god bless your life
Yo my man trip god bless you son
It was an accident, you know it was an accident
Life is real a lot of trife things be happening
I love yall kids I love my whole mobb deep fam
It's real like that you know life has tied me man
Yo I lived the life of 62 pick ups
Pumping on corners beat downs and stick ups
Seeing events in which you have to stay silent
Murder extortion and all types of violence
Yo kids living a life ghetto heaven
Selling cracks getting ready to attack with nines and mac elevens
You know my style
You can't stop what knocks me down
Peace to AZ, Nas, and figure Foxy Brown
My whole firm team is ill no doubt
I can't forget the commissioner he's called Steve Stoute
With the ill benz
He rocks the ill dimes and ill rims
You know my steelo
I'm like Al Pacino
God bless the life of my man nino

It's sort of like the conclusion to ""Color Purple""
Brothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject
I love teks let's get it off
Yo what up what up

Yo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex
I wear my guests in apendix
And cash my cheque in flesh shit
My man escobar be lighting a weed
And I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need
I'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man
Cormega, I just got signed to Def Jam
My man Nas is down with me
A lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me
It's like that, you know it's like that
We'll strike back Queensbridge style
My mobb deep people is mad foul
A juvenile delinquent wet your prequit
I get my money numerous occasions
It's frequent my man Ike
Tried to avalanche ice watch
You know my steelo Al Pacino
Yo Escobar

Reason,Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said ""My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum""
They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know

I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa

I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggas gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

Emily harmonizes as Nas talks:
""Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man.""",https://genius.com/Nas-reason-lyrics
Amongst Kings,UnKnown,UnKnown,"First I see a flashin' light, then on my own
I hear nothin', the smell of fire in brimstone
I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul
Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell?
Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell
Is it now that I'm to be judged?
Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights?
Will embrace me before force takes me
Like I'm movin' through high winds
See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends
Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near

You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land
Made in my image son of God son of man
You came in the spirit for I am that I am
Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb

Seen my body layin' down in the ground
It was painless, didn't feel a thing
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run
I was atheist, committed Suicide
I wish I could erase this shit
I seen a new life before the Christ
He created night & day, the sun & moon
From the virgin woman's womb
We lookin' down at my body, emergency room
Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed
It's my day of judgment, eternal peace & fire
Far past the stars far past the Orion
I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin'
Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin'


Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master and I
Face to face (uh) fightin' my case so we debate (where?)
Countin' all my sins (ok), where do we begin
When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10
It was all retaliation, (from what?) from way back then
Now I got the black Benz (and) trips from Aspen (and)
Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin'
You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth (Dear God)
Send me on a trip God please the Earth
So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin'
He gave me life, I screamed out loud that ""I Am...""
(Nas... Nastradamus)

And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven (I Am)
Clothe wit the cloud (Nastradamus)
And the rainbow was upon his head as a Crown (I Am)
And his face was lit as were the Sun (I Am)
And his feet as pillars of fire (Nastradamus)
And his name was Nastradamus (I Am)

Find Ya Wealth,QB’s Finest: Nas & Ill Will Records Presents: Queensbridge the Album,2000.0,"Crime, life, bitches, money
Time..
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times..

From ""Breaking Atoms"" to ""Illmatic"", to goin platinum
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate

Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket
Or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
How much it cost, Korean man brushin me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, ""I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?""

Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
You first time in you known for poppin your toast
By your third year in you forgotten by most
Niggas wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
In they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
In the projects, who gon' die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro

Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew

One on One,Street Fighter (All New Songs From the Motion Picture),1994.0,"In the Rotten Apple, take a bite, taste the worm
Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn
Coke connection drug bust, graveyards where thugs rest
I keep my mug blessed,the evil is illegal substance sold
Roll mob deep, guns in the black Jeep
MAC-11's in Legends, cracks in the streets
Patroller, gold money-folder, gun happy soldiers
Never sober, takin' over, my blood is colder
Niggas respect violence so I become it
I'm from it, I even done it blunted, so run it

Yeah, son, you know what this is
Take it off, [come on, dunn
Don't even come at me like that]

Yeah, imagine this: no guns, no knife
It's a one on one so now we gots to fight, son

Yo, I'm a cream fiend with a mean dream
Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin' fresh out the greens
Give you what you never seen, the infs on the MAC-10
It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens
Try hard and die hard
Chances of survivin' the game is like tryin' to feed Allah lard
I walk at piece with a deadly shadow
They want to blow me with the double barrel, foul, no sorrow
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in the thinker, dome
Make hell your new home, with the blue chrome
Mid-State wants me, suave fellow but raunchy
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country
But only to shed tears for years
Too wild for my own self, hopin' help is near
Street fightin' was cool, but in school I brought a new tool
Duelin' with the devil, a rebel, a fool

Imagine this: no guns, no knife
Just a one on one so now we gots to fight, son
Imagine this: no gun, no knife
Just a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah

Yo, whassup money? 
*sounds of brawl* 

I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep
Marked money I keep, play the benches all week
I visualize Coups, alligators in suits
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof
Sippin' 80 proof, watchin' Juice, but hold up
I see some brothers tryin' to roll up, wishin' I could fold up
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me – I'm out

Yeah yeah, kid, don't front
360 degrees, knowhatI'msayin?
That's how it comes back at you
Queensbridge, that's how we live
South side, all that

My Worst Enemy,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yea, uh, uh, real niggas dawg, ya heard
Yea, journey to the life, just journey

I'm the nigga that ain't loud
Throw C-low
, never ace out
Only move out wit a particular crew, I hate crowds
The observer, money and murder the hood praise it
I was raised in it, early age
Was presented with the ultimatum
Be a boss with a army, drop the Atari games
Hard cocaine that had my neighborhood strung out
Brains numb out, guns out
I was smart high hopes in my heart
But dope cartels would emerge
Bloody shirts on niggas while they hollerin'
'Til their lungs don't work
Figures I end up with a scarred memory of my youth
With dudes in the drug loot, feelin' henny ""SHOOT""
My nigga Will still here, man I wish it was truth
Buried in his favorite shit, FILA sneakers and FILA suit
My eyes are the window of my soul
My niggas let the Indo roll
Thinkin' time flies we gettin' old
That's the words of my right hand man, my main dawg
We been rollin since day one, he down for the cause
All he talk is extortion, kidnap shit, big gat shit
I'm like - ""yo think positive"", but he act sick
He only think about lettin' his Mac spit
He like fuck who he hit
Me it bothers, cause he know I'm rent 'em it regardless
If he keep wildin' out he's makin' both of us targets
So I pull him, tell him on some deep shit, try to school 'em
We already lost niggas by how we was movin'
We still livin', but our lives need much improvin'
I think I'm gonna lose 'em

I was blind in this world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack and run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
Like all this time, it's just a fragment of my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me

Feelin' like I got the dons clout
Trigger pawn cocked Glocks spray up your moms spot
I ain't playin' wit you, war, fuck pistols
Bring machines, icy bell buckles, ten guns, M-1'S with ice muzzles
Life's a struggle, get your wifey touch too, everybody involved
Homicide, doctors patchin' up your war scars
Task Force chargin' at us, news flash, thug crews blast at officers
Coroners pick you up from the grass
Livin' fast 'til somebody tries meltin' my chest
I'm high loosin' it, could of hit my own self with the tec
Refuse to quit, but I tried tellin' me to relax
It's like I can't hear my words 'til I'm trapped to the max
Even then I blame everybody else except me, pops left me
I was just three, I cried for help, moms was busy
That don't mean nigga's stupid
But I got a habit wit - makin' up excuses
Was born ruthless, hated school, they ain't teach me I'm a bad seed
Planted in this ghetto, where my niggas can't read
Multiply, subtract; only knowin' how to count cracks and count stacks
Now what y'all know about that
One side of me wanted out of this life
Glue traps on the floor for the mice
'Til the nigga saw the light
I wanted money when I got it, I would spend it
I wanted jewels, but when I heard it, yo I wouldn't listen
All of the drama in my life I got my self into
All the toxins my body took in, faded my mental
I let these niggas words get to me
But 
I'm tired of my ice, tired of Bentley
It's the end of the century
I recognized the world is a beautiful place
Niggas opinions ruinin' my musical taste
Cause everytime I caught a case, could of got me in jail
If you wasn't scared of jail, you more likely to fail
I thought the whole world was cursed, from the hand I was dealt
And +My Worst Enemy+ was my self
Word to my self...word to my self...word to my self...

I was blind to the world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack, run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live

Voice bump out the Bose in a tinted Rolls
Craftiness, take a stab at it
Don't ask if Nasty's back at it
I don't run out of magic
Popular, box-cutter flow
Time is money; the watch cost dough
Shakin' the dice, fragrances from some beautiful ladies
The lights, the ambiance, yeah, this is the life
The money, hotties on each arm - It's on

The third time's a charm
So, meet me by the Eiffel Tower
Bring a bottle of Dom

I am here (I am here)
This is the place (This is the place)
The atmosphere of espionage at expensive taste
And each one that I see is an unfamiliar face
So, I guess I'll just cut straight to the chase
And before I could say the name of who've I came to see
Someone suspicion then came to me
I'm so close and I've come so far
A glass of red wine sent from the woman at the end of the bar
I love to talk to you; but I don't have the time
She looks like the prettiest part of a perfect crime
Ohh, if I could I could I'd put a picket fence around a wild flower

You've survived the killer streets
Now you at the crap table, where the real villains meet
Number seven might get you to Heaven
You break the bank, just might make you a legend
It's after eleven, you playin' against a poker face
Genie eyes, light green, sippin' on Bellini's
You play your cards right, she'll let you touch
She'll be a devil in disguise; lady incubus
Better know who to trust
She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs
I'mma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em

My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not Bathing Apes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P
I'd take the grave or a bid
Then let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases

"The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show on WKCR October 28, 1993",Illmatic XX,1993.0,"Aiyo, this is big Nas
I wanna give a shout-out to my man Premo, you know?
From Gang Starr, no doubt
Lil' Dap, Jeru, Melachi, the whole crew (Foundation)
Queensbridge Crew, forty busters, shorty busters
Vernon Posse, Good Fellas, you know how that go
My man Ill Will rest in peace forever, God
Tragedy, MC Shan and the whole crew, you know how that go
Marley Marl, and my man Big Bo locked up in the piece
And my man Drawz, you know
(Big Mayo chillin', loungin' at the crib, check it out now)

The, the mic is open, yo
On the Stretch Armstrong showw, hosted by Bobbitooooooo

How should I start this?
How should I begin, to sin?
Grab the microphone and my rhymes'll win
Wheel of Fortune, spin, around
Check it out, I'm not a rap clown
Get smacked down by the fuckin' four pound in your dome
Hit you with the nick plate chrome
Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' home
Off the top of my head, yo, I'm a blunt head
Police... Police want a nigga dead
But I'm not goin' out like that, black
I kick the actual facts in solar
Cold as a Polar Bear, I swear,
 
word to Will
But I'mma chill, rhymes'll kill
Niggas know the style when I freak the profile
Asiatic Child, yo
Grand Wizard on the side of me
Get on the mic and bless the M-I-C

Ayio, but I'mma pass it off to my man Six-Nine
Kick it one time

Hey, yo, Six-Nine a true to life nigga
Yo, my style is iller, iller than Halle Berry's figure
Niggas don't fuck with the Six-Niner
Shorty, watch your mouth, I smack you back in your vagina
Here's the reefer, crack the Sunrise Tequila
Kill the Margarita, here's a 50, get some more cheeba
The ghetto trooper, so spark up the Bu-Buddha
My thoughts'll stay nasty like the underground sewers
To be the man, you gotta beat the man
It ain't nothin' startin' over here but nothin' mark my Timberlands
You want static? Let's have it
Niggas who flow like the Atlantic will sink like the Titanic
Since birth, I was thinkin' too fast
My first beef was with the doctor when he smacked me on my ass
The trigger man, I'm crazy like Sam
My skill's so ill like a white chick with a suntan

Check it out now
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis: my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
But, chill! Bless the microphone and say peace
So, Sudan, take the microphone in your hand
Kick the flim flam

So, check it out
I'm gonna give a strong shout-out, this is to my man Will
A little somethin' I done wrote up for my man Will
It goes somethin' like this, it's called Rock-a-bye Homeboy
Check it out

Queensbridge, when will the drama ever cease?
I'd like to say peace, Willie, and rest in peace
A cool brother who's all about justice
I still can't understand how he left us
Well... he's gone and life goes on, you know
We had a crew, but one by one we go
Memories of his face that was full of joy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye homeboy
Reminiscin' with the brothers standin' on the block
Never talked a lot, never was a big shot
It's so hard to say goodbye, a sad song
And damn, I can't believe my man's gone
Diggin' back in the days when we used to laugh
Now its a memory that's haunted from the past
Poor Willy, its a shame how the ghetto got him
And word is bond - I wanna cry when I think about him
Three bullets to his back on his own block
Not a way to go, killed by the buckshot
Queensbridge, wake and up and smell the air
And stop killin' like a villain, like you don't care
Remember Willie and the times we had with joy?
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Quensbridge style!
Rock-a, Rock-a bye

My skills are ill like the prez with a plan
My brothers run from Sudan then the Ku-Klux-Klan
Like a kamikaze, Saddam Hussein then won
Feel the buns of a nun, put tricks for funds and chill (Wooo-ooooh)
I spill a verse so you can understand
I kill rappers off quicker than a motherfuckin' Mic Man
And when it comes to a battle, I stand out tall
Like the man who played the man on The White Shadow
One two, one two

What you gonna do when the flavour's comin' after you?
Grand Wizard, take my side
Grab the microphone and I'mma rock it up like...

To my man Jungle, dwellin' in the jungle
Where must we go? Where must we wander?
Deep out the skies come the MC Nas
Not to surprise, but to civilize
All the dumb men wanderin' around the streets
Listenin' to a nigga rappin' on fly beats
I just kick the mad Phillie style
Get buckwild 'cause you know my style
I could run a word, kick it to a herd
Make 'em turn into a rich man, increase the plan
The master plan, yo, I'm buggin' out
'Cause the weed got me buggin', plus the Guinness Stout
Grand Wizard, yo, you my physical
Why don't you mic the make, make the microphone miserable?

It's the G, the G, the G, the G, the Wiz
You know that our culture's gone get theirs
I got my man Nasty on the side of me
My man Six-Nine, you know we're not hidin', G
I am the man that'll break it down
I'll break it all down 'cause I got the sound
I got Queensbridge backin' me
The Tec and everythin', I'm comin' strapped, G
It's like that, check it out, uh huh

Yo, check it out, y'all
Money and murder, money and murder
The sick shit you heard comin' from my motherfuckin', my swerve
The words are poetic
I sound energetic when I'm blunted or Moët'd
My microphone's upsetted 'cause I'm crazy
Now you know, never lazy
Yo, I'm gonna get all the cash I can
Don't give a fuck if I gotta shoot a policeman
Pluckin' a church and snatch a fuckin'...
Nah, can't be flippin' like that
'Cause you niggas try to jock the style
But I left that shit to get the new shit to flow like the Nile
Now you can't catch up, G
'Cause I got the new styles on the M-I-C
I keep gettin' newer, can't step to a
Nigga from the Bridge, so, you keep that shit
And I'mma flip the script next year
And my real name is Nasir
Can't spell it 'cause I say it too clear
The alphabets are not enough words or letters to use
When it comes to mics, I bruise
I just go with the magical mystic flow
Niggas don't know, that's word to the man Bo
I get Illmatic with the style that's insane
Comin' out a fuckin' murderer's brain
Grand Wizard, please take this mic from me
Before I bug the fuck out and wind up D-A-E-D
Wait, D-E-A-D, I'm buggin', fuck that shit",https://genius.com/Nas-the-stretch-armstrong-and-bobbito-show-on-wkcr-october-28-1993-lyrics
The Prediction,Nastradamus,1999.0,"What's happening brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time

Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsing
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blasting
As the Earth rebels my womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shifting comb-fisting I predict Goddesses you running after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and logged
All paper money is gone
Confused scholars can't interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes
We know the young is old
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told",https://genius.com/Nas-the-prediction-lyrics
It’s a Tower Heist,UnKnown,2011.0,"Born in NYC beastin'
, the lord left me no choice
Christian pendants, 
Islamic thoughts
, criminal courts
Father forgive, 
I wanna die like Godfather did
Standing in lineups I'm paying lawyers, ain't trying to bid
Alliances surveillance watching 'em careful when plottin'
My boys were captured on video, farewell to my partners
Ski masks and fake tags in case the car was spotted
Lavish hotels, Central Park West, fly apartments - let's rob it
Forensics get us sentenced so we the smartest
It's livest as Saturday night as I load up a cartridge
Let off the fully, got alibis, no need to worry
Done right, we don't see the prosecutors or grand jury
Reputed mobster style, take the money and run
Count it in warehouses, leave town and 
live 100 years like crocodiles
Straight up NYC like a Mets fitted
This a tower heist, even Donald Trump can get it

You want respect, money and power, right?
Well let's ride tonight; it's a tower heist

I got my shades on, got my money in my pocket
Got my J's on, spend a hundred for my watch
I feel amaz-on, it's a jungle in these streets
Choppers be going ""bang"", your people need be deceased
Everyday is war, living legends you must applaud
So light my cigar, or for the foreigners living large
Dealin' straight raw, the Mercedes in my garage
Your girl on my dick and I may just feel like menage
I came for the cash, me and Nas behind the mask
Cause, bitch, it's a heist, give me ice or lose your life
My profit's so nice me and dog gon' count it twice
It's poppin' tonight, roll the weed, give me a light - UGH!",https://genius.com/Nas-its-a-tower-heist-lyrics
Everyday Thing,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uh, word
You don't get this everyday, word

With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobaro
El Dorado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life's like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems
Shot pockets, niggas on the block rock this
Box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in triple ways
Goin' through this difficult stage called life
With each year, my physical's praised
Niggas slip beyond the reach of help
Caught in the street, thinkin' they can teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly feed our family, these streets are insanity
Amber me, caught inside a thugs fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy desire, hold this 9, ready to fire
You know me, show me the money like I'm Jerry McGuire
It's on..

It's time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way
Predictin' platinum in less than a day
So for that we toast, this one's for us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps, stack, relax and smoke
Watchin' my dreams come true
Stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politicin' with the wisest brothers
It's Nature, one of the latest, peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge, one of your kids' favorites
From now 'til the day that I'm stiff
Foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways, type chauvinistic
Since a youth, I had a thing for big Coups
Flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin' my riches in lump sums for trust funds
Fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While some'll get drunk, beat wives and cuss sons
A slow process called life, lets show progress

When I said I hold my own, I wasn't frontin'
Never claimed to be the baddest, for skills, I got a little somethin'
Comin' through, new clique and tracks
Known for blazin' on The Chronic, that's what put me on the map
Nothin' could give me more pleasure to start this
I worked the hardest
Ducked the farthest, makin' me illest producin' artist
Done crimes, ran from one-time
Could catch me with my crew bustin' rhymes in the Sunshine State
No case, to build I chill with millionaires
Out to make a killin', for real, my resolution this year
Few places I walked, most imagine
New faces I met at beauty pageants
Past cuties now wanna do me
Yo, I never forgot where I'm from
I check for family and every nigga who was down from day one
If you ain't speakin' money language, I can't hang
You know your conversation is weak, so it's senseless to speak",https://genius.com/Nas-everyday-thing-lyrics
The Second Coming,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Third grade, singin Star Spangled Banner
Using proper manners, learned to handle anger
Animal behavior
Later on my block rockin wit my jocks on
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn, hummin a KISS rock song
Socks long to my knees
Summer breeze runnin through the leaves
Playin freeze tag, can I stay out, please dad?
Can I hang wit my little gang out?
Hearin shots rang out, heard my moms call my name out
Come upstairs, run up stairs
Take a bath, shit stained underwears
Wipe yourself wit paper
Bad little ass in my bed at 8:30
Wash my plate, ate dinner up late
Gazing at the wall, prayin basketball
Was my future for this young one
Hooping in the sun, proud to be where I come from
Later shootin guns fantasizing
Fascinated by gold rope chains
Looking back at my hood days but things ain't change
 *all Nas samples* 2x
""Nasty-Nasty-Nasty Nas is a rebel to America""
""Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure""
""It's like that, you know it's like that""
""Nas-Nas'll catch wreck"", ""You got the mad fat fluid""

Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes
Pinky rings, bank robbers wit two's, boss of wild crews
Slacks overlapsed, apple jack hats, quarter field coats
Cadillacs wit white walls and chrome wheel spokes
They was organizing, investing in a piece of the hood
They had drugs, bettin numbers, police understood
They played the Cotton Club, red carpet, hoes on they arm
Plush minks, pimped out gangstas, civil rights wasn't won
E'ry Christmas they was Santa Claus
Nixon was the anti-christ
Bitches ass was bigger than sniffin nose candy white
Listenin to Malcom speak, talcum powder shaving cream
Layin back, barber chair, straight razor clean
Babies is born, big families started to blossom
Mad people just applied for apartments and got em
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers
From tommy guns to mac 10's
QB's new born killers (shit is changed)
Chorus 2x

Yo everytime I turn around, niggas shot, niggas stabbed
Winter nights, pregnant girls strugglin to get a cab
Fiends lurkin, D's searchin, pat pockets
Kids quick to bed but they heads from gats poppin
Queensbridge slingers hoppin out Benzes, don status
Dope fiends got syringes, poppin out they arms sractchin
I remember park jams
Gazelles, perfect wave shell
Adidas, smellin reefer way before purple haze
Private stock bare, niggas wit ill walks like Mark Clare
Hats tilted, wild niggas lickin shots in the air
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names would switch
Ain't nuttin changed but the names Nastradamus and Blizz
What project is this?
QB, Vernon and Tenth
12th Street, murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me, nigga's seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done, just remember my name

Niggas you ain't like dickin' your wife, what?
Kind of undermining, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan
Heathens, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons
But glory go to God, y'all beneath him
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat
He'll show you streets where them big dealers drove at
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap
Blocka-blocka-blocka—oh
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows
Everything a hood brother think he needs—yo
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap
And I'mma use that for the—

In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the past
Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash
Lawyer want cash, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gel
They burnt a range with a Molotov cokctail
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Them cops swear, my little nigga told on me
I'm thinkin, ""Hello, where's the L-O-V-E""

So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke
Damn, nigga, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms
So she don't have to bone for dimes?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects
Where dogs shit and piss
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics
Might've been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars
To ten LPs
What can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?
I'm Nas—on a track that's unorthodox
Like my life could've been offed by the cops
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale

(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if you was in this game
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) You'd feel the whirlwind blow you

My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope
, 
just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
Speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
Dealers, bitches,
 killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat,
 pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely
, 
don't want no pity save it


Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper
As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead

Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat
Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black, bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip from the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles and spark weed

But the Pimp shit in me says yo, keep looking for ass
My daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snows
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till
You’re grown, when in love you will know
Everybody’s gotta dream I hope to wish to own a six times two
… against who I don’t know
So one who fed you won’t blow, you won’t eat, you won’t cake
Pay mistake, blaming me for their failures I'm fresh
Getting tale single breasted
A lip brush is sense less some pimp shit
A women hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him

It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin'

Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin'

They never seen it comin'

Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?

'Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it

6 pack, gunnin' my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin' real loves stories like
Caesar and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, 
but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin' to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you

Even though you'll be grown soon
You gotta stand on your two
Please listen what daddy told you
I know you think that I'm old school

But you don't owe her no favors
But her respect is due
See, daddy just wanna show you

All the heartache I go through 
(If I had it all)
It's for you

If this world were mine, I'd give it all to you

On The Real (original),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yea (House of Hits)
Finally up in this nigga
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal
To my seed, May I lead you into no breed of evil
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, Monkey do
A shorty sipping sunny dew
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. thats mad smokey
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Marriot, Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell the hoes to hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens
Rolling on you non descript niggas
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust
Chorus
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x

Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use
This is your sorry excuse
Get your neck put in a noose
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce
Over the snare drum
We reproduce like cum
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was
Giving life to idea
Through the verse is what he does

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers
From the ruckus
Your gone and your crew still love us
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town
Chorus 2x

(Play some treats on us)
Drugs in my shirtsleeve
The side bubble converti
Eyes low cause the lye blow
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow
Write a line sipping a glass of wine
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with
Exhale precise shine like cocaine white
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinit's and lexus
So send my enemies a message
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot
I'm still protected
So never ask why I write so violent
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and
When I performed niggas mic's went silent
To the kid who made my man Ill Will's blood spill
(On the real)
When I catch up to your ass you know the deal

On the real

Sampled
)]
Angel Dust
Yeah, 
Angel Dust
Yeah
Yeah, 
Angel Dust

Angels with dirty faces, angels with broken wings
The devil's dust, PCP invading bloodstreams
People lining up to get it, fantastic, knew how to flip it
Illegal substance constructed and plus addictive
Trusted and respected, almost got me arrested
All the time I invested in school is now of question
Child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own vomit
A fool for chaos, taking what we could salvage
Hustling is a art, I'm just tryna be smart
Strung out bodies found in the park, Shaolin was my heart
We stood for loyalty, all we had was each other's back
My raps were like crystallized powder before crack
Raw, uncut, like what is sold in front of the storefront
The sidewalk was my brother's office
We cut our losses, I had choices
I took a pen, became the voice for the voiceless
My people walking in a zombie state
Life is short, even mine's at stake

""The government says that angel dust can kill you if you take it or it can cause you to kill others
.""
""The scourge of angel dust has been linked to psychosis, violence, schizophrenia, and the epidemic runs especially rampant in the Bronx. My administration will hunt down these poison pushers and arrest them one my one until we get directly to the source

Escobar ’97,Men in Black - The Album ,UnKnown,"Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities and hood movie stars
Gat slingers, now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar

The path we all walk starts out long, it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancin' with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly
High up in a five, realizin' the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it
Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, Dijon-scented with Al Green on
My theme song, 
Love & Happiness
, how can it seem wrong?
I mean, before this, 
I used to rock a Taurus with the donuts
Now, I grown up, I got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho 'nuff
Niggas actin' cool but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz off the Dutch
This is everyday, every second gotta make it pay
Every lesson I learnt got me open
While most of these rappers'll stay burnt


With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobarro
El Derado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems and shot pockets
My niggas on the block rock this, box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in triple ways
Goin' through this difficult stage called life
But each year, my physical's praised
Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity
Amply, livin' in this thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, livin' this king's life
Magazines write about me in this dream, it's all tight


Now, the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Ice, the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track but I caught that
They thought I lost that, but I'm continuin' to make more stacks
Halftime, New York State of Mind, It Was Written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin' on the plane, wake up when we land, feelin' real scared
On the ground, Rollie flush, princess cuts and large rounds
The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy
I didn't make the game, the game made me
Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions
Haters keep hatin' and ladies'll keep glancin'

Right here with the amazing Green Lantern
Serious radio, y’all know what it is
NaS too real, NaS true king
You know the king
Cars with police radars on highways boppin
Bullpin therapy cell block dodging
Pissy stairways missed them days not when
They shut down the stores when I’m shopping
Used to be pop locking, train hopping
Face covered in stocking
Six pack Bud drinking gambler
Fuck them cameras in front of the man
Sing the hustlers mantra, hands of luck
More hits than gambling huff
I hollered Indosia, 40 belows covered the toes
I was a soldier with the Popeyes sippin Amota
Nigga honestly I call this a culture
My sister’s a snake, my brother’s a vulture
My mother’s the block, my father’s a ghetto piranha
Swimming with sharks my tones false settle drama
Obama, if the kids mirror you
We’ll all push Masaratis with the silver hue
They fear that connection
I rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection
Gotti was a racist but he still get praises
We don’t give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta
Bricks come with Bill Clinton’s name on it taped up
Hollywood Lohan parties people they facing them
Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim
Know some hood girls who did time that could take them
Rappers changing families, fags are all lost
I’m at the Waldorf, Vancleave under the sleeve
Save the small talk, I feel alive
New Porches Jordan number fives
Already said I’m the last real nigga alive

Ill Will...yeah yeah yo...Queensbridge niggas...crud love baby..
Verse 1: (Ruk)
Aiyo, I zone out
Feelin' like I'm in Capone's house
Starin' at Manhattan and The Bridge with the chrome out
Ki's on the table, black tanktop, long cable
Thoughts of overtakin' the table
Dismantle and disable
Verbal, made fatal, what drug paper do
Straight duct tapin', apin' a few
Takin' Mo' and Henny straight and things loose
Puffin' the fruits, thug in a duece
Flaggin', pants saggin', fuckin' ya goose
I'm like nothin' to you
Dumpin' the Rug' and your group in a red coog'
Jump in the Isuzu and cruise
Blank tints, bulletproof, red Timb boots
Nigga loose, license plate screamin' ""Fuck you""
Drunken days, I wish ya'll knew
Thug dreams, what it means to you
Red seams, triple beams

Pinky rings, big rounders with tools, bossin' wild crews
Slacks, overlaps, applejack hats quarterfield coats
Cadillacs with white walls and chrome wheel spokes
They were organized, investin', had a piece of the hood
They had drugs, bettin' numbers, police understood
They played the Cotton club, red carpet, hoes on they arm
Plush mink, pimped out gangsta, civil rights wasn't won
Every Christmas they were Santa Claus, Nixon was the Anti-Christ
Bitches asses were bigger then, sniffin' nose candy white
Listenin' to Malcolm speak, talcum powder, shaving cream
Layin' back, barber chair, straight razor clean
Babies were born, big families started to blossom
Mad people just applied for apartments and got 'em
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers
From Tommy guns to MAC Tens it's Q.B.'s newborn killers
Verse 3: (Ruc)
96 buildings of children, guns, and bad feelings
Q.B. see we rep by the Millions
Each block, ten spots, a hundred different villians
In abundance my dunnettes run this drug dealin'
Stash the jums in hallway ceilings
Gangsta paradise, watch the ice, nigga make a killin'
In the cut on the steps yo gettin' good neck
Only in the projects, we die with respect
Pussy niggas quiet as kept will riot the set
Six blocks of real niggas vexed
Assorted irons and vests, stress on they chest

If you knew my streets—
—you would know, all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who's snitchin', who told police
Who came home, who's still gone, who rest in peace
Now they killin' over music-money, not drugs—rap replaced it
'Cause thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks—I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Saddam Hussein
—still alive, lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
I birthed the game, learned you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft, man, y'all need some new weapons
The Ps breed warriors in skullies and Timbies
Around micks, spics, niggas, and guineas
From my ghetto kings in deep thought, we don't blink
But don't think we wastin' our time
It's a New York state of mind

New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoah ohh
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty

It's like a jungle out here
So much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest
Sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the Streets of New York
(New York state of mind, New York state of mind)
All I see is street hoes
And bullet holes in our people
Only crime fills the brain
Feels like I'm goin' insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the Street of New York
(New York state of mind)
New York state of mind
(New York state of mind)
C'mon

New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
State of mind (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
State of crime (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
Big dreams (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
Big schemes

Oh, it's like the game
Just ain't the same
Baby thugs and girls
With no shame
Can't get away (get away)
Epidemic plague (plague)
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons cause believing's hard to find
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)

I'm from the home of a million legends and trend-settin'
A lot of footsteps to follow, I been steppin'
Mind stressin'—tryna find direction, crime spreadin'
Time precious, I ain't have rest since 9/11
I live fast, hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave
Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin' off
Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war
The eve of the Apocalypse, evil people in politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and, Ra; the gangsta's opera
So, New York City—walk with me, talk gritty
It's up to us, New York, it's our city
Here the man come with the anthem—hands up
It's time, the thrill is back New York, so stand up

Black pirellis rolling over this makaveli
Two platy LPs
Still the feds tap my celli
Made a mil and another mil
Just signed another deal
From the bridge ever summer deal
Niggas run to steal
Cracks and bundles
Wanna be down ask Jungle
React humble but we blast guns too
Now to son you is a deeper plan
So when I jam
Reach the pan
Check the sale let the sound scan
Keep a brown tan
From vacationing
Chicks in Vegas
Tryna guess us how much we made to spin
Two Tiphannys from the Colosseum
Green olive BMs
Tracks from TM lack when we see em
Grip the heat
When the sixth season
Jump out the S4s
And test yours
Tudor watches
Allah watches
Stubborn, you won't admit that Escobar got this
On top let me explain what the cock is
Firm Biz came livin'
Naturally fly, diamond rings glistenin'
Make it seem sickenin'
What's really ill is how the team's clickin'
Femme Fatale on some dope shit
Flow sick we stay incorporate
Firm giving you a dosage
Of high explosives
You kidnap we kidnap
You blast shit, I did that
Cuttin' through the chase we bring it to where you live at
I wouldn't play you
I'd rather try you by your label

Miss maximillion
Exotic diamonds let it charm
Legal life of bear arms
Protecting my squad from harm
Murder, Danger
Backstabbers and snakes
Murderers and Jakes
Spend thugs but the drugs a case
Fuck y'all feel
And them accusations you make me
Wow femme fatale we increasing the stakes
Platinum plates choosin' isles
Like my cheese willie style
850 on the dig and if you see me

Major league mamis
With the bodies
Got your clique quick to buy these
Who wanna try these?
Firm colleagues
Somali's, think they're badass
16 bars on that ass
Y'all niggas shat ass
Ali aye quatro
Play the passenger of chaco
6 to got though
Think you hot but you not though
Play the corner
Be the type of bitch to run up on ya
Much longer
While y'all get short bread like launa
You're a goner
Rhyme shoota, top shootas
With the lugas true das
Stats rulas
Firm biz grab the cougas

It be the firm biz getting it off
Slow regez the elegant black prince
We take the top gator
Black and shrotopass like im a raider
Sophistacater
Hang tight like dre right
Flow like hawian in the broad day light
I give all that I have
All in my power to see the day
That the crowd weighted
You expired and outdated
Re segregated
None of my people graduated
Ain't no progress in the projects
It's the same process
Rise to the top of New York
Keep the digest
Through all my cornets
Global solar
It's young omar
The shuffuler
We analyze who they really are
Familiar, blow holes into your interior
You minute, little man
You think you general?

I put the hinds betters
Fake thugs styles glued together
Saying old rhymes show signs
You're through whatever
Eat your heart out
I play my part now
Fiend to be part of the squad
But I'm not gonna be shot down
Who's how now? I'm disgusted at you
Rap doo doo
It's funny if you let these cats fool you
The whole no wait
Your values dying at a slow rate
Opposition track live niggas pop gats
Been doin' this since the days of hot tracks
Claimin' you in the firm how's that?
When you got your spot jacked
Read between the lines
The foulest dreams was lead to blind
Tonight is excellence redefined
In the form of Nature, Noreaga
Nas, Mary J. Blige
Femme Fetale on the rise
Manager extraordinaire
My man, Jungle
Pussy rebundled like desert plans
Spitting vivid raps
My whole clique rocking fitted hats
Millionaire status play the block give it back
Thanks to who?
My pen names tight like langston hughes
Generating chips, picking which banks to choose
Clever robberies, on deposits
I got this, why niggas on the blocks
Stare at bitches gossip
I pop shit so understand me
From day one I rap whole new guns
That run in the family

Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan
Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas

Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan

You can try to kill me, but I come back
Hate me, that's a small thing
Demons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring
Bitches try to see me down, hugging the floor
Bullets pulling me, playing tug of war
With my body, gravity got me
Police want me arrested, just to see me naked
Snakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip
Thugs shooting reckless (every night, niggas)
Wonder, how will I exit (from this life, niggas?)
Think you a killer, get cement shoes in the river
You should watch them people with you
Let them street rules hit you
If you hang around snitches, you get judged for that
'Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that
There's slugs for that
Oh, you didn't know your man was talking?
That's why you stand with him, 'til you both land in the coffin
When you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought
Every time this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk
Early on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas
So a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas
I fuck with, only the trusted thug clique
Who really done shit, run up in your bitch, bust the gun quick

Some bitches lie a lot, they could be fly or not
Actresses cry a lot, their girlfriends spy a lot
They can shake your hand, girl, then they take your man, girl
The whole hood knowing, we got something good going
None of these hoes is after me
'Til they saw us happy and that you bagged me
Now they wishing that they had me
So watch who you hang with, and who you cling with
You know these bitches ain't shit, they hoping to bank chips
(With a baller) after she done gave him some head
(He never called her) he gang it and he left her for dead
Birds of a feather fly together
But chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die
And you affiliated, now you look weak
'Cause your peeps is freaks
Credit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets
And they brought your down in the dirt
You was a pretty, young, smart thing
Going to work, I bet it hurt, 'cause you had a clean rep
But the girls you seen with make these niggas say
""I bet that bitch suck a mean dick"", word

That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me

A warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne
Fake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own
I'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth
Never been a follower, my momma told me be a boss
Watch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down
Friends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown
And some only come around when everything is green
Be careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team
For every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus
If somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it?
There's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly
Keep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy
Don't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant
My politics boss up, for you black empowerment
I stay in my element, Braveheart intelligent
Only associate with those for my betterment
I'm out for dead presidents to represent mines
Only click with my kind, my best friend is my grind
Everybody got big dreams, but few follow through
And it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you
Don't just be sitting around smoking weed, letting time fly
If your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell 'em bye
You're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew

Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man

You Don’t Know Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Girls I got 'em locked so similar to a prison
Hear this monster jam, I be callin' it 'GANGSTERISM'
I murder you for dope, I'm the street distributor
I'm homicidal, pointin' the pump, scope to shoot you
Street connects, Mob ties on East and West
We gouge out your eye balls if you seen too much
Hopin' out drops wit blings and stuff
Wit ball players wives, Mercedes 5
Dangerous lives and haters die rollin' with convicts
Conscience who tolerate no nonsense
Fake rappers in doo-rags, get shot-up at their concert
Your bitch bleed, bitin' her nipples with my chipped tooth
I drink her blood, like I'm Dracula, mack in the 6-Coupe
The sky becomes red, heard y'all niggas work with the feds
Doesn't matter, blood'll splatter, everybody must dead
I got urge for self-reinvention, but I'm old-fashioned
From the corner's with the winos laughin'
Dealers and five-o blastin'
Capitalist thoughts like Presidents
I'm burnin' Bush's, Nas the realest, it's nuttin' to fuck wit

You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma)
..Don't think so (Don't think so)
It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?)
What do you know about me?
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
About me
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
You'll never know

I smoke weed like them sixties rebellions, hippies on heroin
Spliffs inhalin', what I speak strictly for felons
Dippin' in their 6-4, hittin' the switches
Or sittin' in their Bentley Azure's, feelin' the riches
Or just ridin', truck drivin' Impalas, Denali's
I fuck with those but I lust for silver Ferrari's
I fuck hoes with the ceilings, have mirrors to watch me
My bed shaped like a pyramid, feelin' the dry heat
Spillin' Courvoisi', I'm half slave-master
Half Apache, half African, mutts is what I call us Black men
Lead astray, on drugs and cups of alcohol, cause back when
They let us off ships; the soul of man was lost or trapped in
But every ghetto, every hood, no matter where the town
It's all haunted, all on top slave burial grounds
Dead cooks, workers and maids, under this Earth in rage
Ancient whore houses that explain my sexual ways
Money and murder: interprets the American dream
The world loves a gangsta, I found my place in this thing
Royce's, diamonds and bosses, woman who're gorgeous
Traitors, killers and enemies, remorseless, we live this

You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma)
..Don't think so (Don't think so)
It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?)
What do you know about me?

Gypsies, preachers, choirs, churches, liquor stores
The world is full of liars, curses, people rich or poor
Without God to worship, see we would be more lost
Gotta believe in somethin', or their would be no laws
A ghetto child occasionally blunted in Mansions
My cup overflow with Cristal, hundred exotic dancers
Niggas is plastic, ass gets jealous and passive
My pistol blast at; cowards, leechers, and rappers
Niggas I fuck with is 'Bravehearts', make G's
Before rap music to me, was wind blowin' the trees
Birds chirpin', rain fallin', perfect and free
But bitches saw my video and think they know me
These niggas bad talkin', claimin' they gon' do me

The World,UnKnown,2008.0,"Where we met, I had to give her her respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back
He jumped in the meter cab, just took her cell and told her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, And I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass..how she gone get to the projects?
She ain’t got no cash, and she struggling while walking
So I drive past, ""Yo"" I say ""I ain’t no stalker wit yo big ole ass
Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift""
Who woulda knew it turn to this? Now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left my ex, damn we speedin

I’m a king, you the queen
His and her 6’s and diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then..
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in

Baby girl had a son
He was 3, yea I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Naw, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie..that’s cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it’s a setback..
I don’t respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you..
But when you make a girl leave a man..
You never really know where she stand..
How you know she really yours?

Ay there go my book... I been looking for this book
What, What... Yea

I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime, since the blackout in Queensbridge in 79'
Everybodies a killer now... pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block, push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window, where ever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens Kings
I used to view the cats that I owe... see things...
That made me real, but my skin and my soul
Girls who turned hoes
Friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring Death where ever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know... it's all real though!...

Where the Jakes Crew face young kids who wanna eat
Quantum Leap to this Black World, Hustlers, and Ghettos
Cell mates, millionaires, who tussle with the Devil
Bust a lil metal lead (led)
Wrestle you... to the pebbles... on the hard gound
That's if the God's down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the hard with the god Shapelle... a Queens Conrad
Yo run and come with the dime bag

Yo, Yo-Yo
Ayo I need dat
I got to smoke dat...
Sell me some Chunky Black

So I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain
But the thought still remain
Yo it's on again
Once the jail take these chains
Cause I been through it
The drug game I thought I knew it
I got knocked, went to trial
But I blew it
25... but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me
Got me wrapped up like a Mummy
Now I'm in the system... aka the Devil's Home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with... drug dealers, and chain stealers...
Bitch niggas, who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots
But I sip alot of Savage
I sat him down, and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...

The Outcome,Nastradamus,1999.0,"Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames flew from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red
Her hair was half permed, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon pace
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their poison, spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggas smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love takes over lust
Despite the damage to Destiny

I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around
Or I'm wasting fabric

Cause you to suck your teeth
Some mean-mugging on my clean thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry writing Russian
Ice disgusting. I started bling
How could you question my direction?
I'm king, I'm cultured, not just cause of
The foreign movie posters, the frames
Starring French names, look closer
? to the worm food
I despise and watch fake wise guys who turn stool
And speak highly of late made guys who once ruled
Hard-bottomed shoes

chauffeurs flaunt ambrosia
My baby moms wrote a book that couldn't harm a soldier
Muhammad Ali hobbies, no pilates, jogging, jumping rope
Til my body cut up like a bag of dope
And hope I die ?

Money's not evil
It's the love of money that's the root
Not a luxury car worshipper, but I purchase
Particular vehicles, so me and my dudes, we can cruise
Upsetting policia They study my natural sleepy eye
To see if I'm high.
 I got my piece of the pie
My 40 acres is my 40 karats on my piece, that's fly
Carti bracelet, you talk that talk and walk that walk
You wouldn't understand our thoughts

Why the fuck you care if I rap about
How much my sneakers cost? I'mma floss

Da ha ha ha
Da ha ha ha ha ha

It was '87
Crack money was ""Ghetto Heaven""
Niggas gettin' it
Every block rise to perfection
Green tops, boulders and bottles
Soldiers who follow leaders
You owed 'em dollars
Know that tommorrow you might not see it
Packs got knocked off by sprinklers that never worked
All the way to the monkey bars, cross that line you got murked
That's other niggas territory had fiends in the cheese line
They told them fiends calm down, ten dollars each dime
They never scared of Po-Po, was only one patrol car
They wasn't up for crack and I was up on the chin of Pa
Watching hustlers with tinted cars, money makin'
But one kid was into takin'
Had dreadlocks wasn't Jamaican
Fort green he laid
First nigga I ever saw rockin' dreads with a fade
Lead he sprayed on the corners in my hood
Dodgin' and runnin'
The glare in his eyes told you somethin' was commin'
They went to war, Godbless Rita, got shot by mistake
Niggas got knocked by them Jakes
Homicide suit and tie cops, Mayor Koch, screams in rage
Niggas so thugs got pits rocking thick chains
Stick-up niggas so thug they got pits with sick names
Clicks got bigger, extortion cats wasn't hearin' it
But he was regulatin'
A ghetto king, now he levatatin'
They say he smiled in his casket
This ends the first chapter of another Nas classic

Tales from the hood, trails of blood
But it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should

Yeah I'mma help you nigga, cause I see evil's callin' you
Sick thoughts make you wanna take Ki's from other ballin' crews
Top of the world's all he views
A puff of weed, nothing but greed don't live by the rules
Fuckin' wit' me here's what I do
Try to sell your freedom I'm accustomed to
You could ball wit' me or get arrested too
It's easy to land where they dwell with the greasy hands
Twenty to L' what's your plan take your grams
You bought you a Lexus, BBS spendin' Abrahams
Never learned your lesson, choose the right direction
Thin line from life and death and my man checked in
A motel, same one as a young G he know well
Crossed 'em on a coke sell then went on a run
But shorty got his old folks killed, yo he got 'em done
Nobody to run to, what succumb to
My nigga just wanted to eat, now he hunted on the street

Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Yeah it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Though it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should

Little Gotti got down for his, let off seven rounds
The kid he hit is heaven bound if he's on the good list
Shorty who shot 'em ran knowing niggas would snitch
Five years passed he ain't been in the hood since
Shot this nigga over a hundred dollars, money, had borrowed
Time passed, on his birthday he couldn't afford a bottle
Least expected to see 'em, then he asked for his
Nigga said he don't got it, so he blast the kid
Escapes the scene, but he couldn't escape the dream
Or how the kid fell when bullets made it too late to scream
Seeing money's face starin' at him
In black space feelin' hands touchin' him
Wake up it got too much for him
Once liked to be alone
Until he started hearin' groans and seein' things
Now it's time to go home
Niggas shocked to see him
Gave him respect what he was missin'
All the way from VA his aunt yell ""He hate to listen""
So he popped up, they gave him hugs, showed him love
Then he was reminded of that night when he sprayed all them slugs
He hangin' like nuttin' happened, police grabbed him up
Now he seein' ghosts in the cell, they got him strapped up
Psycho ward, rest of his life injected thorazine
Haunted memories in his mind of the murder scene

Get your Tick Tock from this hip hop, anyday

5'8"" with double-X-L pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete
So you can be an architect design appartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set I'm never on a chick I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet it's just the booze
Check my niggas, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggas runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down
Now it's back to the same old shit, you know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines, I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit, bloodied up, scream that I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

Tick Tock this is for my niggas in the Bridge, blocks

While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live
Well first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot
Deuce deuce, had my pockets full of bullets I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queensbridge always got shot up
No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggas aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old english red bull and blue bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit fuck it we was broke
Little badass, my nigga Rap sat me down, like this
He said: P you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind of the street
And it stuck in the back of my head, though
I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen niggas get cut up
I put it in my rappin'

Why don't you turning them floor shoes into some ho shoes, ya dig?

But the pimp shit in me say, ""Yo, keep looking for ass""
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait 'til you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
Revenge to get, against - who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blaming me for they failures, I'm fresh, getting tailored
Single breasted, a lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, 'cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga...

Ay pimping been going on man for eons and eons man since the beginning of time
You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind, and get mine
So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know
Do what you gotta do man
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back

I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves
A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players
That's business, not really pimp shit
Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits
And not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, Poitier helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl 'bout, 5'9"", so fine, she could for sure grind
She was sleek, chic, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold
I said ""Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga""

Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, ""Ooh, he speak so well""
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, ""These are our heroes""

Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full


You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, dude? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes

 ""Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know

Big up to Tiger Woods. Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr. Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs

And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit.""

Cause niggas die daily

Laying in your stairway, cause niggas die daily
So I got niggas around you
Mad like they're back for their man
You've killed just a year ago today
So call it a death anniversary
Rushing to emergency, niggas die daily

What if I told you that AZ didn't exist
And I put him there, played it like a ventriloquist
Cause niggas spit fake shit and y'all respect it
I spit that real shit and y'all won't buy the record
What if me and the rapper homey was really cool
And we used that whole thing as a media tool
Would you say I was a sucka or say I was savvy
If I told you mothafucka's that me and K wasn't married?
What if Jungle wrote my shit and I'm really illiterate
And the whole Nas catalog was just an experiment
What if I really died when Ill Will got shot
This is Will rhyming right now while Nas is chilling with 'Pac
What If I did all the advertisements thrown my way
And I've boned every chick that would throw me some play
I'd have to load another AK cause niggas be jealous
Cause we real like them Brazil favelas


Scream at the nigga ""breathe don't breathe your last breath""
But you know a nigga dead when he pee on himself
Blatter giving up on 'em, face start to puff on 'em
Bloating up, nigga cold as fuck, trying hold on 'em
Loosen up the nine out of his fingers
Angels coming only he can hear the psalms that they're singing
And it hurts me, the planets cursed, B
This your niggas first year anniversary
This how it goes down in every ghetto
So it's quite natural for rappers to settle
And make pop music, nursery hooks
Cause back then we thought the only thing that worked was the jooks
They're tryna pimp a game that done pimped them first
I'm pimping the industry so they acknowledge our worth

Ooh, tell me (who's back)
I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again

Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she would decide on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day in March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two

No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl lookin' as good as you)
There's nobody but you
(They can try, they can try)
No other girl in the room
(But you know, you know, you know)
No other girl in the room
(Oh, oh, ooo ooo)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl, no)
There's nobody but you
(They try)
No other girl in the room
(There's nobody to,)

In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip Jose
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us
All I could hear was the sound of (her)
Twirlin' her around just (her)
See nobody in the crowd just (her)

(No other)
No other girl in the room
(No one)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl)
There's nobody but you
(Thinkin' about you baby, baby)
No other girl in the room
(Never ever, ever, ever, see you)
No other girl in the room
(Oh)
No other girl in the room but you
(No other girl has, they're not you)
There's nobody but you
(Oooh baby yeah)
No other girl in the room

Uh, horns!
Clap
Everybody clap
C'mon, clap
Max mellow 'em out

Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl
Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you

A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death
Energy could neva be destroyed
Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me
With bullets to my head
This is my you can't kill me niggas
I'm already dead, BRING IT!!
I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You're on top -- WHAT?
Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated

I ain't mean to be late
It was my night to watch my little girl
It's chilly out here
What happened? You crying?
Y'all got into it again huh?
See you gotta let them know from the jump
I don't care who they are, or who they're with
Yeah I know they know we're talking
Shh, why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us
Could love each other
Come on, stop crying now
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you
I heard they're watching you
Yeah, they're watching, they're watching me too
But there ain't no reason to get low
I'm proud, I'm here
You know I'ma stand up for you, no matter what
And I know you'll stand up for me
I don't have no doubts about you being true to me
The world is ours
But right now it feels like the whole world is against us
So study, be strong, don't cry no more

Hey, Hey, I told ya

Ridin’ with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I’m just getting my hood on
I’m just, I’m just, doing my thing
I’m just, I’m just, (pimp) doing my thing
Hey (yup) hey (yup) hey (yup) hey
I said I’m ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I’m just getting my hood on

It’s the late night greasy spoon patron
Poolhall making
Big bets, midsection got the 8 in
Dior Christian pimpin’
Got that penal system diction
Riffing, you don’t want it you snitchin’
Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me I’m the leader, that’s coup d’etat
Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black
Bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze the fifth with a grip as I dip
From the paparazzi
Still playing numbers (you can’t stop me)
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed
If I ever say “Queens get ‘em”, you know they got me
Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example, or get trampled
Since Hip Hop Is Dead, this is the end
Congratulations in order ’cause we did it again


The chain’s offensive
Brain on airplanes,
 
Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukon’s and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants
The Apprentice but not Trump
I’m the nigga with Glocks and pumps
That you don’t see much
Sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of ‘em
He’s got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don’t make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don’t make me grab your only son
I’m coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed’s the only escape
From phonies who hate
When you rolling with papes
That’s why the God party with juicy models
They mob me, Denali, Charlie Luciano – hardly
Have to tell y’all, I kill y’all
For spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin
, have to carve me a nigga


I got the armour tucked with the no drama luck
Tatted up, everywhere, my neck, arms and stuff
Like I roll my body around on wet comic books
The Dalai Lama prodded up, lighting chronic up
Ugh, of course I’m at it again
When I do it you know N, I throw caution to the wind
I talk about the life I’m in
But I swear to God I may never write again
But if I hit em hard, they say the World must kneel
Baddest girls gon lick my Tim’ boot heel
Sayin’ Nas running out of time
This is my last chance
Gotta shoots to kill, this is my last dance
I say hell nah,
 don dadda
Goons act fly, fly swat ya
Rapping ducks, modern day dracula’s
What you coming out your caskets for
This game been dead but guess who came back for more",https://genius.com/Nas-top-down-lyrics
Triple Threat,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Y'all know my pedigree, hoes blow the gods voluntarily
We're world wide, my heart pumps where the ghettos be
Young sharks be telling me, y'all niggas can't swim, y'all drowning
From my hood to your hood, the anthem, y'all wilding
I die for my coalition, the foes whispering
Hating, Wild Gremlins and those that roll with 'em
So I chose rap, we vamped to neva go back
Until this life of animosity, the high velocity
Niggas be on the same team planning to blow shots at me
Be the same mouths I try to feed
I write shit, entice it properly, 'til it hurts me
The same game as James Worthy, they spread my name like it's Herpes
Nature, niggas on the block boxing me, y'all not complete
We take this shit to where it gots to be, now smile philosophy

Sex and money go together like techs and nine shells
Swiss cheese you and cover it up like Roswell
Cartel, you ain't seen no iller regime
The Celest team, prophecy, project warrior, owns property
Crackers hate it, cops get jealous cause I stay with
The '98 temporary plates on my whip
The system thing is not right
A rich thug could fuck a cop's wife
Cause I'm on television and live the pop life
I rock mics, make mills, sound scan sales
One point whateva records, professional skills
Money's the root of evil but it'll make you happy
Don't wanna shoot my people but still they might clap me
Cause I talk like Dr. Malachi york, played the sidewalk
Hold fort, diamond plate chain, gold fork
Get in tune, rich life Ricky for silver spoon
Frank Lopez's crib, elevators and living room

Ayo we're still in Queens, same place where we use to be
Often you won't see us, cause we're usually out touring
Leave the hood now the hood boring
NORE, you know me, we're regulating
Straight from Iraq with QB affiliated
It's like a higher learning
From 99th street down to Vernon
Letting our heat burst burning
Like henny wet, throwing up my set
Catch me on star tec, 'bout to set the connect
Yo sex, drugs, money and murder, beers and sex
Lands and Lex in the projects
The 4th floor where we score through our cook-up
D's shook-up, hit the block and now you look up

Whispers turning to screams, from screams to hollers
Fans turn to fanatics, go home and dream about us
My zone, I need the chronic, my habit daily
Spitting, rapping fury, I got more steps then Alvin Ailey
Thousands will feel me, my nickname Braille
Dietec, the fakest niggas, cause their cliques ain't real
Each verse be pain filled, force to taking Motrin's
From the street to the screen, pictures be major motion
Nature grossing, holding my square where snake's approaching
React quickly, keeping gats where my dick be
A buck equal a hundred, so a half is fifty
Y'all do the math with me, before I hurt you
It's personal, you and I know, my whole squad be U-N-I-versal
From blood in to blood out, we thugged out
Fuck a four-four, I go to snub route, leave you rubbed out

Death followed him, before it swallowed him whole
It was signs he should of read that was inside his soul
Niggas light dutches to 'em now
So long miss a mutha fucka but still life goes on
Hope I'm rich on my last day, clutching some ass
Nigga said he came in with, got a nut when he passed
An old man laying dead on my bed, with some young shit
Screaming out ""freedom"" when I slumped her chest
After that, chill, be a bitch with a hex
Every nigga she sexed, be the next put to rest

Yo since a young sibling, had every flavor Timberland
Always had a jump shot and always dribbling
John McEnroe, Jose lay like Casserole
Doling Mike Tys', the jungle low, cut the china white
Come check ya, mixed the henny with the nectars
On straight flights while y'all cats connectors
If it was up to me, the whole world would be comfortably
But since its not, y'all niggas stay fucked up
I think about y'all too much and be bankrupted
So niggas get yours, I got mines niggas, so what, what?",https://genius.com/Nas-triple-threat-lyrics

Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin 1010 WINS AM
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin ""Dunn"" but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the Glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell

Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)
We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong)
We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)

Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, english, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption


Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I watch the game like it's 
Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse

Nas’ Angels... The Flyest,Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle (Music From the Motion Picture),2003.0,"Word word word word

I come through in a new double R listening to smiling faces
Check out my jewelry piled in your faces
Italian air forces leather laces with the basket weave
Iron in your face so fast from the draft so sneeze
It's the nastiest, flashiest, turn girls to masochist
Cause I be giving them pain, it's a cold world, I laugh as if
Bernie Mac will be snappin' on you
But I ain't a joke; you think I'm here to entertain you
Fallen angel after them halos
Nobody moves until I say so, take the money out the safe slow
Escape route and I'm out, I cake out like Entenmann's and Breyers
The flyest

You got to be the flyest
I know your ass is mean, like you be strappin them
Jeans, but you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just take my pumps while standing in your pumps
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just breathe and stare while I'm pulling your hair
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You can be Nas's angel, let the largest train you but
You work it like that

Uh, Philly rap a hydro, puffing on a line slow
Your CD needs me, keep it kickin' like Del Greco
Pull up at the Delano South Beach I know
For King Solomon jury security in the Tahoe
Spandex for money, I stay on the tight
G-packs and weed stacks stay on the flight
Elbow out the left window, K's on the right
Canary out her ears, you know she playing them right
Hilton style, Billionaire Boys club
Braveheart, y'all don't want no war with us
Dump a semi out a Maybach, I made girls bust
When I hit them full thrust, full throttle


Big living, what it tastes like, tapes right, used to hate life
To move an eight, every night was my passion
Pipe bombs safe from stashes, Aston's, Rolls Royces
Cold oysters and many sorts of women shake like horses
I got them peeling out their clothes, really about this dough
Problem, hear me out just scone from my pistol poppin'
It's at my mind, just a mystery school
Brainwash them, then fix them with my tools
Mami hit me with some moves
I'm addicted to spinning, dipping these women in different waters
Watching for dudes with tape recorders on them cause they informants
I been okay with these warmers
Girls harass me and gas me and say that I'm enormous

Move your waist girl.. Yeah yeah (x2)

Spirit of the streets
Walks in the ring
From Brownsville to spar fit
To boxing king
Man or machine, an animal
Physical strength and intelligence
But that type of intellect
Y'all respect
To connect those punches
Still as a kid he stole lunches
To mak'in millions and the hundreds
Chaotic conscience
The rage, the stage, the grander
Had to endorse slander
Took it like a man
Cause the mighty stand alone
In the bigger ring hole
The penitentiary
Barbed wire and stone was amp up
They locked a champ up
Even my brains in handcuff
The robin hood, seasonal santa
And y'all give him nothin to begin with
Dilapidated buildings
The drug epidemics
Historical stories
Pain, love and glory

Understand this minds a true blessing
Designer jewels and diamond
A modern day Jack Johnson
Flying private jets and fully protect'in
Automized with ladies Godiva complexions
Lots of sex'in
Hung with a lot of stars
Learned a lot of lessons
Between dead homies and best friends
And getting domed out in stretch Benz
Educated from the hood and pestilence
The dead presidents don't see your pockets
You just gett'in
You got a full court press for them

Yeah, got my name from the city
Where? The most dangerous city
Let's take a trip back, back into time
1977, it was maximum crime
The President neglected us, him and 6 masterminds
6 powerful men put New York through some drastic times
The rich and selfish ones, feed off the welfare ones
And which borough suffered the worst? Hmm, where I'm from
The Bronx
We had to rumble with rivals on the rubble
While buildings around us would crumble
I dreamed right but it seemed like nothin' found me but trouble
I see the light, it's right there at the end of the tunnel
Had to find my rope, to pull me up
Cause I needed some kind of hope, to fill me up
'Til I met one guy, took me under the wing
I could have died if this man ain't intervene
He was an orphan, my savior, free spirited
No man braver, he was honored and gifted
His name was Shaolin Fantastic, the lady-killin' romantic
Can't forget the day we met, and this story recants it
But yo my life began last year, sophomore of high school
That summer I saw her, said to myself, ""She'll be my wife soon""",https://genius.com/Nas-the-get-down-episode-1-where-there-is-ruin-there-is-hope-for-a-treasure-lyrics

Can I hang out with my little gang out
Hearing shots rang out
Heard my moms call my name out
Come upstairs run up stairs
Take a bath shit stained underwear
Wipe yourself with paper bad
Little ass in my bed at 8:30 wash my plate
Ate dinner up late
Gazing at the wall praying basketball
Was my future for this young one
Hooping in the sun
Proud to be where I come from
Later shooting guns fantasizing
Fascinated by gold rope chains
Looking back at my hood days
But things ain't changed


In my hood niggas smoke wood
Nothing is good
Look at my eys and see what I could
Living my life and feel what I felt
The hand that I was dealt
Drama that my uncle Shabazz had
I was a little lad
Niggas shooting through my Grams window shattering glass
Had the chicken pox
On that toy horse that rocks
My moms grabbed me down to safety
Everybody in the crib was going crazy
That was in the 80's
And now im 17
Money cash dreams
Niggas be slave
I be brave spit like A.K.'s and S.K.'s
Close range niggas see brains
Millenium Thugs the name
But now it's slash cocaine
Blast niggas in vaine
Satch yo' chain
Cherrish the life
My niggas got a fetish for ice
Turn out the lights
I bust so I could spar up the night
Uniting the pipes
Queensbridge niggas is sheist
Need no price body yall dudes on spite
Who knew I would of spazzed out
Little Nayshawn owner of the crack house
Get my papes on
Tired of 'friderators all the steaks gone

Now picture this shit
With six Aunts five Uncles
Thugging a double apartment out
Kids, cousins, and brothers
There I go in the pamper by the radiator
Cursing eatin first
Little nigga with a appetite that got worst
Firs day of school ten man cliq
All I'm learning is how to extort shit
'cuz class I forefit
Graduated on another level
Selling birds busting birds
Fuck with the herbs
Never we fuck up the herbs
Make 'em pay like you
Stick 'em up get down
Since ten was taught to turn 'em around
Rip they pockets out
Bust two the way they run
I ain't give a fuck that's how I was
I was young


Horse was born as a brave child
Big for my size
A bully to little guys
With chocolate miks and apple pies
The playground was mine
I stayed scarred up all the time
From shopping carts flipping
Now we race to the finish line
Hated playing cooties 'cuz that shit
Wasn't fun all the honey's say I'm it
Then they little ass run
I was sweared to put a hickey on the ones
That I caught
I was a nasty little nigga I learned to hump before I walk
Kept a sling shot on my side to shoot
Squirrles and cats
Wanted to be Captain America with the
Shield and the hat I started getting older fell
More in love with the streets
Infactuated by the ropes and the shiny
Gold teeth I was to big to break dance
Fuck spiining on my back
My role models now run numbers and sell
Crack this project child blessed
Chasing ghetto success
He needs a name for himself

Cause I'm dealing with this thug life crisis and can't cope
Niggas on my dick beef don't stop
Niggas asking what happened to the Firm
Did you and AZ bone Fox? No
How was it working with Dre though?
Heard you was fucking Lil Kim and Mary J, Whoa , the list goes on
There is rumors that Brandy broke my heart
The world want to know what's in the life of the prettiest Don
Nas, was Jay fucking with your baby mom's?
Was she involved with a plot, to deceive my perfect degrees of
Three hundred and sixty, he ugly she pretty that's life
Never been married eloped with dope; Music's my wife
It's true, me and 2Pac once stepped to each other
Confronted our like's and dislike's in front of Suge Knight, we left it as brothers
As a child pop's blew his weed in my face, results, mixing ether with base
I'm the rebel to America, less is the nasal voice chipped tooth bastard
What your hearing is a replica
I never had a clue, that all you dudes should be in dresses
Double edges playing both sides of the fences

Where my soul going to go when my ditch is dug?
One never knows do one
The things that I've seen in the streets I'm from
One never knows do one
The stuff that I've done what I've become
One never knows do one
Am I crazy what they make me out to be or what?
One never knows...

The streets say what up wit Lake, not showin his face
And did he really shoot at the Jake's?
When he just came home, and dude shot at Capone, for his necklace
Why was Lake name mentioned?
Was he reppin on the island taking phone time?
Did he get Prodigy his chain back in ""99""?
Who's writing his rhymes? He is
Do he be with kingpins like Delson and Jesus, what was he thinking?
On Revolutionary Warfare when he said, He's a modern day Hitler
Did he shoot more niggas, Than every dude in QueensBridge?
Why his last case made the daily news in June?
Do he have the strength to unify heads from BX to Harlem?
Who did he stomp and walk naked in his Projects?
Did he get shot in his chest, never fall with no vest on shoot duke and walk off

Where my soul going to go when my ditch is dug?

Ayo, these niggas don't understand me
There's going to be a murder, my reason: insanity
The acts in the involvement with a homicide, Nas
Who did you shoot at the time when you could've got robbed?
Do you call yourself a prophet of God?
Did your hood set fire to your car in your projects in '95'?
Did Jungle shoot up the club lately?
Did Jungle kidnap Philly's Most Wanted, then they drove him to his safety?
Yo, what happened to Puffy and Steve Stoute?
Why did they scuffle with champagne bottles smashing, what was it about?
My video nailed to the cross
Now Stoute started hating me, hanging with my enemies
They ask everyday on my block
How did I survive in  by keeping it gangsta, why Nas
Did you leave a clothes company after you made it millions?
Cause Esco's weak, I start a new line a ILL one

Where my soul going to go when my ditch is dug?

I Already Know,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Man, Prince was a pimp, Apollonia, Vanity
Sheila E. had me on the edge of insanity
Swore if I made it in music I'd be similar
Here I am, this is the future, I'm where the woman are
Rocking with Tim and Bob, y'all need me, shine a spotlight up
In the sky like Batman, I pops right up
This is Nas, hate if you must hate
Been hot since the days of cassette tapes
T-shirts over the thermals dripped in our memories
Sipping that Hennessy .4-5th in my denim jeans
She told me she was my eyelashes
When we hump, I grunt just like a bull mastiff
They call me the best who ever did it
Only in the club one minute guess who I slip with
A chocolate dyke ghetto thing sweet
We going to pop tonight, bon appetit

Do you know who I am? And she says
La lalala I already know
What we can't hold hands? And she says
La lalala I already know
You got to leave by three? You with me?
La lalala I already know
So until next week? You know, ma
La lalala I already know

You know, mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the nastiest sexiest thug of them all?
I seen her in the mall, she was wearing home
Degarsole keyoke mose cherry cologne
She was looking very alone
'Til this big weightlifting Mr. Universe clone starts grabbing her own
But she can't stop looking I'm in the zone
One look at the kid she taking of her stone
Cash crazy, ass crazy, hair long
And baby amaze me because I'm in rare form
She like an ice cold bowl of post honeycomb
Followed me in the shop while I cop Nina Simone
Tap me on the shoulder I told her I'm on the phone
I played it off well nobody was on the cell
Shit, she said the tone?
She said, ""Excuse me mister so and so should I leave you alone?""
I said

Hello?
Turn the television off, focus here

I'm the vagina liner re-constructor, bed sheet ruffler
For you freak girls undercover who loves ya?
I'm not a priest don't front for me, but step in my confessional
That's the bedroom, tell the truth I'll be impressional
Wait before you pass your collection plate
Show me you a professional so we straight?
She tried to kiss my lips, but no I don't do that
Want me to kiss my lips but not with a new jack
Few stacks spend my chips, yeah I do that
See the problem with you women is, look I got 'em
You can hear a mouse piss on cotton
You don't wanna miss it then listen, stop stressing the man
We out to get as much sex as we can
And you roll with the plan, shorty you lie
But you gotta leave, 2:45

Gang flags
Plane crash
Ground Zero
No lost angels
Ain't you from my from my man's and them area?
It's good to meet you
Ya man did 20 years for some FILA sneakers right
True
Had the 560 benz
Light blue
Where ed shot himself in the stomach
Smoke the dust
He let the culture culture bust
Back when we took the D train uptown
Shante and her whole crew
Groovy hair style
Yo baby yo baby yo t-shirts
Gold teeth smirks
At mark 125th
Hope the heat work
Few numbers I bagged
Then caught a cab back
To Jamaica Ave by the library
Seen the part of shabazz

Dudes in front of her door blocks her entrance
Asking her ""who she been with?""
She laughs ""mind ya business""
Tinted windows
Pop dutches with box cutters

Hate a black New York face
Jumping out the phantom with the Baps

With the hammers on her waist

Doing rounds of tequila
Soon as I touch down
In NYC streets
The heat is on
The Talk
Who said what
I catch up on
The New Teflon Don
Who got they death bond
Who still stable
Where beef got squash at the round table
Who still holding it
Who hanging with snitches
Couple of Zulu's from back in the days who still up in clinton
No more hand shakes fake arm swing
See if your flinching
Need to hold something thats mention in every nigga sentence
When I get it you got it
D's went up in the project
Bail a couple of homies out
No doubt
Ferrari's in the summer
When its the hummer
Or the turtle top band satellite
Spilling drinks
Hitting potholes with savage types
Club 17 marque
The team flash
Next day hit the spas and the steam bath
Knock out this business
Do some promo
Make paper in the grind capital
Sign a graph then hit the hood

Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggas
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots
Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors
Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin' on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, anybody tryin' on, the blocks I'm supplyin' on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em
 and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like 
the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up,
 
but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom,
 
hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writin', semi-automatic no hyphen
It's frightening.... {*scratches*}

I take summers off, cause I love 
winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhartt, gun powder stains
Smellin' like trees, sensimille on the brain
Skeemin' on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin' off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys and
, it's
.... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile then, we robbin' 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin'
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night

Here's what they think about you
""I hate little motherfuckers like you. Little niggers like shit! Think your tough, huh? Blow your head off, your little Smith and Wesson couldn't do shit. How you feel now?""

Cops keep firing in my environment
Middle finger to the law nigga gripping my balls

Middle finger to the law nigga gripping my balls
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong

Now all you hypocrites, witness the injustice
Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us
U.S. attorneys, public defenders send us off to hard prison time
Whether you innocent or did the crime
Say you come from who this cops pursue you hard
Run your plates, put guns in your face
Put you in the car, for nothing
Now your strugglin', tied up, standing in line-ups
Call your lawyer, they charged you with murder
Why? Cuz these liars said you shot another man on his driveway
Guilty, just for being black on a Friday
Polygraph test you failing, because you're nervous
Charged for murder you didn't commit, then they serve ya
Fifteen years, maximum security
Slashing, stab wounds, broken bone injuries
You were placed there intentionally
Either you bang or you miss me, listen to me

Im grippin' the Nina, visions of 9/11
Visions of three sixes, no sevens
This is Bushonomics, George is a modern day Ronald Reagan
I pray to god in the midst of Pagans
Niggers I'm just saying
When do we stop playing?
When do we stop pimping and start spraying?
50 shots for every cop that popped Sean Bell his body lay'in
But they acquit cuz they know
That our generation won't do shit! Nothing, nada
But every rapper is a shotta or a Don Dada
Or a killer, but you ain't killing nothing
And it's peace unless it's another nigga
Tryna raise boys to Superman
And while I'm at it fuck Arthur J. Cooperman
It's never justice for blacks but they send just us to Iraq
With poor whites and Latinos
I pray to God that you hear this single

Swelterin' heat, suffocate in this Hell within' the 5 boroughs
It's like the Sun roastin' the Earth
The hood was called turf, my girl was thrown out of her church
Out of her home, and by her family, she's disowned
She's the love of my life, up to us to go on
And everything's burnin', buildings illuminated by the fire
And the city was lost, we tryna save it, the cross
The Star of David we lost
We started prayin' to governor, he a gangster
In cahoots with the mayor, the roof startin' to cave in
No, it's not a game, all is dark except the flame
Now nothin' will be the same
Now the whole world's changed

Radio stations don't pump us up in their mix yet
Disco still gettin' that air time for big checks

Niggas die for the street glory
Go to trial get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story

And each nigga got a story
And QB the streets call me
So if you see me slippin' reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

Yo
Every time I turn around niggas shot, niggas stabbed
When tonight's pregnant girls struggling to get a cab
Fiends lurkin', D's searchin', pat pockets
Kids put to bed duck they heads from gats poppin'
Queensbridge slingers hoppin' out Benzes
Don status, dope fiends got syringes
Poppin' out their arm scratching
I remember park jams
Gazelles, perfect wave, shell Adidas
Smellin' reefer way before purple haze
Private stock peer nigga with ill walks like Mark Clare
Hats tilted wild niggas lickin' shots in the air
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names have switched
Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nastradamus and Blitz
What project is this? QB, Vernon and 10th
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me? Nigga's seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done just remember my name

I'm familiar with the dead grass drama black gates and crime
Embryo of the ghetto born face and time
Niggas shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?
Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's cause I see the past grimmly
That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window
Watched the buddah clouds linger
Pluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways
Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate
Like the barrel on the 38 snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs
When death calls who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug

My tear ducts dry, can't cry, I conceal it, I die
My index finger and thumb push the pin to the drum
You ask where I've been, New York City, BX where I'm from
No figment of my imagination, sad situation for my dad
Killer came in my pad and started sprayin'
Father layin' on the floor, he breathin' no more
Shot to death, the reaper came like a thief through the door
Shaolin, he helps me, he wealthy in street knowledge
He deep in the path of drug dealin' and violence
Day in and day out, drama, we couldn't stay out
Livin' in my aunt's house, music the only way out
Cause we was in the broke down belly
Of a hungry beast
We stayed true, then we made up a crew
Shaolin gave me the name Book, I became a ragin' bull
Back when I was first enchanted by Grandmaster Flash
You had to be there, imagine him scratchin' wax
Up in his habitat in the Bronx, he got it on
The birth of a new group has spawned",https://genius.com/Nas-the-get-down-episode-2-seek-those-who-fan-your-flame-lyrics
High,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The wild Gremlins
Ya'll know the F. right?

When the winner lose... and the losers win
Nobody scores just a few good men
But everybody sins
A lot of young die
Fall in the trap, strung high
Try to go legal, but the hood calling you back
Flipping the crack, cause I miss it for example
Watching base-heads wildin' on my first sample
I elevated up, since snakes in my circumference
Now I hit my niggas with cakes and say, ""Pump This""
Thank god for cracks, corners, and marijuana
Hoodrats and good gats to carry on ya
I got dead friends, misled friends, crackhead friends
Wild Gremlins, who ""bust led"" friends
Silent weapons for quiet wars
Or loud gats
Tussle too long, some shiny moves the crowd back
It's powerful, niggas would die over respect
And money is secondary to that whole aspect

I Love it, when I'm... High
I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh
I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh
Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects
And clap at sets, a nigga... High
North, South, East, West, riders get... Hiiigh
I take ya'll niggas on a lyrical... Hii-iiigh
I twist it up, Listen up to the real shit, feel this, REALNESS!

Niggas rushing to the top, not knowing what it takes to be...
King Of The Industry, the wise move patiently
Ya niggas is hating me, won't be happy till I'm back witcha...
Selling crack witcha, half & half on a pack witcha
My pen and pad, paint a black picture...
Of young goons passing liquor, after-hour store mass of niggas
Street corner combos, staggering winos...
Tahoes coming through, blasting songs I know
Niggas scheme, girls pregnant by sixteen
Clique out to get rich...
Empty clips for cream
Same funeral home, for different stiff bodies
Once a month a new family goes there, it don't surprise me
Cried 'til the tears, dried up inside me
Revenge to the end, laws in NYC
Got up by the way I used to be...
Apartment 5D... where dope fiends in the hall try your knob when you sleep
Surveillance Cameras in my house now, watching you creep
Spot you from deep, guns for all possible beef
Niggas try to rock you asleep
Kidnap your whole fam for a week
Asking for ransom, niggas starving, dying to eat

I Love it, when I'm... High
I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh
Yo... I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh
Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects
And clap at sets, a nigga... High

More Than I Can Say,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's
More than I can say
It would take a whole lifetime to tell you
More than I can say
Every time I wrote a line it’s still
More than I can say
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
More than I can say

Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure
The sickness: dreaming of riches
Reality was the cure. My doctor
Physician was music, I'm sure
The prescription was super-model sandwiches
And suicide doors. I used to stand in my mirror
Fixing up my hat right
DMV don't make licenses for the fast life
Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights
I just want the whole world to bop their heads
Someone to stop my bread
If my pops was here, he'd be like ""son, you the one
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you
Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle?
If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over
Just stay on point, do what you do
Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder..


Keep having the same dream
About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all
In the middle of flames
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?
I ask what it means. It's sort of a trance
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands
I could do what I wish with it, and waking up
To study my dreambook, see if it links up
Looking for some significance, like does the dream
Represent this cold world I'm living in?
Ask my man, then his laughter begin
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height
I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out
Time out: my body won't wind down",https://genius.com/Nas-more-than-i-can-say-lyrics
Open Letter to Young Warriors in Chicago (Sep. 2009),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong wars! Killing each other is definitely played out. Being hurt from the lost of a love one was never cool.
Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong war! I know that feeling, that frustration with life and needing to take it out on someone, any one. But....
We chose the dumbest things to go the hardest for.
 
I remember seeing deaths over 8 ball jackets
, 
Fila sneakers
, 
and name plate chains
. 
Deaths over ""he say, she say""!!!!!
 
""I'm from this block or I'm from that block""
, or ""my moms n pops is f*cked up now the whole world gotta pay""!!!
I remember feeling like I was the hardest ""n*gga"" breathing. And I couldn't wait to prove it. But let's think. 
What are we really proving??
 And proving what to who?? Everybody knows Chicago breeds the strongest of the strong but I just feel, me, being ya brother from another state feels your pain as if I grew up with you in ya very own household.
You have the ability and mindpower to change they way we are looked at. Look who's watching us young warriors, look who's throwing us in jail constantly, look at the ignorance in the world. Look at the racist dogs who love to see us down. Loving to bury us in the ground or in jail where we continue this worthless war on one another.
Young warriors
.... We are WASTING more and more time. 
We gotta get on our jobs and take over the world.
 
Cuz this movie left the theaters years ago, Juice, Menace, Boyz n the Hood , Blood n Blood Out, Belly!
When we see each other why do we see hatred? Why were we born in a storm, born soldiers, WARRIORS....
and instead of building each other up we are at war with each other
.. May the soul of this young person find peace with the almighty. I'm with you young warriors. You're me and I'm you. 
But trust me! you are fighting the wrong war.

Oooh, oooh, oooh, da da da da da da! (Everything I ever wanted)
Oh, oh (Yeah Yeah!) Do do do do do do! (Yeah! My life, so real)

Before I use to dream I could rule the world
Now it's thorough I survived the perils in my fly apparel
Seven forty five appeal, no candy paint no chrome wheels
I Close deals tried to see my face on my own bills
The president here, he's honest and fair
Prayed for the days, when the kins of slaves is honered and shared
January 20th I was there
I'm aware the part I played to get young voters to care
Recession is a blessin in disguise
For a new economy to rise somethin old has to die
I'm still sippin' Rose' PJ's it be's like that
I brung the eighty seven Fila's back
Save collect, 
B.I.G.'S dream came correct
Tryin' to push seven hundreds, they made them yes
I used to think United College Fund was for bums (Nah)
The ghetto advocate for education look what I become

Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Yeah! Here we are!)

I don't say I'm maintainin', that's a lame's language (word)
Poor English, from a wise man I learned patience
Me not distinguished, is like a fiendless Queensbridge
I don't say I'm grindin', cause everything I do is redefining
Cause when you know the streets to the science
Apply it very moderate, 'til your business'll watch you profit
Rap game, NBA to NFL, the kids'll yell, ""Will I win? ""
The fella ends up in the cell - nonsense
Cause they can grow to be part of the Congress
Be responsive, to these inner-city problems
Behind a tent with a chauffeur, I rep for the culture
Rep for the thugs and STILL see eye to eye with Oprah
I was a dreamer a wisher would hope for
A better life for these kids while I sip on a Mosa
I plan yo, you should watch the black and white's hand, yo
Who's the best? Next to me, they couldn't light a candle
Yep!

Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Arrrrreeeeeeee!)

You can be who you wanna, say what you wanna (Marsha!)
Tryna make it better, our sons and our daughters (Yeah!)
Use your mind - make a change
Yes, we can - see a brighter day
Gon' be struggle, gon' be pain
But no excuses to be made
This is the time that we've been waiting foooooooooor!

I done seen it all, I got it on with the weak and strong
There's no relief, it's like the beef keeps keepin on
I can't count the amount I drew heaters on
Cause we was warrin in the Ps', it was Vietnam
Now I got you in arenas, watchin me perform
The songs rappin 'bout them same beefs and the street I'm from
Thankful, for the art form I'm eatin from
I never see no losses, I only see we won - yeah

Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)

You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again
The don, all the time, with all the shine
You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley, it's all with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it
It's real in the field the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down

Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I lent
Pay me back when you shake it again
Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

I put the shackles on your feet (You owe me)
I think you owe me some (You owe me)
The shackles on your feet (You owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (You owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something

Who Are You (Who I Am),BALL’N,2011.0,"Yo, Nas what up? Yo, Nas What up?
This your boy Artest
This is one track I won't rap on, I won't rap on
Go!

Heard you got your master's, did college up
Never looked back, now that's what's happening
And it's good to see you made it out the hood
With a degree, a true man with passion
Now you could enter the so-called
""White Man's Society"" and go right past them
Looking in the Wall Street Journal for your face
But it's always absent
There he go, that's him eating flan and ambrosia
Watch on his arm, golden, laughin'
Try to get his attention
But he's flinching, guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so I mention
We were neighbors some time ago
He was kinda cold, in this restaurant
Full of his kind and more
He sighed, tried to look surprised, I know
His side of the city where he resides, so
I had to go
I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes
Hate so-called ""intellectuals""
No balls, he suggests we vote
He stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks
He want to lecture folks
'Cause he professional and he suggest that we don't sell dope
And I guess it's true, but who the fuck are you?

Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

I'm Idi Amin, Marcus Garvey, H. Rap Brown
I'm Muhammad Ali, I'm Reginald Lewis
George Washington Carver, I'm Nas with incredible music
Let's do it, thinking of a master plan
Sipping on disaster, smoking on gangster
Watching niggas argue, chillin' on my barstool
With my Hell Up in Harlem hat in hand
With a girl named Pat, she more than a waitress
To order your drink with
She divorced a banker and bought the bar
She got an automobile, she gives an order to kill
You get caught and robbed
We could see your walk is off, you could lose your rhythm
When you outta the gutter for a while
You easily go to soft from hard
Now we all about hustlers, number runners
Hoes and sharks and we all know the code of the block
And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit
'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks
Brother don't start, go build your Noah's Ark
You could float to the end of the world
And pretend what you not, but I know what you are
While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot
While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot
Matter of fact, you're an easier target
And I respect everything you accomplished
But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense
So who the fuck are you?

Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

She Queen of Nzinga
Winnie Mandela, Ida B. Wells
Why can't you tell?
Why can't you tell?

It is what is is, it ain't what it ain't
Am what I am, able to take care all of me alone
And put that boy on hold
Been a lot of duplicated
Makes no difference, love or hate it
Must stick to your guns
Because you're the only one
No one is going to hold you down like the way you do
And they ain't gotta lace 'em up, and walk in your shoes
Say what you say, it's nothing
Got nothing to prove
So, so who are you?
So, so who are you-u?

Who are you? tryna tell me who I am? Who I Am?
Tryna tell me Who I Am? who I am?
Who are you?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?

Dear people of the globe
I hope that you're in good health
By the time my voice hit you
I hope it all is well with you
My mission is to bail with you
Touch upon some real issues
Senators, Government Officials
Sit at the conference and listen
Have a Coke or mineral water and say I'm reminiscing
George L. Jackson, Malcolm X last wind when I'm rapping
Americans, Africans, Asians, Russians, and Arab men
Send your clergymen to journey with Nas from Queens, projects
I promise an unforgettable experience
Compare me with, Amenhotep get in more debt
History was stolen, get in my zone
What makes the powers that be, less gangsta then Al Capone?
The Rosetta stone was stolen like Chicago was
Think I'm a thug?, let's talk about some conquerors
Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Genghis Khan
Hitler, Edi Amin, Attila the Hun
Let's bring back to the cat that invented the gun
From the Indians all the way to the Pentagon
I'm sitting on Capitol Hill
I'm composing this rhyme, guaranteed to make all of y'all feel
The beauty that was trapped under siege
Believe in yourself you'll be free, take it from me

The rejection of what's right could mean you in denial
It either breaks you or makes you becomes hostile
I swallow many lies before tasting the truth
In the beginning there was darkness, beautiful you
How will life be without night?, no tranquility?
No way to get away and rest, no stability?
I can't see the sky without the moon and the stars
The sunlight blocking everything, the king I'm in raw
People worship the Madonna in the shrines in Spain's
I'm proud to share the same blood type in veins
The holy mother -- the loneliest color remains
Can't be tampering, diluted the chains
They try make you not want it, make you run from it
The wickedest men, want the ebony punished
It's so seductive, it's sensuous in my clutches
Hot as fire when Moses saw burning bushes
So abused and misused and mistreated
Naked men wanna get drunk and get weed it
People wild when she comes out pull out and party
Catch her body, fornicate some start beef
Chain reaction cause it's in the air
The lost tribe scattered everywhere
From the North thru West Hemisphere
Scientist and Archaeologist conceal the obvious
The dead, living and little children over time of this
Obsession, caressing, every essence of magnetism
Every organism when it come to it
All question about Resurrection and your connection with God
It's answered with the beast in your heart

Most of my elders were failures
To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic
The later I would hang, the greater my slang
It took my english, replaced it with game
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it
Dared to do what I would
First blunt they passed me tasted nasty
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me
Eyes red, pants saggin
My first dime cut me off for braggin
That we was home alone tappin
Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker
Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya

Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit
Hold your head little man, y'all can't tell me shit
Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut
My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss
Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers
Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York
Talk to this hottie with my niggas who quick to blast you
If you old cats, to these niggas, they harass you

Hey yo cuz, growin up, I almost shattered my plans
Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man
Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time
A street thug showed me how to pitch dimes
Only twelve in this hell where kids die
I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly
My Range shift by, I peel the road up
With my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest
Wild as a teenage thug


Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggas
And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that
Yo where your mack at? I got mine
Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine
Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin
Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips
Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with
Twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen
Under my glove shit rocky
Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi
A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine
No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin
Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people
I chill up in the regal Eagle
And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy
I rip nappy, nature's to cut the roof off of Caddies
You see me?

Pray,UnKnown,1999.0,"""What we need to be thinkin' about is the future!
We don't know what's in store tomorrow!
All we can do is just guess! We want the best for tomorrow;
For our family, for our children, for our future
But if we don't get up andact like we want it
We gotta pray to somebody! We ain't to tough to pray!
You walkin' around like a gangsta, gangstas pray! Thugs pray!
Tell me somethin'; if you ain't prayin', where would y'all be today?
Where would y'all momma be today? How would you be here?
Somebody prayin' for you, nigga!""

I never thought bein' a man you could hang in the end
Facin' life with no parol and consecut' sentencin'
Got people witnessin', your co-defendent snitchin'
Your back against the wall, your left eye is twitchin'
Loyal ladies usual, a D-and A's the mutual
Scared to face the light of a courtroom site
Racist cops on each side cause the know I just might
Make a break for the door but I give it my all
If I die in this struggle, give my momma a call
Cause she always left these jewels: what goes up must fall
Since I fell dead broke, landed in jail
Refused to face the facts, how wifey skipped to town with the bail
I'm on my own now, V8, far away from home now
Palmer wealth state, the law changes each date
Secret inditements got me knocked, there ain't no price I can pay
To get me the fuck up out this shit, so to Allah I pray
For forgiveness - Yes, I sinned and I need to be held
And jail ain't no place a black man wanna be killed
Amen
I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I'm in mothafuckin' handcuffs!
Callin' out for someone, somewhere!
Is there anybody out there?

I look up at the sky, why do young niggas die?
Felt the stray hit me, somebody stay with me
Fallin' to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me
Bitches screamin', wish I was dreamin'
I fought a thousand gun fights, near one bullet skipped me
On the morning run to get my little sisters Rice Krispies
Played the numbers knowin' that I got my lucky dice wit' me
See some niggas I know I can roll - Uh, uh!
Get them bitches, left all of them broke, left what they smoke
Hoes yellin', 'Watch ya back!'
But before I could turn around, before I could I react
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Would you look at me now?
Is this blood that I feel as I fell to the ground?
Feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple
Niggas diggin' in my pockets, sayin' I just rolled a pimple
Yo, my mouth was movin' but it was nothin' I was sayin'
Only if they knew deep inside my mind, I was prayin'
Amen
I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I need his help the most, what?!
Callin' out to someone, somewhere!
Yo, is anybody out there?

Ain't nothin' stoppin' me - Untouchable - Hoes, I fucked a few
Style like The Greatest, Ali - Check what the knuckle do
Rock bubblegoose to mink, big links
Yellow ice, live the ghetto life, 'fuck y'all think?
Bravehearted; fuck around, get graveyarded
Dearly departed - The word on the street, I'm a target
I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin', I'm ridin'
I be gunnin', y'all be duckin' and divin'
When I come through buckin' this four-fivin'
Revenge you sayin' you gettin'
But shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons
So I check out the preacher - Life is off the meter
Thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper
Confessions in a church cause it hurts, behind a curtain
Nigga talkin' to me, but I ain't certain
Voice sound familiar so I pulled the shade back
It was this stupid nigga that I popped way back
He set me up, he just got to the preist
I tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way
And said, 'Pray'

""You've got to pray, huh! I mean pray, pray
And when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh!
You got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh!
You got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh!
You got to pray for that man on the corner! He know he doin' wrong
But somebody gotta pray for him, huh! You know we doin' wrong
But we gotta pray for ourselves! You know we are headin'
To this new millennium, goddamnit! They say a comet is comin'
To this world by the year two-thousand, I say it's God! It's up to you
To pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself
And, and, and beg for forgiveness cause it comes back to you!
A man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray
All he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to God...""",https://genius.com/Nas-pray-lyrics
Remember the Times (Intro),Street’s Disciple,2004.0,"Alright, are you sure

Yeah, I'm sure
So wait, you're telling me there's no-
You can't think of anybody
In your past, in your dirty dark crazy past (Nas laugh)
So if I gave you a free pass, you wouldn't wanna do them just one last time

No

Come on

No

I don't believe you, all them-
All them bitches?
I'm serious, okay I'm saying you have
Before we get married you have one free pass
I don't need to know about it

Mhm...

But it's one girl, there's one girl that you had in the past that you could say
""You know what? Let me hit that one more time""

Ah, I can't really think of nobody
Definitely ain't nobody 'cause I've been there, done that

Where Am I Going,In My Ghetto,2017.0,"Uhh, where am I going?
Where am I? Where the hell am I?
Yo, it's ill...

Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily, I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, tequila bottle in my left arm
Like Christion, watching my life go
Can´t do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let 12 spin, hop in my Benz
Push it to the limit, buck-sixty, who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit wit'
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth, I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed, I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me, I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo, nigga, watch me

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell these niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take 'em to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark, homie
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle, not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze, blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas, expect kilos
But what they not seeing is police expect RICO
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up, blastin' A.C., going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
Yo, I'll ride to the end of the road, if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, I try to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around, who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start to feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib, I'm tired...

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, all alone in the zone
Drunk by myself",https://genius.com/Nas-where-am-i-going-lyrics
Wanna Play (Rough?),It Was... Remixed (Rare Unreleased & Remixed),UnKnown,"Yo, the Lord is my shepard
The sword is my weapon
Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle
Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son
Cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun
Before they choose an education
But once dead their ain't no awakenin'
So like once said, life ain't for fakin
Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em?
Fuck waitin'
Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation
Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan
When I aim I ain't missin', master of assasination'
I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo
Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth
Is this the truth?
This is what we do, sip a brew
Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM
As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin'

Okay, you wanna play rough?!
(gun shots) (scratching - a thug changes, and love changes)
Okay yo, we could play rough!

Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?
Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas
Ducked in they seat?  are they lookin' for me?
But I ain't do shit, 
could it be that niggas thought
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did
May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit
P-11 Glock spits 17 shot clips
Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is
Pull the strap from under the seat
Back up in the street
Watch these niggas thats tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat
Empty every shell in their direction
Its you, I should've guessed it!
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you
Now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into


Walked in his house, smackin' him up, ""what you talkin' about?"" he said
Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome
Never thought I'd be in his home
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone
Fuckin' with me, you should've known
I'll have 'em write ""stupid nigga"" on your tombstone
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G
For threatenin' me
I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free
Killin' you niggas with nothin'
Left him dead, engine runnin'
You the only I'm makin' sure that gets whats comin'
Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it
But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live
Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back
I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac
Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that?
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats
Gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react
Eye for an eye, cause the sweetest part is payback
Somebody kncokin', who dat?
""a cop man"", let him in
And give that mothafucka one under the chin
Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds!
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
Dont explain, I put the pound on his head
Blew 'em! before that I can't remember the last time I said......

The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war

Everybody's crazy
Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop

Peace fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes

I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation
Got pussy niggas get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying

It been a lot of times when a nigga ain't wanna fuck with this rap shit no more
Fuck this shit, but you know...? Through the year I started to see shit, you knowamsayin?
Nigga see niggas driving around with fancy cars, diamonds, all that shit
Niggas thinking a nigga chilling
Got to go through a whole bunch of big shit, all that bullshit
But you know what? Fuck that shit, you know how I feel? Yo

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby

I got the mansion and the nice ride
Platinum chain, and an ice watch
All this fame in my life's hard
I entertain in so many places
See so many different faces
They look the same from the stages
After the concert, hours of long work
Home sick from the road, smoking my lungs hurt
Even though now I'm recording songs
It's better than, when I was peddling, doing wrong
I brought the crew along, we thugging
Fucking married bitches; they go to their husbands
Bitches ain't shit, we laughing with them
Can't even role the streets now, without the heat
I bust the nigga off impost, that shit is weak
On trial, what I'ma tell the judge
He don't give me no smile, he don't give me no love, nor the jury
That's when I need celeb status and the blackness
This motherfucker's hate rappers, what a life

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby

My girl hate when I'm with my boys
Think I'm cheating, every morning knocking at my door
State policeman, give him a reason, but I don't give it to him
They said they heard a disturbance, and I just listen to him
See, I cooperate until they push me
Cops hate when you know the law, you ain't pussy
You not fake, can't explain how much I miss the block
When we was slinging with my niggas, screaming ""Fuck the cops!""
Now when I'm dreaming I can see my dead friends smile
Wake up, I get some air, hit the mall for a while - pick up some gear
I'm going to the studio; my engineer put the track up from ""out west""
And he told me spit it clear
Another hit just made, another album
So ones again we getting paid, and now we wilding
Get hype to shoot the video, all in the city yo
I'm hoping that a nigga blow, but ya don't hear me though

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby

The haters say I ain't shit
Hope I fall, but I can't slip
Got to ball, got to bank chips
Old ladies hate my moms cause their kids ain't amount to nothing
Catch my moms on the bench fronting
I got to stay awake, got to pray today
Glad I'm still alive, fuck what them haters say
So many times I ain't wanna rhyme
Wanted a normal life where I ain't Nas all the time
So many problems too, do what I got to do
As long as my moms say, ""Boy, I'm proud of you""
I keep laying hits, winners never quits
Plus if I stop, how would I stay legit?

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby",https://genius.com/Nas-never-gonna-give-it-up-lyrics
’91 Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, this is Nas, the rebel to America
I load the clips 'til my lips are crass, cracked
Like a vet buggin' out from flashbacks
My raps, I shoot at your skull and leave ya sprung
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
Paragraph wizard makin' mics malfunction
I blow the fuse with the style I choose
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voice-box locks and excels like a rocket
Nas assassinates the Pope with a scope
I mutilate mics 'til my voice-box is broke
Try to battle me and gasp for breath
Words I speak is a step beyond death
A rappin' Charles Manson, I'm just that odd
I'm so strong, long enough to box with God
I throw a pitch at your brain so try and catch it
My thought are bugged
My brains should be put in a straitjacket
I'm nastier than cannibalism
I'm as sharp as a shank in prison, thoughts abrupt, risen
My rap is a ritual of Satan
Though I'm not demonic, my voice is electronic
My brain is deranged
In a metamorphic change, my sound waves are strange
Many say that I'm propelled to Hell
But I met the Devil and wrecked his brain cell
Police murderer, I love to kill a black cop
Nasty Nas is as deadly as a crack spot
And smoke a mic like a fiend
I use a TEC 9 like I was ???????
I go on till the break of dawn
Breakin' raps in half, my word is bond
It's like that and, uh, I go on and on
Akinyele, rock the mic till the mic is torn",https://genius.com/Nas-91-freestyle-lyrics
Blood diamonds are forever,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland
Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yeah, guess that's how we got here
Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade
Every child's afraid
When his Mother and Father get sprayed
Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade
Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue
Til' his mind can't take what he's gon' through
Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue
Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed
As I rap with my Platinum chain
When you shop for a gift for me
You think about the misery?
The same way we made Apartheid History
We can do the same thing to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine, right?

Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em X 7

My VVS glimmers on my chest
200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how people starve to death
When God bless the land that lacks the harvest
The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity
It shocks, so many are killed annually
'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly
But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine

Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em X 7",https://genius.com/Nas-blood-diamonds-are-forever-lyrics
Street Dreams (Bonus Verse),UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Uh. What?! What?! Uh.""
Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware wit' one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
Wit' the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents- A fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'mma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up for realty
For real, G, I'mma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my C.R.E.A.M
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch wit' the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
F' God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million
Without the FBI catchin' feelin's
Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin' gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin wit' moms, gettin it on, flushin' crack
Down the toilet- Two sips from bein' alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou from bein' rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream, we could all score it
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel smokin' on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin' sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin' in the drop-top B-M
""Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this.""
(""Uh. What? What? Word?"")
Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Ill designer fleece, studded marquise
A letta L on my car keys- Thuggin' hard on Cavarse
'Posters be Franchesco and all these bets
Mobile phones in the armrest, ladies be the bombest
I creep tinted, parked the whip and grabbed the rented
Seems like I'm changin' my location every minute
Like a plague is on my head, son- I vision red rum
Warrent squads knockin' at the same time the Feds come
Pandemonium got me puffin' Cambodian
Grand openin's of barber shops and stock
My jew-el rock, tokin' pronto- Livin' like a pablo
Papi like a poncho until the state patrollers pulled us over
Found the guns and the good
Had a nigga like 'Nas had to run through the woods'
Sneakin' out the next mornin'- Looked up to God
Guess in all this was a fuckin' warnin'
Took my diamonds in for the pawnin'
Now I'm back on the climbin'
Movin' consigned through rain, sleet, whatever climate
So many ups and downs shiftin', I was twisted minded
'Mazed on top, all the hoes and pussy had me blinded
Big lip bitches, suckin' dick rediculous
GS'es and vest-es, larger rays lookin' sentious
Back on the block buggin', how the fuck I been through this?
Nearly caused my life but now I can't show a cent from it
Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese

Grand Finale,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I ain't goin back to jail
Next time, the county or the state see me
It's gonna be in a bag
Uhh! this is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!

Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
From the friday the 13th, ghetto jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass
Out that s-class for fakin, forty-fo' blast
Is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
For the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young g we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse, you and i
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer
For deceased peers, holdin fort
Police line 'do not cross', they found his corpse
In the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide the crime method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the grand finale

Who wan' test me, c'mon!
Me shot pussy-hole fi fun

Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem
My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin niggas who pumpin
Lil' blood got popped, by the group home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those? go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And god'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The mayor wanna call the swat team to come and kill us
But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, the belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggas from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh
Chorus: ja rule (repeat 2x)
When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)
Come on niggas! (we dawgs for life)

There's mad money out here dawg
Mad money out here
What you tryin to get it? (word up)
You gonna bust your gun to get it? (tsh, whatever yo)
I hear you I hear you

Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I know it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think i'ma rob em
Niggas that know me well see me and think i'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to underwood
Cause if I see it, i'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? that's d
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how much you need?
Beat you down with gat see how much you bleed
How much you plead, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over! this is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

When I’m with my niggas this is how it sounds
It ain't nothin nigga give my niggas pounds
This is what it sounds like when I’m with my hoes
Hard dicks bitch you fuckin with a pro
This is what I’m thinkin when 
u bitch niggas
 plott'en
I’m gonna kill this nigga right now I got him
This is what he say right before the lead hit him (yo please don’t shoot)
Man fuck'em, did him
When the cops come this is what a rat say
He shot em 4 times and he ran that way
Now a nigga on the run, this what real nigga do
You can stay at my crib I heard what happened, come thru
A bitch or a nigga can help a nigga hide
Open up the front door and welcome u inside
Coward nigga want war, well then we gonna ride
Wit the pump and the 44 and catch a homicide
This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (your moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when a thug die (pow pow pow ) (mamas cry)
This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (tears from your mama's eyes)
At his funeral this is what u heard (oh my god oh my god)
Ya that was that nigga's bird
And that ***** is foul
Do u know that ho's style
When u was locked up she had another *****s child
The other *****s me, I knew that was his wife
What the fuck am I gonna do, bitch is begging for the pipe
And I was coming through on the reggy every night
But then this nigga came home I said it wasn't right
9 months later shit got crazy
***** flipped out when she said it ain't his baby
Slapped her up, gun butt her with the nine
Put it to her head til she told him it was mine
(you fucking bastard I'm gonna bury em 6 feet deep)
Heard he looking for me daily, carrying his heat
Now he’s under the ground may he rest in peace
Cuz he was married to a ho and I was married to the street
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from youe eye)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from your moms eyes)
Its been 2 years ain’t nobody catched me
Hennesy and pepsi, my Tech will protect me
Out of state made alot of cake, they respect me
Got a new identity, hoes want to sex me
Havin memories of my seed kind of stress me
Cuz my son is 2 and his appearance reflects me
Gotta new Lex GS chrome wheels nigga
Drove all the way home, man shit is real nigga
Got back to the hood it was raining and pouring
Knocking on this bitche's door like 3 in the morning
She knew I was comin, I saw a cop 2 of em running
Let off 4 shots then I caught 2 in the stomach
She set me up, the rain and the led wet me up
(pow pow pow) that’s the sound of a thug dead cuz

Beginning and End,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind

I shot my way out my mom dukes

They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said ""At least that nigga ain't ugly!""
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil

Lame foot soldiers get croaked in my vicinity
The ode for all murder, criminal activity
Diamond encrusted bracelets, escape death
Cars and yachts, I flaunt things that say success

Inside the LeBaron trunk, got Pakistan her-on
Nasir Jones, not a Capo, the Picasso, word painter
Black Sinatra, rap King Cole, gangsta
Point blank body armor
I'm violence, you're the Dalai Lama, you just holla drama

Hovito Brigante, my own people that got me

And I'm reppin for Nas and my crew the J Beez!

Nicholas one son the +Greatest Man+ livin

Me and you got something in common through Marley Marl
Burst in the bricks, talked to buyin ?leather?
Golden aged flows, you sound undiscovered

Hip Hop's alive, and I'm the breathing dragon
On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin
It's Lords of the Underground and that's if you're askin!

Yo! I strip the booth anytime my lips move
And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof
Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it
With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!!
When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you
I spit phantom in a boost you better just prepare to make room!
Nas give me eight bars, eight stars Escobar
Yo we rule, and we still ain't got nothin to prove, yo!

For the second I'm wreckin I got you double-checkin
For me to flash your big chain wheeler, shiny weapon, step in and holla
I gotta hit the kids that shit Hip Hop
The wack gets spit lot, the man bullshit stop
Yo they call lot and I accept the invitation
But I not try and snitch upon my ?inclamation?
On the real God, I'm good, a brother been in mediation
And my mind has been kenotic, kill the pres led a netion, Dres

Aiyyo Chi Ali hold ya head up in the peniles

Your Mouth Got You in It,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out
Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun

You mouth got in it your ass can’t get you out
Next time hold your tounge, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want it with no one
... niggas now are after you and here they come

This nigga thinkin that everybody puss til he got his shit push
Lot of shit poppin, got him all swiss cheesed up
He fell to his knees and wished he never released words from outta his mouth bout the next man's Gs
Telling me that he was heavenly involved to rob
Any nigga who scared to murder who had cash
Didn't deserve the convertible cars, sipping bourbon at bars
He feel if they ain't real he should get stuck, him and his peoples
You must be sniffing that diesel
Cause if that nigga knew you was scheming he would just leave you in pieces
Plus he's a friend of ours, we got our Benz's that power
Motor cars hung on the wire, left summers puff party
Plus you don’t get enough really never meant ..laugh and threat
.. That they wouldn’t budge they play the ..

Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out
Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun

Know when you don't want war with no one
... niggas now are after you and here they come

These niggas live after death before ...
I got you we smoke the same weed, same cars we drive
Knew two of these dudes got into murder shit just last year
I start fuck with them thinking make me lose my career
We still touch though its just dough
I make some songs that ... on they dirty money just smell wrong
But I don't knock you because we come from the same upbringing
I came up slinging, the same way they came up slinging
One thing I learn though, still judge niggas by it
Say alot about men who contend but can't be quiet
The school from which I learn is the street of old
Fuck fools they talk to worm in six feet hole
Be telling niggas what I'm eatin, what I’m holding, its sickening
Don't be conerned with what I'm eating, cause what I eat you ain't shittin
These niggas that start beef, they talk like bitches
And I'm the type to give you ...
Yo, black stocking cap on my face pulled down
From behind, all you hear is the gun cock back sound
And now I put it in yo mouth, fuck you were sayin?
Suck on this you trip, try to duck and imma spray ya

Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out
Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want beef with no one
When the ... niggas after you where you gonna run
You mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out
Next time hold your tounge, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want war with no one
... niggas now are after you and here they come

You make promises that you can keep full of deceit
Street face swallow pride ...talk to you money shit
You wana run with it .. talk about shit
You ain't’ get none of it
You whisper got bitch unless is for the real
Always ..tryin' to ..can’t remember I said ..fire on you ..
If .. run off ‘cause the things gotta
You ain’t get no wings ..but ends

"Blood, New Version",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Italiano motto
Train like Cus D'Amato
Guard your plant
Recline low black milano
Blessed God feelin kosher
One in the top of the toaster
???
My nine is stuck in a holster
Dump quick
Chasing my dick
Made a bum bitch rich
Stalefish
Heard she naked in jail flicks
Mamacita
Black widow turned to be a back seater
Satin pillows a pimpstress in willow
Cookin my blow and heads low
Eye swellin
The son of the grain
I gotta split my wife's melon
So I can see the seven seeds of my circumference
Beaver lunged it
Polishin pistols at the gunsmith
Clever
My mama told me take cheddar
Buy slugs or drugs whatever calculate better
When cakes measured
Lock the front door secure
See the gleaming white crystal when its pure
Fuck the snake hoes and jealous ass niggas
That smash your Benz windows
Detecting fake niggas signals
Yo live niggas get it too
Scarin rappers like the fed time Gotti was acquitted to
Bloodshot red eyes, high
Yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Kicks matchin my shit my gun on
Thinkin of names for my mans unborn
Spill the Puerto Rican rum on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints scream religious praise
Heat grazed the baby yo
Foul shit made a welfare mom crazy
More bodies drop by the ratio
Paces flow
Grisly thoughts for makin dough
Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash flow
So now its on never wasted a slug
Time is money
When it comes to mine
Take it in blood",https://genius.com/Nas-blood-new-version-lyrics
Come Take a Ride (Two Seater),UnKnown,UnKnown," **2X**
'Come Take a Ride' you can fit up in my two-seater
Nas a thug you can catch me in my wife beater
Blowin' my drugs you know how I like the cheeba-cheeba
And if you hatin' and I prolly don't like it either

Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my black jeans and Timberland Chucks
I got some moneys in my pockets got some money to spend
Got some hoochies I'mma hook up wit quarter to ten
My daughter wit me and we came from the mall
Don't need no baby mama drama
Kissed her on the cheek and dropped her back off
I hit the car wash at half past four
Some kid was star struck
I pulled off my grass and let 'em puff sour
My deuce-deuce rims shinin' happy as they can be
I went to the famous Project that they call QB
I saw some brothers gamblin' on the curb
A shorty pulled a pistol took they paper, nigga that's my word
I turned the corner wit my burner and palm
Niggas know my name and game I'm a murderous Don
Saw my peoples then extended my arm
Pulled on the sidewalk, no time to talk
If y'all comin' come on; come on!
 **2X**

Talk like a champion, walk like a champion
Body like a God and I promise that Nas'll a hit you off
Flow like a gangsta, brum bum bum bum bum
Bustin' black dummies and dustin' all y'all niggas off
I've been around a couple of times, know how things go
I dealt wit 'em all on different occasion
The same things'll come in different stages
So when them things rise up or pop up
I look right past as if its weightless
Meanin' it won't intervene the thought process
So I can levitate to more important topics
Laughin' the Face of Death, flash back of car crashes
20 L's Grey Goose vodka and tall glasses
Dippin' in the twilight
Wit gangsta smokin' weed in my ride light
The same stuff is still a bitch livin' like I'm rich
Bang broads call me Mr. International, ghetto stars come on
 **2X**

Slow like I robbed Brinks truck, haters all fold
Cuz my 9 is aimed up, I left four seasons
My niggas bleedin' cause of four reasons
Jealousy, hate, laziness and envy even
Up in the Benzie squeezin' a couple Henny wit my comrad
Conversatin' on what we believe in
Like honey in the way she's been cause he's spend
G's a week in the make freak knees bend
I told her to pimp hard, see the hoes we left in the room
They nymphomaniacs prolly lick homegirls womb
As respect just phone 'em and leave 'em & shit
They not your wife keep your cash nigga don't even trip
Pass the grass accordingly, you saw police
But when I puffed and coughed
Seconds later screamin' ""Fuck the Law""
Got CD's, TV's, guns tucked in the floor
Once again I hit the streets and y'all don't see no more

Fetus (Belly Button Window),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas
And the year is 1973
Beginning of me
Therefore I could see
Through my belly button window
Who I am...

I existed in the womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit-land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching my mom's stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on the name that my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Looking out my belly button window, my father sighs
On his face he wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
'Cause I'll go back to Spirit-Town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
Mom and Pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off
First they want me, then turn around and they don't
You got 120 days, y'all do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up your minds

""I shot my way out my mom dukes""
""I shot my way out my mom dukes""
""I shot my way out my mom dukes""
""I shot my way out my mom dukes""

Yo, hey must wanna keep me, cause four months past, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call ill will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down 'cause I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All bBck babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my mom's voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, ""If I am born, will I be safe at all?""
This place they call the world, through my view, was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, '73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start retraining cops
Month 9, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms push and take deep breaths, too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pop's face, he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, ""At least that nigga ain't ugly""
Placed me in his arms, snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me
And, yo, I plan to overthrow the devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers",https://genius.com/Nas-fetus-belly-button-window-lyrics
"Be Safe, Be Notorious",UnKnown,UnKnown,"New York city in the early morning after a night of no electric power. What it did have in the dark streets was a wild outburst of crime. Arson, looting, mugging, and a thousand false fire alarms. At 9:34 last night it all went black

I pour some Yac for the days of way back
The turn tables crates of wax turn to major to my earlier days
My world was ablaze, black outs in the summer
No electricity asked out
Breaking down doors, my city was hungry
We vandalized stores, poor
No lights in the project hall
Before the lootin' only 5 DJ crews was movin'
Till people stole DJ equipment the numbers risin'
Now there's friction
First time in Bronx history DJ's poppin' up, there's more mixin'
Everybody wants to be Flash
His name on the flier
The Grandmaster performin' live, no acclaim was higher
He was king and the dream was to be like 'em
Meanwhile C-Cypher's not around
Firehouses shut down
School was closed
Grandmaster (?) our domes with rules
Written inside the rap scrolls

The revolution will not be televised

The revolution may not be televised
And we wonderin' who the hell is Koch
This man Koch wanted the mayor's seat
And he's campaignin' like he can't be stopped
Up in the Bronx they forever strong
Don't ever try to play 'em weak
The revolution may not ever be televised
Books command the speech

I want to stress first my total outrage that at this hour the city of New York is still without power",https://genius.com/Nas-be-safe-be-notorious-lyrics
Body In A Box,In My Ghetto,2017.0,"So many niggas get fucked up in the game
See, that's where they get caught out there in that word ""Game""
'Cause it's not no fuckin' game

When you hear shells coming at ya
Hot ones from a shotgun, I bet nigga runs faster
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster
Think about that casket—you don't wanna be in that shit
Quick to take consignment; you taking everybody's package
Money over bitches was the law you practiced
So you act as if money was no object
Spendin' fazools, trips for your whole projects
Epcot Center, linens for ya bitches, Rolies for your dogs
Now we in the mall, slayed by his bitches
Every day I'm reminiscing, how he was living, having fun
'Cause any day coulda led to prison
Not for a short bid, 'cause if the feds ever caught kid
It'd be like 25 years conspiracy
Another 25 for RICO, snatching up him and his people
He had his jeep bulletproof, silencers on the Desert Eagle
Flipping bricks in Gary, Indiana
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer
Only trusted two things: his trigger and his hammer
Used to be a bum 'til he had a six-month run
Had a lawsuit, 30 G's, the case was won
Met with Mexican Hoyé, cop boya
Bought a barbershop, named it after seeing Sade
That's where they found his body, in a barber chair face down
Bullets in his chest, sliced apart from the waist down
Planned to sell his shop, stick Hoyé for everything he got
Take jewels and his pies
Fill his shoes with cement and drop his body in the tides
But Hoyé was wise
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive

Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive

Cokehead Sandra, she grew in Gowanus
Her man was large and Sandra was his baby mama
Stayed in drama, fighting with hood rats that he was fucking
No job all day, she did nothing
They son was 7-years-old, she really was a wifey
First should she would transport blow, overnight for a G
He paid up front, they laid up once
She got pregnant, she wouldn't dead it
She had a boy, named her son Infinite after his father who did dirt
She didn't know disaster would follow
Capsules and bottles of crack in the back of his Mazda
He let her drive while he drove the burgundy 5
He often talk about how he wants to murder these guys
From off of Bergen Street, had mad work in the street
Lifestyle, richest nigga, far from how he used to be
Never thought he'd rock diamonds; never took weakness for kindness
That's how he gradually grew
Did a favor for a favor—now the nigga in with the crew
And now he live major, house in Dix Hills next to Brooke Shields
With the cook and the maid, shit was real
Saved his first bills made in his bodega
""Good luck, player"" sign on the paper taped in the window
Escaped from a would-be kidnap, and slept
Thought niggas feared his rep 'til he got wet
Woulda had the world in his hands, his girl did a scam
The owner's rich, is boning niggas to get rid of her man
Welcome to the game, baby

Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5

He looked at it, uh, something from god telling him, you know, the world is yours

Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld (It goes)

Young people are so special
It's so good what god blessed you
Death to unethical thoughts that surpress you
Like diseases, they conjure up inside the test tubes
To stress you, beaurcratic genocide
But maybe I'm a wreck loose
It's just my observation as a whole
Human extermination, population control
Assuming my generation is young and out of control
But y'all don't understand this
Y'all out of touch and y'all old
I promise to stay in full, try to stay on course
And right the wrongs of my father with my baby boy
Life is full of problems, don't go away when ignored
Life is long it's important that it's played like a sport
Every skyscraper you see started off as a thought
And Ricky Walters told me that the world could be yours
So hey young world, yeah hey young world

Hey young world... the world is yours

You could have been arrested
Locked down doing 10 on a fed bid
But you home so your know you blessed, kid
But trust me, I know some people who are not as lucky
Cause on the small drug beef
Gone 15 years it must be
Conspiracy, a killer sees
No liberty or justice
Congress talk nonsense
It's consignment for us hustlers
There's no 401k retirement for us hustlers
It's one way, until death
We die young, it's bum luck
Young bruh, tell me why you want war?
Tote a gun for, whoever to pump forth
With tough talk, get done off
New York City streets they carry the worst gun law
But still it's real, we do it with tools
It's ungod, under the code of hood, play your role
And maybe you'll live to grow old
Kids and a wife and household
Slow your roll before your soul
Eject from your body and you turn cold
Take advice yo, take a higher road
Hey young world, yeah, hey young world, yeah (It goes)

Story Board,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossing with Stoute, he had the gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washing her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hitting it raw, tasting it, wilding out of my character
Taping it, Tyra Banks face with Faiths lips
Giving head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the la to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sport
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adapting
P-11's, ACP shells for blasting
Caught him with his spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burning her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance
His maid cried ""No"", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought ""What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision""
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet again

Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fastlane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screaming ""Yo, we almost crashed!""
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death",https://genius.com/Nas-story-board-lyrics
Y’all My Ni**as,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of martin king just saint around no more
Dave Bowie ain't here James Baldwin neither
They all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this porch two seater
A lawyer left the hood he never looked back
To be a fortune 500 C.E.O it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies thats hiring blacks
Fresh hip hop lingo for your campaign ads
The controversy surrounds who could say it and win
Some niggas are full time some play and pretend
So fuck that no apologies on the issue
If it offends you
It's meant to
It's that simple

Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory
Too late I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas)
Speak my name and breath life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me (y'all give me life)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it)
And I love especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
'Cause y'all my niggas
Yo I was thinking a little bit what would it take
To authenticate my nigganess
Ball ridiculous
26 inches when I call up the dealership
Yeah that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit
We havin' too many kids
Recordings, welfare recipients
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
It makes me think what the hell they clean their syringes with
Everybody bleedin'
The cops are the demons
Courtrooms full of goons
Jail busher's leanin'
Handcuffs squeezed too tight
On you've life
If you fight they just give in
People used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger two different countries
Somehow Niger turned to nigga
And shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'til Noble Drew Ali
Started droppin' that consciousness

My father was not a banker
Neither was my neighbor when it came to getting paper
Who the hell was gonna train us
A pressure couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say its quite amazing
The use the ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
Its celebrated now people are mad if they ain't one",https://genius.com/Nas-yall-my-nias-lyrics

Sinful Living,It Was... Remixed (Rare Unreleased & Remixed),UnKnown,"Situations I be kickin' just to get you pacin'
That attentive parental supervision, you should do the diction
Street chronicles, struggles and losses
Can make a nigga moms hang up crosses and horseshoes
I brought you to that state of mind you needed
By now you're weeded, bob your head, recline seated
And picture life inside the shoes of the shiestiest crews
With sports cars and the iciest jewels
Y'all know the rules in this street life
By now the beast might release white
Stash your heat right, my pop passed the peace pipe
And shed light on, he put me right on to be an icon
'Cause dead niggas got they name wrote up in krylon
The fast life, fistfights, that shit could like amuse me
Some chose a road, some niggas died, some was too choosy
At nighttime, it especially addresses me
Preferably around 10 when my weed cipher begin
We start buggin' on facts, half the facts, that's for sure
Put your zone in my world, if we adapt, crack and pour
Make a toast, yo, that's how we break bread together
Probably when we dead, be better, the problems ahead, whatever
Courvoisier sippin', whippin' out-of-state missions

Man I found these shits up in the crib man in boxes man
I don't even remember when I was writing these shits
Oor what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man
Fuck it check it
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man a O.G
Some niggas will conversate with lairs all day time pass

Soul on ice death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first I thought I was abnormal
'Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain
Some do minor shit swear they on the top of they game
Ya rhymin' is called ""Vagina Monologue""
It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue

The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream

Thieves murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbing my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and lairs and squares

Pardon me type in my two way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci
God poverty's real I can't fight you
'Cause you would sue me niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit

Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar
The path we all walk, starts out long it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancing with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly
High up in a five realizing the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it
Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro-ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, dijon-scented, with Al Green on, my theme song
Love and happiness, how can it seem wrong?
I mean before this, I used to rock a taurus with the donuts
Now I grown up, got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho-nuff
Niggas acting cool but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz, off the dutch
This is everyday, every second
Got to make it pay, every lesson I learnt
Got me open while most of these rappers'll stay burnt

Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar

Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar
With so much drama in QBC
It's kinda hard being Escobarro
Elderado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems, and shot pockets
My niggas from the block rock this
Box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Looking to profit, in different ways
Goin' through this difficult stage, called life
But each year my physical's praised
Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity
Amply, living in this thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, living this king's life
Magazines write about me, in this dream it's all tight

Now the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Iced the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track but I caught that
They thought I lost that but I'm continuing to make more stacks
Halftime, New York state of mind, it was written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin' on the plane wake up when we land
Feelin' real scared, on the ground
Rollie flush, princess cuts, and large rounds
The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy

Not today

I'm in the game
Women only want my money or fame
Or they heard that Kendrick put them on blast
Or they feel I had so much ass
""What could he want from me? When he can have whoever he wants for company?""
The like, ""he a slut, he a ho, he a freak
He my childhood crush, wish I met him '03
Now I need a simple life with a Christian man""
I was like, fuck it, get this money, get this power, keep slutting
Then I bumped into a cutie, looking at her
Not in a lusted matter, but in we need an introduction matter
Need her like fresh water from the springs of Florida
She hot for reasons more than one
Underneath the balling sun in Coachella where a I met her
She was staring
Since we began to hang, she my number one thing
Tell me your troubles, I'll listen, I'll try to numb your pain
You like to hug a king, I call you the color queen


Oh burn me love, it's not a drug nor complexion necessarily
It's an expression the canary sings
If that canary don't sing, I train her
On the wings of love, I took the top from the Wrangler
She riding shotgun with her shades on, a day will come
I'll put a natural yellow rock on your finger
Born a queen, love looking at you, smile made me change up
You a bright sunny morning, sex, amazing
I said it since day one, we was meant to be
When you put my clothes on and started posing like a G
Playfully with my chain then you liked what you see
Loving how daddy do it, no one quite like me
No games, no side chicks, me and my ride or die chick
We see eye to eye, maybe not when your heels are five inch

Black Folks,In My Ghetto,2017.0,"What, what...yeah

I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime
Since the blackout in Queensbridge in '79
Everybody's a killer now; pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window wherever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens kings, I used to view the cats that are old
Seeing things that made me real from my skin to my soul
Girls who turned hoes, friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring death wherever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know
It's all real though

Everything is real
Where we Headed now?
Up to more money, would be more fun
Leave with mo' bitches, carry more guns
Where we headed now? Where we going, yo?
It's getting real, son; we gon' let it flow
Where we Mo' bitches, it be more dough
It be more fun, holding more...

How the hell are we supposed to excel from the street
Where the Jake's crew face young kids who wanna eat?
Quantum Leap to this Black world, hustlers and ghettos
Self-made millionaires who tussle with the devil
Bust a lil metal lead, wrestle you, to the pebbles
On the hard ground, that's if your guard down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the horn with the god Shapelle, my Queens comrade
Yo, run and come in with the dime bag

Ayo, I need dat, I got to smoke dat
Send me some Chunky Black, so I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain, but the thought still remain
Yo, it's on again once the death stunts these chains
'Cause I been through it; the drug game, I thought I knew it
I got knocked, took it to trial, but I blew it
25, but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me; got me wrapped up like a mummy
Now I'm in the system a.k.a. the devil's home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with, drug dealers, and chain stealers
Bitch niggas who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine, sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots, but I civilized the savage
I sat him down and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...

Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a Mac-10 over a Tec
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase ""Nigga, light that""
Hoes you fuck ask you: 'Where your ice at, dunn?'
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we could cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gon' truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your clique roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in Suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13-year-old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics

Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay Macarena-ing
Marinating, while you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it

Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want, huh?)

Listen to Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uhh, Uhh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill

Yo my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, Tequila bottle in
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, Can´t do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice


The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...",https://genius.com/Nas-listen-to-me-lyrics

Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us
U.S. attorneys, public defenders send us off to hard prison time
Whether you innocent or did the crime
Say you come from Hooters, cops pursue you hard
Run your place, put guns in your face
Put you in the car for nothing (Green Lantern!)
Now you struggling, tied up, standing in line-ups
Call your lawyer, they charge you for murder
Why? ‘Cause these liars
Say you shot another man in his driveway
Guilty, just for being Black on a Friday
Polygraph test, you’re failing, because you’re nervous
Charged with murder you didn’t commit, then they serve ya
Fifteen years, maximum security

When I walk into a room, niggas feel a slight breeze
Stay a little while till they feel they might freeze
Never understood why they never liked me
'cause when I locked the door, they turned into to icees
Starin at my feet all you see is nikes
Bet you never seen a ill pair like these
Size ten, never find me in a tight squeeze
At the airport, minutes before my flight leaves
Round trip tickets to who knows where
Stay boarding, never at least a day's warning
Previous plans, they spoiling
A dollar and a dream, the theme to new york, stay torrance
From st. john's to wake forest, wait for us
Straight ballers, you hearin it first
Nate flawless in almost every event
Puttin up point, while niggas like y'all stay scoreless

To my bitches from the projects, light one up
And stay high, high
And pass me a cup of that good shit (so high)
We on some hood shit (so high)

And pass me a cup of that good shit (so high)

What's me without the hood?
A tree without wood, a dutch wit no bud
A cut wit no blood
A fuck but don't nut, I be incomplete
If me and the street wasn't in between the sheets
I'm a product of hard luck, the money and murder game
Here's nature, kill a faker, man you heard of the name
From the cold streets of qb, old beef to new beef
No peace, through the song, what I see you see

Mad bitches wanna smoke wit me
Niggas wanna roll wit me
Usually in my hood, find me in yo' city
Grimy-ette so pretty, it's like there's two me's
Wit no favorites, I try to love both of me
Thinkin of a way where I can better myself
Sometimes I get a head of myself
Smoking weed wit intention, frontin like I got it prescribed
So high I must be outta my mind

It's like hoppin in a glass pool, half full
Niggas only hit the bottom when they crash through
Mash fools out like they fast food
Bon' appetit, platinum or not, it ain't no match for me
I sum niggas whole careers up, scared tough niggas
Bluff niggas into thinkin that their year's up
It ain't a game, took six months off, the shit jumps off
Mini-me's are gettin punched in they jaw
My dunn call this shit animal rap
Me, I call it dumbin
My near-sighted niggas saw it comin
More stunnin, brand new flows to toy wit
Neck flooded on some hurricane floyd shit
Back and forth to st. crouix kid, same plan
Playin sega dreamcast till the plane lands

I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fuckin pitiful
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha)
I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a

Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only
But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin this mic profession, turn your direction

You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
And show you how to stay off my dick
That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection
You unlucky, I'm your fuckin C-section
Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high
Realize, how many classics I gave you
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you

You can't be me, I'm tryin to walk a straight line
Why they tryin to take mine? I'm past +8 Miles+ of every state line
Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts
At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch
As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
Is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every MC reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't cryin laughin, to the lions, throw your ass in
What the fuck was you niggas thinkin?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin that you comin for the kingpin

But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas – too real, Nas – true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since ""... Barbeque""
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the crafts of the streets
But look at me now

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

At church on my hand was a preacher's blood
I swallowed dirt from a graveyard in need of love
I vomit blunt residue. I want revenue, dreaming
And pump lead at you devils trying to make my freedom
It drove me crazy, the day I drank my own urine, my own semen
With a nine to my brain
But wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

Can't hate us
Fellas
Vice behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs, my anthology on perfection
Dress superb, admired by conspirers
Who wanna try me, but ain't high enough to four-five me up
Child of the eighties, y'all niggas is lazy
Complain about labour pains, nigga show me the baby
And my nigga Game, light another L, pass the bottle
Pro-black, I don't take cotton out of aspirin bottles
Yeah, I learnt my lessons, and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin' with Nas, confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on, My niggas I bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water, but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show 'em my fortunes but can't force 'em to think rich
And still I don't abort 'em ? when and if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance, I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray to fans, let Murder Inc. live
I don't talk about my guns, nigga I just blaze
'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin'
I was supposed to be amongst kings, my Mom shouted out at my Christening
And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a man hole
Cam got shot inside his lambo', sample, life is a gamble
15 years old red rag around my hand, My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo'
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindled the flame
Dre created The Game
Nigga with an attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown, clown, I rock an LA Dodger Fitted
I showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down with it
Now the ball's in my court, never dribble out of bounds with it
Behind the back to Nas, he alley oop to Jigga, nigga
Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me
How you gon' pass the dutchie ? to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see the Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not
I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my training wheels off his curtains
I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers
The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career
The ending of yours, the endin' of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line
Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin' off rap

“The Price i Pay To See My Son” - Open Letter via Instagram,UnKnown,2018.0,"The Price i Pay To See My Son. And apologies in advance for the typos as I am speaking from the heart as a man who has had enough.
Today i got a call from essence about my ex wife doing another sad fictitious story. Nothing surprises me anymore, including this.
This is what your life has come to sis?
Exploiting some people’s Real struggle and pain...just to get at me....to get attention ? Fame? Another fight against men? We are a human family and we should be better examples for our son. Why is there even a issue for me to have time with my son. A son needs his father. So many absentee fathers out here and here i am being attacked by your accusations simply because i got us in court to help fix this the custody matter?
Why did i have to take you to court to see our son? Why when i win the joint custody ( which is a win for both of us and our son, it helps us with both our schedules) why do you feel thats an attack on you? Is it control ? Why do you need to have control over my life? because we’re not together? Then why? Is this being rewarded and praised by people who are being taken advantage of by you and your lies?
To all separated couples out there who are cordial and co parent nicely GOOD FOR YOU. I wish that was me. I’m the most chill cool parent there is. Who has time to argue ? About what? It’s about our little guy. You haven’t had to deal with what I’ve been dealing with. Trust me.
I’m a mild mannered god fearing very fair human being who tries his hardest to please everyone. It’s my nature.
I’ve seen this too many times before
And there was times i thought Kelis my ex wife was not this type. This is the type of antics that deceive people and people mistakenly call it strong. Seems I always had more belief in you than you do for yourself. I instilled strength in my daughter who you were already so jealous of and treated poorly. Being jealous & verbally abusive to a Little girl.

In life you have to work hard to be successful, not try to tear someone down for that’s the most coward way. Women are the essence of life. I cherish them. My strength is given to me from my mother. I am everything she taught me to be. I was raised in a single home by a single woman. I am a very proud black man.
I shouldn’t have ignored the signs from your your first song and video I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW. But I thought you was beautiful. You came into my life at a time i was grieving from my moms passing. You was a friend. Because of that i wanted to marry you. And i did. And we had a big lavish wedding. Overall there was too many good times. I have to say i wasn’t the most faithful husband. I was immature. I’m sorry about that. But you bumped your own head sis.
Why do i have to live thru a constant divorce? It didn’t work out. Life goes on. I’m not coming back to you. Your married and im happy for you and I’m a extremely happy black brother out here trying to make a difference for my kids and the next generation of young people who see me as huge inspiration in music, art,business, education and so on.
After 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent Attacks on me right outside your house THIS YEAR while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window, it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town. I just went home. This has been my life for my son’s entire life. Even our son wonders why you treat me the way you do?

There’s some seriously crazy things i won’t i disclose for our son’s sake.
Because you keep my son from me ive been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit I’m tired of it. I’m tired of you painting a bad picture of me. I’ve been tired of it but you never seem to get tired.
I even had to be in a relationship with you AGAIN after we separated just so i could see my son & I AM JUST TIRED.
Back then you asked me why didn’t i stop the divorce from happening. I tried! We are too different. Some things aren’t meant to be. We were meant to be so that we could have our son. Nothing more. You didn’t like that. I prayed for your peace of mind for years because of your uneasy soul. I still do. I guess some things take time. You definitely don’t know me now and probably never knew me. You make up this image of me that’s not true but it’s funny because it’s really you describing yourself. You made up stories about me and claimed i did things that YOU DID.
I hate all this, but you were a very jealous wife, and i had to deal with that and that’s the worst feeling. How much heat i had to take from producers, writers, music attorneys and record execs etc who felt your mean spirited wrath and dropped you from labels, from startrack to them all. I stopped talking to jungle & steve stoute because of you & almost lost Anthony because of you.

You used to turn my phone off so my professionals couldn’t reach me and take the battery. You insulted any and everyone whoever was around me. Not a single person in my life loved or could even stand you. Luckily for you our assistants all signed NDA’s or you would have a list of men and women who would happily talk about how verbally abusive and evil you are. Your self saboteur ways has caused you your grief your dealing with. Not me. The altercations you speak of are no more different from what most normal couples go thru, but your exaggerated version is UNJUST. Whenever one is constantly attacked the instinct is to restrain that person or defend yourself to prevent escalation. In hindsight now my advice to young men out there in a situation like that is to RUN at the very first sign of verbal abuse or physical. I herd you said terrible things about me. It makes me feel sad how heartless you can be. You play with strong women’s struggles like they mean nothing. You’re taking advantage of a moment in time where women who are fighting for their lives to get justice and be treated fairly & you just looked at it as an opportunity to get ahead. Like abuse is a game? Like tearing down your son’s father is a game. You have a son! Why are you still competing with me by telling him bad things about me. Guess what sis, he has eyes and ears and smart as ever. i don’t have to say anything. I think he knows what’s really good. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. You tell him GOD doesn’t love his dad because his dad doesn’t goto church.

Didn’t want to bring up money but since that’s the fuel behind all of this Let me say that I gave you the tools to be successful after you was dropped from your label. I paid for your cooking school cordon blue.
The expensive yellow stove we had flown in from Europe. I helped pay for the remodeling of your house. Your assistant stole thousands from my cc according to Amex. Out of all people you should be completely understanding of my my grind. But you just can’t win with you. My schedule is CRAZY but you never help me see my son. I’m hardly allowed to talk to him on the phone. Ever.
My lawyer told me bring the cops to your house and show my court orders when you don’t let me get him or answer your phone but who besides you wants to show their kids that his parents are that out of control? I’ve been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit for years. I finally got our custody together to work with both our schedule thru court, while leaving court you tell me your gonna get me back for fighting to see my son and 3 weeks later you’re on camera doing an interview about “your truth”. Interesting timing. Do what you want just don’t violate another court order sis because the judge won’t like that at all. The judge already ordered you to pay my legal fees because he was tired of you wasting everyone’s time in court. No lawyer wants to represent you after what you put them thru. That’s why you texted me today asking me for more child support money-and you want to keep it out court. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. Remember GOD sees all. And I’m no longer allowing you to take advantage of the fact that I did not want to respond in a manner that could affect my kids , friends or family publicly. THAT ENDS TODAY.

Everything with her is a plot and a scheme. Has no merit. No foundation
I didn’t Wana speak up because i have real respect for our women. And definitely my son. I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife. Stop. You got beat up in court. How much money do you want? Do you want me to relinquish my rights to see my son is that what you want? Just tell me. After all the tweets and posts you made thru the years disrespecting me and my family I still have love for you as the mother of my child BUT I am done with this. This game ends now and GOD will be the judger of all this. And although you tell everyone GOD hates me (some Christian you are) I will survive and thrive from this moment because I know who I am & you have not a clue who you are.

And to all the fans that knew my silence was due to the fact that I don’t openly do this kind of petty shit... I appreciate you riding. And to those that were lead down a wrong path... I get it... very sensitive times and all things must be taken seriously. This is MY TRUTH. And I don’t care what else she has left to say unless it concerns our son. This is the first and last time I’m addressing this. Despite all of this I still hope for the best for her because whats best for her is what’s best for Knight.

Life’s Like A Dice Game,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo... yeah...

Locked in a human flesh shield
Watching niggas get rich beside me
Pushing a 5 B-Y me
Up in the passenger seat
But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom
Sipping Asti Spumante
Dripped in, reality kicks in
I need the papes to start clicking
Got a connect out in Richmond
Every nigga in the fam will pitch it
It's on, word is bond
That's my name, big Nas
All wise to civilize
From the Northern Hemisphere of the earth
Peace to my seed and thanks for her birth
Destiny, that's her name

Salute Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"In a day of 1999 it had to happen
The result of man's stupidity became real
Death smell is everywhere
In their nicely worked out war plan
Through the sky come rockets down there people are scored
Everybody does try to save his own everywhere in town
On the run the people turn to animals
Love and hate does not exist here more
No more hope
Which led to the world's last breath
Fire does control our world till the end
Go fight stand up if you are not scared
Tell them the people are dead
The merciless radioactivity spread real fast
Burning skin makes the pain a torture, everybody gets blind
Can't feel hot and cold no more, it is so strange
Listen to the people helpless screams, it is too late
Moving forward slowly and together we are strong
We will tell them what we are thinking
About their bloody war
And we stop the war and there will be no hate
And we will together rule the world peacefully",https://genius.com/Nas-salute-me-lyrics

Wanna Play,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Verse One:
Yo, the Lord is my shepard
The sword is my weapon
Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle
Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son
'cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun
Before they choose an education
But once dead their ain't no awakenin'
So like once said, life ain't for fakin
Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em?
Fuck waitin'
Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation
Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan
When I aim I ain't missin', master of assasination'
I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo
Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth
Is this the truth?
This is what we do, sip a brew
Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM
As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin'
Chorus - Okay, you wanna play rough?!
(gun shots) (scratching - a thug changes, and love changes) repeat 3X
Okay yo, we could play rough!
Verse Two:
Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?
Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas
Ducked in they seat? are they lookin' for me?
But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did
May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit
P-11 Glock spits 17 shot clips
Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is
Pull the strap from under the seat
Back up in the street
Watch these niggas thats tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat
Empty every shell in their direction
Its you, I should've guessed it!
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you
Now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into
Chorus
Verse Three:
Walked in his house, smackin' him up, ""what you talkin' about?"" he said
Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome
Never thought I'd be in his home
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone
Fuckin' with me, you should've known
I'll have 'em write ""stupid nigga"" on your tombstone
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G
For threatenin' me
I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free
Killin' you niggas with nothin'
Left him dead, engine runnin'
You the only I'm makin' sure that gets whats comin'
Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it
But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live
Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back
I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac
Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that?
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats
Gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react
Eye for an eye, 'cause the sweetest part is payback
Somebody kncokin', who dat?
""a cop man"", let him in
And give that mothafucka one under the chin
Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds!
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
Dont explain, I put the pound on his head
Blew 'em! before that I can't remember the last time I said......
Okay, so we gonna play rough!

U wanna be me - soundtrack version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uhh, ooh baby, baby
Keep it thug and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah
Now slowly, thinkin of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fuckin pitiful
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha)
I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a
Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only
But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction
You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
And show you how to stay off my dick
That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection
You unlucky, I'm your fuckin' c-section
Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
Toast glass, ill will, the label get high
Realize, how many classics I gave you
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you
Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only
But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction
You can't be me, I'm tryin to walk a straight line
Why they tryin to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line
Eating alligators and hummingbird hearts
At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch
As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people, this is God son
And I've come from the God under pure peace
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
Is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every MC reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative; what you made of Junior?
'Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't cryin laughin, to the lions, throw your ass in
What the fuck was you niggas thinkin'?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin' that you comin for the kingpin
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha
Take me out, try try try, but you
Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only
But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction
You can't be me",https://genius.com/Nas-u-wanna-be-me-soundtrack-version-lyrics

American Way- Dotan,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, check it, uh
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard lil' longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough, wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MC's on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody as the hood as my councilman, uh

Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
( Cause that's the American way)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way

Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
It's rarely men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Says, ""Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe""
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve to earn man's purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh

Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
( That's the American way)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
( Cause that's the American way. What up, K?)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
( That's the American way)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
( Ha, yeah)
I don't care about the runaways
I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS
But I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think they're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane
As long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way ( Uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah)

The genesis - explicit album version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"NAS
""Get-get.. get down!""
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
""What you up to, the cops goin' bust you""
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showin' they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin' proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother durin' the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein' replaced
Pre-trial hearin' is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I want to crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, nobody leavin' everybody

""Get down, get down! Get down, get down!"" 
Everybody
""Get down, get down! Get down, get down!""

Some niggas fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you, disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas I got your back - the fools don't play""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Should of never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do, with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people goin' get down, how we ever goin' get up?
How we ever goin' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you ain't look at it
My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk

My Country-Banaylo,UnKnown,2001.0,"American born, American raised, American made

My country shitted on me (My country)
She wants to get rid of me (Naw, never)
Cause the things I seen (We know too much)
Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)

It was packed on the Ryker's bus
The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lap
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa
Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry


It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20 years, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back
But yo


Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun shootin' ducks with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
 But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in this business, I'm bout to rebel

There's not a bitch in sight
All block bench, all block gates
All gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the news hash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say


This goes out to Jake Rivera...
Revolutionary destroyed by his own country,just tryin to fight for whats real
This goes out to my nigga Malcom Alhazbalishibaz...
Just tryin to fight for whats real
This goes out to Martin...
All about peace and destroyed by his own country
This goes out to everybody in the whole world...
Just tryin to fight for whats real
To Petrish Lamoumba...
Just tryin to fight for whats real and destroyed by his own people
This goes out to my hood niggas...
Coming up every day just tryin to survive the only way we know how

Play On Playa [Clean],UnKnown,UnKnown,"Light somethin', stop frontin'
How much money's enough? Think maybe like the trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton Sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it on to the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet moms in my Yves St. Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance like my man Luther Jam
But my verse came first
I stole change out her purse
Now I wanna dig her up outta the earth
Too morbid, learn forward toward a new paragraph
Blue carats, D-Class, strictly that kush in the weed bag
Tryna figure out what Berry Gordy had put in production
Studio smoky now, hard like David Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a sÃ©ance
And I, play on playa
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters
Do the yacht thing, mÃ©nage swing, baby
Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on
Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in Hey-Zeus piece
Pimped out like Snoop be, but an East Coast thing
My girl stocking tied up in a knot, top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream hear
Went from triple beams to digital
Serving fiends, the minimal, 60 G's, no criminal
No mo', just mo' doe, mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings on fingers
While your girl performs cunnilingus
'Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then he give me a fade
Hot towel on the face
Hot models who vomit after they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowing my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Moe Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step, I Clorox it
Keep 20 G's on both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buying Conflict Ice
That's the **** they stole from the Congo and other black soil
True mack for you, nappy hair, just spinnin'
Honey gave me a massage with the happy ending
Finest females I just came on, and sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters
Do the yacht thing, mÃ©nage swing, baby
Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on playa
It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a **** like me get revenue
What you never do is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
Better yet a better crew, praise God, I'ma marry you
Get your homie, carry you, bury you
Slowly, roll me another blunt stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, **** it
That man, that gang, that bang it was
In D O double G we trust
Yep yep, young loc with the two steps
He creepin' with two Tecs, he's sleepin' with two chicks
Right before he blast, all you heard was two clicks
End of existence, for instance
Rewind it, replay it, re-chop it, remix it
Re-twist it, goddamn D O double G, 'cause we missed it
Travel slow, I'm a Indian but not a Navajo
I smoke the big leaf in all the big deef's
My hair in two braids, I'm the big Chief
Ladahdah be dahdadah
Yeah, break that down, how fresh ya are
The King from Queens, Mr. Escobar
Connect with the best from the west, yes yes ya are

Who Killed It? [Clean],UnKnown,UnKnown,"Look here see
Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lamb
She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam!
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
He says one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker
They say her old man's a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather, and at this rate we'll never get her
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's gettin' me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party, what are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said 'Ssee you later'
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silhouette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do ya know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke says the Devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B is not president
Well, what do ya say
Ya see?
Ya see?
Ya see?
Look here see
I know you got soul you're trying to hide it
How did you kill a man out in Cypres
One Eyed Charlie, he only hangs with the criminal minded
Says you guys did it **** is he lyin'
She says, 'Walk this way I'll tell you a children's story'
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed, her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said it's gettin late c'mon give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady? She says Bill Gates
What are ya born '77 or '78?
She said, â€½Nah it goes way to an earlier dateâ€
Slave times, claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave
The Bronx, now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc
Listen up sweetheart, now we gettin' somewhere
As she's talkin' she starts vanishing in thin air
But before she drops the money bag on the floor and died
She said, â€½If you really love me I'll come back aliveâ€

From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a certain child
Should learn not to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words
Nothin' is explained or rushed to the brain
Lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""
""Why'd you let them inject me?""
""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso

If I changed anything, I mean anything

Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Wiccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11.000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead bitch whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib, to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murcielago driver, 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper

Remember The Times (Intro) - Explicit Album Version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I think I can remember some...
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you

Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you

Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
(now we could properly begin this)
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do

Nas is Like EZO,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Listen

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
EZO put it in your cell phone
E as in three for the Holy Trinity
Z in the 9 perfection from rhyme to delivery, God
O, 6 for i am human and my existence is to be flawed
I'm the rhyming Medina
Have you green like the reefer of the fever
Want to be battling?
I'll leave you scrambling fro words like we was Scrabbling
It's Maddening when you get to the big stage
And spike it, you throw away the game
Joell taught me how to rap
Biggie taught me how to craft
Nas showed me that the game is about more than that
EZO is like a lyrical drug
Ketamine in a slug
Fuck rapping the lights out, goodbye to the utilities, roof, and the rug
My mixtape don't go gold, I'll give the Kanye shrug
Guess the game really is in the hole that it dug
Skill made Chance my friend in this rap game
Like, Vic, Mensa as my, nick name
I'm 16, looking for a Super Freak like Rick James
Cold blooded when i Kick the Urban Rapsody, but I Get Money like Wayne and T-Pain
Insane the number of lines in his brain
Such a quick claim when you see he used the simplest rhyme in the game
Go back and forth like a dope tennis match
I stay in line like 4 bars of Kit-Kat
Come at me it's a mismatch
One eight seven over the dispatch",https://genius.com/Nas-nas-is-like-ezo-lyrics
Squeeze,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Squeeze!
Squeezin' on ya; real niggas creepin' on ya

I got cream, some ganja trees, and fronto leaves
Honda bikes, diamond dykes, rubbin' me, lovin' me
Don't let my seed hear this, cover her ears
Real shit; no surrender, no fear, we pioneers
Of all this ice shit, biscuits, and tight whips, rims
Bangin' blends in the S-Class, half a thousand
Slap pounds with cats who shot down shit
Real niggas who stay around chips, and down Cris
Sips of Henny; chicks who bless you, finessin' it, professional
Slob with ice cubes, just like Vanessa do
Reppin Q, smoke amazing Thai
Shit that givin' you triple Asian eye
Yeah, bitch, a nigga stayin' fly
From tube socks and Timbs, to blue rocks, a Benz
Who got the ends?
The type'll make 2Pac 
To all niggas who shine; yes, who got revenge
I won't showboat, my flow choke you
And if it don't, the fo' fo'll smoke you
Left your seed reminiscin' on ya
MC's I'm pissin' on ya
Shine cause my chips are longer
It's gremlins I'm sic'n on ya
Shots your dodgin'
While Esco could rock the whole fuckin' Garden
Real niggas always gon' play this shit..",https://genius.com/Nas-squeeze-lyrics
One Mic (American Epic Session),American Epic: The Sessions,2017,"Yo, all I need is one mic‚ one beat‚ one stage
One  person front‚ face on the front page
Only  if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed  with 151‚ one sip probably'll make me flip
Write  my name on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge  it‚ leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up, try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up, try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But  my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers, coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die
This is what Nas is 'bout

Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic

All I need is one blunt, one page, one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime
Hope your funeral never gets shot up
?? through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, my heart is racin'
Tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years
Strapped up, too many MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until it's empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, the time is now!

I need one mic
All I need is one mic

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, and one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have your ass done? Fooled you niggas

I need one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic",https://genius.com/Nas-one-mic-american-epic-session-lyrics
"Comments on Sony/ATV Deal, November 14, 2013",UnKnown,2014.0,"Rap Genius:
We’ve got nothing but love for the NMPA and all music publishers. Rap Genius was born out of our passion for nuanced and beautiful lyrics, and so in many ways the entire site is a paean to music writers and publishers.
All our dealings with music publishers reflect this love, the biggest fruit of which was the landmark licensing deal we signed with Sony, the world’s largest music publisher, earlier this year. This partnership has already been magical for both sides, and the symbiotic relationship between Rap Genius and artists will only grow stronger as more publishers board the “Rap Genius Love Train” (toot toot!!)
But we don’t want this conversation to distract people from our true mission. Rap Genius is not a lyrics site, nor is it a music site. Rap Genius is a monument to human knowledge. Like the Talmud before us, our goal is to add context to all important texts in people’s lives. Lyrics are very important texts and so they’re a big part of this mission, but the vision of Rap Genius goes far beyond music and touches poetry, literature, the bible, political speeches, Supreme Court opinions, science, everything!
And text is just the beginning! Already the Rap Genius community is annotating images, movies, TV shows – all of human culture! Personally I can’t wait to click on the Mona Lisa’s eyebrows and see what they’re all about. Much love.
Sony:
Rap Genius allows our songwriters and artists to connect directly with their fans in a new and exciting way. And the site’s popularity is certainly due, in large part, to our songwriters’ lyrics. We look forward to the continued success of the Rap Genius service.
- Martin Bandier, Chairman & CEO, Sony/ATV Music Publishing
Nas:
As an artist who has been making music since the 90s I am constantly seeking new avenues to connect with fans that was not at my fingertips 20 years ago. Rap Genius is an outlet that provides fans with something they have always sought: access into our craft. In our tech-savvy society where streaming is actually having a positive impact in reducing piracy, organizations such as the NMPA should understand and embrace the ever-evolving mediums in which music is consumed. The #1 issue that the music industry has always had is its lack of innovation and the inability to pivot along with our audience. I admit I have had my challenges with this as well, but being a member of the Rap Genius family since it’s inception has really opened my eyes to how incredible music enthusiasts are. Rap Genius is an educational vehicle and a social network that quenches their thirst for knowledge. As members of the music community, WE WANT our fans to know and understand our art and this is what this platform accomplishes. Rap Genius is a non-traditional academic institution that engages and sparks dialogue amongst its constituents in a way that makes makes professors and scholars envious. If anything, Rap Genius makes people want more music!",https://genius.com/Nas-comments-on-sony-atv-deal-november-14-2013-annotated
