I Got 5 on It,Operation Stackola,1995.0,"Creep on in, on in, on in (Whoa)
See I'm ridin' high (Whoa)
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got's five, I got five

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
 and when it comes to
Getting another stogie, 
fools all kick in like
Shinobi
. No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit it
Bit 
unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go 
delirious, like Eddie Murphy
I got more growing pains than Maggie
‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it (got it, good),
 grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, 
messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it (got it, good),
 
it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the
Face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint
, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it; 
grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; 
messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; 
it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

I been smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down up in the O-A-K
The Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the 
E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu

I got five on it; 
grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; 
messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; 
it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack",https://genius.com/Luniz-i-got-5-on-it-lyrics
X.O.,Original Gangstas (The Soundtrack) ,UnKnown,"Chorus: 1x
Would ya quit, fucking me high off

Petal to the metal, drinking X.O., nothing but X.O
Verse 1:(Numskull)
I'm broke, you broke, we all broke
So let's take our broke asses to the sto'

I know I failed cause I done smoked hella weed, bro
An every time we with Chris
That nigga rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me

Lit to the fullest extreme
There was getting no higher
That shit had my chest on fire
Dru Down was swigging to the face straight
But I ain't fuckin with that
I think I'll stick to the crazy 8's
Bring me a bottle and I'm cool with that
I'mma a lounge with that
Nigga bring me a phat sack
I don't know how to roll
But I know how to smoke!
I think I'm gonna hit it til my ass choke

Only Oakland got that Doja like that
Only the town, nigga
Eh man quit hogging up the joint, man you babysitting it
What you talking about?
Pass that shit over here

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that likes to light another joint like Cypress Hill

Narcotics, and boss ballas, pitbulls and rottweilers
Niggas wit gold teeth, old schools on gold feet
Killas, and O.G's, task force and the police
Mac Arth to Foothill, East 14th
Sobrante Park, Woodfield, Plymouth, and Walnut Street
From the Ville to Seminary to the rollin 20's
Wit ghetto celebrities like Big Feek and Little D
See the East Bay Dragons, it's the home of the Panthers
Where niggas slang tons of crack and feds catch it on camera
Throw you in the slammer
It's the home of $hort and Hammer

That's my weeples, that's my nizzle

With my niggas ridin' dopefiend rentals
Rock presidentials, slang crack, pack pistols

From the Bay to L.A. to Las Vegas
'Cause I'm a playa, a boss playa
And if you wit me pop ya collar shake them hatas
I'm a Raider

I'm a Raider, just like my niggas before me
But I was a thief with out the open face gold teeth
And En Vogue was some fine ass Oakland Raidettes
And Too $hort was the first Oakland Raider on the set
Now Pooh-Man was a Raider when he was ""Fuckin Wit Dank""
And Askari X was a Raider when he was a ""Ward of the State""
And Dangerous Dame was a Raider when he was callin' hoes names
But I know, from the Lake on Sundays, to the five-o
Now we to Eastmont with the sideshows
But it's fun, and I'm famous, but I ain't tryna die tho
Niggas be goin' out in a gang but not I tho
If I have to go back to dope, I'm slangin for survival
Now Dru, pimp he do
If you hoein' then he pimpin' you
Tried it for 30 days, I ain't lyin', I ain't wit it, dude
A babysittin job, oh my God, that's a job
But I still wanna do it 'cause that's 100% I

You the shit baby girl, I'm just lettin' you know

We got five on that thing, man
We got, uh, Dru Down
We got the Luniz
(Shock G)
Yeah, Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1
You say you got five on my tenda
You can bend over the table
But be sure bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brush?
No elementary school ground plan
Not a five dollar bill
But five double zero on the real, feel
I'm on the level, stair mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high speed
But still don't tap the B.B.s
I'm dizzy, Dru Down, baby
Like Nyquil, I drop fever, so either put your five up
Or ya gots to leave it like beaver cause see ya
Nigge Perk land broke and smoke ya spliff all day
Go home and buy big tricky with his pretty Impala
I got five on the Hennessey, Segrims and 40's
Cause this is how we do it like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland city, framed nigge is a gonna
Now I'm blowin' it up like Oklahoma
Put ya five with my fin, best believe we'll bend
Mo corners than you thought, to somethin' writers bought
More sizz-acks, believe that talkin', where you from?
Oakland
Smokin' in attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy, the whole town loves me
An every event I'm sacked up
So if ya need me, scream double R when ya see me
I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back
I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack
E-40, why ya treat me so bad?
40 makes it happen, fives gets slapped
And rubbin' them girls just a little bit of light weight
Flamboyant, potent fumes lingerin' mighty clouds and molten lights
You expect to bit the baron an you'll be violatin' my civil rights
I'm startin' to feel my scrilla but perhaps today my scrilla ain't feelin' me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools three
Pockets empty, pitchin' five, man I'm dusted took off my hat
Passed it around, sprinkle me
Me an E-40 to the head, comin' fifth, plus
You let the lead bust, ready to do a murda, man?
Curved off the Hurricane, hurled again
Witness we'll bein' off two-fifths equal
Killing people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane)
Bring the pain like Method neglected
Smokin' crips to the night to the brains for breakfast
Cause for the indo fins do the evil that men do
Give me five and I shall proceed and continue
I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back
I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around heard young genome said, ""I've gotta be down""
Cause new styles is goin' down, look around you
Tunes from the Luniz spread round an round you
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still brinin' satin for them draws
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause
Rollin' up the cannabis, hittin' the Mary Jane
Smokin' the five before it's twelve o'clock
Sippin' on Hurricane, ready to smoke on the indo
Rollin' up my window, fittin' to go to the land
With a hand fulla broccoli
When it comes to the sticky, I'm the man
Crunch nasty, I be hittin' the jank so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke THC ain't no joke
I got five on everything, let's get loaded and smoke
S P I C E about to hit it an croak
I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed

(C.N. muthafuckin H, hey, fffwussup w-wussup wit that bitch, nigga?)
What bitch?  The bitch that I nutted all up in her face
And was grippin all down her back?
(Huh, yeah, that ol' bitch that uh
Had on that ol' tight ass shit wit them bikinis and shit
Draws was fittin tight!  You know?)
Ehh, after I nutted in that bitch' face
I took a broom and shoved it straight up her muthafuckin pussy
(Cause she a trampy slutty ass bitch, you feel)

I'm at the peak of my age; when I wake up my dick's hard as fuck
Steady stickin hoes so you know I don't press my luck
I like to fuck until she bleedin
Don't ask me no questions, afterwards you know that I'll be leavin
I might not leave right then and there though
I'm not givin you no ride, so get up, put on your hair, hoe
I got no feelings for hoes at all
Cause I know when they leave, the next nigga fuckin up the walls
So when I have em for a one night, I have more fun than Hasbro
But I don't be fuckin hoes in the ass though
That's a no-no, a nay-nay
I remember to take my dick out, hoes, cause I don't want no babies
It doesn't matter what position we in
Cause when I nut, the cum's headin straight for ya chin
My dick is shootin like a water hose
And if your tits are big and in the way then I'ma water those
Ya think Too $hort was bad
Hoe, ya better think twice cause I'ma have you wearin out ya kneepads
And what the fuck is a threesome?
I don't give a fuck about how many hoes, I'm fuckin plenty hoes
It doesn't matter to me nuthin, you can put ya mouth
On my dick, but there just won't be no eatin out
We can have lots of fun though
Take a hit of Henessy, uh-oh, ya better run, hoe
Cause I be horny as fuck hittin the yang in the gut
And if you think you can hang then good luck
I'll take ya on no matter what ya think
Ya know shit's all good, just as long as it don't stink
So open up and let me in, and in the end
All ya have is nut drippin off ya chinny chin chin, wit my ...

Yeah nigga, bring ya ass out nigga, right now)
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin, wussup Yuk?

Yeah, Yukmouth in the muthafuckin house, the crib or the pad
Look out the back of my ass, peep the sag
Love to hit blunts cause that's the shit, but never eat the cunt
When I fuck wit a stunt, that ain't the lick, punk!
Sellin out and gettin sick when ya earl is when
Niggas lick the pearl tongue, fuckin with them girls from
The ghetto, if it wasn't for dukie braids
The hair be nappy that done fucked everybody and they grandpappy
Wearin a rubber can't provoke
A nigga from catchin gonorrhea in the throat, so you choke
I never was a nigga down to eat
I just pound the meat, enough to put a bitch sound to sleep
Most niggas don't know what they doin on it
Ya might as well grab some shit out the toilet and start chewin on it
Cause niggas eat the asshole too
Leavin hella doo-doo on yo tongue, now you sprung on the bitch
(She fucked the crew even) Steven Segal was above the law
And I ain't puttin my lips on shit that ain't above the bra
Hoes pout when on the couch cause I never put my mouth down south
You gotta count me out like Ralph
I'm not a stone cold gentleman but my dick is sensitive
When it goes down the throat and hit the ribs (Yeah)
So open up and let me in; in the end
All ya have is nut drippin off ya chiny chin chin, beyotch
Outro: CNH (Dru Down)

I'm givin a bitch a golden shower
Ya know, pissin all in the hoe' face, ya know
Some of that dirty ass shit, like CNH, tell these hoes!)
Yeah, y'know what I'm sayin
It's that dirty shit, y'know what I'm sayin
For all you hoes out there who suck plenty of dick

Playa Hata,Operation Stackola,1995.0,"Why you wanna playa hate on me?
Oh baby
Oh yeah
Why you wanna playa hate on me?

Nobody can help him, so welcome to the land of ski masses
We blasts-es and bust a couple of caps up in them weak asses
The dust that's bein' kicked up, and Yuk is down to lick up
Do a stick up at an armored truck pick up
Then get up, up out the scenery with greenery
Stopped up, watch up, sew the block up with creamery
The cream, I bling, got fiends on my team
Like Hakeem the dream and hoes swing on my ding-a-ling
Somethin' tremendous, they spend grip, endless trips to Macy's
They drape me, so playa haters hate me
I keep the safety off my four-fifth, hold it in focus
Fools didn't used to trip all on my dick when I was the brokest
But, notice I got a little mail now
'Cause everybody bump L-U-N-I-Z like hell now
You just a busta brown and blood you know
Chris spreadin' faulty rumors around the town like Club Nouveau
Really though?

Why you wanna playa hate on me?
Why you wanna playa hate on me?
(Why you playa hate on me?)
Why you wanna playa hate on me?
Why you wanna playa hate on me?

I gots to, keep my business to myself
'Cause haters talk mo' lip than get shot
To spread rumors when they loaded
Hatin' to get yo' grill exploded, quick, severed
The first thing I heard, I stole a credit card from Chris Webber
I never knew that, but who's that, and next?
I heard them ridin' around smokin' crack
In the back of my homie's Lex
It be them broke ass, no cash, busters tryin' to quote
That's why the Town got rid of $hort
I think you busta browns need to wise up
Before we ride up, stop, sew up yo' block and sew them lies up
Once, don't trip, twice, roll thick
Three times, I'll get you bucked with the nine
I thought the hatin' would stop, but the rumors are passin' still
Sounds like that busta that plugged mo' holes than mass appeal
You need to stop, hatin' on

Why you wanna playa hate on me?

Break it down, oh yeah
For the Luniz and their homies
I am here to let you know
Got a thing for you, so Luniz 

Let me tell yo' ass a story, yes
They just be hatin' to the fullest
But you can miss me with that B.S. that you stress
When you test the young Hugh Hef'
The tech spit up, chest get lit up, foo' that's a rig up
Now I think the whole world knows me
Not what they should know
It's like rap and sellin' crack is what I'm good for
Hangin' in the hood for so long
I see why they talk, bitches snitch and bustas home
(Can we talk, for a minute??)
Yo' broad want me up in it
I be there hand in hand 
Can it all be so simple
Like Wu-Tang, they spit true game
To get pootang from a nympho
Now I keep sayin', don't get mad because you can't bump me
But I'm still gonna spit it 'cause you still don't get it
If it ain't noted, don't quote it
Haters when it came to common sense, you ain't showed it
I don't understand!

Why you wanna playa hate on me?
(Playas gonna play, why you wanna hate?)
Why you wanna playa hate on me?
(Hate on me, yeah)
Why you wanna playa hate on me?
(Why you wanna play, playa hate on me)
Why you wanna playa hate on me?
Why you wanna playa hate on me?

I Got 5 On Us,UnKnown,2019.0,"Creep on it (Creep on it)
Oh, see, I'm running for life
Oh, and I'm trying to survive
But I got 5, I got 5

I got 5 on us
Yo, let's go, let's leave the scene
I got 5 on us
Won't believe what I just seen
I got 5 on us
And I ain't going out like that
I got 5 on us
Man, just run and don't look back

Somebody better tell 'em it's about to be another one of them bloody murders
But I'm with it, my nigga, to be the victim, I'd rather be the predator, I wanna be the nigga with the leather face
Running, tell 'em, ""Get away"", but it's seconds too late
Wanna live another day, nigga, better pray
Better keep a steady pace, time to beat this race
I could've escaped but I wanna play
I'm roaming, I'm zoning, I'm tryna stay focused
It's weird 'cause nobody seems to get near me
The demons are screaming
Could it all be 'cause we said ouija, are you with me?
Bloody murder, murder, bloody murder, murder, bloody murder
Come murder one, come murder them all

I got 5 on us
Yo, let's go, let's leave the scene
I got 5 on us
Won't believe what I just seen
I got 5 on us
And I ain't going out like that
I got 5 on us
Man, just run and don't look back

Look, look, look
It's the night of the living dead (Living dead)
Mom, I got the boogeyman under my bed (Come look)
Daddy, I got zombies up in the shed (I'm scared)
Bloody bodies, I see people up under the stairs (Everywhere)
Have nightmares on Elm Street, I can't sleep (Nah)
People wait, the demons looking just like us, my family (No)
Insanity is crazy, they creepin' on up to chase me (No)
We stuck inside this haunted house
Now they got us running out
Let's go, let's go

I got 5 on us
Yo, let's go, let's leave the scene
I got 5 on us
Won't believe what I just seen
I got 5 on us
And I ain't going out like that
I got 5 on us
Man, just run and don't look back

I ain't 'bout to die, bruh, I'ma air it out, droppin' whatever get near us
I'ma hear a 'tch-tch' or a 'ah-ah', I'm lettin' off like 'rrat-rrat'
I ain't fin to be playin', that's that evil, I don't do ghost
If I dream about 'em, I be waking up screamin', ""Nah, that was too close""
And I ain't checkin' nothin' out, Nummie ain't even hear it
Numie go numby to the honeycomb, but I'll be here and steer it
Listen, whistle if y'all see it, I'll let y'all know if I hear it
Then everybody duck, this Chinese AK gon' kill it

I got 5 on us
Yo, let's go, let's leave the scene

Bring them in
Man where the fuck we at who the fuck are you??
It is I, Jesus, Shock Jesus
And what brings you brothers to such an early fate?
Man, no what the fuck man
Niggas just shot me man, what the fuck man
How dare you use such language in the face of the almighty
Fuck you
You shall perish (beitch!!)
It is my judgement that you shall burn in hell
Man, noo
For eternity
Nooo (the Luniz are here)
Ahhh
5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni
5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni

I wish I had cot (what?) I wish I had some cot (why?)
So I could sky and have a place to lay my head and plot
A broke nigga boney
Quick to lick but I could never steal shit from my homies
I play acts and make scratch from table scraps
And always end up fucked watchin other niggas backs
I broke hamps wit my folks and get pounds
But in the mist of funk
Would they really bust rounds?
I get woozie when I inhale all the badness
I swear to the Lord when I was young I never had this problem
I stressed the fuck out gotta doubt my own niggas
I try to solve my problems wit hamps and liquor
I used to swig a 22, graduated to a 64
And now I don't smoke weed no mo'
And I ain't knowin where I'm headin
Most likely it's the scene of creamery
I'm petrified of the whole scenery
The game is some shit ya either roll wit
Or give up because the game is quick to make a nigga stroke it
For less is what I was wishin for it never came true
So it came to plannin missions damn near shittin in my drawers
I gotta play my part though and take what I can
From the niggas I don't got Scarface nigga I feel ya
By any means nescescary
That's why they find scary niggas buried
Carried to a whole 'nother place
If youse a hard nigga die with a smirk on your face
So much drama, I put my best in it
Peace, I'd rather live than rather rest in it
Where I'm from or where I'm headed, it ain't no love
I give thanx that I'm alive to the man up above
I'm still takin shit day by day
Survin off a nifty, that's why I'm goin 5150
Ripley's won't believe I'm shot, limpin down the block
Tryin to scoot out, carry the bloody Glock
Cause niggas they plot, it was a shoot out
Tryin to take the loot out my pocket
But I'm quick to let the Glock spit at his 350 rocket
Then I split runnin down the block
No sense of dick made them bitch made niggas whip out a guage
Then blaze my ribcage, I'm dazed
On the ground hella bleeedin ass out
I remeber seein somebody put me in a glass house, I passed out
Then my spirit arose up out my flesh, I'm old
No more bullet holes in my chest
A gold vest when I awaken for Mista Go-Tec-9 is awaitin
The Lord has no love for playa hatin
I'm facin Shock Jesus cause I'm the G-ist nigga to do the job right
Because I'm trained up in that mob life
Come back tonite strapped tonite
He said if I suceed he'll bring my family and dead homies back to life
A big ass eagle scooped me up then we bails out
Flyin through the cuts goin the secret hill route
The whole scene was a disaster
Friday the 13th the final chapter
Lookin niggas wit casper the ghost
But I float until I smoked the big man
Slipped in quick sand
He's gonna kill me but my spirit slipped in my body
I yelled watch out he's gonna get me
They didn't get me, huh, 
they labelled my ass 5150

Killaz on the Payroll,Lunitik Muzik,1997.0,"Welcome
Little boys and girls. You thought niggas was gonna come weak?
Nigga this the Mobb fool, uh
I got some killers on the payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low

I fight to struggle
Hoping God don't stop my hustle
My fam fight back like wild dogs wit out a muzzle
The shots was muffled
I remember blood puddles
Land of the scand' where niggas fallin in doubles
Maybe couples, I mean the strong kill the weak
Million dollar puzzles, I done placed the last piece
Success is sweet, I put it all back together
Mass melted cheddar strictly guarded by Berettas, uh
Cash sweet, for the jewels, they get they ass beat
Sweat in my sleep, think they found a way to blast me
Grossly, muthafuckaz tried to choke me
Sliced they throat, look in my eyes, die slowly
You owe me, that's for takin it, P
Now what's left to play solely that's for fuckin wit me
Listen, in the streets it's a respect thang
Can't tell the tune, let the nine, Tec sing
Mostly 'caine products got sold on my block
Most the nights I slept got awoke by shots
The inner city, I could care less about your pity
I'm Phats Bossin ready to die if you come get me

Well you can label me an outlaw, it's Madd Maxx turn to set it off
Grab the 9 millimeter by the pistol grip an let it off
Like Dustin Hoff', killin MC's off wit a vengance
Blow the microphone up and leave it smokin when I'm finished
Popeye on spinach, my niggas been in and done done it
So come to Smoke-a-Lot Records, nigga, you know who run it
I gets blunted 168 hours a week
P tried to creep and get burnt from head to feet
But never sleep on the vocabulary skills
Of a nigga that's out to make mills, uh
My nigga Phats Bossalini chills on the block with cash
Got a hundred hidden in the stash, fast to blast

If it's one thang the nigga hate
It's niggas swangin like chimpanzees
That's why it's no exception
To the shit these niggas hand me
20 years of struggle
Huddles and plans can't amount to millions bubble
That's why we keep stacks tucked and cuddled
No matter my home, nigga, my home is where I'm hustlin
Wit Killaz On The Payroll, makin' up for lost pay loads
The Bay knows, it's hustle-matic til you drop
Stop, look and roll through the cuts lookin for cops
I kept on grinding for three years, too muthafuckin long
And had to cope wit everythang that went wrong
I got the Lord in my life, not 'cause religion
But the fact was a nigga had dreams and visions
Never listened to grown folks, I did my own thang
So muthafuckin what if it's the wrong thang
It's only one rule I live by:
Keep some Killaz On The Payroll, nigga, and get your shit right

I got some killers on the payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low

Presentin more urban tales
Of crack sales and blackmail
And black males peelin black males
I swear these California streets is symbolic to Baghdad
It's sad
They did my comrade bad, smoked him wit the mag
Now he's walkin wit a cane, and wearin a shit bag
My loc keep me focused got me sporting this rag
With this tragedy added to agony and frustration
Farrakhan himself couldn't stop the retaliation
'Cause his only climax was payback
He let his wounds heal then got more get back
The lo-jack posted up at the gambling shack
Fully strapped wit a Benjamin big faced stack on the attack
Lookin for the assailant who put in the work
He swore on the turf he'd put his asshole in the dirt
'Cause a million soldiers died in this urban street war
Before the deaths of Biggie and 2Pac Shakur
Is this the effects of being young, black and poor?
Do we genetically have what it takes to endure?
Had killaz lookin for him from Crenshaw to Figueroa
To the O-A-K, 6-9 Ville keeps it real
'Cause men sharpen men like steel sharpen steel
We warriors for the scrill wit' a whole lot of will
And I'm never gonna put down my sword and chill
'Cause I'm out here in these fields with the focus of a drill
Yeah, straight Mobulation affiliation
With enough scrill to put down an assassination
 - repeat 2X

Uh, uh
Well it's that Ville nigga, that real nigga
That fill niggas wit hot ones
Combined wit L we doubled barreled guns
Motherfuckers best run
Fuckin around with album numb' two
So, do not be fuckin around wit we and we won't fuck around wit you
I do hang wit Dru, I do not be fuckin wit busta niggas like you
Can't trust niggas in your crew, what to do, I
Don't be drinkin no brew, I
Do get high til I kiss the sky and straight up I ingest in do
Why, do I
Go on the under like True Lies
Shakin these fleas and shoo-flys
Royalties from Noo-Trybe
Got niggas tryin to twist me like screwdrive'
But fuck what you claim
We aim Mac 10s
Hoobang and hooride
So who die?
Nobody ever knew
'Cause true
Killaz don't fuck wit niggas like you
Bumpin your gums bout who got ya threw in the flue
Drunk in the Chev', grabbin your pumpkin head like ""Ooooh""
I been the Ice Cream Man since '92 comin through
In the ice cream truck on triple gold shoes, fuck some Trues
Vogues give the hoes blues, bitches choose and lose
Plus I puff indo, fool, how could you refuse?
I do not be fuckin wit broke bitches like you
Only if you knew my game would have you running trains through the crew
I do
But since I got funk wit Dangerous Crew
Some new niggas tryin to step on my shoe
You know who
That nigga got a perm like Dru
Burn like two
Remmies when he perform for you
I do
Kick it wit real niggas from Frisco
That's who?
My niggas from Get Low, the RBL, my nigga Coug
Nut, 11/5
Bump this in your Chev' and ride
Did a show in Reno, about seven died
Muthafuckaz startin to ride
But niggas ain't bumpin no 4-TAY
'Cause he too busy (bietch) tryin to smoke some more yay, uh
Hoes say around the Bay 'I knew
He be funny lookin like G-Money, nigga, puffin woos'
Heard you got married to a crack pipe
You need to get some Get Right like Mac Mall
'Cause you act like you can't rap at all
Cappin' jaws are swingin on platinum balls
Won't get flat on your wall
Just get snatched up in a U-Haul
'Cause you'se a bitch nigga like RuPaul
You all think you gonna make money dissin my crew?
But only if you knew, nigga
You fuckin wit these Mob niggas fool, uh

I'm broke as fuck in this life that I'm livin' in
I'm watchin' niggas bubble and the jealousy is kickin' in
I wanna pull licks but that jail scene don't fit me
Let's bet on the set, I'm a vet runnin' from Fifty
It spell out, so I'm a post to the fullest
Only servin then, the Ice Cream Man is out again
It's jealous niggas on the lurk still
We had a treaty, so now they goin back on they first deal
(Awww now they ready to put the lead on ya
How would you like it if a nigga was broke and came fed on ya??!!)
That's why I'm still on my P's an Q's, readin fools
I'm known as a shyster deceivin' fools (
Secret Agent Man
)
Snoopin' around found trouble
For tryin' to fuck up a nigga bubble
Don't bubble more than he got
'Cause now he know that if he get rid of you
Then that's more cash in the pot
I got a rival now
The turf is showin what it's worth
I gotta pack a gat for survival now
They just won't let me be, all I can be
So all I can see is victory
I'm struggle master, so
The doo-doo that you do will only make me wanna bubble faster
Don't party-poop 'cause this troop came fed-eral
Slappin' hoes in they neck just to let em know
It's all clear now why, it's so hard to say goodbye
You broke, I'm gettin' high
Don't make me put the lead on ya


Here I come, I'm outta jail, fresh in the air
Nigga need a come up, so nigga didn't care
So let me think, nigga, I need to pick up pace
Nigga need a lick, nigga need a safe, so uh
Let me get straight down to business
I need me some distance to run when I carry gun
And I'mma be like quick on my feet
You try and be a hero, my nine milli you will meet
And even if you're the chief of police
Nigga, you will still catch some heat
'Cause I'm just...(one of the killaz in the town)
And niggas know they call me Dru muthafuckin' Down
So homie step back, this is a jack
Nigga make a move and that ass will get tapped
Because I'm loaded, I'm loaded off the dank weed
And jackin' you will get me high just for free, see
Just call me...S-I-C-K
I love to kill for play, 
'cause like Cube, it was a good day
And I'mma be like strictly on my Q's
P's and Q's of puttin' quarter holes in fools
So don't you even fuck with my rep
My rep's too big and deeper than Dig-Dug digs
And I'mma get ya, nigga, if I want ya
I got a gun, you rotten nigga, I'mma pop ya
Because I'm broke, I need to feel me some ends
Give me yo' pocketbook so I can break it in
I want your Wells Fargo, Bank of America
And if you're a woman, don't think I still won't put the lead on ya

Hell yeah I'm on welfare, G.A. checks
Keeps me paid like a muthafuckin' vet on the set

To the point where even my bitch be choppin' zips up
I whips up the cream
Twenty-eight grams on the triple beam
Chev' sittin' clean (How much slam?)
Four-fifteens, and the Zapco
The rap go, he slipped and made a weak move
Don't sleep, dude, I pull licks every week fool
But ain't no Bonnie and Clyde, nigga
'Cause if a bitch set up a lick, I get the money and slide, nigga
I hit the crap game first thang, leave if your shot short
'Cause bein' broke is the worst thang
Check this out, mayne, 'cause you know I ain't that type niggie
I scoop the dice, once or twice, then the riggie, riggie
Dangle roll shot, is a fa sho shot, dope shot
I mean, it's so hot, I'm snatchin hella fades from the pot
I got the Glock, sixteen on my waist just in case
Never hit 6-8's, so the eight is in the gate
When I shake the dice-a, nother one bites the, dust
They mad as fuck gettin' struck by the shyster
I shoulda known, 'cause rule number one:
Never roll craps with some niggas on a track you ain't from
They done, claimin' they broke, but they forgotten
That I got they mail, and I can tell they plottin'
But shhhhitt, they'll get licked like a popsicle
Don't fuck around and get sent to the hospital
Little niggas think they slick, but they already saw it
Poppin' that ""Y'all tape hella raw"" shit
Let me raise up from these cowards' turf
Yeah, 'cause little do they know what's below the Eddie Bauer shirt
Niggas mean muggin' me but what that do
I'm a soldier til it's over, 6-5 on my tattoo, punk
So if you want funk you'll be a dead homie
'Cause I'll be damned if you pull a 2-elev' on me
Now all the niggas gettin' lit up

An I pull licks if I have to, no laughter
Or chit-chat I juss clack my shit back an then I blast ya
When it's the wig split
Come wit big shit fo the 9-Feva-roo
Cuz ya fuckin either two
Of yo baby ma'mas
Got em on camera
Doin a tootsie roll wit a hammer up her coochie hole, an a 40 up her
Bootsy hole
Fo sho, I pimp nights like Gladis
Niggas better knock on wood like havock, when I'm in yo hood wit an
Automatic
So crack ends, givin me jaw, I be call fuckin around wit mo ups & downs
Then a see-saw
Sometimes I feel like I'm broke, sometimes I'm shot calla
Who got all the bitches lost in the motions like Pala
Balla than shisty, mo betta blues then Spike Lee
Might be off the 40 cuz I'm OG like Ice-T
Ya dig?

Smoke hoes, an coke hoes, are sumpthin like the same
One fo the white dope, one fo the nigga that's in the game
Now I know bitches that say ""Richard, do what ya wanna""
But like old Vogues them bitches cry when I hit the corner
My 7-duce, produce, cuz the zues was pissed off
I'm still gettin zips off
Niggas feelin ripped off, 
an clipped off
Until they told me, it was Knumskull, Yuk an Dru
Now what you wanna do?
It's 35-hundred for the straight laced triple gold, wit the vogues
That's what they cost in the store, yeah
An you can reach, but you can not touch
Ever figga, scared nigga that you feared too much?
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out, she works for me
Brought me that Jeep
That's why I, keep my bitch business in the cut
That way I gets yo skrilla, plus I get to fuck
Cuz we

Pimps, playas, hustlas, ballas, shot callas, all of us
T for tech out to get the scratch, it ain't easy, bitch believe me
Pimps, playas, hustlas, ballas, shot callas, all of us
T for tech out to get the scratch, it ain't nuthin nice, Dru Down, let
Me hear ya

I'm steadily stackin up on the green
Ballas will use the triple beam
Shot calla use they words
Hustlas will use they shoulders, playas sit back an get served
Now observe the definition of the pimp-mode
I take hoes, an break hoes, an hoes is stayin mobile, really though
Doe is what I love, so what's up?
Nigga who you tellin, that life always been tough
Nigga I had it rough
An nigga it ain't no bluff
An potna I had my own mama sufferin, that's sumpthin
Yeah okay
I turned straight into a hustla
Crap on bustas
Skrilla fo reala from them suckas
I gave my mama half, me half, I'm out the door
Ready to bubble
I turned into a balla, shot calla
Two for twamp
With in a year I'm back on the spot
Zippas in zipper, I'm ready to hit some fences, it's so wicked
Bitch you jack rabbit call me Bugsy
Four-four up in the Paddy wagon, to break my niggas love me
An I'll be sure the next time niggas see me I'll be high
Do or die, throwin up the 5, in the 5th lane right
Side, I'm watchin the rearview juss for po-po's
I swerve to the curb, about 3 an you know that I straight broke that
Ho

Fa sho. G-A fo checks
Pimp bitches fo sex, might as well go all out an pimp the whole block
Wit 4 techs
Niggas on this, on the move in many
Plenty taken, playa hatin, Caddy's
That ain't my thang ruger
It's good to roll skrill that's the best thang
My S-S-I check came, you gotta be a big mack to do some shit like that
An issued this game
My buddies, who ever can better my Operation Stackola
Smack, mack, the greenery an crackola
Homies wanna be down rollin big stacks
You wanna make an effort towards paper, then bitch get crack
So sick wid it
That's why I shitted on raps fo luck
I'm like what ever it takes to make a buck
Could never be stuck
I'm facin a life of brokeness already
Fuck the pain, it juss make sense fo me to stay on my hustle and game
Blame no nigga fo my down fall
But pimpin is the final frontier, I gets around y'all

So Much Drama,Operation Stackola,1995.0,"Verse 1 *(Nik Nack)*
Nik Nack is in the house for the four
My niggas locked up, left a kilo.... it's good as sold
Stole
Gumbo pot creamery
Rise to the top
My limo even slide through on the late night for that high
I wanna zoom-zoom, bumpin Luni-Tunes
Candy paint K-5
Bitches I stay high
Playa hate
Callin me a balla, shot calla
Cuz I'm slangin all the major weight
Blam!!
Close the door to my residence
Po-po start searchin low, but found no evidence
They tryin to wash me an our county like Downy
Quick to pick a nigga Nack up like Downty
Don't clown me
Bitch!!
Dike hoes wanna lick my clit
But end up gettin stuck in the gut, wit a dick
Down fo my shit
Tricks wanna get em up wit me
Because they heard their baby-daddy fucked wit me
But I'm out on you hoes
Wit the 10 g belt
The only thing I'm concentratin on is checkin my mail
What the hell??!! what the fuck??!!
Do you mean
Your boyfriend is a dope fiend, an he smoked up all my ice cream
Oops upside yo head fo gettin licked like a lolli-pop
Let yo nigga cut, where's my shit, now you get lolli-hopped
By everybody on the turf
Oh yeah about that skrilla.... hell yeah that welfare check is mines on
The first
*(chorus)* x2
It's so much drama in the streets
An I can't tell you why the funk be deep!
Do you really know where ya going to
An do you like the things that life is showin you??
Verse 2 *(Knumskull)*
Fuck around an trust yo underfolks
Like dope fiends, you leave yo cream wit
Post, you come back an yo whole bundle gone
Or this, niggas add dirt to the list
Getaway clean
But one wanna keep everything
He gots to cook it, cuz we need the good shit to post
Tryin to bake a whole thing, this fool claim that the pot broke
But here goes 5 g's an dubbs
You can probably catch mo cuz I chop slugs
Blood bubbles, so I charge it to the game wit no shame
Even though we got away wit a whole thang of cocaine
I got fucked in the deal, sumpthin cool
(Why meee!!)
Cuz that 5 g's he gave me was boo-boo
Too much drama in the streets of the Oak
Niggas will tell you what they want you to hear
Not what you should know
Instead of sellin mo cream
Niggas is sellin mo dreams
Lyin juss to kick it sellin weight wit no fiends
Now this is sumpthin that I don't understand
Why the FUCK would that nigga Master P call himself the Ice Cream Man
BITCH!! Don't you hear the muzik??
That's jankie as fuck
He musta been
Off the fluid
,
Niggas steadily tryin to take shit from the next man
Don't playa hate, juss give a pound an let the best stand
It's too much skrilla in the Land
Fo niggas to be hatin
Captian Savin
I juss don't understand
Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)*
Cuz when I was a youngsta, money was so damn hard to find
But dealt wit my young comrads an we was deadly on the grind
When I wanted to bubble, fools start trippin talkin shit
They never woulda thought I'd be, the mutha fuckin wit all of the grip
Check this out here you jive ass turkeys man. Ho's slobberin-obberin in
The O. There's only one Mobb man, don't hop on the back of the Ice Cream
Truck an get yo ass booted off
I can't stand punks on a man hunt
That destroy
Lay low, cuz my four-four
Will make yo ass glow, like Bruce Leroy
(sho nuff)
Since they bigga
Many figga that I can't throw
But they don't know about this bole-legged skinny nigga
Mad because I'm foldin grip
Plus rollin thick
Still up on that late night loadin clips
Holdin shit
To myself
Shotgun bullets be bad fo them health
So save that gang-bang shit on somebody else
Where I peep thugs
Have drugs to sell you
Don't fuck wit the L-U-N-I-Z that's what they tell you
Peep the murder we wrote
We roll wit C-Note an Noo-Trybe to fools slide
At my show because I make the whole fuckin O hooride
Slide to get the remedy
M.D.,
Twamp, twamp
Make you wanna pump, pump on the enemy
Been havin suicidal tendecies the whole day
Alazae will have a nigga on lock down like O.J.,
(slang-a-gang-of-caine)
Like the Cubans
They hate when I'm crusin
Don't fuck around an get yo life ruined fool
So take yo last look
You get yo ass whooped
Rolex took
Cuz broke niggas make the best crooks
You best look over your shoulder, highrolla
Wit that cola, cuz my soldiers come wit mo folks then yours does
No bluers or blunders

Court.... YOU'RE GUILTY!!

No I'm not guilty, you're guilty. Law makers. Politicians. Business men

Criminal. You're the reason why, I'm.... The Ice Cream Man
Verse 1 *(Knumskull)*
I, spent hella time on the block late
An I feel safe, as long as I can shoot the Glock straight
So come
Get the greenery
Rush to the bank collect yo doe
Make sho you got yo bucks in yo hand, cuz the man
(be comin around the mountian when he come!)
That's a rigg up
I rather swallow my yay, an shit slugs
Fuck task, it's a must I bubble
So many rocks in my jaw I feel like Barney Rubble
I got my, pager
An my, bus pass
Grab my Avion water juss incase I had to dust task
It was about four otha niggas on the spot grindin
One was on my team smokin hamps an poppin leads
(knock on weed nigga, fuck that knock on weed, you got a twenty??)
Gave up two ten's an a bump cuz I had plenty
Not even knowin what I juss did
Put the money in my pocket an headed back to the crib
Got a tingle on my dick feelin bad
Looked up an seen task cars comin at me
So I bounced through a buildin lost all my cash
Swallowed my rocks, ditched my pager, I'm haulin ass
Then found myself by Blyman's house
Thinkin about juice
Hit the turf, sky out
Through the roof
But that plan was cancelled
Betta give up
Betta throw yo hands up
Here comes the man
The gloves on the other hand
Got on my knees
Crossed my legs
Then threw up my hands
One of them yelled ""Bitch hit the deck!!""
Kevin Reese grabbed the stick an almost broke my neck
I'm handcuffed on the ground wit a foot in my back
Then they asked me ""Hey where the fuck our money at??!!""
Now I'm stressin cuz the dogs right beside me
They took me down so that the under could identify me
You got the right one BAY-BEE!!
Shot me downtown
Threw me in a cell that's drivin me crazy
So they booked me
Walked me through the court door
Stripped me down
An gave me some drawls the next nigga wore
I'm in my pad makin phone calls
So I can post bail
Go home
An then put on my own drawls
Got in touch wit my nigga Yuk
What's up fool??!!
I got a quarter ounce hidden in the cut
Snatch it up
Get it off
Come an get me
Before I go back to court an they judge can get wit me
Cuz the D-A
Was talkin nonsense at my arraignment
An think she's still talkin the same shit
They try an keep me
Locked up fo a grip
An my public defender ain't sayin shit!!
The deal is zero to twenty-eight days
That shit is filthy!!
Now they got a nigga pleadin gulity
*(Chorus)*
I ain't did nuthin wrong
Why should I plead guilty??
They caught me wit no work
But they claim that we was filthy
I ain't did nuthin wrong
Why should I plead guilty??
They caught me wit no work
But they claim we doin dirt
Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*
It's like sixteen fiends get they welfare checks
No po-po a 4-0 an some bomb
An I'll be there when it comes to collect
No po-po a 4-0 an some bomb
Rolled up
Know what
Don't give a fuck what ya do
Grama thought I was a goodie two-shoes
But I was too true
Now fools holla out the window like Rapunzel
Give the caulk up, rock up, an chop up my bundle
So
Through the back pack
Gimme the crack sack
9 mill gat
An don't grind on any turf that I'm buildin scratch at
Jack pot
I spot a hundred a sixty-fifth fiends buyin cream
By the fifty grip but that's come tricky shit
It's tricky!!
They wanna get me, rigg me on the pavement
An Ripley's won't believe they had the nigga wit me on survailance
Bring heat, to meet two
But I can see through
The fake ass wanna be true like R2-D2
Bounce so I can start the Operation Stackola
Yukmouth, about
Wit a whole ounce of crackola
Stash the ounce
Grab a count
I holds down, nobody out, like... ok
By the window, then I threw my dope down
An frowned
That's when I looked suspicious
They bust a U-ey now I'm hurdlin fences like Olympics
Wit hella sweat on my forehead
Mo feds
Jumpin off the roof top
To lock my ass up like 2Pac
Captured
I see you in the bushes young bastard
Don't say shit
Come out before I blast ya!!
Ok, I quit!
Ahaha! Bob, check him,(I give up man), no dope on him, no man, well
You're still goin downtown potna!!

She’s Just a Freak,Operation Stackola,1995.0,"I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front
Verse 1:
Bitches be lovin' how I dick em
When I get them in the mood to fuck
They hold up all my nuts and lick em
They break me off cash flow
Any damn thing I ask for
So a nigga paid up the asshole
Some fools be thinking they gotta win her like Bruce Jinna
But Joe Tenner is letting every nigga run up in her
Most of the tricks I pick up
Like to get fucked
As a bitch is a bitch as a ho is a quick nut
Like this slut named Kim I knew
She fucked me, fucked him
And she fucked all of them too
So we worked the train on her
And left enough stains on her neck
Looking like a gold chain on her
No free high, the hoochie couldn't find two
Even though she popped that coochie like the hole from 2 Live Crew
So if you bump into this bitch on the streets
And you like the pussy deep, nigga speak
Because she's just a freak
I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Cause a bitch is a bitch as a ho is a quick nut
Verse 2:
I'll be rolling through your cup
Motherfuck, you whats up
Its that little nigga Yuck
And I don't give a fuck
Rolling through your neighborhood
Motherfucker, yo it's me
The capital N-U-C, K, L to the E
See this is for them hoes and the trick tramp sluts
All these stupid bitches on my motherfucking nuts
All up on my nuts cause a niggas getting richer
Didn't mean to hit ya, hope you get the picture
Back in 91' you was a little bit stuck up
Acting like you didn't have time for the fuck up
Trying to walk the halls wit that little switch
Trying to play that roll but you ain't nothing but a bitch
A bitch on my dick cause you hoes make me sick
Come and get a lick of the dicks do a trick
Caught you in the mix with a fix turning tricks
Fucking one nigga while you licking two dicks
She's a freak
I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front
I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Cause a bitch is a bitch as a ho is a quick nut
Verse 3:
My dick up, but hick up bitch
But don't stick up your nose
Cause you don't look shit like En Vogue
Hoes taxi around them gold ones
Acting like they don't fuck no one
Be the master like Sho Gun
At the hot tubs making a gang of waves
Ho in the cunt doing stunts like Super Dave
Ballas call her the human giraffe
No joke cause that ass be deep throating niggas on the quick fast
With no whiplash
You see me footing it but couldn't it be cool
Won't buy you assy food when we cruise, you lose
She give niggas blues like 505 don't ask why
I guess that stank bitch is a fall guy
You got no bucks, you can't fuck
We'll thats how I put it
C&H got that hole on tape, straight footage
The same bitch that wouldn't speak was on the TV screen
Sucking everybody mean
Because she's just a freak
I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front
I fucked you, you fucked me

If roses what I play, to get paid

But first give a nigga props
Fo ditchin cops

900 Blame a Nigga,Operation Stackola,1995.0,"(Chorus: 4x)
""Always trying to blame a god damn nigga
900 blame a nigga""
(Verse 1 - Numskull)
How can I get blamed for shit
That a nigga really didn't even do
One nigga did the dirt, but the blames on the whole crew
I feel like O.J. and Rodney
A little mayo, but still don't be having no happy days like Potsy
Nigga's get blamed for every thang
From robbin you house, to ho stroll's
And the tropicana cocaine
And if the sun turned black
{""Yup a nigga did it Jim""} OR
{""get him over here so I blame it on him""}
Nigga's getttin (??) like the oldies
Played the fuck out, we only known for stealin cars and drinkin 40's
Or showin your whole ass crack on cops
They quick to do a nigga on the routine stop
Chopped rock's, in a nigga possesion, a whole zip
Blame me cause I'm one of fo' grips
Now you can have mayo and a gang of triggers
But that ain't shit, cause they still going to blame a nigga
(Chorus plays over REDNECK talking)
Boy I tell ya Jim, one of those black niggers took
The battery outta my car last night
I didn't see it, but I know those niggers ways
(Numskull)
Driving down the block, and what did I see
A police man trying to gaffle me
Threw down my rocks, so I wouldn't get caught
A high-speed CHASE for fourty-eight blocks
(Verse 2 - Yukmouth)
I heard some shit was goin down though
It might be scanda-lous, on the down low
Plus I get around ho, like Shock and Mon'
Walking to the lot, forgot I got the gun
In the bushes, more mayo then the rest of the pushers
Tonight a nigga might be readin my Nike's like Bushwick
Chronic smoke like chimney, to lit a doobie
They knew me, let me in free cause I be that Luni
Higher then the police sky waves off the blue
I partied two or three hours now I'm sideways in the sukra
To the hoopsta's, survival is the be-under
But I was in it, now five-oh's on my bumper
Ready to dump the forty outie, and weed baggies
They had me searchin through my car, for what we have we here
A queer tryna frame a nigga, 
but shame on a nigga
That try to put the blame on a nigga
(Chorus plays over REDNECK talking)
Uh, hello, this is 900 blame a nigga?
Uh, my daughter's raped, and comin back from
A Ku Klux Clan meetin, and I know a nigga did it
(Yukmouth)
Last night was the night before
Twenty-four robber's came knocking at my door
I ran out, they ran in, trying to blast for my cash
With ski-masks on they're chin
(Verse 3 - Luniz)
Take a puff from my hamp then bounce
I'm on a mission for scrilla, vanilla slugs by my zipper
Playa haters trippin off ho's it seems that they plot
Snitch to the cops, and swear that I chopped O's of cream
WHO STOLE THE COOKIE OUT THE COOKIE JAR!
That's what they mumble
Now knowin about THE POWER OF NUMSKULL!
Now I done had it wit all that static
I'm thinkin I should load my automatic
And let all these faggots have it
(Yukmouth)
One love, it's cocked backed, and then I bust slugs
Roastin a motherfucker, so busta always suffer
Blood in the ghetto, other niggas try to run up
Wit they gun, and get done from sun down to sun up, punk
Dead bodies in the trunk, they kept on tellin the

As soon as I got out, had to pop out a nigga brains
I was the wrong nigga to frame

Wassup man, you all on my tape and shit

To make a buck I had to sell nuff drugs
Showed up, an rolled up, bubbled wit tough thugs that love to bust slugs
I had much love, from dope fiends
Plug 'em wit mo cream, my dangla
Used to sport Wranglers wit Pro Wings
Fa sho green-ery stacked up, that macked up
Quick to put the gat up an blast on niggas that act up
Snatched the scratch up, quick hit the back fence loc
I been broke, rollin through yo mutha fuckin hood in trench coats
Wit double barrels get yo narrow ass on the ground
I'm not play, I don't play though
I'm out to get yo pay roll
Say ho, you get yo monkey ass stomped wit the steel toe
Fucked in the game like a dildo
From the Vill ho
To the mutha fuckin Fil-Mo fo real though
None can get wit this sick wit it man slaughter
Practice lookin harder than 40 Water
Niggas all over claimin they foldin weight
I caught yo slippin, rippin that duct tape over yo face an off the
Golden Gate
Let go, I'm down to break jaws when I takes all's
Yo cash, blast that ass won't last fo one mo day like Nate Dog
Break laws
Leathal weapon like Danny
Slangin candy
Livin lavish about my cabbage understands me

Can't slang cream, can't lay low
Quick to pull licks for some paper to fold
It ain't me fuck gettin fronted

I see what you see, but you don't see what I see
Mill an zips come up the whole grip like Kadafi
20 years of age, waitin fo the say someone say cap me
A whole line of felonies on my rap sheet
Any means to make loot in the East Oakland Bay route
It's all about makin mail fuck bein cute (whoo)
That's the sound when it's time to lay down my hustle
Why there's so many bubbles, I choose to throw rocks like Barney Rubble
Can't lie back, wit a gang of top scratch
I gots to move on, an scoot on
Now mutha fucka can you buy that?
Lay low make no mistakes, make it successful
An if a nigga run up then make his chest full
I toss niggas that try to struggle off me
Cross me
A gang of jelousy because I'm saucy
It's not my fault that I grew to become a licksta
Instead I say moms meetin pops was a mix up
Pick up
Hennessy got my brain runnin quicka than I can think
Adrenaline pumpin about to faint
Ain't no shame
Can't be no 9 to 5 nigga
The ""O"" is where I'm from, so I gots to survive nigga

Can't slang cream, can't lay low

Nigga notice I'm broke wit a loaded four-fifth gat
The real nigga rolled an showed us where you hide yo doe an shit at
He did juss that, showed me where the kicks at
An big scratch told Knum to come nigga lets get that

Yuk pull over
Park the Nova
Tonight's the night, so I hope you write about the yola
I hold the Mag, lookin for the attack
Search the whole fuckin crib cuz I know he got scratch

Creep up the mutha fuckin stairs wit the ski mask
On the second floor in the drawer there should be cash
But we laugh
Cuz we see task cars right next door
But we poor, no budget fuck it, so kick down the door

Boom kick it once
Boom kick it twice
Three times it's breakin an have the fuckin building shakin
Make our way through the house nothin less nothin more
(where the kicks at??!!)
I think they in the third drawer

There's more
An that's a fa sho-sho I got the doe, now we up out the door
Before the neighbors call po-po
To the mobile, to count the real deal bank roll
In my sock, I rub daily cuz it's scratchin my ankle

It's morn-ing
We unleash to the streets
Wit 12 g's a piece
Headed straight to the East
Better recognize this game is bought to be sold
That's why I pull licks fo some paper to fold

Nah nah hold up homie) We takin over!
Gimme your girl, gimme your keys, to your four do' Explorer
Yo Lu-Nile, crack their composure
(We decompose your crowd) We layin down tighter than plaques
When I blast I wild like them two bitches from Baps

Yo, the Hong Kong Fooey, human tornado like Rudy
Turning your bomb-ba-zee into doobies
Platinum overseas like the Fugees, Japanese
Germany groupies, mooshi mooshi, sniffin lines
Off each other's booty love the Luniz
I went from smokin dubs to QP's
Make hits for thugs that bankin hoopies
And aimin uzis, at who dirty mackin my loochie
Come clost cock the toast and make you see Ghost-s like Whoopi
Have you ever seen a nigga get snatched up by his drawers
And wonder the cause, cuz big dope had his balls
Got small methamphetimes with colors to be Cray-ola
Took the drunkest O-A, and let the X take shit over
No need to get juiced cause it's the anti-depressant
Smile now but trip later, and put your hand out for the present
Lay down for fifteen, so your body can feel rest
Kick your feet up, and start makin beats on your chest and think

Two lay ya blunt, players with cream
If I die my spirit will jump inside machines
Runnin niggas over like Christine (sorry)
I mix the green with the last piece of hashish, ass-burning
Hoes in my black mink, your baby momma lovin my backseat
Freak nasty got me slappin the ass cheeks of Blackstreet
So high, I'm so high I feel like I'm wearin a disguise
Superman type of, with Kryptonite eyes
Not knowin I'm trippin, I walks out to my vehic'
Buckle up for safety on my way to get some cheap shit
I'm out the parkin lot, sideways on two wheels
Vision is double, trouble to me is bein real
Listen to my big block bill cause in the town that's a earful
Shares and mo' shares, swang if it's good

Now how I get dollars, I be the rap artist blue collar
School scholars on knowledge to move dollars
I do gotta motion chirp, like Impalas
For niggas who rock Timbs, Gortex, or new Walla's
You're facin, the Cochise of operation
And if you ain't tastin you should steady observations
Doctor/patient, leavin mics with laceratons
Love to stay bent with my doggs rollin adjacent (woof!)
And when they bark they turn your sunny days to dark
You play the back like Rosa Parks when the arc sparks
I bang rawly, do you orally
My horny sounds will pound more heavy than E-40

Bend your back like Long Isle Iced Teas with five liquors
Knew about the cheddar since I took my child picture

What is it when niggas heads gettin covered with blankets?
It's just a one-eight-seven on your motherfuckin crew
I'll have your brains doin donuts like you in a rental
Flip fools with credentials, nasty like havin sex with kinfolk
Blaze high, then smoke

Drunk-a-Lot, stays on top, that's why we roll
Two and two, four deep makes a crew
Red Yuk and Num with the sidekick Hennesey
Fuzzy, wuzza, fuzzy, little friend of me
Hitters on the payroll, secure because we practice
Pure ass-kick cures for who's acting drastic
Drank and buddha blast, callin shots on Motorolas
One step shy, so I'mma drank until it's over
Kick this for the fake Versace wearin fake Donna Karan Mossino
Players we know, ain't no gambino
Peons be watchin too much Casino, wannabe Nino Brown with the uzi
But clown you more like Downtown Judy

Girl,Caught Up (Music From the Motion Picture),1998,"Welcome
Little boys and girls, listen
A man can get caught up in things (Right)
It's like a gridlock (Right)
He gots ta have it (ugh ugh), his girl got his mind (ugh ugh)
Took over his whole body, he needs her (Speak on it)
He can't live without her (Ugh!), dig this
Her name was Lady Heroin, I think he met her at a Chevron
Late night stressin he caught his wife sexin with his cousin Stefan
He told his wife to get to step on
Before I start lettin loose on your skanless ass with the weap-on
Then since he's learnt, involved in a three year marriage
Arguin, fightin with his wife at night, arrested by sheriff
Embarrassed, handcuffed, go to jail in your drawers
And all of this because his wife tried to put the knife to his balls
And oh naw, cock the seat uhh, she tried to straight Lorraine Lee Bobbit me
I woke up out of a dream, she was on top of me
Screamin that's how it gotta be, holdin a dagger
I grabbed my gat, point it at her, she dropped the dagger, I slapped her
Months after he got out of jail, seriously hooked on girl
Lips chapped, face pale, body skinny and frail
Tales of a married man whose life was stressed too much
Had to resort to snortin drugs and such just to keep in touch
With himself, his wife suin for half of the wealth (uhh)
And all that shootin in his veins was gettin bad for his health
His cards was dealt, methamphetamines on the shelf
Smokin the creamery, the greatest thing the man ever felt
Now he's high, pull over on the bridge ???
Ready to die, he took his last swig of Reynell
A livin hell, he climbed on the rail then he yelled
""God all my life I failed"" as he slipped and fell, oh girl

Why'd you have to do me that way?
I love you til this day
Even stinks to think you're the one we used to stay
Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
I'll never give you up
Never seemed to act touchable, that was the start

She was a gangsta ass bitch, the greatest of all time
She took my heart and my mind, turned me to a life of crime
Now I'm, under pressure to impress her
I wake up, put on my bullet proof vestin
Grab my Smith & Wessin off the dresser
Then I, hop up in a chopped up rag Tre
When I, cross your path you're havin a bad day
Cos I, make the automatic mag spray
Gimme the cash, she taught me to get mine the fast way
I creep on ballers while they blaze joints
I'm snatchin caine boulders and jackin Range Rovers at gauge point
Under hypnosis, robbin the closest nigga
The diagnosis - psychosis, the cirrhosis is from doses of liquor
That I'm sippin by the picture, tryin to ditch ya
But when ever she get dug, the bitch'll be witcha for richer
Or poorer, through sickness and health
Eyewitness, if I shake this mistress I can handle business myself
But I love her so much I'm stuck in her clutches
I talk about her, can't walk without her, she's my crutches
She showed a young nigga how to check grip
Connectin me with the correct licks to collect chips
And if I leave her, no question I'm destined to hurt
And she's the reason half of the homies are restin in dirt
It's Crooked I next, I'll probably get dropped by some metal (some metal)
Just for comin around my girl (who?), the ghetto (my girl)


I'm curbside, and my girl sellin graciously
Never no worries, and if Task kick, we skeet and scurry
I'm posted up makin my squillion
My mind set - I don't stop til I get a million
But I'm seein baby momma's and grandpas gettin double
Legit, that ain't my problem cos I bubble
I always wonder why friends came back for mo' and mo'
The high was fantastic, smelt like plastic but it's dope
Scope the area before I made moves, losin gains
Was the up-and-downs in this so-called game but hey
Take the punches and blows, put aside, the crack babies
Dope fiend mommas and nasty hoes, peep
I'm walkin around the spot with a bundle in my mouth
Yay leakin through the plastic in drastic amounts
I'm feelin wide eyed, probably lookin like a tweaker
Spit the bundle in my palm, and tried to keep calm
My dove shrunk down, to tens, I'm high off crack
And damn, it didn't really feel bad
Started thinkin, this use to be a rich man high
I gotta high drug tolerance so I'll give it a try
Went home and did my thang, snatched a two hundred bundle for keeps
The shit was so good I was Pookie for two weeks
Luckily, I bounced back, but I stopped sellin cream
Now this is like one big dream, oh girl

I remember when we was hella broke dude
We just had a dream right?
We made it happen dude
Chorus:
Jus me and you
We made it, went from broke to havin' thangs
Jus me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game
Jus me and you
We made it, went from broke to havin' change
Jus me and you
Ohh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry bout a damn thang
Numbskull:
We used to be short on the avenue so broke
On the avenue I couldn't afford to have a brew
How it happened dude just me and you
I use to drink brew after you
You had your daughter first my baby son was born right after you
Now we making cash with Dru
Oh look what havin' cash would do
Playahatas come after you
If they blast at you
I'd be the first one to prove what the mass would do
One ain't better than havin' two
Looney individuals off cash and brew
Lace the avenues boy I ain't mad at you
Hindu drinkin glass with you, cheers
We lasted through years what we have to do
We finally here, I got 5 showed on the billboard live
Doin' songs with Too Short, courtesy of jive
Front page of the Vibe, live and direct
Rafael Saadiq freak that beat chorus and drumset
Make your ears wet like sex, who waitin to come next
With pavey rolex
Just me and you
Chorus
Yuckmouth:
We risked it and killed in cali before we make bread
Creating our heaven on earth but it's worse we cursed from birth
Now turn money and keepin moms happy got me gladly livin lavelle
I say we blessed to have mail
Big willie, I'm numb to the world baby
Don't speak among thangs unless it pays me
You never see yuckmouth weighin circumstances
You never see numbskull flossin takin chances
Advancement is okay doe and cheatin is alright
And it's best to have some killa's on the payroll, day and night
Stick and move pick and choose licks
Benet wasn't in it that's why Benet didn't benefit
Believe my story the tale of glory didn't make me believe
That in america I never had to worry
Cupid wasn't stupid but never was Numb and Yuck
It was all dreams and wishes, game and luck
Just me and you
Chorus
It was gonna happen man
First we got 5 on it
Now we got 5 on big beats
Rafael Saadiq, DJ Quik, G 1
That's how it happened man
Once you get large do your thang
Big thangs man
Numb:
Hey when you saw my show in '94
You didn't know we'd blow like Nitroclycerin
Girbaud, Tommy Hill, Timberland
Playboy I use to rock a pendelton, offecer arrests a gentleman
Now I'm spending big deusch marks on German women
In the red light district way out in Amsterdam kickin it
Adam and Eve coffee shop purchase grams wicked
Disappeared like the grand wizard dig it
Trying to be the richest young black brothas in the business
Yuck:
I heard so many times it was hopeless, bogus
Accordin to both of us the world was untouched we had to focus
I had to explain thangs to the fullest
Figured out what we could and couldn't
And made plans to get the puddin'
There's too many rules to made and broke
The mail is to be made so lets fade a toast
Now tell these folks to let me be all I can be
So the L-U-N-I-Z will go down is history

Do you need the strawberry booms to fuck
Cut up the tunes and bump
What up my name is Yukmouth
But that don't mean I eat the pussy hole and butt out
Or you could get the fuck out my vehic
Cause, eating your pussy I can't see it
A million other bitches I could be wit
Believe it, see it ain't allowed in the Lexo
Don't talk that way
I'll drop your ass half a block away from the ghetto
With the club via Freak Nasty
Debbie doesn't but drinking niggas bubble up Freak Nasty
Pass me that baggy of doe doe

Sit your asses
Look at mesmorizes eyes that twinkle
Bitches astounded by the Chinese and Peroneco
Hey you, hit the shower
Towels in the back, check it
And when you done bring your ass out here
Surround by sounds coming out the walls
My little freak nasty bitch start coming out her drawers
And all and all
She like to eat dick, a can of balls and her jaws
Go down the chimney with Santa Clause
Where's my bitch? Three plus one equals four
Naked motherfuckers, big orgies on the floor
Bitches knees sore, rug burns, broken lamp shades
What a party these tramps made

I Got Five on It (Aphrodite Original Dub Plate),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Creep on it, on it...
See I'm ridin' high, high...
Kinda broke it seem to y'all
So all I got is five, I got five

Playa, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it but it ain't enuff on it
Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s
Never the less I'm hella fresh rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like Ping Pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to get another stogie, fools all kick in like Shinobi
No, me ain't no homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' it at my friend hit-bit
Unless you pull out the phat crispy
Five dollar bill on the real, before it's history
Cause fools be havin' them vaccum lungs
An if you let 'em hit it for free You hella ""dum-du-dum-dum""
I come to school with the taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin' all the thick teasers, skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like ""Where tha bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a slurpy, the serious
Bomb will make a nigga go delirious
Like Eddie Murphy. I got more growin' pains than Maggie
Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie
I got five on it, got it good
Grab your 4-0, let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin' wit that Indo weed
I got five on it *got it good*
It's got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Potna, let's go half on a sac

I take sacks to the face whenever I can
Don't need no crutch, I'm so keyed up so the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bra
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no, you better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up, don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint, stop hittin', cause you know you got Asthma
Crack the 40 open, homie
And guzzle it, cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I failed, cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And everytime we with Chris that fool rollin' up a fattie
But the Tanqueray straight had me
I got five on it *got it good*
Grab your 4-0, let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin' wit that Indo weed
I got five on it *got it good*
It's got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it *got it good*
Potna, let's go half on a sac

Ay, make this right, man, stop at the light, man
My yesternight thang got me hung off the night train
You fade, I face, so let's head to da east
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two door Cutlass, same ole' bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk

Been smoked - Yuk'll spray ya, lay ya down
Up in the OAK the Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the ESO Drink the VSOP up
With a lemon squeezer
And everybody's rolled up, I'm da roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a buncha sticky dosia
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, cause where I be's, we needs half like Umfufu
I got five on it *got it good*
Grab your 4-0, let's get keyed

Girl, youse a lie, now who's them eyes?
Where did he get that big-ass hair-fro?
Lookin like a baby macks hair-drum, huh
Platinum, until my bread come
So she can try to sue me and do me
Like they did my man Num, my baby mamma
The typical groupie, she watch me go from
Squattin the hoopie, to clockin loochie and the prowl
I see woman livin me coochie like, catch (catch)
Go, go smoke-a-lot Rolex stretch in the crowd, grab a bitch, ey

To conceive a nigga baby and basically fuck up everything

I knew you was scandalous, man-less, but I took a chance though
Now every time a nigga get paid, I see your hands ho (ice that dough)
You stick the D.A. on me, and even worse than that
You got my little baby daughter thinkin daddy phony
But will she grow up; you tell her your faulty tales
When you took my essence, I check and spent all the mail
I was in jail, you told lies to my mum
Scooped the next nigga and sucked him at the prom
Now I'm, going to court for welfare-back payments
Because I didn't keep receipts and bank statements
I got the lead on ya, you only daddy's little girl
Because I think your daddy's sweet on ya

With little surprises in their bellies
They use it to buy Christelly Chanelle jellies
And ounces of smelly al-greenery, smokin out the whole scenery
My baby mamma, the craziest bra since my wife
At night, she the type to go sleep walkin with a knife
Like Jason Nikitcha, tryin to slit ya wrist and the bitch wit'cha
Did ya forget its been three years since I fucked wit'cha (bitch)
Quit fuckin' my high off
Quit showin up at shows askin for dough fuckin my life off
Listen my boss players' haters, let the playboy
Smoke-a-lot for nature, lace, modulate ya (hey)
Tie you shoes on these down-home blues
Out of all the woman I choose
Your baby mamma look like boo-bleh
I got some top notches I know you do to
But nine times out of ten your baby mamma look like boo-boo nigga

The Luniz and Too $hort everything has been squashed
Yeah we want everybody to know, that it's, you know
The Oaktown ain't about this
The media hypes up things when they're wrong
But doesn't give enough praise when everything is going good
We should just do a cut
Don't even mention no beef or nothing
Just drop it on 'em
You know it's politics, that made it sound like that
But it's all unified you see it's all Jesus
BITCH! BITCH! BITCH! BITCH! BITCH!
Man what's it all about?
Ain't about shit
Nigga call me up talking about man it's on
Your niggas fucking wit my niggas an it's on
Nigga what we fronting for?
If it ain't about this money
Ain't about this life an death nigga, shit
What's really going on?

Jumped all in a nigga's face front him on the spot
Don't cross the game unless ya wanna get shot
But who made the rules, do you recall?
Who's the judge when it comes to this street law?
Is it me? You? Or is it my crew?
My niggas get down, your niggas do too
Motherfuckers try to tell me don't fuck my life
Cause ain't nuthin' nice, ya gotta pay the price
You know them dudes, walking in them same shoes
It's brand new to you, but the game is used
I got it from them old niggas, they so cool
Now we just roll through, all the hoes know who
Ballin' in town, don't front, it's too little
Fake ass niggas get punked for your vittles
So what's it all about? Think about it later
To all you real gangsters, and all you perpetrators

You've got me funkin' (funkin')
Over nuthin' man (funkin mayne)
Why ya wanna funk with me?

(Speak on it boy!)

Uh
Sometimes you step in some shit you can't get out of
Niggas who talk hella shit is who I'm quick to sock the shit out of
Sniff powder, with all your hoes off my door
Got em froze like Poconos, you're spendin all your dough
On the average-ass, stanky ass, run a gank-ass
Fuck everybody fast, just an Oakland-ass hoe
Now I know why niggas wanna knock you out like Glass Joe
All that playa hatin' shit ain't asked for
You must got problems wit niggas makin they cash flow
You gaffled your motherfucking youngsters
So go with your old ass flow, I gots to have jaw-jacked hoe
Cuz some of niggas wonder why us playas do this
On the under, caught up in some shit I didn't have nuthin to do with
The truth is, you know my funk is through 
So ride for a nigga if that nigga ain't gonna do shit
You wanna be ass pimp
Getting your ass whipped is like an every year event, bitch
Dig it


I'm too motherfuckin much for myself
So funkin' with niggas close to home is somethin' else
If you ain't gonna blow a nigga head off, then that's the end it
Concentrate on makin' mail and start spendin
Now this is where my do it for myself begins
Cause in '97 I ain't makin no new mutha fuckin friends
Now I got no enemies, I hold no grudges
From now on I'm overseeing my own budget (For real!)
We all did our dirt nigga, but now that's all forgiven
Chris, you my nigga til the ending, and
I started wit Dru (me too!) I started with Yuk (Smoke-A-Lot)
You're all hangin with me, so I gives a fuck
Nummy-Num gone go ahead and drink his self to death
Nigga you wanna chop it up wit me, go through death yourself
I ain't tryin to hear nuthin', instead of throwin away skrillion, nigga
I'd rather be fuckin, uh


I signed my name on the dotted line, niggas know I did it first
But when you first, you know you get it worse
I suck the game up, I try to pass it on
Niggas from the Bay, gettin' they cash on
From Frisco, to Vallejo
To the Big O, fuck that yayo
Hundred thousand units make a nigga half a million dollars
If you sittin' on a grip, I have to holla at you later
You can get rich in a minute
Two words: Distribution, Independent
Make an accapella you can hear every word
I spit this game you never ever heard
You know how you be quick to pop niggas
These record companies be quick to rob niggas

Don't pay these youngsters and watch 'em get crazy


Fuck around and run up in your shit
Yeah, that's the new thing going baby

So get where you supposed to and, do
What you does, get your facial done baby
Do your physic well, no holdin jail over
Resent mail, no hoes with no clothes
Torn up and ripped apart
Domestic violence bitches want out battered and scared

Candy green polly dubbed nips lookin outrageous
Big pimpin and panderin, big boostin and gamblin
Everything is all good until police start manhandlin
Picture me grappled, scrappled, snatched up by yo asshole
Indicted on some chump charges that I didn't even ask for
Gettin hastled by wild boys, like gettin lassoed by cowboys
Any instructions given he put some more shit on like, now boy
Like I'm supposed to jump out my Nikes and start sweatin
Boss said anything, I'm makin the plan to start jettin off
Oo- ah dont look behind until my shoes stop
The only thing on my mind is losin you cop
Chorus
Verse 3
Someone's knockin at my door, oh, who could it be
Big baller with the sawed off choppin off all below your knees
I testify, not glorify, when I get high
Tell all that listen what I see through my blood shot eyes
My peers they die, why, over they set they ride on cheddar cheese
On they knees, how, one to the head behind them keys
I dip through, the town on a rocket ship sittin on twinkie
Smokin sticky, and breathin until my breathe get stinky
Pops that pinky, never could seem to get his shit together
Ran like DMC, left me livin thougher than leather, teenage eyes
Soakin up the streets like a sponge, drugs and guns
And freakin hoes seemed to be so fun, from the beginnin
I've been sittin tryin to be winnin, dissin bitches
Fuckin hoes, conversatin with women, workin out
Pimp ass nigga since my day of birth, its in my blood nigga
I'm gonna hustle till I leave this earth
Chorus
Verse 3
Nigga, it's in my blood to fuck around with these thugs
Straight villans, drug dealin, 38 snuff consume niggas buck pealin
I love millions, plus stackin them chips on up to the ceiling
Sittin on fat like banks, wit out no scratch and no dank
We gettin bank, to set it off like Jada Pinkett
In a major way, just witness, business flossin
Boss playas kickin champagne wishes before this rap business
Playas I went from rags to riches
To havin cash and bad ass bitches
Since day one, yo nigga been slangin that A-1 yola
Hit ups savings, for razor blades and bakin soda, paper
Chasin, usin 
V-12
 to swell up the cola, baby just shakin
Turnin the liquid form into bolas, I Chef like Raekwon
Those friends that wanna blaze
One come over, dropped the napalm, until you scream
Straight cream on up, coughin up they lungs they come back screamin
For more when it's over, slangin these head rhymes to young soldiers
These ??? known as hustlers, nigga

Damn

I'm tired of no good people poppin up on the scene
I'm talkin' about them ""buy-no"" bro's
Don't buy no Hamps, don't buy no liquor
Smoke yo whole bundle type ""buy-no"" folks
Be showin' up at yo door step
Got yo whole block hot
Takin' off they shoes like yo house is a sock hop

Show up again on the strip, you gettin' floor

I got problems of my own, what you all in my hair for?
I can't help you wit the pain you got, but I'm a tell you one mo'

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*
Ring the alarm!
Another dope fiends callin', haulin' ass to my door cuz I'm ballin'
All in my buildin', wakin' up grown folks children
Now they complainin' claimin' that I'm dope dealin'
I'm still in bed, four fifty-four in the mornin'
Me and my ho yawnin'
And there goes the bill on the noon, and yo it don't stop
He claimin' that he smoke rock, and better take yo ass to the dope spot
Fool I tote Glocks, and I'm the type that blasted
I closed the door, and so you know 5-0 went past it
I got my ass kicked, they said I looked suspicious
And all of the traffic got my black ass evicted
Inflicted by the drug clientel
They ask a lie in hell
But now I'm lyin' in a cell
Wit no bail like the Goodfellas
I'm gonna tell ya...

Never ever Ring My Bell!
But you can give me a page
Do not Ring My Bell!

No, don't you ring it!
Verse 3 *(Numskull)*
Man, why ya'll still knockin'!?

Now I think ya'll plottin'
Tryin' to case my house
Scopin' out my cabbage (it's cool!)
I should start shootin' folks in the ass hole
Cuz I'd a told 'em before, but they still come at will
So now this time, I think that some blood should spill
It ain't juss dudes it's hoes too
My house ain't the spot!
Smellin' up my crib wit yo dirty ass cock
My broad findin' out is what I'm fearin'
Showin' up wit out notice, leavin' photos and earings
People knockin at my door, it ain't me it's different strokes
So you can go on, leave and get yo Note

So you can hit me on my pager
Keep comin' and I'm a mow ya

Handcu-u-u-ff your hoes

This rap here goes to all you player haters
Hand cuff your hoes, that goes to all you Captain Save-Hers
Me, my major industries gold teeth and diamonds
Been grindin' for nine and half years now I'm rhymin'
Reclinin' meal tickets couldn't be lookin' me in the eye
I'm sigh now, clown that ass like Saturday Night Live (WHHHYYYY!)
Because I'm all between they wife's thighs
But all jokes aside I yoke the ride and roll the weed up at the same time
While I drive I cross my heart and hope to die
Hella high, it's the mobb blowin' greenery till we die
So haters do me a favor, handcuff your briide
I creep through when your husband's at the job
Many hunners got players, baby mammas feedin' me all kinds
Of hibachi shrimp and I don't even rock Versacci pimpin dudes
But when I'm through, you never knew I touched her
Got her screamin loud as hell like Chris Tucker (aaaaah!)
Handcuff your hoes
(The Luniz)
When I step in the house (niggas snatch they hoes up quickly)
Niggas start breakin' out (cause they all wanna get with me)
Cause they know they hoes ain't faithful (and my eyes is on them all)
And I'll snatch them if I'm able (hey, put this lighter on the balls)
Olly-olly-oxenfree, don't hesitate to give your hoes to me
(Numskull)
Uh, I'm used to stabbin' top notch and border coochies
Just big booty, firm casabas, preferably groupies (WITH BIG THIIIGHS!)
Makin' em ride they self up the wall easy
Off the expecting them, feel breezy
Do me a favor, take your hoes (HOME)
Before you find your breezy (GONE)
It'll be for life, only players when I'm beerin' at
I want the better things in life
Nice, he ain't hearin' that
I ain't the nigga to be buyin' bitches clothes
They know that and still keep
So handcuff your hoes (handcuff your hoes)
(Chorus: The Luniz)
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcu-u-u-ff your hoes (your hoes)

Hey Mrs. Big Butt (why you always cry?)
She fight all the time (Oh my, my, my)
He's been cheatin' on you, but don't worry, please dry your eyes
Just take a ride with smoke-a-lot, the master of high
(HOW HIIGGH!), high enough to kiss the sky, on the real
I wonder why beautiful girls date fat guys
He must got his cape on tight, oh look up in the sky
(WHHHYYY!), now that's a Captain Save-Her fo' sure
Me being like that no, no, no, no, no
I know some hoes don't want to be a dumb-dummy
But don't play around and disrespect my money
Like a gun I'll take you away
And if you niggas act a fool, I'll spray you with the AK
Just let me take the ho (and go peacefully)
Let me skip into the sunset (like tweed-de-lee-de-lee)
I like to come and so do you
If you can take one nut then you can take two
And it's true, we likes to party (TO PARTY!)
We likes to party

Uh, she started tuggin, an rubbin on the Swoop
I'm wastin my drink swervin in my rag 6-duce
Uh, you didn't know I keep it real from head to toe
I hit that savings and loans when I was just a baby loc
Went to Mexico, traded it for the pecos
Came back to California now it's time to roll
I was 16 mane, sellin quarter keys of dank
My uncle was a balla from around the way
So I had the hook up
Whole keys I cooked up
Now all my niggas, makin major figgaz
Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*
Mobb shit, the type of shit you out committin a lick
Pistol whip them nigga to death and have a kick

Mission accomplished boss crack
Hard or soft livin boys and girls packin yo shit
Let it off
Niggas who floss out here be takin a loss
It cost to be the mutha fuckin Boss Playa
Talks to throw away gats in the air
For makin yo scratch like that there Boss Playa
Niggas beware
The ganga-gangsta type of Luni hoolum atmosphere
Fo rappin about the clothes you wear, I represent welfare
No happy-happy, joy-joy

Runnin from decoys, pimpin mo bitches than Dr. Detroit

Back in the days, when I was raised
Niggas got sprayed wit A's and K's

Bash 'em other sucka, likely struck wit G's

Hot traces, suicide so you really can't fuck this
Bringin mo heat than Rapper Bernard
Lookin, micro woof tickets, bout how much to kick it that nigga hard
Oh, from a sucka
Fo them niggas that press they luck there
In a game fucka
Paralyzed caught one in the ass, punk ass
Couped up in an send 'em, an jive

An it best be a bounce off Mista, Mista
Hit ya, get ya, split ya
That's how we shit ya
Verse 5 *(Cydal)*
Parafanalia to some Mobb members unpredicable
Niggas get dropped, we call the shots, smashed on sumpthin pitifull

Guess what you in for
You bout to find out

You don't know, you seen a nigga jumpin through yo window

Jump in the get away ride and hit the corner

Grew up around dirt an dope, an jelous
Evil tactics
To shovel up caskets, and double barrell
Shotty blasted

And cross the game it ain't the thang
Swoop G plus two G's will make them niggas for you to hang
An try to be cool when Mobbin on them niggas as we reign

When we sip
We laid out, to drip-drip dry

Through the Town doin high-bys
When the yak hit my face it's like a hamburger kill
We'll be real
What's the deal
Uh, uh, searchin fo skrill, up here!

We mess with phillies we roll big phillies

Surpress the brown bitch up in the Crown Vic's
Spread her legs and put the greenery lips around it
Gets around it while niggas quit (woah!)
This bitch look better than Whitney, lick her titties
Cause niggas say the pussy be the stick-icky
One puff'll turn your brain cells to dust
Head rush, bound to fill your eyes up with the redness
Suck her up, but there's a million bitches just like her
Even dykes try to fuck her in the cypher with the lighter
Puttin' the dick on the ass an', everybody cashin, blackin
Latino motherfuckers know they be mashin
Nigga like whas' happenin'?
You can keep them sassy the dickey used to
Nicky Bone to top to dump the hash in
My partners they be askin' Mr. Y-U-K
Why you stay high off the hash and be smashin'?
With a hundred gun and a hundred clip
To the sto', they get phillies
To we get blunted as we wanna get


I takes my gat with a phillie I don't need no quote
Now boss player this is how I like to blow my smoke
I grab the phillie cut the throat, jump to the back
Of a building, top player, makin' a little bits with a cup up of spit
It makes me sick and upset when it's spit and silly
Whenever you phillie, its all spitty and wet
It doesn't matter, rich or po', I couldn't care less bro
It makes me not wanna let the motherfucker smoke no more
I shake the bud mary-tramps
The one that tried to suck the weed up the fifth
Without givin' up no cocker food stamps
I know they want it, but smokin' for free, I don't condone it
Don't put your crusty lips on it if you ain't got no chips on it
I spent a grip on it, and girl, the cuffs out here
And if you floss out here, you take a loss out here
You're doin' too much standing in the cypher wit'cha
Lighter, tryin' to flick your big
If you ain't got no skits, you can't get shit


How many blunts do you blow on the daily
Many money I blow many, many, many
I smoke plenty (well, won't your black ass quit being stingy)
I'm not greedy (well, where's that weed fiend?)
(You better quit smokin' those beadys in my fo' hun)
(Blow one for the po-one)
(Nigga, don't you owe one?) (Act like ya know one)
No one does it better, break it down with my thumbs
(Fuck the zigzags, and stack your lungs, make the blunt)
But no fund, no gas money
(Well, even if a dummy has money)
(There'll be a dumber dummy to spend his last money)
My blunt is my keeper like cash money
Flash money, stash money, the last money was considered
Bombs, stick, green grass money
Roll, but next time, I'mma put a little to the side (hash money)

Hey nigga I started smellin' weed and hella weed
Then I started sellin' weed
Bitch be tellin' me, they wanna smoke
To catch Mozik than a spellin' bee
Cause I smoke they ass under the table
The hoes stable, pass me that cigarette or phillie

I got that feelin' again, let's smoke that acrylin'
Again, I said you willin' again, then we can walk the Poppa-ceiling again
I storms in like a mighty blast of wind
Inhale, exhale, the phillies rule my dome an' (Aaahhh!) (*Cough*)
(High powered shit, tell that nigga down the road to roll the shit up man)
(Man y'all niggas need to quit this shit)
(Nigga, you used to smoke too, more than me here, hit this shit)
(Man, you already know do')

Fuck around and smoke the sprayed up
Nigga be laid up, walk around like zombies, minds never made up
Smellin' like ass hemp's and grine, cocky mouth
Chap lips, fuckin' off all the poo-nanny
If y'all gonna smoke I'll be the designated weed roller
Call me Numboy, the motherfuckin' seed roller
But you gotta crack the window though
Cause me and the lads like Whoopi Goldberg in centerfolds
Drink-a-lot never like to think-a-lot
Nigga I don't smoke no more cause I don't like the stank-a-lot

Fuck, how you gonna say that shit nigga if you be smokin' cigarettes (fuck y'all)

I think it was Friday night, I met her at the club
Apple Martini-ed up, smokin bud with my thugs
Then yo yo, there she was, très bon booty ( *French* )
Like Beyoncé no fiancé, let's keep in touch
I wanted to beat it up, cause she was a superbad
I mean with all that ass, same night hit it that fast
We at her mega pad, still diggin like a sav'
We poppin x tabs, the head was extra lav'
But this her baby dad and he don't live with her
And at his grandma's pad they left the kids with her
So that explains the pictures I see of this nigga
She says she's low on scrilla, she wanted gifts for her
So she can get her nails done and get her weave fixed
And I can't stand no nappy hair bitch
And so I break off bread, nothin but pocket change
She blew my socks again and then I hopped in the Range
And then she kept on askin for bread, like everyday
""My children need some aspirine, I got some bills to day""
Now what am I to say, cause Yuk, he love the kids
Puffy sell millions, but Yuk, he love the kids
So I broke off bread, I did it for the kids
Never trust a bitch, never think Yuk a trick
I got the slut dismissed, she got the dismissal
I ain't fuckin with you, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Time after time, rhyme after rhyme
I look around, some hoe after mine
But I'm just steady on the low, steady 'bout my flow
Why try to keep a hoe steady when they be steady wantin mo'?
I don't want no hoe all on my back, all up in my sack
Before I burn one, at every corner that I turn on
Hoe, get a life ( ? ) boppin all night like you a nigga
Need to be at home with yo damn children
Like that shit was cool, well ain't shit cool
About your children missin school
Because you done cut a fool at the club last night
And you ain't ( ? ) six
Ran into a couple of ballers cappin like you broke them tricks
But them tricks make cheese, they pop bottles for fun
And you'll fuck one just to say you fucked one
How dumb can one get, didn't even break bread to get with you
And walkin round like you the fuckin shit, bitch, you got too many issues


Bitch, you get rotated through every crew like a tire from BF Goodridge
Cause you 21 now, what, you actin like a good bitch?
I'm tryin to get my nigga sucked cause he from outta town
You just suck his dick while I weigh out the pounds and then you out
What you mean you don't know, don't you need a little bread?
You can feed a starvin child for just a little bit of head
You suck a broke nigga dick but won't suck a rich nigga
He a white boy, little man, limp dick nigga
Three minutes and you gone, then I hit you at your home
Give you a little for your pocket, now your weekend is on
I don't understand, huh? Then why the fuck I'm talkin?
Matter fact I'm wastin time, huh, bitch, get to walkin
You try to help a rat bitch, she'll diss you on some wack shit
You weigh 125, how you still lookin fat, bitch?
Save them cheap ( ? ) yeah, I'm tryin to diss you
You a broke-ass, think-you-bad bitch and you got too many issues


Nigga, fuck yo broke ass
You ain't got no muthafuckin money anyway, nigga
Don't come over here talkin about I got issues
You got issues
Nigga, you rollin on stop
So don't even try to come over here
Either you pay me or don't pay me no muthafuckin attention
So ehm that's all this about over here
When you look my way I already know you gots to pay
All this issue shit, you can take that shit to the next bitch
I ain't the one, nigga
Please
Please believe it
Fuck that
Pay me
Yeah I got issues, so what?
I'm tryin to get fly, youknowmsayin
I'm tryin to go to the Century Club
I need $100 on my hair
I need uh 50 to go the nail shop
I need 200 for that new Iceberg make-up
So uh, what you workin with?

Live and direct! Yay Area, they carry a 4-5 and a Tec
When they bury ya, they pissing on the side of your grave
No witnesses but a buckshot from inside of the gauge
(11 o'clock News!)

""Watch your own back, son"" my dad always told me
But that wasn't in my mind while the electrical gate closing slowly
I was thinking about my pussy upstairs, waiting patiently
Not knowing that it's two niggas outside with Tecs casing me
Before I know it, the barrel's facing me, I'm deadlocked
The pistol in my rib cage, neck is in a headlock
I kept the fuck quiet so I could peep these niggas identity
It might could be some crew, they might just be some kins of me
One shot to the cranium, my mind's kinda wonderous
I've been flossin' too much, it's about time I got some of this
Hardcore haterism, my time was up
One nigga called me by name I'm like ""What the fuck?""
Stuck my head up, I heard a car in the garage
And that's when the whole fucking scene had to pause
I thank God 'cause whoever it was saved my fucking life
I caught eye contact, aw shit, it's my wife
The nigga who had his hands free went straight for my honey
So I knew this robbery wasn't for no motherfucking money
They took my pretty out of the car and put me in it
Drove off and that's when I knew a nigga was finished
They put me in the trunk of my own shit
Smashed off, twelves bumpin'
My girl screaming but can't do nothing
We drove for like 20 minutes, and once we stopped
They took me outta the trunk by an old ass barber shop
And asked me: ""Who could we call to get some cash?
And if you don't do it quick then your punk ass won't last!""
I dialed 6-6-7-6-7-6-7, 1-2-3, 4-1-1, 9-11
I got my ass whipped while we was waiting for the call
Kicked in my head and stomped on my balls
I just couldn't take no mo' and stopped moving
I couldn't feel nothing, my whole shit was ruined
They threw me in the back of the trunk where I slept the whole day
'Til I got enough strength to kick the seat away
Drove myself home, laid out on the couch
Drunk a whole fifth, a nigga passed out",https://genius.com/Luniz-11-oclock-news-bonus-track-lyrics

Y Do Thugs Die?,Lunitik Muzik,1997.0,"Thugs die, why me?
Verse 1
Numskull:
All eyes on me, so that means all eyes against me
Simply cuz I may do in this world what God sent me
If I said that I was gonna die
Would I be tellin' the truth would I be lyin'
Would I be chillin' in heaven or hell fryin'
Do thugs go to heaven even though we bettin' big
Loot, makin green an lovin' hootchie prostitutes
Jewels an big high rollin to the big part
Of two main thugs who got plugged with slugs but had so much love
Until tha paraphernalia, you can't floss or make mill
One fellow dies in his click then it's all hell
Big Poppa took hot ones 2Pacalypse took hot ones
Now, between east and west there's problems
It's true cuz who knows when you gonna die, who
Knows when and where, who knows tha reason why
Who goes and who stays who pause in these days
Who paves the roads ways
Who makes bread and who plays
Not rollin' not doin' what you love (uh-uh) an when I die
I wanna die in this business as a thug
So I ask you, why?
Chorus:
Why do thugs die, makes you wanna cry
Why do thugs die, cuz it's insane
Why do thugs die, makes you wanna cry
Why do thugs die, cuz it's insane
Verse 2
Yukmouth:
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh, uh
Sometimes I wanna pray, sometimes I wanna say somethin'
To God cuz only God can solve the problems of today
Get on my knees and pray, I cry and say
If I die today please take my soul away
Make a brighter day for Lil ???, that be my son
So many people with money fall victim of the gun
For tryin' ta rock your rhymes like ??? caught two in the lungs
Wanted to get me, dear lord forgive me, I didn't
Wanna die this quickly
God the most expert hitman on earth to get me
Had plans to have tha inner city killin' each other
First Pac now Biggie, what really goes on
Lets hold on, like En Vogue, cuz when them devils want you gone
You gone, tombstones and funeral
Homes keep yo game strong
My little homie got his brains blown (POW!)
Ready to get yo whobang on, C an Rappin' Ron I miss ya
Dudes, how many brothers must we lose
Before we hit tha ballers fued
It's only hurtin' me and you
Cuz they tryin' to shut down our music that we use
Dont be confused, these ??? folks to us
Control the industry, got us programmed like New York is the enemy
Man look what they did to Kennedy
Why, why, why me, why me, why do thugs die playa
Chours
Verse 3
Numskull:
1, 2, 3 years of struggle, huddles and plans
Can't amount to millions bubble
That's why we keep stacks tucked and cuddled
I praise any human makin' loot by the truck loads
My motto stay clean like pimps in El Dorado
Or any real playa makin' ripples in the pond
Got hustles for days, kinda makes me think of mine
And by the time I'm 30 I wanna own them things
In your ear (what) bubble for 20
Years if the world is still here
Yukmouth:
Uh-huh, huh, playboy, it seems like everybody with bread
Get indicted by the feds
And family members end up dead, REDRUM
I used to read psalms and go to church to be an usher
Then of course the terms they got worser
Everyday is a different murder, so many
Funerals and waits, pour out liquor smoke blunts
In the face when thugs die, you can't stop cryin
Cuz I lost my momma then my father in `95, I ask the lord why
Why thugs die, why do thugs die
It's like that there playboys
Watch your back cuz it's goin' down man
This goin' out to all the fallen soldiers
Who died in the line of duty, you know what I'm sayin
My playboy 2Pac, rest in peace
My playboy, Biggie Smalls, one love rest in peace
To all the other soldiers, everybody who lost somebody
You know (world wide)
Reminisce, lets do this, pour out some liquor
Smoke some blunts with your folks
They lookin' down on us proud
There is a heaven for a G playboy, that's real

I had a brand new jeep and we was rollin
Told her it was mine, but that shit was really stolen
She asked me to shoot her to the crib, so I did
Walked to the house and the bitch had about 12 kids(small world!)
Hangin on my brand new Girbaud's
What's wrong wit my nose, I got a shit stain on my clothes
Look down and say a little BeBe
And felt like bootin that little nigga
'Cross the room like I was Pay-Lay
That's how they get you to the crib
You did couldn't pass off the chance, cause that ass was hella big!
And she was walkin and that fat ass was swingin
I'm thinkin about bangin her, somebody kept ringing her
The phone was ringing every twenty seconds
And I'm still gettin bothered by these dirty adolecent's
Spillin hella kool-aid on my K-Swiss
Hey bitch are you finished?
Grab this bottle, and poured hella drank in it
He was drunk, so the other kids jumped on
Mama grabbed the high hell, and straight clumped em
I still fucked, but it took a little drank though
And I bet I still fuck a stank ho

Why, bother?
I'm bombed out like Pearl Harbor
For??? sex I cut em loose like a Barbara Beef Cake
The cheapskate, never got swundeld for a bundle
Bitches got weaves on, hair long like Rapunzle
I crumble, a phone number, but I stills bury bozack
Rollin in dough like Pillsbury
I don't carry a pull out, just my pager
But I'll pull out major, Black got more sacks then Lawrence Taylor
Captain Save A...Ho's stashes loot on the low tip
To get the boots, he buys this bitch a Girbaud fit

Yuk got cabbage, I clothesline a bitch line Randy Savage

I'm wastin my drink swervin in my rag 6-duce
Uh, you didn't know I keep it real from head to toe
I hit that savings and loans when I was just a baby loc
Went to Mexico, traded it for the pecos
Came back to California now it's time to roll
I was 16 mane, sellin quarter keys of dank
My uncle was a balla from around the way
So I had the hook up
Whole keys I cooked up
Now all my niggas, makin major figgaz

Mobb shit, the type of shit you out committin a lick
Pistol whip them nigga to death and have a kick
And the twist cuz niggas be havin shit
Like bitches on Set It Off, dank
Niggas be sniffin dark bank
Mission accomplished boss crack
Hard or soft livin boys and girls packin yo shit
Let it off

It cost to be the mutha fuckin Boss Playa
Talks to throw away gats in the air
For makin yo scratch like that there Boss Playa

Fo rappin about the clothes you wear, I represent welfare

Area smoke greenery malacious all day
Eh, eh blaze

Back in the days, when I was raised
Niggas got sprayed wit A's and K's
I prayed to my Lord that head won't take
Me over, we soldiers to fold ya like Motorola's
And hit the corners
I told ya the 4-4 flow will fuck yo face and leave you frozen
Bitch you was chosen
That's how it's goin the Mobb fa sho-ness
Mo killaz and shady niggas to keep the click-ulation flawless
Fuck all that other
Bury yo brother
Leave yo family mad at the fact the Mobb took me under

Bash 'em other sucka, likely struck wit G's
For tryin to brace
Cough drops laced and you'll be laid out stunned by zae's
Place the cover in a maced
ATF lookin for this arsonist, lettin off conscience
Hot traces, suicide so you really can't fuck this
Bringin mo heat than Rapper Bernard
Lookin, micro woof tickets, bout how much to kick it that nigga hard
Oh, from a sucka
Fo them niggas that press they luck there
In a game fucka
Paralyzed caught one in the ass, punk ass
Couped up in an send 'em, an jive
Make niggas remember the Mobb
Them other niggas ain't no kiddin 'em
An it best be a bounce off Mista, Mista
Hit ya, get ya, split ya
That's how we shit ya

Parafanalia to some Mobb members unpredicable
Niggas get dropped, we call the shots, smashed on sumpthin pitifull

But that was the first three to have kicked in good
Hey, I wanna eat your pussy

Now coke, that's a whole different story
I met a bitch so fine, she said she had something fo me (that white liiines)
She knew I was with it, and she didn't even know me
She put out a line and told me do it and chill
Rolled up a dolla, said bitch give me a 100 dolla bill
Damn, I'm broke but that don't mean my standards is low
I still feel like a king even though my bank is low
(is that yo sniiiff)
Ey bitch don't give me none, if you can't give me mo
For the first time doin it, game is charged
For the first five hours, I couldn't get hard
I'm now and I'm like talkin to Chuck
Like, c'mon man, please wake the fuck up!
Pulled myself together, layed down on the ground
Fantasize for a minute, now I'm ready to get down


Shrooms, shrooms, I just take that as a whole
The first time I did it with A-Plus from the Souls (of Mischief)
He boiled a pot of water, put the mushrooms in it
Put the top on it and let that shit boil for a minute
Added teabags to the pot, we doin it now
Added some orange juice to the pink pop to cool it down
I got a nice big cup, cuz I love gettin loaded
Duzzle get down, aw shit, hold it
What do it do?
Man I didn't even ask
You prolly gave me some shit that's gone have me on my ass
He said wave your hand Num in front of your face

I’m in that blue and gold in The Town with a 30 reppin’ Curry
It’s a Looney on the team and he got 5 on his jersey
The three’s so purty, we lead so early
‘Cause Green making ‘em miss like we miss Furly
We blow ‘em out with this Pachulia plant here
You in the Oracle, stop thinking Durant Square
You come to Oakland, you get surrounded by the Bay (Come on)
(Vallejo! Frisco! San Jose!)
You might get iggy for your dala’s in the Hay’
Have you hot off the bench, livin’ stunnas (I should say)
And you might get a shot off, but droppin’ when it’s nonsense
But we will, ‘cause we shootin’ collection of Klay Thompsons
When you visit, never forget that you a guest
Thinking you Goliath when David’s in the West
On the court or the streets, in the paint or on the corner
(Splash) You surrounded by water—you in California

K.D. and Draymond going mad house
Sixth man, can’t nobody quiet our fans down
Cannot hear your phone, can’t hear the person sitting next to you
Four All-Stars, oh yeah, that’s what the best’ll do
West’ll do, three after three, I know it’s stressing you
Oh my God, yes Lord, God keep blessing you
Somebody tell Shaq he better quit that hatin’ stuff
‘Cause TNT gotta come to Oakland, they be waitin’, bruh
And we don’t play around in the Bay and that’s a fact
Check the stats, anybody runnin’ up, they getting smacked
Lambo, we push the playoffs mid-February
They say that the Cavs ‘bout to beat us, boy, we never worried
Yes, it’s forever Curry, drip man, Splash King, cheat us just to beat us
Ask LeBron, he the Ak’ king—Warriors, we the best

Swish, where they palms, game on
Added Kev Durant to the camp, we get our trey on
Catch me posted at the Oracle
Next to Mistah F.A.B. with a fresh Starter Warrior coat
Whippin’ up coke, they call me Steph Curry
Bake ya boys, ain’t gon’ tell the ref hurry
Burr—ya boy colder than a McFlurry
Blue and yellow jersey with the quick hurry
My nigga Num, we got another one
Still got 5 on it, let’s slide another one
We gon’ ride the wave until the summer done
Fresh Steph Curry, shout out to Under Arm’
Three rings, another championship

Jus me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game
Jus me and you
We made it, went from broke to havin' change
Jus me and you
Ohh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry bout a damn thang

We used to be short on the avenue so broke
On the avenue I couldn't afford to have a brew
How it happened dude just me and you
I use to drink brew after you
You had your daughter first my baby son was born right after you
Now we making cash with Dru
Oh look what havin' cash would do
Playahatas come after you
If they blast at you
I'd be the first one to prove what the mass would do
One ain't better than havin' two
Looney individuals off cash and brew
Lace the avenues boy I ain't mad at you
Hindu drinkin glass with you, cheers
We lasted through years what we have to do
We finally here, I got 5 showed on the billboard live
Doin' songs with Too Short, courtesy of jive

Make your ears wet like sex, who waitin to come next

We risked it and killed in cali before we make bread
Creating our heaven on earth but it's worse we cursed from birth
Now turn money and keepin moms happy got me gladly livin lavelle
I say we blessed to have mail

Don't speak among thangs unless it pays me
You never see yuckmouth weighin circumstances
You never see numbskull flossin takin chances
Advancement is okay doe and cheatin is alright
And it's best to have some killa's on the payroll, day and night
Stick and move pick and choose licks
Benet wasn't in it that's why Benet didn't benefit
Believe my story the tale of glory didn't make me believe
That in america I never had to worry
Cupid wasn't stupid but never was Numb and Yuck

Figured out what we could and couldn't

See I'm ridin' high (Whoa)
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got's five, I got five

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty and when it comes to
Getting another stogie, fools all kick in like
Shinobi. No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit it
Bit unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy
I got more growing pains than Maggie
‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it, messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it (Got it, good), it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the
Face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

I been smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down up in the O-A-K
The Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu
