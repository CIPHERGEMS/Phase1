Gettin' faded with some bitches from the West Side

Fuck a nigga co-sign
Always change my number and my phone line
Baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib

Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'

This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous

Talkin' commas, how much you need and all that shit

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was ""what's the hold up?""
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?

We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you

You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me

I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed

Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers

Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it

Fucked my white girl, she said, ""Nigga, please""
Fuck that white girl, she said, ""Nigga, please""

I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably

Thought It Was a Drought,DS2,2015.0,"Dirty soda, Spike Lee
White girl, Ice T
Fully loaded AP, yeah

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, ""Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you

Your crack house doin' numbers then you blessed
You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug
A few bean pies stashed in the trunk
Shoot dice all day and sell dust
You loaded up, they talkin' shit, you gone bust
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut

He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?

Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me

Go'n fuck that nigga, get it over with

'Cause I wanna be in your head tonight

You can take my love and hide it
Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You goin' out the country
You posting up on IG
I'm laid up with my sidepiece

Tell me that the pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me you moving on and you don't love me no more

I know you tryna play around like I ain't got soldiers
Big cup of syrup washing down all my doja
Wearing Louis loafers like they old penny loafers
Started off local got the cribs bi-coastal
I don't want no words with you 'cause you mad bogus

And if I get her number, you know I can’t wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight

Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it

And run to the stage

Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
This bitch exotic than a motherfucker
These bitches  do anything for me

I think fifty-six nights crazy

I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I took fifty-six bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand, man this shit real crazy

I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation",https://genius.com/Future-56-nights-lyrics

Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with your freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on

Got my Chi niggas on the horn

Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you

Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, and squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, and squeeze the trigger

I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Thinkin' about that cash like it's fast food
I'm thinkin' about this cash like it's fast food
I'm payin' all my tithes, receivin' bad news
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I know this cash rules
Everything around me turn to fast food
Standin' in the cold, I ain't got no blanket
These hoes always gettin' exposed, ain't got home trainin'
And when I push up in that Rolls and I'm still drankin'
Went from standin' over stoves to the tour bus
Stayed down, ten toes, board the G5
So much yellow gold on me like a beehive
Started rockin' Balmain's like they Levi's
Over time, the booth is like a gold mine
I served in Alabama like Roll Tide

When I whip that Bimmer, can't you picture me rollin'?
Fuck you pussy niggas, ain't no sympathy
Niggas tellin' lies, they so feminine
I be sellin' pies, chasin' M&M's
Fuck a 9 to 5, get it out the gym
Push illegal weight, we call it out the gym
Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin', do right, feel like I waited a lifetime
Weigh up both sides 'cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dog
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car a push start
I'm from the apartments, my crib big like Wal-Mart

I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'

That get it and niggas who strive

My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin, you heard?

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe

Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, ""They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one""
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody, they took my life away

People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode

I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody to smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealin' with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we gettin' back to the paper
Gettin' back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hatin'
I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno

And I ain't worried 'bout nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby, gotta go on tour (fuck that shit)

Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give 'em what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the cut, they just know me from rhymin'
My hard work finally catchin' up with perfect timin'

You know what I'm saying
I could take a hundred dollar slab
And goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?

Everything in the streets
It prepared me for everything that I'm going through right now

My Collection,HNDRXX,2017.0,"I've been in the stu late, workin', no residuals
If we never speak again, I'm just glad I got to tell the truth
I ain't done countin'
You wanna come to paradise?
Matter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?
Haha

She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
I used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child
All these cameras on, fuckin' with my mood, wild
And these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud
They know damn well this wasn't promised
I know damn well this must be karma
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left 80 racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know
But at the same time, I like to vibe with one
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
And I had to 'splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
Had to send this one freak on the last flight

Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection

Standin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock
Icin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock
Yeah, maybe it's the drop, yeah
We get in our feelings, yeah
I don't know how you would feel about if I ain't have millions, yeah
I'm conversin' with you, I hope you hear me, yeah
Keep my promise, take my love with you everywhere
And hell no it ain't about no braggin' rights
But even if it was, shit I got it
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
I'ma keep it genuine and tell the truth to you
I got this jawn, she know what to do with me
And right now I don't know what to do with you
I don't wanna sound like I'm bein' rude with you
She caught a red eye, leavin' L.A
I shoulda gave her to the valet
And I had to tell her 'bout Miami
After she came with no panty

Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'

When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter and the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose

Never gon' lose 'cause these bitches gon' choose
These bitches gon' be who they is
Walkin' and talkin' like classy
You a ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be workin' that boy, I'ma pour it
Servin' that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playin' my cards
Whip after whip put up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally and gather the squad
Yeah, girl eat the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafuckin' tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothin' but an avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swervin' on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe sayin' we ain't fallin' off
I'm on a lot of green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
I got a magazine with no Visine
Just ridin' around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me
In Ohio, that's my shorty
We ain't playin' around
These diamond rings gon' go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me, then copy
They wasn't playin' fair no-no, no-no, no-no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell that coco, you talkin' to po-po
You know that's a no, though, you know that's a no-no
Know that's a no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no
Came at the door, pour, serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch, you steppin' in, no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-to-back, back, back-to-back with these stallions
Like she trunk after trunk, I just carry on
Got the sack on me, now I just carry it
Got some M's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagen
Fifty-six nights, I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden

I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby

I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you

It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way

Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shawty so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycont' got me flown up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, mi casa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa
, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E
, hope you ain’t get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, 
shinin' is therapy

I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

Can't be cancellin' no shows, fuckin' up your bread
Check out these rumors, that ain't nothin' but the devil

'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle

Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Where ya man at? Heard that the Feds got 'em
I seen ya cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'Fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Man down over yonder
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out nigga, no wonder
Niggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder
Hoes getting Xd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing

Had the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimming in the water, no paddle
Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
The bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the frontstreet where mama said ""Don't go""
We went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these folks, these
Niggas be telling these days, be telling these days

Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Where ya man at? Heard that the feds Got 'em
I seen ya cruise the Land Rover through the west side

My Savages,Monster,2014.0,"I be on the phone with Doe Boy, I be telling him
He inspired me to go harder
You know what I'm saying? Real talk
Will-Will-Will-William

My savages, my savages, my savages
I'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with Yo, I ask him how the trial went
Thirty-five racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened, they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?
How we let these bitches get between us?
How we let these niggas get between us?
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil' dawg caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
R.I.P. my granddad Quick, he should have seen this shit
Twenty thousand on some child support, I seen this shit
Riding around with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me, but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn't love me, would've been done jumped ship
And it's the love from my fans got me still here

Monster, ah
Say I'm Illuminati
They tryna make me catch a body

I don't know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Big Bank saying wipe a nigga's nose
My girl changed the lock on the doors
Said fuck that shit, poured up a four
Ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me?
That what you really expect?
You thinking I'm sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
Put Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There's money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got lil' shawty with me, she a pro
Know she'll never meet another nigga, not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars, he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spur wasn't tinted, I told 'em ain't got nothing to hide
Told 'em I'm through with the pies
Told 'em fuck all of my wrongs, I don't even write
My savages, my savages, my savages
We gon' leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin

Been humpin' wifey for so long, she got a limp when she walk
Got seven drops in four spots, I get to pick where I live
In the back they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoo
On my teeth, these diamonds twinkle, in her legs a jacuzzi
I be tweakin' every day, I got some screws missin'
I keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)
And they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)
Havin' money on this side is not the conversation (Yeah, yeah)
Solitary diamonds for my dawg inside, he waited, yeah (Straight up)

Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
With a bitch that's shinin', lookin' like the moon
Said she wanna party, wanna let it loose
Bustin' out my back room, she ain't out to loop
I wanna take care you and your friends (Ooh)
I put it out, they come in (Ooh)",https://genius.com/Future-solitaires-lyrics

Word to them niggas out the six
A whole lotta lean my nutrition
They should've told ya I had the drank on me
They should've told ya I brung a bank with me

Molly and them Xans got me aggravated
Them hundreds and them fifties, got 'em separated
Put them hundreds with them hundreds, yeah, we segregated
They tried to take the soul out me
They tried to take my confidence and they know I'm cocky

I don't give a fuck about lil' ho, I let young hit it
I play the games of the thrones with you
I can't change, I was God-given
Tried to make me a pop star and they made a monster
I'm posted with my niggas lettin' the champagne flow
A nigga was depressed now my mind back healthy
A product of the roaches in them ashtrays
I inhale the love on a bad day

They should've told you I was gon' lap niggas
They should've told you I was overseas
Say his last words, he can't breathe
They sent the ghetto bird out to peep me
They finally did admit that I was cloned
Because I was ambitious, now I'm on
Five in the mornin' on the corner rollin' stones
I just brought the money, I'll count it on my own

We've been washin' money.... all day
I heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood hot
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money.... all day
Heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood hot

It got blood on that money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

28 grams, I serve it on the porch
I just seent them narcs, they ran off in my house
The homicide unit coming to the house
My cousin murked a nigga and he just got out
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up some drank, say ""Fuck my problems""
My hood, they treat me like I'm El Chapo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I had the warrant in Clayco and beat the case
Man I'm fresh as hell, bitch, Easter day
All my ghetto tactics I'm above average
I've been so in tune, man I've been so ambitious
Grab another Fanta, let me fill it up
If they ain't make the channel, you ain't built like us
The Federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I feel I'm walkin' through Hell
I swear to God I'll never tell
They try to give a nigga the chair
I tell my mama, ""Wish me well""

They got girl on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it

I know the devil is real, I know the devil is real
I take a dose of them pills and I get real low in the field
I'll fly to LA today, and I live so high in the Hills
I share the mansion with goonies, I shared the bitch with a goonie
I took the mack in Bal Harbor, niggas ain't slippin', we got 'em
I took the pack out to Paris, me and that money got married
Me and the molly got married
Devoted in everything, my niggas mean everything
We're 5 deep inside a Chevy
Yeah, we tryna get it
Ask me, do I know how to whip it
Yeah, fuck the witness

It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

She put me off and it was ugly
I made a million dollars, say she love me
The way she did me, it destroyed me
I kept it real with lil' shorty
I've been goin' bar for bar
These niggas know what's poppin' with me
I can go from car to car, these bitches quarter million at least
Two thousand for the shoes, I keep some shit on my feet
I'm prolly in the mood to fuck your bitch on the beach
I dropped out of school and I get money like Meech
Send a junkie, send a driver just to get somethin' to eat
You see how things change?
I came from cocaine

It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it

Trappin' is a habit, I got Xans on me
I'm hotter than a flame, keep the fan on me
Catch me whippin', I'm Hussein with them bands on me
I'ma kill the competition and I'm playin' for keeps
You see water drippin' off me then catch it
I turned nothin' into somethin', now I'm livin'
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
You didn't recognize my drive, shouldn't have did that
Now I'm flyin' every day, I won't get back
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it

I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah

Who knew I've been racin' with a whole 'nother rebel
Shawty wasn't checkin' for me, mama wasn't checkin' for me
I hustle every day just so I can spend a check on you
You my dawg 'til the end, I got so much respect for you
I watched you give up on me, but I never lost faith, did I?
You didn't ever hold me down, then I bought a new safe, didn't I?
Paper plates flushin' in that Wraith, didn't I?
I'm built with a new reputation
Blood, sweat and tears are my new foundation
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation

I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath

And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I come back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We don’t watch TV, we count Fettuccine
4 and a half, it’s right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a 'Ghini
You gon’ need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a biznite
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish

See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split your tato

I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playin' fair
I'm about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat

No Matter What,Astronaut Status,2012.0,"Aye we didn't even know it was gonna be like this

No matter however it goes..

We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
I'mma be there for ya till the very end
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further then
We made a promise to each other we gone never end …
She gone be there for the kid, no matter what
No matter what, no matter what, yeah

We met through a mutual friend
We started clubbing, dranking, talking, laughing and grinning
You had your eyes on me the whole time
I could see ya through my lens
Your face your shape and the lil things about ya…had the kid all in
Anytime we spend time, we spend more than we spend benjamins
What the fuck this high siddity girl want to do with an astronaut kid…
Or asking myself questions, I had to understand…
You gotta live and learn to make mistakes to be the man
We didn't mean for it to get this serious...
I got another nigga bitch with me
And I’m falling for her, yeah I’m falling for her
We ain’t got no strings attached
I want her more and more

We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend

We made a promise to each other we gone never end …
She gone be there for the kid, no matter what
No matter what, no matter what, yeah

We can talk about whatever, we can fuck whenever
It’s like we’re walking on rose petals, when we together
I see you jocking me, and I’m jocking you harder
You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya
And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you’re loyal
It's like we been casted with a spell or both ate some poison
Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing
You my main fling, I took it main stream
Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing
Will never come between, our thing
And we ain’t mean for it to be this serious
I made a promise to you and I’ma take it serious
Cause I know my words mean the most to you
And you mean the most to me
We got a special relation, can't nobody come between

We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
I'mma be there for ya till the very end
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further then

When I Was Broke,FUTURE,2017.0,"Yeah, she ain't leave when I was broke
I used to sit at the trap all day and wait for a phone call
She ain't leave when I was broke
Juugin and finessin'
She ain't leave when I was broke
Yeah

I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke

One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
I don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she won't
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

Came out the sewer, it's stankin'
Go in the booth and I'm blankin'
Slept with my tool on the blanket
Like I'm the son of Michael
All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful
They see my heart has been damaged
You see the whip Panoramic
You see I made it, you witnessed progression
I was talkin' like I knew I was destined
I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it
Whether you like it, you gotta admit it
That I change up your location
That I pull up in that Wraith
Have I fulfilled all your dreams?
I gave you checks
So you're checkin' it off on your wish list
You get Ferraris right now
We doin' Cali right now (without a doubt)

We goin' shoppin' right now, I see they copy right now
I see they're watchin' right now
They didn't know I was just plottin' right now
I've been executin' the play for a while
Witnessed Chubbie Baby walk down the aisle
I got a few rings on me now
Had to change my team and my style
You can't intervene on my craft
You better turn your back right now
Ain't no turnin' back right now
I can't let you cramp my style
If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl
Stand right back 'cause you lookin' like coward
You end up stiff, sleepin' with the flowers (ditch)

How It Was,Radio Los Santos [GTA V],2013.0,"This is an experience
If you haven't been a part of nothing this great
We went through, the motherfuckin' unbelievable

Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it
I was self motivated, I was self driven
I got my determination, now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lenox
When it come to stackin' cash up, it ain't no limit
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talking tennis
It's some girls that's gone wild, I like to see them kissin'
It's some niggas playing foul and they sneak dissin'
I won't let her hold me back to complete my mission
It ain't easy when you try to make it out the trenches

I'm the dope man, dope man, yes I am
Turned your baby mama house into a drug lab
I was using all the forks, using all the pans
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands
Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow, a lawn mower
I’m a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, 
a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve

Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup

How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

Serve it to you cleaner than the house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working, nigga
Got a dogfood connect; DMX, nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money, ‘cause I'm certified
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was

I only want you to have my baby
When I'm drunk and I'm down and depressed
I just need to confess to you

Baby, if I want you, then I know there's somethin' wrong
I don't mean to ruin all the times we had alone
But I'm not my best with you, I'm so depressed with you
But it's so hard, I don't think I can exist without you

Long as they print it, my niggas gon' get it
All of my love, I gave it to my city
All of that game you gave me, can't forget it
All that finesse you gave me, ain't forget it
I turned the whole world up, now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'
These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it, they'd rather go ask for somethin'
Remember them days I had to load it up and put on my mask for somethin'
Remember we jugged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin', yeah, yeah
I spent three stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it
I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit

Woke the don up, all I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up, it look like I lit the sun up

Goin bonkers, I fuck with her, I'm her sponsor
Go redundant, everything I do responsive
Off the continent, everything is out the country
No assumption, hit on the gas, start punchin'
Park my confidence, hit the gas, barely functionin'
Ain't no consciousness, I'm bout to spaz on this stallion
Fuck a casualty, everything we did was lavishly
Fuck a tragedy, all these sticks automatically

Just a young ass nigga I was dead broke
Fuck that fake shit nigga, fuck that fraudulent pretending
Got young Doolie on the body and I really do miss her
Let’s flip that clip and spray that bitch for big daddy
Let’s flip that clip and spray that bitch for big daddy

Punching on the gas, I done rented me a bag though
Two hundred on the dash, baby this is not a Jaguar
You don’t have to ask, keep that hammer on me, MC
You show these niggas love and they gonna show you a barrel
It’s Taliban gang, we in a whole ‘nother era
Our money ain’t the same, I’m in a whole ‘nother bracket
It’s five thousand or better, what I spend on a jacket
Finesse a nigga momma in the hood when I’m trappin’
Praying about this karma when I count up my Franklins
These niggas don’t want drama, they some federal agents
Run inside your house for them coke leaves
They gon’ shoot you in the head if you the police

Hit some R&B shit on the jet though

I’m ‘bout to cash out on a new Bugatti
I’m ‘bout to pay the police off, John Gotti
They mixin’ Actavis in with the molly
Pull a half a million dollar car up in the projects
You niggas wanna go to war, it’s like in ISIS
That bitch gon’ fuck your homeboy ‘cause she triflin’
They got my lil’ one down the road on the hummy
He got Freebandz tatted ‘cross his stomach
I’m ‘bout to smash the prosecutor and the attorney
And I’ve been hustlin’ long time, on a journey
I wake up, go and blow a dime off in Barneys

I’m tryna fuck the DA lady in her mouth though
Hit some R&B shit on the jet though

Can't let the money and fame come between my crew

I just took the middle man off
I go Corleone 'bout the check
I was getting dome with a Tech
Bitch, you ain't gon' get no extra points pulling no faggot move
I just called my contractor, told him ""build another pool""
One sitt in the back, one by the living room
I keep all my jewelry at the bank now
Alexander McQueen's therapeutic
Bitch, I'm getting the same money as Cam Newton
Ask me how it feel to be a millionare

I had to spank lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket

Oh, you greedy in Tahiti, I just seen your flaw
Ayy, tell that girl you 'bout to settle, whatchu tired of?
Ayy, see how she react when you're no longer in your Bimmer?
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented

Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from makin' mula
Oh, you gold diggin' diggin' graveyard loser

From my lips, 'cause if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it

Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care

Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zippin' through the city and I don't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me, why would I do that to her?
Simplism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it

Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk

Nigga, we ain't runnin' from no responsibilities
I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial
Material intentions, gotta play it foul
I'm in rare form like a hyena runnin' wild
All the opps gettin' gunned down

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry

Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial
I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial
I saved the streets, a crazy feeling just to lose a child
Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while
I woke up paranoid off drugs, I said, ""I'm tired now""
I answer my phone in the middle of the night, like, ""Who done died now?""
Knowin' I'm involved, but we gon' slide back when it's dyin' down
I don't know who opps no more, you look crazy, I'm firin' rounds
I love the streets, it's a portion of me
I came from nothin' to the voice of the streets
I got blood in the streets
The way he died, I advise he died in his sleep
That's the trenches, yeah, yeah

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

Public conversation got you touchin' clouds
Popped the wrong pill, hit the wrong dial
Ain't no visitation, waitin' for the trial (Ain't no visitation)
Took my last name, this ain't 'bout the child (Woah)
Real classy Jazzy, real don't do no trollin'
Gotta treat you like you dead when you playin' bogus

See, Pluto, you my brother, gotta stay focused
Sometimes I get in my feelings, too, I wish I wore a Trojan
They tryna go viral off DMs, that's why I'm antisocial
I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion
I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch
I'm just tryna live my life and catch this moment, yeah

Don't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan
I seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way
Chanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today
That bitch get on my nerves, man
I had to send her out to St. Tropez
Oh you done blow more checks than me, boy?
Then you got to be hallucinating

I'm a young nigga with this check and I fuck it up
The freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck

It's a lot weighin' on my shoulders
I ain't ever gon' fold up
I had turbo'd off my motor
I was pushin' boulders
I gave you some closure when I bought the Rover",https://genius.com/Future-hallucinating-lyrics

You know what I'm saying?
Showing improvement
Getting fetti ya dig?

Riding low in a Maybach
Spraying at you like an Arab
Streets having you going crazy
I got my young niggas going crazy
Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Burn it down nigga, why wait?
Burn it down on good drink
On good drink, on good drink
Money long get your money long
Get these yellow diamonds like a honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Getting doped up that's everyday
Hermès on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day

Fuck a bitch in a big way
And I hit her right on the staircase
Hit that mouth I go bareface
When I'm in that mouth I go bareface
Pain pills took a double dose
Gotta bank roll with some iron on me
They told you I was real, real nigga
They wasn't lying on me
I get better and better with time don't I?
Drinking codeine like wine don't I?
Step on the scene, got dimes on me
It's a dirty game, niggas dying in it
The black Range got her riding it
Hit her throat then dive in it
Flip her over, switch sides in it
Niggas switching sides, they some pie niggas
Thank God they ain't my niggas
Stacked tall I can hide in it
Steal a car, used to ride in it
Had to hotbox, had to ride in it
Foreign coupes now I ride in it
Jimmy Choo I just vibe in 'em
I don't dab in 'em I just vibe in 'em
Boss nigga win a fight with her

I ain't never tryna be a side nigga
Never tryna be a crab nigga
Take a champagne bath nigga
Take a real champagne bath nigga
You can hit him with that yopper now
I'mma gon' head and pay the tab nigga
You the one talking down
When a nigga turn around, tryna stab niggas

Hermès on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day

Styrofoams and a Fanta on me
Few racks with a hammer on me
Gotta move around cause them cameras on me
Gotta keep it cool when them cameras on me
Live and learn and I'm still going
Money burn and I'm still going
Count it up and I'm still going
I just count it up and I'm still going
High-Tech and I'm still pouring
Got High-Tech and I'm still pouring
Designer-signer man it's all on me
I got flawless diamonds and they all on me
Real cash nigga ball with it
Gotta bend over in the stall wit it
I'mma rich nigga so I fall in it
Really it ain't none of y'all business
Thick shit, stand tall in it
Flip her on her stomach then crawl in it
Vicodins have a ball with 'em
Percocets have a ball with 'em
Pouring up, act a dog with it

I can't pop up when I want with her, she popular
I've been tryna fight my demons, I've been tryna fight my cup
I always tell her she my therapy, I told her it was rough
She acceptin' all my flaws, I got diamonds with the cut
I've been sufferin' withdrawals, missin' out on real love

Different, you a angel, true to me

And I don't plan on taking no ski trip, that ink drip (Woo)

Copy and they clone what I'm feedin', they be thievin'
China white in my home, be strategic, I gotta feed ya
Grind up on my own 'cause I see how they mistreat me
Don't you let 'em turn you on me, I see it, I can peep it
Clear like white Patron, I can see it, you conceited
Talkin' on the phone, you can hear my tone, mischievous
Plastic or the chrome, whatever we need to keep us heated
Canary yellow stone, girl, shine on my demons
I feel it in my bones when you takin' out my semen
I purchased a couple Cashmere sweaters this evening
Take you for a walk in the park like a deacon
Half a ticket, pullin' up on you and mamacita
Give you the keys in her face to show her how I treat you
I'm takin' you out on dinner dates, got Franklins like Aretha
Trained in the war zone, codeine in my one liter
Pain in my attitude, it's vicious and it's lethal
Came off the avenue and ran into a diva
Broken-hearted, baby had me down, had to get you
You out the garden, baby, I'm from the jungle with the leeches
Clouded my lungs up and I slowly started speakin'
Rain, thunderin', showin' you grace for this meetin'
Givin' you compliments throughout the day and the weekend
Fall in love with revenge, hopin' that'll kill my demons
Sittin' out on my porch, I'm in disbelief
Give me glory, give me Lori, that's victory
Moment I drop your name, is it chemistry?
Fuck this money and fame if it's meant to be
Like a rock star showin' up at a symphony
Rock hard, pissin' on my enemy
Fuck 'em all, we don't show 'em sympathy
Her favorite color blue, I bought her Tiffany
Out the trap spot, I got my dope degree
They persuaded me, they gon' try to persuade you to leave
Had laid in it, played in it, and stayed in it for weeks
Mistakes like earthquakes, they can't break us a piece
I'm not Catholic but had to have a talk with the priest
Acrobatic flips, gettin' European cash 'cross the sea
It's so radical, automatic-al, I'm knowin' we elite
Fascinated by the lifestyle, you know it bring greed
Fascinated by your vices, it's okay
Fascinated over your crisis, it's warfare
When we roll one, we converse, we like orphans
Coast to coast, float the ocean like a starfish
Check my post, I'ma toast to the heartless
That's why I'm prayin' for better days on this continent
I don't need a ghost to write my promises
You boost my confidence

Cash out mad G's, bustin' down AP's
Handmade 1 of 1 Riccardo Tisci
Crystal diamonds on my sleeves, L-O-V-E
Changed the whips about a week, yes I do agree
Louis V on my carry-on, yes indeed
Have to pay for it tonight as you charge a fee
Order the PJ at 1, we land tomorrow at 3
Steak and shrimps, caviar for seven days
Let's flick it up for my dawgs in the cage

Peel you off a couple bands, girl like, ""here you go""
Been lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white Rolls
We livin' marvelous, yeah we livin' marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' them that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, nah

Always keep it real with you!

Long nights of the wake up
New check, fuck my life up
Anytime I'm in a new city
I prefer to do light drugs
Police try to hit the tour bus
Try and fuck a nigga life up
You can fuck a nigga life up
By trying to fuck a nigga wife once
Told you baby this business
Please stop tryna ruin it all
Money fucked a nigga life up
New rims, new tires

Whip browner than a band-aid

Eight stacks sitting in the club
Swipe my credit card, fuck my life up
These drugs gave me my light up
Told her ""Baby please, don't bite it""
I ain't had sex in a whole week
Just so you can get to know me
Gushy, gush, so soaky
I put it in, go so deep
Motherfuck how far you
Come over here and get the write up
Homeowners association, they always tryna get right up
You got a better advantage
You always use xannies whenever you plan it
Pussy be fucking my life up
And yet at the same time it's giving me stamina
My role model fucked my life up
Two bitches in the same room, no light on
So easy getting 100 thousand when the night up
Got cake cookin' up cake bake
My life fucked for a ladies bit
83 to 88, money comes so fast

Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
Girls it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true

Ball hard, and I'm still balling

Hit a few licks with my dawgs, we mobbin'
Called a few chicks on my line, they slobbin
Girl on a girl, if they eat that's the topic
Thought she was true, she was fuckin' the opps
Can't tell her none, might be workin' with cops
Told me she loyal, I found out she not
Can't trust a unfaithful girl at the spot

Danced with the Devil so hard to avoid

I left some behind, they didn't leave me no choice
People get to me, can't tell I don't show it
Shit gettin' brutal, gon handle it with force
Yellow Presi and it wasn't off-shore
Enough water on me it can fill up the tub
Platinum your ice if you know where to store it
I smell the blood, I'ma eat you like sharks
Hold on to grudges, don't tear me apart

I made me a boss, I'm tellin' ya I feel very impeccable
A neck fulla beads, I'm tellin' ya this shit gettin' spiritual
Get down and plead, baby, and beg for forgiveness

Codeine, it sit on my kidney and dissolve
Hit a few licks with my dawgs, we mobbin'

I'm gettin' higher than satellite
You can get flyer than me in my afterlife
Sit down and watch me and have a bite
Put it on the floor, she gon' eat it up
Put it in a safe, we gotta keep it up
Throw 'em in a lake, you gotta teach 'em somethin'
Seen a wing on the pedal, and I stomp to the floor
Cost a couple of Ms tryna save a whore
Lucky as a blessing and there wasn't a loss
Wrapping a bale feel like my hand was forced
Put one of the girls in an executive Porsche
Crib with a maid, and it came with a horse
Cover the green like a golfer on course
Purchase that lean with no problems, of course
Brought the machine with the money ain't short

You understand me?

I bagged this bad bitch, it was nothing to get her
You want a whole brick? Oh it’s nothing to get ‘em
Oh, you want diamonds like this? It wasn’t nothing to get ‘em
I had to focus, then it wasn’t nothing to get ‘em

Hey, 30,000 on a watch, I swear thank God I’m ballin’
Feds watching on my spot, they say somebody called ‘em
Hottest nigga in the streets, they see my Audemars
Hottest nigga in the streets, 3,000 grams a show
Boston George, I’m with that game, you got that girl that blow
Oh, you want my life, that's life for me, that’s all I know
Catch me pissing out the codeine from the night before
This for Khaled, this for niggas riding on eights and vogues
This for G-rod, C-Rod, all these niggas banging B’s
This the greatest story never told, you gotta see it
I, I got some names but I ain’t gon’ never drop ‘em
Ayy, she say my name but she won’t ever drop me

You want an R&B chick, shawty it ain’t nothin’ to get her
You want to run around the town, well it ain’t nothin’ to get her
You want to drive around in that Rolls, you know it ain’t nothin’ to get her
You know that I’m gonna make homies ride for me, it ain’t nothin’ to get ‘em

We throwed away that money, 'cause that mula swole
I throw that them of boy, I’m servin’ in the cold
Got 58 grams of boy, we servin’ pita
They say they got Magnolia shawty bangin’ needles
They trapped out Angola, they was out the NOLA
Then fuck around and then know you, got to be a cobra
They cooped up with that yola, now that cook Coke Cola
I fucked around and showed them that my heart is colder
My water whippin’ issues now we packin' pistols
They packin’ gats and lots these niggas sending missiles
They say they hate the kid, the kid was getting mula
You wanna ask around, then you can ask my jeweler

Buddy came around, he shot ‘em on a bike
Oh he poppin’ wheelies, a lil' Haiti baby
Oh they say that nigga he just a lil' Haiti baby
Oh they say that boy he just a lil' Haiti baby
Shoot in broad day, he shoot in broad day
Shot the whole window up in broad day
Oh that’s that lil' Haiti baby, Haiti baby
Oh that’s that lil' Haiti baby, Haiti baby

Dumping down the pills, I feel my head explodin’
Roll a pound of dope, I gotta keep on smokin’
Money comin’ in, we ain’t gon’ never spend it
10,000 bags of kush, we ain’t gon’ never listen
I just wanna be there for my nigga, woo
I just wanna go back to the Bentley store
I just wanna go back to the Lamb' store
I just wanna buy another Rover though
I just wanna get back on a yacht tomorrow
I just wanna buy another spot tomorrow
All this money comin’ in, can’t never spend it
I swear, all this money comin’ in, we’re still winnin’
Shoot in broad day, shoot in broad day
Shot the whole window up in broad day

Coke in all the cars, we ain’t got no facade
Pull up in that ‘Rari, we don’t know facade
Pull up with that yappa, it wasn’t no facade
Lettin’ off all the rounds, it wasn’t just no facade

Oh he poppin’ wheelies, he a lil' Haiti baby
Oh they say that nigga, he a lil' Haiti baby
Oh they say that boy, he a lil' Haiti baby

I took the bitch out of Steve, bitch out of Steve
I took the bitch out of Steve
Then I put blonde on her weave
I took them hoes outta Soho, then I put them in Manolo
I told the bitch you do not fuck with bozos
But now you fuck with boss on the low low
I had a bitch on the side
Then I gave that bitch some pride
I told her come through tonight
Then I took her on a flight
I took you out of apartments, then I put you in the condo
I had you off in the trap room, you was the one in the bando
You didn't abandon a nigga, you stayed down for the kid
Now I gave you where to live, now you pull up in the lear

Went from a two door to four door
From four door to two door
I'm back in the coupe

Came through playin' in a mink
Don't put the fan on, it's gon' shrink

Got a lotta bands on me, outta drench

Burned down the house, call the fire truck

Might even take a lil longer
Took a few losses with the 'caine
Arm & Hammer made me stronger
Watch for the do', count up this fo'

It's been a long time comin'

Aw, they ain't think I'm gettin' my bag, ayy
Ran it up and gave 'em a sad face
Now anywhere around the globe
You rep the gang and you got rank, yeah
Gotta converse with the manager
When I walk inside the bank, yeah
Who would ever think they was sleepin' on me?
Goyard with a half a million on me
R&D's, it's like I'm possessed
All these diamonds on my chest

Sleepin' on the floor had made my heart colder
They try to make it hard for me, I never falter
Gotta say I'm good, I'm on the ESPY's
I made millions by the day, 
check my chest piece
Try to take care of my family the best I know how
Bought myself a mansion, now I gotta buy everybody a house
Takin' care of my bitches like the mother of my child
God know all my brothers sin, I gotta blow this trial
You don't get no guidance out the trenches to make it out
God knows I'll never give up on you, never will
Shit gettin' hectic with the niggas that ya kill for
Money got me hesitant, what I got to live for?
All this fame gettin' terrible
All these rings and Berettas
Flawless victory, change the weather
Hurricane, natural disaster
Pour the lean for the bastards
Take the jet across the atlas
God I pray I forget my dada
'Cause I didn't grow up to be average
All the times he lied to me, ya gave up on my arteries
I was such a worried child, just wanted you to be a part of me
Fishscale projects made a man out me
Sleepin' on the carpet made a man out me
Full of medication, I wouldn't change it
I was once broke but no complainin'
I finally start to embrace that I'm famous
It's hard for me to erase when I was nameless

Aw, they ain't think I'm gettin' my bag, ayy

Save it up and send it OT
Makin' mills tryna OD
I'm in the Hills tryna find peace

Fuck around, I had to call up Scratch

Never been a quitter, I'ma turn it to the max
Lean in my liver, I've been taking good batch
Real dope dealers don't hang around rats
Four by four, sitting taller than a 'Lac

Glock four-oh, plastic gat

You better not tell them none what you saw
Soon as I drop, I got flexed up
Fuck all that drama, got heat tucked
Ice out the hittas, my cuts up
Yellow gold Presi, it bust up
Young nigga already pushed the Ferrari
I came in with the head off
Jumbo Patek gon' crush your career
All these wheels, got dust on the wheel
So many foreigns, a car dealership
Poured up my cup when I hopped on the Lear
Drippin' severe, the God is here
Dic's in here, I got chartered here

We on that dope and that mud shit
We tried to show niggas some love shit

Niggas tried to flex they muscles on us
We cut 'em off and bought some better choppers
We fuck you bitches, let my brother hit 'em
Fuck you niggas, let my robbers get 'em
They just wanna see me out my mental
Went and fucked some commas up at my dental
Fuckin' lumber up, doin' numbers
Pop a molly up, I remember
Better put your missus up, I'ma get her
Fuck her in the mouth and didn't kiss her
Gut the crib out with all pistols
I got my grill in, twenty thousand
Bought a few chains, that's a new 'Rari
I got this cute dame, give a fuck about her
She want all this fame and a million dollars
I done took this pain and I'm noddin' off
Keep a few rings, give a fuck about 'em
I'm in that new Range, I give a fuck about it
Grippin' grain on the Mulsanne
Sippin' drank at the Blue Flame
Hit the booth, let the booth flame
We ain't never cool, we just say that shit
For this bitch, you gotta play my shit
Run it back and then say my shit

You wear more Chanel than anybody
You the type to get your man indicted
I'm the type to pull up in a Spider
I'm the type to drive a Honda
Put a hundred round clip inside a dirty rifle
It's dirty when it got a homi' on it
Fuck that nigga, put a bounty on him
I'm the one that put that dirty in the cup
Had you sippin', noddin' off, nigga
You was gettin' fronted, runnin' off, nigga
I made myself to a boss, nigga
Put a hundred carats in a cross, nigga
Spent two hundred thousand on a cross, nigga
Can't never sleep 'cause it'll cost niggas
They can never see my palms sweatin'
You'd've never seen the hunger in me
I'm so sick and tired of being humble, nigga
This money put a lot of demons in me
Went and tatted all these angels on me
Fuck that nigga, put a tracker on him
Then we throw a pep rally on him
These commas coming in, these haters coming in
The karma coming back from when I was gettin' it in
Baby mama tryna sue again
Bought my little ones Christian Louboutins
Give my nigga commissary in the pen'
Got the federales on a nigga chin
Fuck the Benz, I'ma whip the Spur
Said fuck my Spur and bought my bitch a Ghost

Got a bunch of chains, my neck is very crowded
When I flood the streets, they have a powder shower
Know the recipe, you need to learn about it
Finessin' niggas, gotta learn about it
I could cook it in the microwave
I got your baby mama with the shits
I got your son sitting on a brick

I can't wait to cut a bitch off!

These bitches ain't shit
She'll fuck your homeboy, she'll take your money
She'll take off running, where the fuck she going

No, no, no, no, no

Like I know that ice, and you fugazi
The very first night
Smashed out your lights, look and acting crazy
Caught in the hype
Come take this pipe, can't even take it
I'm fly as a kite
Wanna ride on this plane, bitch you lazy
Wake up every single morning with that dick on your breath
She ain't looking for love, she looking for help
I got money, make her wet
Gone and cut the check
Soon as you fuck her to sleep she dreaming 'bout a Rolex
You super fine, I know your kind
You'll blow a nigga mind, why the fuck you crying
I'm on my grind, committing these crimes
Ain't got no time, for that sobbing, and all that lying
You another nigga problem, I'm glad you ain't mine

And she sucking on Drama
Telling me the nigga momma this must be karma
This must be life
When you hitting these bitches don't take off your ice
She must be tricking
She ain't picked up the phone, she gone on a mission
She watching Basketball Wives
Every single damn night, before she go to sleep
Thinking 'bout them trips with Kanye
While she sucking on Wiz Khalifa

These bitches ain't shit
She'll fuck your homeboy, she'll take your money
She'll take off running, where the fuck she going

And I can't cuddle

And I'm on a double, and a half
And all you keep screaming 'bout is some cash, haaaa
And all I can do to myself is laugh, yeah
And all I'mma do to the bitch is pass, her fast
Cause she ain't got no stamina, say she trash
Excuse my manners, here go a bag

Tellin' me what the lawyer was sayin'
About the lawsuit
I thought they had had that down, yeah

Big money shit, baby, I just bought a new six, baby
Flintstone in my ears, pissed on my wrist, baby
This song just mutilated, everything decapitated
Deep on new relations, just gotta be brand related
Ain't no sellin' out, no tradin', so you gotta be gang-related
Pop stylin' this shit for my shottas incarcerated
Rockstar this shit, a street star, I stay acquainted
Pop stylin' this shit, how you get the high maintenance one?
How she gon' take my love and give it away like it ain't nothin' to her?
How you gon' judge my drugs I take when I never did offer you?
Hawaiian surfin' on the thick one to the PJ
I can just imagine the pain on Bankroll PJ
Murder murder, broad day, I got tears, I can't let 'em out
I can't take it, I can't take it no more, I'm 'bout to spaz out
I'm good on deposits but I gotta have a stash house
I see you bein' greedy and I gotta work my ass off
I chief on gas house, until I pass out
Rollin' in a Phantom, came with an umbrella
Survive the trenches, it thunder today, I'll walk through it
Hurricane Pluto, I'ma drip all through it (Icy)

Seen his son at my little boy birthday party, it was harder
The streets of the ATL don't respect nothin' but shottas
Had to look the other way, could be the other way
Hit Yung Mazi up, that was in the broad day
I popped two Xans and I been sleep all day

Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick if you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me to Grady's
A young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
For the haters I'mma go ahead and do it 360
Drinking on a Sprite got lean all in it
I'm a Astronaut nigga better trust my pimping

Learned the Astronaut Kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Bimmer out of Germany
Gotta thing for me, they wanna sing for me
They like my energy, I'm an embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You will re-appear and go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walking when you walking

I was an Earthling now im SciFi

Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
High as a fuckin' cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First, I had bought a Bimmer, then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, 'cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's comin'
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again, if I can be where I'm at today

I took my scars and made a movie
I got all my niggas with me through the bad and the good
I got all my jewels on me and I'm still in the hood
I can never stop from grinding cause I made it out the mud
I can never forget when I was on the block selling drugs
Codeine calm my nerves I was getting high since a kid
I took all my problems and I turned it all into hits
I can channel my anger now I can go make me some billions
They trynna' predict my next move but I say fuck politics
Long as I stick to the formula I'm never gon' switch

You can't tell me you ain't got no love for me, no

I done ran into a few complications
Promise me you'll always stay dedicated
You gotta promise me you'll never be scared of love no more
You took the vows, for better or for worse
Please baby, please baby, please
Gave me reason to believe in my dreams
Give me love, that's what I need, that's what I need
I'll travel through time, I walked the line and overseas

Before we do anything, we're doing us
I didn't have no more patience, I was in a rush
I fell in love with music, just like us
You work at Magic, baby can you love me?
You see the moon comin' out at night
I got a wolf standin' by my side
We do these girls three at a time
I'm in my world, I'm out of time
Three different highs, I'm off the ground
Look in my eyes, you see my trials
You see my tribulations, I was down
I seen the sweat running down the wall
We tryna have a good time
We toastin' it up at the juke joint
Sit by the bar at the juke joint
Made love in the car at the juke joint

I'm standin' in the middle of an orgy
I put a smile on a whore bitch
I feel like my life is completed
I feel like it's timin' with everything

I feel like it's timin' with everything
Feel like it's timin' with everything
I stood in the middle of an orgy
She did it right, it was gorgeous
She lookin' right, she was gorgeous
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night, it's a portrait

Sometimes I'm rappin' this
When I know I shouldn't be doin' this
Hopin' that the end results
I don't aim to ruin this
Palm trees influenced this
Chronic trees influenced this
Tootsies in Miami
These girls, they influence this
The JW Marriott in Dubai, it influenced this
Take a few laps on the horses before the sun sets
And I can see it from my window
I can see this from my window

You see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras
I'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball
Pink shirt on me just to match my diamonds
NASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'
Big dawg but I feel just like a giant
Withdrawals, pass my cup, I think I'm dyin'

Say fuck the drug task, go'n pass my gas mask
Flatscreen, I back back, I see my racks stacked
Super like Goldie Mack, ho caught an asthma attack
Hoes gettin' their toes tagged, kill 'em dead at Hermes
Turned up on purpose, I have her nervous
I don't have no stylist, make my own purchase
Low top my Gucci, I was wrapped in a turban
Knew she was a hoochie, I had to murk it
Now I got power, I feel like Curtis
I gave her Pucci, I felt like she was worth it

I wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious
Sometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious

I put the shrimp in the noodles
I gave you love like a guru
I seen the whale in the wave
We laugh at you niggas and fuck your bitches
We don't know how to behave
We been so viciously trained
I've seen the gift in the game and the curse
I watch that pussy get wet in a 'vert
We can flow through the hood like you drivin' a hearse
All this shit peaches and cream
I ride the B with the wings
Put a few of them B's in the ring
You deserve to get treated like a queen
Don't let this shit go to your head
Don't let the dick go to your head
Sippin' purp, I don't fuck with the red
She want titties? I bought her some breasts
I pray it don't go to your head
I pray it don't go to your head
Can't forget about my bitch on the side
I tell Uber to give her a ride
Popped the cruiser, I'm back in the skies
Maneuver the streets with my guys
The money didn't come in disguise
They thought it all came overnight
I flood out my neck with some diamonds
I gotta thank God for this life
Too many malicious suspicious bitches
Got a hell of a vision, I need some Ritalin
Got that kush in my cataracts, ask my dentist
I got them golds and the permanent, yeah

She know I'm flier than a poster
She know I ride with the toaster
I have a work on my line with them boulders
I'm makin' my quota
I sip out the soda
I trip off the soda
I live for the dodie
Get worshipped like Moses
Heavenly sent from the crew are my niggas
I'm liftin' my niggas, I love the young niggas
Wrote on your sneakers young nigga
Servin' illegal my nigga
Duckin' them people my nigga
Smokin' my reefer my nigga

And we ain't always gone see eye to eye: compromise
And I just want you hold me down 3-6-5
With no complaining
Relationship get draining
I pray for my sanity
I'm tryna better my family
Through the blood, sweat, and tears

To a mogul, come up with explosive

My cousin had my back from day one, mano y mano
I believe in keepin' it one thousand and stayin' humble
You’re right, I told to take the route through the jungle
Keep the same integrity when I was standing on the corner
Hit the studio, and spit that crack of heavy on 'er

Sometimes I feel like I wanna sing
My passion (My passion)
It goes without me saying
The fruits of my labor I laid down a solid foundation
You water a seed too long and it'll grow
You stay down and grind for long and it's gon' show
It brings water to my eyes just to hear me on the radio
You would not understand the route I had to take to get here so
I worked for this (I worked for this)
It didn't come easy (It didn't come easy)
Now people hit me up and say these rappers cheesy

That we want them out of our schools, neighborhoods and our lives
And the only way to do that is to take the customers away from the product
Say no to drugs
And say yes to life

And who you believe is up to you

How can I not make this music for dealers and killers and niggas who out there be robbing

Run in your spot, smashing your ho, fuck on your couch
Quit running your mouth, pimping my pen beginning to end
Telling the plot, look at my watch, fuck all your thoughts
I appreciate you niggas I appreciate you bitches for keeping me relevant talk all you want
Brag all I want, how can I not make you niggas regret
How can I not go and get me a check
How can you not get hooked on percocet
How can you not be the one who was star
How can you not be the one who was king

Buy a drop and another watch then flex some more nigga how can I not

Jugg with my money nigga how can I not, fuck you mean I got 20 spots

I gave her so much money she got my ex still claimin' me
I ordered the jet because I hope she ain't tryna frame me
I'ma keep a dirty stick if you ever think I ain't the same me
Got a Bel Air address, but this money never changed me
I stay next to Uncle Will, but I'm still the same me
I done seen Jada Pinkett sittin' out on her blanket
Came up around murderers and most of 'em shiesty
She was already bad, but my money made her feisty
She done been in love before, but I done got her icy
I done sold drugs before and couldn't bond out of Rice Street
I came from off the floor, you won't find no nigga like me
I done told you once before, you gotta say it's spicy
Makin' money is the only thing excite me

Went and baptized my wrist in VVS', oh
Stackin' this mula up to Avatar
Bentayga, Rolls Royces, etcetera, etcetera
High profile drug dealers, oh
Canary yellow stones on the Amazon
I'm workin' every day like I'm the last don
Fuck the investigation, we some Talibans
And when it come to emotions, I'm playin' camouflage

I'ma keep a dirty stick, you ever think I ain't the same me
I'ma keep a dirty stick, you ever think I ain't the same me
She done been in love before, but I done got her icy
High profile drug dealers, oh


I need a freak on sight, I got ice on ice on ice on ice
I got ice on ice on ice on ice
Keep that white on white on white on white
Keep some white on white on white on white
We rockin' Rollies for real, we rockin' Rollies for real
We rockin' Rollies for real, we rockin' Rollies for real

I was just gettin' me some mula, I come from the streets and I jump on a Lear
I don't wanna do nothin' but profit, I see it, I want it, I cop it
I got several different options, you don't want it with these horses
You don't wanna get to poppin', you don't wanna start sparkin'
Ain't no renegotiatin', we ain't even tryna bargain
They runnin' out of the Ace, anything else, we don't even want it
Peep how we came up the interstate, peep how we never gon' lose
Peep how they peepin' and watchin' me runnin' off with everything that I do
We didn't do this for the fun, I didn't do this just to slack
I did it all for the love, I put the gang on the map
We takin' cash at the door, oh wait, you can't even get through the door
We rollin' up in the police face, we got some cash to blow
Twenty dollars for a gram, tryna stuff a two-five in a Backwood
Niggas know who I am all through your city 'cause they know the cash good

I need a freak on sight, I got ice on ice on ice on ice
I got ice on ice on ice on ice

Got more guns than a terrorist when I think about it
All these cars, my kids inheritin' when I think about it
All this money I can't cherish when I think about it
These niggas rather see me suffer, now I think about it
I know they playin' undercover when I think about it
Ordered more whips, more jewelry
We take more trips, fuck the whole jury (fuck 'em all)

They got me in the courts like I'm losin'
I gotta be the one most improvin'
I know they gon' try to misuse me
Patiently wait while they come up with solutions
Twenty chains on my neck, man, they can't figure me out
Put a Rollie 'round my neck, they try and figure me out
They 'bout to gas up the jet, they try and figure me out
I had to get some more Fugazi, they tryna figure me out
Wetter than a pussy, got your nose runnin'
Kamikaze comin' out on all or nothing
We just gettin' the money, fuck the whole public
You can get the whole clip if you tryna touch me

Caught her in Bahamas and she got interrogated
Chanel or Valentino, tell me what's your very favorite

They tryna keep up with me, that's just like investigation
They use a track up on me, thought I wasn't in Mercedes
I'm droppin' out of school but that didn't stop my education
I swear I'm most improved, I had to flood the population

She know my love is very sacred

More love than February, this-sh ain't no fairy-tary
The highest level you can go, we blow up to legendary

I wear my heart on my sleeve, you got my heart in my stomach
Without a doubt in my mind, I'm takin' off and you comin’

You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me
On a whole ‘nother level, me and you we light the room up, only together
Every time we havin' sex we gotta break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
And we don’t wanna go to shleep, cause we too obsessed
With the high life, and we gon' blast up like a rocket when the time right, and when the time right

Top floor of the penthouse, on the rooftop poppin’ bottles
Shawty she go both ways, anytime she go smash models
Addicted to the high life, me and you we ‘bout the same
Gucci, Louis, Prada, when we walk it ain’t no thang
Got them VVS diamonds they don't bling, them bitches blang
Say you wanna go to Pluto, me and you, we are the same
Baby, tell me you can gutter and she fire to the flame
Remain full of spin like woo ride plane
Take of take off take off take off and blast
You almost never prepared you’re in a whole ‘nother class
You are sidity, you pretty, lights, camera, flash
Focus on your future ain't concerned bout your past

You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me
On a whole ‘nother level, me and you we light the room up, only together
Every time we havin' sex we gotta break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
And we don’t wanna go to sleep, cause we too obsessed
With the high life, and we gon' blast up like a rocket when the time right, and when the time right

She the red on the bottom of her shoes (on her shoes)
I’m in her brain like I can’t lose (I can’t lose)
And it ain’t nothing for her I can’t do
And when I’m with ‘er I got nothin’ to prove
She accept me for me and I take you for you
We get high as the skies and get past the moon
We got a special connection, we could light up the room
We some astronaut, maine, no cartoon
We outta here, we eatin ass and we gon' never gonna Earth with you
We ain't never gone touch the surface again, designer gear is all we in
Outer space status, the most incredible bond
In it for the passion, a whole lot of fashion

You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me
On a whole ‘nother level, me and you we light the room up, only together
Every time we havin' sex we gotta break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
And we don’t wanna go to sleep, cause we too obsessed

The girls are pretty, the nights are long
Aye, no sleepin' for us, when we drinkin' tough

Talk to Scotty and he talk right back
I'm diggin' your body, your ass really fat

I was on a yacht on a Tuesday, keep it on God, come Tuesday
Maserati truck on Tuesday, better keep up, don't lose me
Gettin' geeked up, I'm exclusive
Two cell phones, and I'm ruthless
Two cups on, and I'm vicious

I was goin' in the house with the vision
I done came back out with a million
I was hypnotizin' yay', I was cookin' up powder yay'
I was makin' it shower yay', for a full three hours, yay
I'm proud to say I made it, got the whole damn world invaded

These diamonds don't mean a thing to me
In my song I don't repeat

I go hard for my n*ggas
Pray to God for my n*ggas

When I'm standin front the center
Screaming every verse
If you leaning of the syrup
Or are you drinkin cold water
You drink the cold water
I f*ck wit you regardless
We know I feel (?)
We gotta feel important
I go the hardest
Pull lines off my song when I swear this sh*t will make you go the hardest

You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars

Took a nigga’s favorite shoes - took a nigga’s favorite store

These ladies trippin’ …
‘cause I buck a lot but I don’t be datin’ none of ‘em
And I roll with niggas, go-to niggas, know they ain’t as friendly
And all my pieces wide receivers they all eighty’ somethin’

And I make your ladies do my say-so
I’m just a nigga on the grind tryna make moves
Shine like a g, though
Rhyme bully, my mob goodie, shout-out to ceelo

Homicide,Pluto,2012.0,"You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

Fighting, shooting, killing, riding, cripping, tripping, spitting fire
In the kitchen, baking pies, taking mines, making mines
Yellow tape, black gun, fill it with them hollow shells
And leave the scene bloody, buddy can't nobody tell
Catch a plane to the ATL, lay low in a cheap motel
Whatever suits ya, and get a few thangs from my cousin Future
Now I'm back on and popping like
Trapping, rapping in the cut, talk shit, I fuck you up
They don't recognize who I am or where I'm from
So I hit the strip club banging 20 Crip cuz
Treble with the bass, put that thang up in yo shavening
And leave yo body bleeding on the pavement

You say you wanna take a ride? Get in

Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

How many will ride open up that fye
You gotta question a nigga standing next to you, cut him off
I grew up on the side you gotta make yourself a boss
Niggas'll shit on you any chance they get
Cross you out on a lick
If you ain't ready for the ending then quit
It's a dirty world, you gotta get your hands dirty
I'm going for the title with my hands on the rifle
I put in the same work you put in, survival
Looking at my rival, they looking suicidal
Keep them bodies off wax, I can spot a rat
Let the guitars play, brraaat!

You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in

Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

Slang a bunch of packs, and go and snatch a Benzo
I played them streets as a young nigga, ain't never liked Nintendo
Them gangstas in the yard, them my motherfucking kinfolk
They'll kidnap you and yo broad (in broad) daylight, no pretendo
I grew up 'round a bunch of monsters, apply that pressure on ya
Be so scared for ya life, you call the police on ya
You ready say you ready
You gon' starve or you want fetti? Yo life'll change a second
Good or bad, don't open yo mouth, make sure you shut it
Ain't no telling who listening, make a wise decision
I'm from 'cross the tracks, like Boosie
If you ride, you better know who shooting

Lord I'm prayin' for my demons, MDA in my semen
I was talkin' to God the other day, swear I was leanin'
God forgive me, forgive me, Oh no I didn't do it
But just go right in the booth, and spit my heart and my anger
My closest friends givin' up, man they feelin' like strangers
I got my whole crib plush, with guns like a ranger
You gotta take me on a high speed chase before you catch me
You either live, you either die, that's the only way you'll get me
Aww man, aww man, I should have stayed at Columbia High
It was times that I thought ""What I'm thinkin', like why
I am who I am?"" and shit I can't cry
I was built for this lifestyle, damn, honestly
From the gutter travelin' to another country
All kings need to be crowned, that's my pedigree

40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
What I spent today I spent it in a month I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!

What a bird go foe, I got that in my coat, say 35 racks?
I can buy a kilo, put a gucci skully on
Help me think a lil better
I stuff the cash in my denim
Blowin racks on bezels
All the drugs I made, I need a gold medal
All the songs I played,blow the mill look better
I blow the strongest dope I drink the strongest lean when I hit the scene you see racks in jeans
Think I printed it up like a copy machine ya'll niggas fugazy, tryna copy muh team
I blow dem bands like ceiling fans
Stay chasin' paper, like a Taliban
I'm freeband, La Familia
I got Benjamins, talkin a bunch of them

I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it

Ludacris I'm a legend
So still drive in my Ac'
Took two years on just to raise my cup
Worth a 100 fucking mill
Niggas can't keep up
What you're making in a year
I blow it in a week
Just built the guest house
Three thousand square feet
Everything go to waste
Too much money in the way
Got a b-ball court
Nigga don't even play
What thaa fuck?
I got enough weed to fill a hundred thousand blunts
Brought a playground at the crib
My daughter play on that shit once
Got a safe filled up with dirty money like Kaleena
Got a tennis court rotting cause it's waiting for Serena, bitch!

I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it

Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle

Want some blow? Or to rent a boat?
Nigga need a bigger boat for all this blow
How getting doe
You ain't got no thing to blow
Fuck out of here with your blow
The rich who blow
Got it from a new blow
Actually it's old blow
It was gone for
You can say blow
Show me 700 for
By all means I was going to blow
... partner made that
Hop in the enzo
You're the bitch
Got to blow
Better tie her to the car
And the deed see high
Yea nigga I'm a blow you bitch
Blowing money, blowing strong
What's all that blow
All them blow days gone
You're the whore
Had to give me some of the blow
So I went to California
Bought a California
I just want to blow their brain
Infatuated with old mercy

Make me feel the power
Blow that money every hou

I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it

Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
What I spent today I spent it in a month I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!

Put VVS's and my watch is presidential
If I fuck yo bitch you tell me can you keep it confidential?
Ain't no pressure on my presidents, these Franklins are official
And my coupe is so official, riding round with all my pistols
30 round that clip from since the day one
I add-on all my whips, I never trade one
I'm doing 100 miles I'm on the streets and I ain't racin'

You already know the niggas that roll with me ain't nothing but robbers
You already seeing this ice that I got on, it's looking like water
'Cause already knowing this Audemar cost me like two quarters
Already knowing we jumpin on the plane, we gettin' the charter
You already knowin' I gotta get paid, so send my deposit
I seen the smoke, it was rising
Burn down the house, I was vibing
Come through the hood, I was sliding
A nigga be dead if he try me
Got a beautiful chick sitting beside me
I came from the creek, it was violent
Police in the street tryna find me
You put me on charts and I climb 'em
I was ducking them narcs, I was grinding
Now I jump 'cross the stage like I'm flying
I go harder and harder with timing
I'm just filling the void, I can't hide it
I'm just taking the poison and I know it

My bitch know every time we go out shopping I spend over a quarter
Big pole, sippin' and whippin' the gold, you know how I'm vibing
Sitting low, high in the back, when I pull up the Maybach be gliding
You see how I came with that Dolce, I pulled up on low, my diamonds gon' cloudy
This big gasoline when I roll up
Them V12 machine when I roll up
Pineapple pink when I roll up
Just try not to faint when I roll up
Step in the paint like I 'post up
Hopped off the train and I growed up
I was catchin' the MARTA and growed up
When I pull out garage, the door's up
I pull out a four door and chauffeur
The Lambo a topic, don't fold up
Stop all the faking and posers
I'm the only one slangin' that raw dust
Your homies playin' with that raw 'tuss

Pussy good and her throat deep
Sucked so long, made her nose bleed
I ain't savin' no slutty, I hit her and her and her buddy
Bought the freak a little puppy but she ain't nothin' but my cuddy
I can't wife no thot, suck my dick till she see snot, huh
Came from out the slums, fuck these thotties 'cause I'm hot

Did a donut out the lot soon as I turned out the parkin' lot

Check her phone, I think she tryna scam
I ain't tryna save these hoes, no thank you, ma'am
I hit that nanny on green-green, swallow my cum, no ring-ring
Red Ferrari a mean ting, I got a mean ting
Came with her panties, I gave her some lean-lean
I gave her the clean-clean
She want that molly, I gave her a green bean
She took off her wing-wings
I had to put her inside of the Bentley thing
Fucked up her Maybelline
Maybe she think she more than what she is
Maybe she thinkin' queen
Maybe she think Civil gon' save her
Maybe she fuckin' 'round with the neighbors

Go Harder,Pluto,2012.0,"I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
I done been lost, I done been crossed
I done heard all kinds of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder

You can't break me, I'm solid, I go hard body
Can't break me down I break laws, don't never abide by it
I let my hater be my motivator and keep grindin'
I make my moves when I wanna make my moves
'Cause I ain't even tryin' to
Listen to no other nigga talkin bout, what he gon do?
And he lyin'
I see it if I want it ima get it straight up buyin' it
I learned that free band shit cuz Freebandz
Shit clothing line I designed it
Ain't thinking bout the 13 years to see 'bout a young nigga flyin' in
This G5, G6 classified I don't hit the bullseye
When you spread the rumors make sure
You tell them I'm a multi millionaire, ain't playin' fair
Touch ya bag, I don't even care
'Cause I can wake up any day travel anywhere

I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
I done been lost, I done been crossed
I done heard all kinds of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder

They try to show and prove, you'd rather see me lose
But I refuse to lose, I run on jet fuel
I'm makin' major moves, you tryna peep the move
I dropped ten hits, I got 'em real confused
I hear they my enemy, I make them in my sleep
That's all you want from me, I know I'm makin' history
I know you greasy and you greedy
But I'm a genius and I been fiendin' to set the streets on fire
You can catch me flyin by
Ain't got no time to stop to kick the bobo
With ya boy, my time is very precious thats right every second
Too many hard times I'm thinking bout investments

I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
I done been lost, I done been crossed
I done heard all kinds of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder

You watch me go through hell, you see me run through them bales
You know I hit them corners everyday and caught them sales
You hatin' mutherfuckers don't wanna see a kid prevail
Got hit up wit that shell now my CD on the shelf
If I can take a bullet then I can take the rumors
Through all the losses I never lost my sense of humor
I kept pushin' you kept lookin' hopin' I fall
Even at my worst I'm at your best, laws and all
Through scares and all, I'm standing tall I won't fold
I got money coming out my pores, music and my soul
I run the globe, I'm in my mode, this ain't no flow
Throughout the riches, I know that road

I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder

Trapped out, I'm on CNN, spaceship I done went to Mars
Gotta model bitch who can take the dick, got a gutter bitch who can take a charge
Went to Paris on a weekday, and I'm coming back in a couple months
Everyday I wake up, I'm drinking lean, I'm smoking blunts
Dropped out of my high school, then I went and copped me a drop top
Got residue on my dreadlocks, my whole style unorthodox
Trading in my hand scale, started selling them big bells
30 bricks by 30 bricks, I could sell a nigga some oatmeal
Sell a nigga some horse feed, cashing out for a hundred pounds
Sell a nigga some A-1, I'll cook it up for you right now

I'm taking off like MJ, my check game like Nike
Anytime I get that cash, that cash make me hyphy
I'm jumping off my products, stacking up my dollars
I stay chasing that guala, ain't no turning up my collar
Represent my city, nigga want game gotta pay pesos
That pink inside my Styrofoam, got yellow bones on my iPhone
Running up like a treadmill, conversation gotta pay bills
Everything I wear nigga is Ferragamo in public
High top Margiela's, thousand dollars for a sweater
Money talk no pressure, everything disrespectful

They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""

I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The times I get frustrated, I don't take one
I feel a hit comin', so I went and made one, oh yeah

Dom Pérignon, shake it up and spray it
We ain't nothin' but some champs and thoroughbreds

I been buyin' out the stores, living luxury
I can't forget about the swag champ, OGD
It ain't no competition, I got my mission secured
I gotta make 'em feel it, all the pain I endured

Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too

Lord save you, Lord save you
Ain't stopped by the rendered red lights in the Range coupe
I might shoot off in a Benz, and a Lamb too
I sent a few niggas frowning when I came through
Jealousy and greed, that's what it done came to
I got my proceeds, must've been an angel
I got a Cuban kilo on my fingers
I trapped my whole hood out, turned myself to a star
I'm on point now like I still duck from the law
They gettin' mad at us 'cause my niggas won't fall off
My niggas Cash keep the Actavis with him by the bar
I know they see me out in Aspen, they said it was luck
Be honest to me

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness

Ey, it's been a long time coming, babe
Oh, I just called to see how you been doin' late
I didn't call to start a new relations, no
It's been a long time coming, babe
(Verse 1)
You ran across my mind, and I ain't trippin'
 canary yellow birds are drippin' off me
I was young when I fucked with you
You wouldn't understand the person that I grown into
I put in overtime inside this vocal booth
It's amazing how crazy in love you wit' the kid
I used to hold you by your waist and you'd look up to the kid
You was out cryin', why you ridin' on the kid
We should've won an award off the movies that we did
We both moved on, I bet you still reminiscing
I hurt you so bad, I just need for you to listen
We was friends before all of this
I wanna see you happy girl no matter who you're with
On some real shit...
(Hook)
(Verse 2)
Over the weekend went to Vegas, crossed my memory
I was taking out the limo thinking
How much you was there for me, I got you forever, wherever
That's just the man in me, I look at you like family
Wanna see how you been doin'
I turned you to a fucking beast
Remember how we ran the streets and fucked until we'd go to sleep
I know you ain't forgot that, I doubt that
Even though that nigga housed that, you still left yo heart back
I'mma wait for you to call back, I'mma fall back
I'm over that, yeah
Ay, let me reflect for a second
Nuttin' serious tho'
I'm happy than I ever been before
You need some help, don't hesitate to hit me up, you know
I ain't on that lil' boy shit, girl I'm just lettin' ya know

Yo what up just hittin' you up say whats good
You know what I'm saying checkin' on you makin' sure everything's straight

I'm from the bottom, you can get your door knocked
We'on't like to talk to cops, even in the road block
I put in more work, went and bought a drop top
New millennium, please don't penny-pinch
I made all the films, I was born a pimp
I'm goin' off the M, I've been in the gym
I've been liftin' money, Metro flippin' money
Perky, sippin' muddy, I'm supposed to flood it
I was over-busted, bust it down and flood it
Everything was dirty, we so star studded

Got my fur drippin', got my nigga sippin'

Drip all over me, you can't roll with me

Run my money up instead, like I'm on a tread
Put your dawgy on a shirt, don't even call the meds
When I'm on a Percocet I might try Qualitest
Usually I be sippin' purple, I'm on pineapple red
All my family call me Pluto, don't you never forget
Don't be fabricated, like I ain't play with the Pyrex
Drop ten thousand on the ground, it's still in the wrapper
I'm a boss, I got the crown, I'm still in the trap
Moonwalkin' with the hammer, plugged in with the scammers
Kill first for Atlanta, serve first in Atlanta
T-shirts in the Lambo, 35 and you can have 'em
Rob coke, you can't have it, gotta re-rock, little daddy

Off the record got my young nigga straight
Straight promethazine, straight Hydrocodeine
Pinky ring clean, straight up Billy Jean
Shout-out Screwed Up Clique, my OG's can't forget
Cuban links on my bitch, cuban links on my bitch
Hibernatin' with your bitch, ridin' round with the stick
Searching 'round for a lick, a half a brick that's a split
No Metro ain't gon' switch it, he switchin' yo' bitch
With another yellow bad bitch, they ain't havin' money like this
They ain't havin' cash like this
You got a Rollie but it ain't this
You got an Audemar, it ain't this
Buy a foreign car for my bitch
Got the yacht, I'm with the shits
Got the trap spot with the bricks
G taught me how to fry fish
White girl givin' Bill Clint'
I'm Hank Aaron up to bat
I'm throwin' slugs for these racks
This chopper tour Iraq
I went up to Jupiter flashing
I make it look good when I'm attackin'
My chain and my rosé a present
I'm havin' my way with some peasants
I told my jeweler ""Baguette it""

Got my bitch a lil codeine, she rock new Celine

I'm 3D, I'm HD, these movies that I make
Can’t see me, you capische
I’m a titan, I fly in, like a pelican
You irrelevant, to a president, on medicine
It’s that kilo, you fuck dingy hoes, el chapo
Young future fuckin’ on pocket holes
We re-up then reload, I blow up, then explode
I'm organized like a crime boss, I'm up there like a mafia

And I got your girl, and I filled her mouth with a lot of cum
I’m rollin’ big blunts, gotta keep some ganja down my lungs
Hard times, turned me to a maniac
My blood line - motion pictures cinematic
Mix it up - mix it up, mix it up
Pour it up - pour it up, pour it up

I was swaggign to the max, I had to turn it to some commas
It fucked wit me a second, got it right back out the jungle
I'm eatin five-star dinners, living like my nigga Stunna
Get some cash nigga, get some fetti get some lumber
Make it rain money, make it hurricane, thunder
Running to the check, while the check steady coming

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more

I was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
Running from polices, jumping over fences
Serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
Taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
The teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
Make your outlook on life different, damn you look suspicious
My granddad died a boss, and that's been on my memory
If you listen closer to me, feel the pain in my delivery
The struggle and the pain, I still remain the same
I'm grinding so hard I'm just strengthening up my brain
Flyer then the plain, moving faster then the train
Get the fuck up out my lane, some things gotta change

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind

And you caught me in so many lies

I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more

Damn it feel like yesterday I'm at the corner store
When the po-po ran up on me in Mexico
I dropped the blow I swear I never ran that fast before
And when I play it back in my memory in the studio
I swear I grind and I grind going hard every time
Going hard on my grind
Selling damaged bricks, shit be at a bunch of licks
I write a hundred songs every time I think of this
Take a 2 liter fill it up with codeine
Let's take a toast to all my niggas who ain't here with me
And I'm a ride I'm a ride
Until the rubber off the tires, only the strong survive

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more

My glasses made from Germany, designer on me permanently
These scars on me permanently, this pain insides burning me
But it ain't killing me, It's boosting up my energy
I'm on my way to Tennessee, doing a show for 10 a key
And these streets they're a beast out here
I don't plan on coming home I might leave you this year
And shawty I know you ride for a nigga
But you get tired of a nigga, tired of crying over your nigga
So many lies, so many broken promises
I hate it come to this, I took you through a bunch of shit
Feel good to your side, I tried to buy you a bunch of shit
But you don't take it no more, you sick and tired of it

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more

I come in a tank, I come with the drank
I come with the drapes, I crush up the face

Gotta stop all the leaks, get caught with the freaks

I pour up codeine, I can't go to sleep
Criminal mind, thanks to the gang, gang
Louboutins, sittin' in a row
Louis Vuitton's, mink on the flows
My migo the coldest, it got me the frozest
I ordered the LOTUS, soon as it touched down, I sold it
The money is stacked up off the ground, you could never fold it
I done got racked up, I done stacked up me a fortune
Colossal, enormous, have you seen my performance
You makin' it drizzle, I got it thunder and stormin'

She came in blushing, she came from Russia
Digital scale, my kind is rare
I had to prevail, I made it through Hell
See the wheel on the right, when you live overseas
Think it came overnight, how I make it look easy
Ain't a regular nigga, I accept that
Got ahead of you niggas and I never took a step back

Came across a fortune

You can press record then
My bankroll enormous
And my girl is gorgeous

Pull up in them Porsches

Hit it with the aviators
Ain't no way you losing
Codeine in my styrofoam
Leaning like a motorcycle
Order me a Bentley

Dolce and Gabbana
Hermes and Dior
I'm dressed so exclusive
This not in your stores
Fresh as Michael Jordan
I think I can fly nigga
Drinking me some dirty
Have you checked my background?

Think I ain't got that pistol
Pocket full of Franklin's
Stuffed in my Versace’s
Lean inside my cup
And I put ice inside my watches
Ordered up that new coupé
I just left the dealer
Ballin' like I shoot hoops
Michael Jordan my nigga
ESPN and Showtime
Want to see my highlights?
Future is a rock star
And I live that high life
Bottles in my section
Didn’t you seen them sparkles
Shawty in Giuseppe's
Ain't that girl a model?
Splurging is a hobby
Money not a problem
Yes I am a rich nigga

YSL high tops, man on fire
Denzel Washington, kid way flyer
Check on your head, young nigga we'll buy you

Adding 30 pounders, it'll cost an extra quarter
25 racks to the future, that's some bill money
Million dollar signature, yeah I'm getting real money

Button-up sweaters, custom made treasures
White canary yellow, purple or the yellow (drink)
Codeine habits, a hundred for the karats
Tuck it in the Gucci shirt cause I don't like to wear it

Thousand dollar shoe game, boosting up my energy
Versaces on the sofa, made the bitch a super soaker
Burberry blazer with the red bottom loafers
Every single color, I'm a free band hustler
YSL cheetah, put my feet inside the jungle
Money over bitches, swear to God I never love them

Red bottoms on like my feet just caught a body

Balenciaga sneakers, stepping on you cockroaches
My chain cost a kilo, that don't include the piece though
That cost another kilo, my watch another kilo
All the girls they love me, I was taught to get money
Look down in my rollie, it's always time to get money

Come show my rings some love, come kiss my chains
When you start comin' on me, just say my name
Come with me to paradise, takin' all my jewels
Ten chains on my neck, feel bullet proof
Don't let them broke bitches get you, don't let them do it
I was in the ghost like Casper then hopped in the Porsche
16 passenger jet, it hold me and my comrades
We got tigers for pets, got a Bugatti in my bookbag
Show my watch love then you gotta show my wrist love too
I took a piss in the coupe, I didn't deny it
I got the cash on me and I can't hide it
After you ride it

Show my chain some love (yeah)
Come show my chain some love, uh
Come give my rings a hug (come give my rings a hug)
Come give my rings a hug, yuh

Your smell it's dangerous
If I fuck on a thot she gotta be Blue Flamin' up
I'm in a executive board with the redskin
Blood out and blood in, yeah we bangers
So much money on me right now I can buy you the world
I got two model bitches I make 'em merge
I told her everything in, what's the word
Come by darling, just to make 'em swerve
These diamond clean, no rough
If it's Céline, ain't worth
I call her back, surprise
We ain't tired of fuckin' in, hope ya hug on me
[Chorus: Future (

You grind til’ you shed a tear, like, why I get put in for
I done it, lost it all, I had no one to call
We living on couches, these niggas ain’t 'bout shit
Take a straight shot to the head, face first sippin' ain’t scared
But it’s time to break bread, she asked how much I need
I’m ‘bout to fuck the hood out this bitch ad roll me some weed
I can’t see it like I want to, but she’s always there for me
It’s been hate the days in the streets and I have nobody
When I'm stressing, I hit her up and then we talk ‘bout it

Last night I passed out mixed for a women
Can’t keep it real with niggas, you got to handle business
You can’t see what I go through cuz it’s covered with all my image
And I love this life, and I won’t trade it for the world
And these niggas fake, that’s why you got to fuck their girls
Get high as kites, and we taking shot’s of syrup
I can’t see myself, if I was looking in the mirror
I don’t understand the haters and I will never understand it
These niggas rather see you fall, than see you standin’
These niggas they'll leave you for dead while you breathin'
I feel like she love me, unconditionally, know I can see it

Break the rules for a boss, make the rules for a nigga
Break the rules
Half a million dollars in the closet in the stash, like some shoes
Break the rules

Cookin' dope, breakin' rules, whip it back, make her choose
Flippin' packs of Peru, can't push that, that's a juug
Sellin' dope at the school just to go get the Jordans
Gotta go get the socks, comin' up off of rocks
Never talk back to cops, comin' up with scenarios
A dope sale opens plenty doors, fish scale with the odor
I'm servin' that Lamar Odom, fuck bitches look like Kardashian
This the type of shit I be on, sellin' ki's off any phone
Pickin' up on the ringer, diamonds all on my finger
Got a half a ticket in singles, tippin' stacks on the stripper pole
Drankin' codeine, nigga pourin' 4's, ballin' hard, nigga, Derrick Rose
Out my trap spot, 24s, we open up, we don't ever close

They can't compare you, Future, now you buy 'em out of tools
You got your barrel Future, promise me you'll never snooze
400 racks in a Nike box, no shoes
A hundred racks inside my pocket, I'm tryna spend it now
A half a ticket in the parkin' lot, I'm in it now
A bunch of dead faces, then we put 'em in the ground
Pour up the medication in the Sprite and stir it 'round
Aye fuck my registration, I'm in them paper tags now
I'm crazier than a mental patient, fillin' up that stash now
Can't think about my past now, all I'm thinkin' is cash now
Hit 'em up and stick 'em up and takin' off my mask now

Permanent Scar,Pluto,2012.0,"And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, you are who you are
And when you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold as your heart, you as cold as your heart

I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties
Goin’ through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete
Wouldn’t believe the half of me
Show and prove, don’t make believe
I’ll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Purer than the rawest coke
This ain’t no shit that I wrote
I’ve been down this road before
And I’ve been on the rollercoast’
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin’ like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' a life sentence and he died
While I’m on the road, doin’ shows, takin’ this ride
I just got word my uncle tried commit suicide
This the second time I’m goin’ back in, the second time
You’ll get a second chance at life, nigga I ain’t lyin’

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

I gots the homies, they could only mean the world to me
And they ain’t comin’ back home, they in the cemetery (rest in peace)
I wish I made this up, it was a fairytale
I know the kingpin’s on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain’t a Tyler Perry
This real rap, real life, it’s very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Wish I could stay in this booth and never come out again
My lil’ cousin caught a body and he’s still fightin’
And I got killaz walkin’ the yard, Future all they recitin’
And I can’t forget you niggas did too much biting
But I ain’t gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

I take a trip, unwrap a gift, run ithere like Emmit Smith
Go to New York with this gift and I come back with a lick
Break bread with my team
Partner money here, here
I ain't come for this, I want my music global
I wanna see people pump their fist
I’m gonna change a nigga life
So he ain’t gotta go through this
Don’t get caught in my fit
Till I’m runnin’ 1 0 6
They tracked me ‘cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect
I stick to the code
I hold a tol on my shoulder
But I will never fold
No snitches allowed, case closed

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart",https://genius.com/Future-permanent-scar-lyrics

Um, that Drunk in Love song, was that your song that Beyoncé and Jay-Z did?
Cause I'm honest, I didn't, when you, they put you on the MTV -uh, what was it-, the top 10 best rappers, I don't know what the number was, I was like 'why is Future on that list?'
Is that, is that, I might've mistaken, I might've read it wrong. I might've seen a one before the five. Is that a fifteen-carat diamond ring?",https://genius.com/Future-the-intro-monster-lyrics
Big Rube Speaks,Honest,2014.0,"I'm stainless
Tempered by earth and flame
Mixed with time and pain
Ingrained with higher purpose know the worth of my name
And the product I done came with
Not blameless for the straps and the dope that I hold
The sacks that I sold
Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food
And her back never lacking of clothes
This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact
Matter of fact it deranges
The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes
We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness
In the back of our minds are the nastiest lines that a dope emcee never came with
Once we get tired of fakin', unchain the beast in the brain that awakens
See the clear path that I used to couldn't see
Be the kind of artist that I thought I couldn't be
Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee
So I purify my soul in the land of the fire
My sweat and my tears dull pain
And the blood that I leave on the battlefield proves what I've always known
I was born to reign",https://genius.com/Future-big-rube-speaks-lyrics

Gave her the game, no round of applause

How you expect me not to sign it all

When I call the shots, they never got crossed
Opinion on me, when I go in the vault

Paradise,Pluto,2012.0,"What up Grandma like
Told you I had to do it
I'm just scared for you baby

I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

I got some money but it’s all dirty
I got a partner doing a James Worthy
And I done took my heart through so many surgeries
Last night I woke up ‘round 4:30
It's hard to go to sleep sleeping with the birdies
These niggas play for keep the streets they real dirty
You have to practice what you preach gone take courage
Your pain running hella deep don't get discouraged
You in the belly of the beast don't get worried You know these niggas play for keeps you still working
You gotta pack miami heat they always lurking
You can't think about the gifts its so many curses

I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise

When you in the game playing foul
I hit a lick for hundred eighty-thou
Blow it in 3 months I'm going out of town
Get two bad bitches and hit Grey Hound
I had to cut the couch down
They tried to burn the cross down
They even tried to bring God down
We shooting for the stars now
We live above the ground, fly from town to town
Riding round the city they treat you like Diddy
With all the crimes you done committed this must be winning
This only the beginning and we ain't even finished
I came from the highway riding with a life sentence, this ain't the ending

I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise
I go through hell so I can walk with you

The Future is Now,Pluto,2012.0,"No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension
Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception
A living lethal weapon
I'm the natural selection
Moving in my own eccentric orbit
A rebel amongst conformists
So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto
4 billion miles away
Do a whole week in one day
Live for keeping it real, you already know what it is
I rarely ever speak without something to say
But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how
Remember one thing I said: the future is now",https://genius.com/Future-the-future-is-now-lyrics

Got a '69 Camaro 'round my muhfuckin' neck
But before you hit a plug, you used to call up your connect
You could tell I fuckin' fish I mean I'm playin' with a check
Got that money on my mind and it's easy to finesse
You got them racks on top on racks, that fish parkayin' is the best
Rockin' Cartier, oh yes, straight like chandelier oh yes
Aquafina clear, oh yes, Future outta here, oh yes
I brought the base with me, you could bet a cake on it

Get Franks, got Macs, wanna play? We ready
Two stacks, three stacks, four stacks
Twenty mil', twenty mil', forty mil', we ready.
One comma, two, comma three, come and get llama get
Llama gotta get a dog, gotta add up digits
Few fishtail I'm too exquisite
Parkay fish, you could try lil' fishes
All these hits until we spend a sack
And since you know we did it
Yeah we did it, too consistent
I stay with it
We don't do it for the fame all we want is guap
We don't do it for the bitches cause we been had blocks

In the club tippin' the bartender with the old money
Cause I gotta keep the new money up in the safe
So I'm up in the VIP givin' out old hundreds
You could see them muthafuckas been around the way
Out on the block, in K-Town with the hustlas
Made it out South, goin' pier up after tier
Made it to the bitches to the strip club
Inside the thong goin' hip up after hip
Dirty money movin' around in the vicinity
If everybody gotta get it they be up in it when they on the grind
This here my play money
Some money I made before '09
If I see a nigga talkin' about I'm broke, I'ma tell a nigga man please
I'm still spendin' bucks from Adrenline Rush and my Slow Jam cheese
Bank accounts don't freeze, cause the flow is too cold
My stacks don't fit in my pocket cause the dough is too old, niggas be tellin' everybody they be ballin' but they don't run it
New paper put up, because I got them old hundreds

For every second I'm in the leather room
My phone up, actin like a piston
You so caught in the present
You don’t wanna stay down for your prison
You bout that drama, drama, I want that llama, llama
Behind these raps behind that trap I ask my baby mama
Go see my vision, my dreams maybe too big for you

I coulda went to war twice andcame back nice
With a few scratches all I need is some green plastic
And I go morherfuckin get that cash

And a whole lotta soul with my voice raspy
I'm gonna try to spit my lung up
When the sun down till it come up, find a way to come up

Money just to burn like a fire in the forest
Holdin' on the cartridge
100 page magazine
Sippin' on codeine so I can make my thoughts clean
I swear if I ain't calm my nerves id click on niggas
I had a issue
Im too ambitious
I painted a picture

With glamour and glitz cause all the shit do is remind me
Bad karma I put in when I was grindin'
Hustle hard taking money this called surviving
You down bad take yo anger then you combine em

Best 2 Shine,Astronaut Status,2012.0,"I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me

They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

I took the profit from the coke and slapped it right on my feet
I tried to hide a half a million cash, it took me some weeks
Man, that bitch got some head so good, you gon' swear she ain't got no teeth
I mixed the molly with the lean, now we laid up in a suite
I'm in the hood posted up, I know the police gon' sweep
I keep a hood ho, so I can keep that dough where she sleep
She down for a nigga and she ride with that four-fifth
I put that AK in her name, but I keep it on me
I'm brand new when I step out from my head to my feet
These niggas studying my photos, trying their best to compete
I got a style so outrageous, I come through like a chief
I'm the commander on these streets, all you niggas know me

I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key

I was selling dope like every day 'til I topped the charts
I serve my same clientele, cause these cars are unmarked
I'm running up to every car before the car even parks
We went from Reebok and Girbauds, now it's Louis Vuitton
You want to be Future, I'll look at you just like you're my son
I got a rap check and all I hang around is ex-cons
And if I ever get in trouble, my bitch gon' pay my bond
I told that bitch I need a yopper and she went to the pawn
And I didn't have to tell her twice, cause it was already done
These niggas showing out for me, so now they ordering up ones
Been on some futuristic shit, now I'm back where I begun

I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me

They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

Put the codeine in the Sprite, and then I'll have me a drank
Smelling like a pound of loud when I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp, in the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign, and I'm cool as you think
You need to turn it to the max if you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club, but she's leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coupe, getting some head from a slut
And she's catching everything, she won't spit it back up
I bought that bitch some red bottoms, cause she's down for the kid
And she owns so many guns, she's worse than Billy the Kid
I put that semi-automatic in her name and she's with it
When you pull up with that cash, she's going to serve you them fishes

I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat

Ain’t Neva Seen,Unreleased Songs,2020,"Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lumber
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
You can’t dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you’ll never go
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before

Cop a H3 with the big tires
I got money that will never expire
Took a chance and I became a idol
Who can do what I do, no rival
It’s just me and all my benjamins
Y’all start right, you need to experience this
4 bitches at once, try that now that’s an experiment
Then I don’t wanna be nowhere but inside this music bizz
I work the work and flip the work and bought me a big crib
I could make the first down to first song the bottom of my list
Talking piss poor, broke when you start thinking you ain’t shit
And then you make some millions off a planet that don’t exist

Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
You can’t dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you’ll never go
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before

Don’t mention even be explained
Bitch I rep that rich game
Close your mouth bitch you can go far
You know what it’s like to roll with a star
I know open doors I can get you chauffeur
We can drive around I don’t touch the wheel
I put swag on you and you taking off, outta here
I got diamonds chains and they put up like souvenirs
I don’t know what to do with money but to stack it up
Came a long way from watching out for them ups drugs
I just seen on drawn the package it’s on the porch
I’m just doing my exercise, finessing the sport

Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry

You can’t dictate the way I move no more

You put me in a trance girl you put me in a trance
Girl you put me in a trance
And I don't understand what happened to me girl
I just wanna be one of your friends
And I don't have to hug you
Long as I get to hold your hand
And don't try to figure out what it is
Baby it's the way you stand
You got me in a trance girl you got me in a trance
Yeah you got me in a trance
I don't know what got into me
Ever since I seen you think you put me out my misery
I'm not concerned with your companion or your history
Cause everytime we're together, I feel the chemistry
I touch your hand, I touch your heart and I might touch your mind
You can't deny the feeling that you're feeling when it's right
I tried to fight it, tried to hide it, swear I tried denying it
Don't have to be with you girl I just wanna stand beside you
You compliment my style, you compliment my whole...
You motivate me in so many ways, I keep on grinding
You shining like a star, you looking like some real diamonds
The way you make me feel I wanna buy you real diamonds
Hey, you put me in a trance, you put me in a
You put me in a trance
You put me in a trance, boy you put me in a trance
You put me in a trance
And I don't understand what it happened to me
I just wanna be one of your friends
And when I put it on you, bet I make you come again
She got too much love potential
She could be the valuest thing ever touched this earth
If she keep me on her temper, she pray for me every single day
During she not at church
I need a friend like you, I would do anything for you
You have this... about yourself that seem to jump on peop
And if you have a man, he would be a fool to leave you
I'm like your biggest fan when I met you how can I... you
I know I rap up for you, I be in our...
I know I trap, I take that dirty money and I clean them
And it ain't this about me girl you know we...
You not a cheater, but sometimes the way I need ya
I haven't seen in you in 2 weeks
It's been so hard in through these days
And if you ever feeling weak, let's go somewhere, run away
And if you ever feeling weak, I make you stronger everyday
And I just wanna see you smiling, and I'm willing do whatever it gonn take
Hey, you put me in a trance, you put me in a

Salute (Mastered Version),UnKnown,2016.0,"Yeah, ey
For real, for real
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Mixin' the soda like hair dye
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

I see your loyalty payin' off
I see your grind been payin' off
I see the dope, been payin' off
I see the plug, been payin' off
I went to work, they were layin' off
Lil shawty be popping them Xans off
Lil mama, she do it the best now
Sucking that dick with no hands now

My lil rider to whack some, I told a young nigga to stand down
Pineapple Fanta, Promethazine on me, get loaded
I told you I'm ready to get it, my nigga, I'm focused
I got way too much juice, niggas can't hold me
Bitches can't hold me, I'm juiced up with shorty
I'm whipping the 'Rari, or the new Maserati
Bust a jug in the West End at the parking lot
Used to sell my crack at Days Inn, had it crazy hot
Styrofoam cups, all I know is I get crazy mail
My partners on dust, they gon' shoot up a whole stadium
I don't trust your baby mama but we made a crazy film
And I smashed her last night on a lot of pills

I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Mixin' the soda like hair dye
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie
This for my young niggas grindin', went snatched them a Rollie

No mercy, no manners, no glory, no story, I'm very important
Protect the sources, I was dippin' the fork, I could jump in the Porsche
When I jumped off the porch, I was selling that crack like that shit was a sport
I was running through bushes, jumping over fences, I gotta get 'way from them narcs
Hey, man I can never get 'way from this art
They treat you like Lord, they treat you like God when you beat the odds
None of my dreams was reality just a few years ago, homie was starvin'
This for my young niggas grindin', went snatched them a Rollie
I feel the weight on your shoulders, I need to blaze up the doja
You need to blaze up the doja, I gotta keep my composure
I gotta keep on goin', come and lay with you early in the mornin'
And when the sun rise, I know it's killing you
I ain't down with you no more
You done caught feelings, you can't take it no more
Me coming through, smashing, leaving right back out the door
I could tell it's somebody else you spending your time with
I'm just tryna find me somebody else I can grind with
You want me acting like a nigga on some nine to five shit
Ain't tryna treat you like no side bitch, but you my bitch
Diamonds on your ankle, baby, walk light
I been in the kitchen cooking all night

I see your loyalty payin' off
I see your grind been payin' off
I see the dope, been payin' off
I see the plug, been payin' off

They goin' crazy bout the new ice
Homie still talkin' old times
We ain't too impressed by the old hype
Young gunna with your head now he gonna knock it off for the new hype
Fishscale in my blind sight
Been a visionary from the start
I'm the type to give away the limelight
20 cars in my new garage
Got em laying out like a club night
My Oakland homie told I'm ""hella tight""
My hippie homie told me take a flight
Future need to go and take the acid
Future need to go and take the shrooms
Standin' on the sofa drinkin' Dom Perignon, strapped up with the Uzi
Step aside when I'm on the move
Pay attention cause I got the juice
You can feel my presence in the room

Ain't none of your ex's my enemy
They damn sure ain't no friend of me (No)
What got me to this point?
I'm really fuckin' with you, spendin' cash on that ass
Got to layin' up with you, pulled off when I smashed
You let me have my way, I got this good girl goin' bad
I ain't treat you like trash, what I'm really tryna ask
What it do, baby?

Then I copped the coupe for you no time
Then I copped a Rollie for you both times
Then I stepped your fashion game up lately
I'm just tryna ask you, what it do, baby?
What it do, baby? What it do, baby?

Down & Out,Unreleased Songs,2020,"When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, haann
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies, Ahhhh

More money more problems, man this shits hilarious
I got baby mama drama, this shit embarrassing
Once you get the fame, it’s consequences that come with it
Sometimes you wanna wake up and just say I’m done with it
You know all these dudes I paid
Now you do the most complaining
Now I made it and I’m famous
Emotionally you drain me
I smoke a pound of that kush
And blow out the stress I’m thinking
I put versace on leather cover me like a blanket
I sip on codeine, I’m sippin it till my body numb
And I get loaded like baby gangster vl shawty
Remember shoppin at linnicks, I let you hold the 40
I’m a superstar and now you wish you can take it from me

When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,Ahhhh

Getting high, drinking, smoking, rolling up the purple
And I swear to god it'll hurt me more to hurt you
Grinding, hustling we ain't never take no nights off
Money came flipping, switching, tryna cut my lights off
Fight and make up, shoes, 1000 on the make-up
Pouring drank, to hold me down like an ankle
Tunnel vision on that money, fuck that talk
In the club, twisting fingers, getting twisted
Off that dark, water
We was down and out, we had to plan it out
Me and shawty getting ghost, spoil the phantom out
Quarter million on the car, silk medusa sheets
Before I made a dollar, I was lying to the streets

When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,Ahhhh",https://genius.com/Future-down-and-out-lyrics

Have you ever took a shroom? then you Miley Cyrus

Sipping purple, sipping yellow, 24 out today
Smoking on that California, first thing when I awake
Sound of the wife it go, you can call me Future blake
I heard she like to hit the flake, I heard she like to sip the lean
‘Bout to take her to the moon, I’ma fuck her on the bean

I know Scotty and I’m fresh in European

I would never be sober until I’m dead (ain’t no lie)

I keep it interesting
For her, it’s no finessing
She love my style so when she shop, she let me do the dressing
She shoulda learned her lesson, fucking with me is a blessing
Infatuated with my presence, now she feel neglected
I bought her so many presents, it’s one to break there
She been a1 with a nigga since the first day
Just to pack it, she gon’ pack it in her purse
I got her jewels, she ’bout to pull up with that work

I bought that bitch a crib, been some years since I’ve seen her
I know I’m coming there and hey, I might need her
A gift and a curse when you’re fucking with a hustler
She know I got a curse, she just want me to fuck her
And you still hurt me when I lie to her

Snap back leanin' - lyin' face, dangle from my rope
Get to know the meaning
Me and Future, chopper in my coat, while we both be leanin’

Picking up all of this money like it’s only dough I’m sweepin’
Grippin’ up all of this money like you know we only eatin'
Grabbin' up every bag, fuck the talk, we beastin'
Your memory is really gramp, why waste time competin’?
And I know you thinkin' it’s funny - close your mouth
I'm only here to get this money, the fuck you talkin’ ‘bout?
And never doubt we gettin' this dough ‘til it hurts your head
‘Til my accountants fall asleep while they count the bread

Watch when he pull up on ‘em, all the ladies push up on him
Doin' curls with the money, bench press two million
Pull up on ‘em, Rolls Royce, thinkin’ like ten million
Never answer my phone, only pick up when that money ring
Sit up on the stairwell, look at that money ring
Tits around the town, workin’ my cow, ankle weight
Ship it in, lots of pounds, I don’t need an anchor, wait
Break it down, stretch it out, punch it up, work it out
I remember pullin’ up, now all I do is pick it up
First we train the money, it come every day
Thank goodness for my hustle, thank God I got my muscle
I'm ‘bout that cream, a bitch’ll never milk me
Fuck being clean, I’d rather be filthy

Your heart ain't gotta be in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit

I'ma flood some ice on both of my wrists
I'ma flood that ice on both of my wrists
Baby came over, she a new vibe
Baby came over, she a new vibe
Tell me that you ready for the turn up right now like me, just like me
Don't tell me that I fuck you so good, you don't wanna leave, you don't wanna leave
Got a case of Hennessy in the fridge on chill for you
You need to call up some more girls, tryna feel on you
Pretty girls they in my collection, baby don't get caught out there flexin'
And you got that Birk' on your shoulder, and I got them racks, won't fold up
You can't pick a hood don't know us
You can't pick a hood don't know us
You can't go nowhere and they don't know us
You ain't for them lights and the cameras when I roll up
So I fuck your main thing to keep her composure
Rollin' up dodie, and I'm gone off soda
Don't I keep that red drink with me like Piru?
Then I put them solitaries in it, go to Cancun
Fuckin' on the sand, baby they don't understand us
Fuckin' on the sand, baby they don't understand us
Christian Louboutins on your feet when you stand up
Now I'm gettin' fed up, cause tryna bed fuck
Actin' like a nigga don't know she bout a dollar
Actin' like nigga ain't got no models
I'll fuck a pop star at this time here tomorrow
These girls walk around, these strip clubs ours
Goin' out the country, get that dirty money, gotta watch who did the laundry
I gotta get it rainstorm, sleet, or sunny
I gotta chase this mofuckin' money

I ain't talked to shawty in a few days
But you already know, girl I been missin' you
I ain't talked to shawty in a few days
But you already know, girl I been missin' you
Keep some pretty shit at the condo
Got some thick shit on the bed with her legs open
Bitch came through for a few, that's a layover
Bitch came through for an hour, that's a layover
What you been doing? I been chillin' at the crib, poolside with some pretty-pretty bitches tryna get a tan
Had some Chinese freaks come over to the crib last night just to fuck, 
Had them Chinese freaks come over, tried molly, now they wanna ask Shoota ""Do we got them xans?""
Tell me you don't want no parts with this
Tell me you don't want no parts in this
Tell me your heart ain't in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit
Your heart ain't gotta be in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit",https://genius.com/Future-layover-lyrics

Take her out of Bakers, now she shop at Jeffrey's
I'm on a roll, gettin' money, got a bad recession
What type of nigga you know in the middle of the hood worth some tickets?
What type of nigga you know sell out shows play with fishes?
Gucci, Louie, Prada, that's the way a nigga kick it
I got a whole bird on me, nothin' to be specific
Ice, ice, ice like I jumped in the Pacific
Money, money, money, man that shit comin' in digits
I got 50 cents on me on my way to Walt Disney
That's a whole 50 racks, young nigga with the business

Slow gift wrap, need a Christmas card
Champagne pours, I christen y'all
You niggas hatin', I'm liftin' off

In them Porsche Panameras that we wheelin' out

I'mma make it rain and I'mma take the train
I'm Latino, got razor blades, okay chico, but it ain't to shave
I got pesos, I got pesos, bad hoes by the caseload
And she gonna get a face full, and she gonna get a face full
So pardon if the kid narcissistic
I'm shinin' bright, it'd be hard to miss it
I heard y'all in Target thriftin'
While I'm buyin' out the whole Garment District
No room in the whole room
Don't clean clothes, I hit show room

Cheat a lot 'cause I'm good at it
Fuck a bitch for her bank account

I'm king baby, David Yurman
I'm a space cadet, ain't even human
Adios, it's six to six

In the air with the Kush and plane
Take a pain killer, take away the pain!
Real street, nigga, take away the fame
I switch lane with your main dame
Rock Chuck Taylor with the spikes on em
My ear lobes got ice on em
My main thing with ice on em
With a big bag and some red bottoms
I spit fire, that real love
I'm a superstar, now I'm a real problem
I'm in the club, seen a hundred bottles
Seen a hundred bitches and they're all models
Champagne, pour it like it's water!

I turn up, I turn up, it's no one can compete
I broke the knob off and they vanished, capisci?
I can't see you, even though you see me
I'm back on my one-two, hooking up Peru
More money, more problems, what am I to do?
I'm inside the zoo, I'm gone on that screw
Guerrilla warfare, chopping it loose!

Designer my clothes, we pouring up fours
My jewelry froze, make commas and Os

Puttin bitches on detail, just so I can eat well
We cooking up that fish scale, its going on retail (ya ya)

All this dope on me, I'm bout to explode
I got a bomb on me, now and go straight to the bowl
I had to cook it up myself and bring it all back
It hit the block every day, nigga run up them stacks
He jumped it all he jumped it all like me (like future), nuh-uhhh
Our house is a 100 degrees (straight up), where I'm from
I put that kush in my lungs, I count up chips
Water water water, bag up them zips
Work your wrist, cook that fish, 36, in a brick
Get a flock and make a fist, get a pot
Find a bitch, open shop, this ya spot, at her house, trap it out

Stacking cake like leggos, all that work is paid for
We're cashing out and lay low, pockets in the kitchen
More touchdowns than Ocho, we don't never close
24, uncold, ice like super bowl
Talk to migo, tell him bring that twerkalator
Make sure the fish A-1, Make sure this fish
You gotta have that clean when you remix
I could put a brick together like a puzzle
I'm in the middle of the street with j's' in a huddle
My clientele love me, I don't have to touch em
This money coming in, nigga I can't trust ya

I'm starting to work off the boost since my mix-tape got leaked
It was soft, now it's hard like concrete under your feet
I turned my grandma house to a drug store, we're serving all week
What your order is, I pay the water bills (round here), water crystal clear
Dope is out of here, I got that Earl Manigault jumping out the gym
Straight drop glass, 
Smoke up smoke up smoke up, if you a smoker
I got that crack for you in my toaster
If you get too close, sir, I'ma have to roast ya
Have the cash in your hand when you approach a roller

Feel like I've been here forever
I came in with gun powder on my beather
Already knew you wasn't on my level from yo schedule
Before I settle I chased that cheddar
I wake up every day tryin to better myself and all my fellas

And it ain't all bout glame and glisten cause I'm a treasure

It was cloudy around my way I gride hard and never settle
Say when it rains it pours and now its bottles galore
I have done counted so much cans that my hands are sore
We went from rags to riches, two thousands pounds of midget
We got ARs everywhere them hundred round biscuits

I got every car you want in my garage
She gotta fattie on her like Nicki Minaj
I copped a car and then I fucked her cuz I'm naught
(Yea nigga)
I was ridin' round my hood with narcotics (Yea nigga)
I got 36 ounces in my pocket

I'm saucin' yea I'm hard to kill I got these mils yea
I took the gang off the planes and jumped on Leers‚ yea
I told the jeweler‚ told my niggas this our year yea
Zona stacked his first mil I'm so proud yea
Metro spent 3 on a crib he so out here
Ain't no sauce‚ ain't no loss, plenty more sauce, oou!
Push to start‚ man  fuck them narcs, we take off
I got activis, color Randy Moss
30 chains on‚ ten rings on
Zona stacked his first mil, told ya I'm proud of him
Poppin' them seals, in Beverly Hills
My clarity clear (yea yea)
My diamonds are real (lets go)
Serve you some whip
Then take me a trip
I rap over scores, like it's a gift
It came with a stem
A thousand-one grand
I left in a Rari
Came back in a Lamb
I'm truly excited
My niggas get money (I'm that nigga)
Stash in the walls
All one hundreds
The coupe got frog eyes
I'll get ya hog tied
I know when one ride
Nigga we all slide
I'm trying to keep it so real with you
We kinda pulled off a miracle
We need some fresh new material
Cuz niggas ain't got nothing to live for
You can't be throwin' up money
Then goonin'
I'll keep it all the way real with you
I love to see when my niggas get money
I'ma keep it all the way real with you
Whole lot of loyalty, love, and honor
We gonna be hard to deal with
If you gotta put a hit out on your honor
Just know, nigga I'm still with you
Left, right wrist glowin
I can't keep it no more real with you
I keep codeine pourin'
Let me pop a pill with you
My young nigga locked behind the bars
I was trappin' first, then made myself a star
Baking Soda, cocaina on your heinous
Fuck being neutral, I'm exclusive
You can't find us
Cuban links, dipped in diamonds
Change the climate
That molly exclusive
Fuck yo bitch, cuz she basic
I catch you hatin'
I'ma stab you up, like Jason
We got drug relations
Can't hear our conversations
We do home invasions
But that's just on occasions
Know what they do to snitches
When they sign them papers
Heard they found yo momma
But I din't tell em rape her
Rather have my dogs with me
Than have them in the cages
Make you get all of this pain
To feel the rock and cradle
Cut it off you fucking snake
You motherfucking traitors
My words will have you devastated but how can you blame us
You need to be decapitated boy you tried to play us
I'm having evil thoughts about you, better come and pay up
I'll pop a Desert Eagle at ya, ain't no one can save ya
Check my AP, I'm so loaded
Fuck yo bitch, she so bogus
My lil bitches yea
I buy them Rollies
Fuck yo clique, fuck yo OG
Stuff my blunts, three grams of OG
Shake em off, can't let you hold me
I came to stunt so hard on you, call the police
She swiped the cards, I fucked her with my brothers
A pound of OG, I smoke it I ain't sell it
I know some felons, take furs and melons
Buss down the prezi

Penetration, can you take it?

Too much money in the closet, girl I gotta switch safe
Change the tail number to the flight, girl I gotta switch planes
I seen a triple homi' on the news, they was in the wrong place
I ain't giving up on you, but we gotta take a break
Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot, I'm on acid
I was raised up on pork & bean no catfish
I need a prenup if you the wifey
I know your true love is making money

So Cold,1000 ,2010.0,"When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold

Walk like a ball player, talk like a migo
Watch worth a bale and my neck on a kilo
Guacamole stuffed in the TRUs you can see notes
Long wave racks on that alley where I trick her
Strong in my system I can barely even see ya
Young fly mamasita slice it like pizza
Heard she was a diva and i did her with my people
Didn't your wifey tell you how we fucked and had a threesome?
Didn't your wifey tell you how the ice shine brightly?
Didn't she tell you 'bout the Audemar or the Breitling?
She told me how the diamonds had her dripping wet excited
Smashed her in the studio and kicked her out politely

When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold

Yeah, I don't gliss, I shimmer got them hoes in a Venom
Finna fuck 'em 'til I can't remember could of been January, May, June or December
A1 Freeband gang, nigga I'm a member
Get money in the fall, spring, summer and the winter
Been around the world on a gangster adventure
California so loud you can smell the picture
VVS's on meth, you can see the crystals, my neck in a blizzard

When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold

Military training got my Gucci army hat on
Gucci belt holding up the TRUs that I have on
Gwualla in my pocket poking out like Offset
Fuck my bitch friend have my old girl upset
Old school Corvette '65 pace car
Money going round and round fast like NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt sponsored by the bud
Ice light up cause I'm sponsored by the drugs
La familia nigga I'll explain later
100 thousand on the whip and I didn't have to save up
Movie star, rock star, cocaina flavour
I love the money so much it's hard for me to cake up

When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold",https://genius.com/Future-so-cold-lyrics
Rocky,Unreleased Songs,2020,"Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money
Even if I fall, I'm gonna land on a bed of hundreds
I know something, mama's life will never flourish
I swear to Lord, I just left the bank
Hungry for more, wearin' designer galore
Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got this fight in me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin' shit, Rocky Balboa

Give me a set of keys or a melody and I'll go crazy
I'm blowin' trees in my fatees ain't no Fugazzi
Even in them A1's I'm sure I got the same bipolar
The super charger going stupid hard, now I'm pullin' up in the drops homie
You ain't never been this high
Good thing I got, I'mma own me a car lot
Spit fire to the studio, just like a trap spot, I've been fly
Ask cop guy, no lie
Went from getting a house bust to bustin' a stadium
Only take a day off, getting them Benjamins
Runnin' this trick, I'm runnin' up in the mills
It ain't low key and that's new lingo, new millennium
I'mma spit a verse, I drew my 10 and i don't take this life for granted
Blood sweat and tears ain't just happening
I'm a free band nigga with a plan

Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money

Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got this fight in me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin' shit, Rocky Balboa

With my back against the rope, selling dope, baking coke
Child support, no support
I still had hope, I always spoke
Banished into existence
I never lost faith, I kept my place
Paper chase every day
It's we sensei but it's why I stay
And I go ape behind this cake
I stay laced, look at my face
I can't see you, money in the way
I'm up to date in outer space
A new regime, a brand new day
I'm infamous, got lion trace
What I'm tryna say I'mma keep that fire inside me til my heart decay
Went from sellin' yay (so what?)
To sellin' verses (true story!)
The gift, the curse, I done been through the worst
They let the real for real surface
100 million dollars is my only damn purpose

Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money
Even if I fall, I'm gonna land on a bed of hundreds
I know something, mama's life will never flourish

Have a few chains on, I don’t have but one
Bought a few houses and I never sleep at one
And I can have ten cars and I wouldn’t drive one
And when you make it from the bottom you the chosen one

Rich nigga since birth, Louis V chinchilla
Bought a brand new Rover, drive it like a 4 wheeler
Solid gold: AP, flooded out with them crystals
Shinning just like molly, I woke up in a new bugatti
Free lil Kirk Wood, Young Gotti, free my nigga White Boy too
I whipped up a two and a baby and I spent that on Jimmy Choo
You got goons around you nigga, I keep shooters around me fool
Im a young rich nigga from the bottom I came up and I can’t lose

And you hate to see me winnin'
I'm a millionaire, you can't doubt it
Rich Gang, I'm 'bout it
Bossed up my status
I know you want my spot

I'm the flyest nigga on earth, and my money always come first

Buy some ice and ride foreign, That's the way it go
Hit the club and buy the bar, That's the way it go
VIP, we usually stars, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go

Either way it go, I'ma smoke a pound of kush
Got a redbone on my line, like to fuck wit crooks
She gotta brain on her, suck a good dick and read books
I'll take lil shawty shoppin, cause I like the way she look
I could put up wit her attitude, plus she ain't a stalker
Inside the cup pink, and I'm playing  wit them dolphins
Ridin' fresh as hell, money in the glove compartment
Goin' cross town, to meet the bitch in her apartment
Got my jewelery on monster, flexin in my Burberry
Saks Fifth shoppin', twenty bags I ain't carry em
Jumpin out the Porsche Cayenne, zippin thru traffic

My English broke, so I'm slurring words
Imma zoo keeper, I'm holdin' birds
My swag absurd, can't be put in words
You old rappers, kicked to the curb
Now the way it go, about 3 or 4
I'mma probably leave wit bout 3 or 4
And they followin and they swallowin
I gotta house so big can't find em in
Or I could get a room and just pile em in
Gucci Mane switchin' up the style again
Gotta hunned mill on my mind again
I'm icey bitch, go blind again

Ion drink unless it's dirty, and I'm higher than a hawk
White and red tiger stripes, I'm in the Aston Martin
I put the roof inside the trunk, the kush be stinkin' like a skunk
I'm the clouds, just what I want. Today I smoked a hundred blunts
I took this bad bitch to lunch, she been hittin' me for a month
Had to make some time for her, I been busy all this money
If I ain't outta town doing shows, you know what I be on
From Benihana to the Intercontinental draped in stones
Wit a pretty yellowbone, and she hold a nice tone

Yellow Blue White three stripes Adidas suits
All day I dream about selling dope like shootin’ hoops
One day you dreamin’ then you wake up to reality
First you lose your heart then your true friends disappear
I was already shinin’ fore I got here
I told myself I’ll get my feet off ground I’m goin’ outta here
I’m taking some people I never would thought even be here

Thousand dollar shots on my face, I'm coolin' it

Alot of people talk that loyalty don't know what it is
Have you ever been so broke you don't even wanna live?
So fucked up to the point that funerals can share the tears
Gotta grind so fucking hard the shit bring you to tears
Forgot to call my momma on her birthday God bless the kid
Phone barely ringing now it's ringing till it's dead
I'm bout to run dem m's up mutha fuck the feds
Got my money in a wall, ain't fucking up my bread

Man fuck yo attitude, you 'bout to make me fuck your friend
I should've been ashamed, bitches fucking bitches too

I told 'em I retired, I wanna thank them for the kilos
I can't never forget, what I went through for me to be here
On my metro, I was working, I was serving
I go cutthroat, when I'm down and I'm hurting
This a special moment, and we taking full advantage
100 dollar Future, I'll pass them out to all my family
I got this one bitch, I'll put her in the red bottoms

When the money come, hater come and you keep some soldiers
They gonna knock a nigga off for you
Just to say they told you
I'mma get the office in the building to make my quota
I can't never have no feelings for bitches, they so rogue-ish
Trying to come to the club with a nigga to get exposure
I'mma buy shawty a bag, I feel sad for her
She can't come around a rich nigga rocking a Coach

Started smashing late night, she was average
Took her on a few trips with me, she extravagant
Let her spend the night, she a overnight celebrity
First time I seen it online, went and copped it
Oh, you want that Bentley coupe? I keep that in my pocket
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, I ain't ever had a wallet
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, I ain't ever had a wallet
Calling up the chauffeur cause I'm fresher than a pilot

On 2 Us,Dirty Sprite,2011.0,"I just bought a new watch
I think they on to us
I got four or five spots
I think they on to us
All we drive is foreign cars
I think they on to us
Every time I'm in the club I'm with a foreign brand
I swear they on to us

AP or Frank Muller I got choices
I'm in the car by myself I'm hearing voices
Lamborghini, Bentley Coupe, Bentley, Rolls Royces
Gotta the way entourage attracts the task forces
Hand the kush out the DJ booth make it rain
If they find out we in, I might lose my chain
Things might change
Gave the waitress Ben Frank for a drank
She kept the change
Is he rapping? Is he trapping? Bitch, I'm in my own lane
Driving down 75 in a foreign vehicle
On my way to my people
I close examine every vehicle
I can't say what it is right now
I can tell it something fishy going on
Esco and I smell it

I just bought a new watch
I think they on to us
I got four or five spots
I think they on to us
All we drive is foreign cars
I think they on to us
Every time I'm in the club I'm with a foreign brand
I swear they on to us

Spent 5 bands on a fit and wore it for three days
I got 3 main bitches ain't no telling where I stay
Hit the studio all day to stop myself from catching plays
I know the alphabet they looking for the rappers with them K's
My life is more than a stage paranoid why you watchin
Is you watching me preform or is you watching cause you copying
Try to convict me on the ice: I'm rocking
Could it be my ears
Man tell me what it is all these damn designer gear
I'm bout to stop rocking jewelry I can't tell who people is
Just by looking in the crowd you looking blurry over here
Something bout to happen in a minute I can't tell it
Something fishy going on X-Rayed and I smell it!

I just bought a new watch
I think they on to us
I got four or five spots
I think they on to us
All we drive is foreign cars

So I could make that dough at home, I’mma post up in that pent house
Never talk on the phone less you want to end up in that big house
Stack that paper, pig out, go hard keep it loud
Never turn it down, go to bed press pause

Swap It Out,Astronaut Status,2012.0,"Said I'll swap it out
I'm swapping everything out here brand new

I swapped out my true religions
Put on my robin jeans
I swapped out dat clean sprite
Mixed it with codeine
I swapped out it old school
Pulled up in dat new thing
I swapped out a Puerto Rican
And now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame
Now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe
Cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe
Make my pockets fatter
Swapped out dem vv ones
Now I got better carots

I went psycho with dat sprite
I went a drug addict with dat sprite
I Got hoes dat like to dike
But to tell you the truth they fly like kites
I got bad bitches who write
Went to space and took a flight
Yeah I'm fly but ain't no kite
Cause they're too short for my life
I'm on Pluto
You on Earth
I had burberry at first
Now it's Pluto on my shirt
I don't go crazy
I'll go berserk
Had to maro hard top
Pull da rari with da vert
I'm the king in my hood
Aye da globe is my turf
See me rocking diamonds
You know the diamond's very bright
Had to swap out the mid
Then we start sellin white
I was true religion saggin
Now dem robins on me nice
Paid the cash in, cash now
All I do is swipe

I swapped out my true religions
Put on my robin jeans
I swapped out dat clean sprite
Mixed it with codeine
I swapped out it old school
Pulled up in dat new thing
I swapped out a portal beacon
And now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame
Now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet ho
Cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe
Make my pockets fatter
Swapped out dem vv ones
Now I got better caarots

I swapped my Louis scarf for Alexandra Macqueen
I just brought a sprite and it's no longer clean
Was a true religion kid that I designed for my jeans
Hey I run ATL
Man I feel like a king
I'm red bottom walking when I walk on the fly
Rosalina popped a pill
Now I'm no longer tired
Marijuana in my system
You can see it on my eye
I've got a pocket full of hundred man
I feel like plies
I was old school shopping
Na da rari what matters
I once trip off light
Now I'm in Pluto forever
Yellow Stone, White Stone
Stepping up on my bezel
I vvs the face
Took out canary yellows

I swapped out my true religion
Put on my robin jeans
I swapped out dat clean sprite
Mixed it with codeine
I swapped out dat old school
Pulled up in dat new thing
I swapped out a portal beacon
And now I'm talking Japanese

Stress all in a nigga shoulders, feel it in my backbone
Trials and tribulations taking the pain with an advil
Rich gang la familia, last night was mad real
Texts in my phone playing jealousy and hatred, misery loves company

You can take a nigga heart but you can't the mind

It's Klein-Davis, I'm fucking up club sofas
With my  bustin roaches with ashes on ashes
Spaceships and stars, I see snakes in the yard but I can deal with 'em
These bitches eat pussy better than me, I choke her while I fuck her, can't nobody do it like me

What the fuck I was on man? I'm tripping off that good codeine and kush
Fuckin' up  Imma' keep it on pushing cause it ain't fuckin' up my limits
Turn my weakness into strength, now forever scripting
Let a hoe ride first class put your shit in the bentley, man what's goin' on?

Hah, yeah, yeah
What's wrong with the Earth
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hah, hol' up

You niggas ain’t nothing but some punaany
I’m laying up with a cuban
The dash in the coupe over 200
My chain and my watch are a tsunami
I ran the game for a few summers
Still get that hunger for new money
In the back of the ghost get some shuteye
I’m the same one that trap a hotel out
I’m the one that had the motel jumping
Give me that yay imma sell some
We close it up when the feds come in
We leave the scene when the shells droppin
I had a ...?
I sell a key in the middle of the week
Flatline a nigga in the middle of the street
I come from the mud out the middle of the creek
Got a C on my shoe, got a B on my seat
That Chanel evidently, I pull in the Bentley
I wasn’t trappin i’d be on my pennies?
I just be laid up at night with the semi
I wrap it up like a pollo
I got that red on some lean it’s some oil
I wrap the bands up, aluminum foil
I get a ticket forreal for a chorus
Aye, I’m hot and important
I jump out the lamb and go hop in the porsche
I fill up a soda with nothing but that codeine
I plain jane the AP and flooded the rollie
I get that dope in the ?
I got you dead on the blow
I sell ya uncy ya aunti  ya mama

Yea let the endo burn

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me

I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want 'em
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason

Got it out the mud
FreeBandz Gang

Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS wrapped around the Breitling with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud

LeBron on the front, Kobe on the back
I’m the astronaut kid money way taller than Shaq
Before on rap on the track, got her standing on the track
Nigga Cocaine mafia, jumping off packs
Forgiato with the skinny tires, they lookin’ flat
I see you looking real goony eyed
I’m lookin’ back, I be running through the pack to DMV
Used to catch the flight to AZ with fake ID
They ain’t never gonna  that got my nigga killed
Represent for the game cause thats how a niggas built
Go and spend a 5th at Fifths, run it up and take a trip
Leaning off four zips, riding in a spaceship

Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud

I got it out the money, that nasty ass money
Brown paper bag ole dope boy money
Foreign with the frog eyes, Bentley with the big head
Fast lane with no hands, counting money with both hands
On the road with checks like a motherfuckin’ mailman
Started from hundred, no-one gave me shit
I jugged off bricks, Got rich off bricks
Forgiatos on that jag I cashed out off a lick
So many bands in my pocket make me walk with a limp
Full of dirty ? Valet at Fifths
Finesse I got Freebandz to get
Black amigo, who live life like this

Forgiatos standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud

Yo Campaign hot it rolling, you ain’t made a real jugg
Ain’t no way that money folded
Got myself hot these hoes in VIP patrollin’
Boogers in my ears around my watch and they loaded
Solitary clips, I’m in the studio devoted
If you knew what it took to get here you could understand my flowin’
Doja, I Hit the dope my words come out folded
Turn the lights our, I’m going inside the mic raw
More Diesel than a 18-Wheeler, I’m with them killers
Forgiato’s on the coupe creeping like a caterpillar
Got the money in the Louis bag, right by to the pistol
Long as the money come, you know I’m gone deliver

Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head

Ain’t gotta pull the trigger still to hit ya with the yoppa
I’m a Benihana nigga Future through with red lobster
Gettin’ money is a hobby drank Ace of Spades like it water
Need a chain like Maraka thats the power of a dollar
Ain’t nothing but a street nigga hot as damn lava
I ain’t spend a dollar on her but she still call me Papi
Ain’t doing nothing but mixing collard greens with ?
Promethazine Baby bottles, Lortabs, Oxycontin got the kid and I’m always riding foreign

Ain’t nothing but a stunner, pocket full of hundreds
Walk inside fifths try to buy that motherfucker
Ain’t nothing but a baller, been a shot caller
Ask your main bitch I don’t ever have to call her
Ain’t nothing but a hustler, fuck you lil busters
Pull up in a Rari, inside mustard
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ stuntin’ ass nigga
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ ass stuntin’ nigga

Nothing but a flexing, Scooter straight finessing
I bought everything before the deal just off a Juggs
Saran wrap the rap thats how you sign thats one jug
I paid off his whole rent for one year
I need another stash spot them things on the way
Walk inside fifths spend fifty thats how we play
I just made a hundred racks this month off of J’s
Them Black Amigo numbers you can eat and do your thing
I ain’t nothing but stuntin’, countin’, jugging’ ass nigga
I ain’t nothing stackin’ cow money ass nigga
Young Scooter all I talk is cash on you niggas
650 I got gangster swag for you niggas

Ain’t nothing but a stunner, pocket full of hundreds
Walk inside fifths try to buy that motherfucker
Ain’t nothing but a baller, been a shot caller
Ask your main bitch I don’t ever have to call her
Ain’t nothing but a hustler, fuck you lil busters
Pull up in a Rari, inside mustard

Smacked Silly (Rack City Freestyle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Rack rack city bitch....
Get get smacked silly bitch
I'mma give ya'll 50 bars on this one.....Ready?
So what they tryna hate for
They know I'm gettin' paid more
And when I'm in the club, everything I drink is paid for?
You left the picture and missed everything u stayed for
The game gettin' tough but this the shit that I was made for
So act up, best believe you gettin' smacked up
Pedal to metal I ain't lettin' niggas catch up
And we could match up homie we gonn smoke too
Cause it's our time and we gonn shine like we supposed to
I told you, I'm the illest with this mic shit
Spit it off the top, I'ont even gotta write shit
My tight shit sounds the best when I be dumb high
Cause I get Harvard brain and I'm far from an alumni
You dumb guys, I do rap and soccer shit
You don't see me glow? I'm bout to blow like a rocket ship
U talkin' shit I think its best that u dip and hide
Cause when I start to flow it be wet like a slip n slide
I'm gettin high u can tell my eyes is bloodshot
Take a lotta pictures but I stay away from mugshots
I do my thing boy I always do my shit well
Rest in peace to em but I'm bout to smoke a Big L
Brain twisted, soul being lifted
You should hand over the mic like Taylor Swift did
See what the piff did, feel like I'mma die slow
Hit it and a nigga spit fire like I'm Spy-ro
My eyes low, compliments cause I rhyme well
I'm runnin' in your crib like I'm Kramer off of Seinfeld
You sleepin' boo? I slide thru, like PeekaBoo
You frozen in shock now ya nickname is Pikachu
Jeez - I swear I'll try and take it easy
A nigga need a wife but need some bitches who are sleazy
For when I'm feelin' low, they know exactly how to please me
To all my niggas listenin' I know ya fuckin' sees me
Yeaa
Cause I got bitches on the side
That'll hop on the dick, if I feel like gettin' sidetracked
They ride that til I nut and then I pass out
Then I give em food and and cab and kick they ass out...
That's how a player do
And I'mma player who
Loves gettin' brain so shout outs to all my players too
And they say hate the game not the player boo
But bitches doin' circles like muhfuckin dreidel do
And I'll shake up the whole damn place
My punchlines'll punch lines in ya whole damn face
I smoke weed and sip goose til I start to get loose
Fake niggas gimme dap, I leave em hanging no noose, damn
You can't battle? well I'll kill him myself
A registered sex offender how I'm feelin' myself
You feelin' the wealth, well I got paper in sight
A lotta niggas can't stand how I'm rapin the mic
But all this herb got me lookin' like a china man
Everybody know I rap so I rhyme when I can
Try and name somebody with as many lines as ya man
Time is money guess I gotta lot of time on my hands
And I got paper in my pockets I'm just achin' to burn
N you could shine when its ya time but keep waitin' ya turn
Cause its mine n I'mma grind til this paper I earn
And ion preach but ill teach til they blatantly learn
Understand I'mma boss, I could never take an off day
Cause I'mma be a star who got bucks, no latte s
Papi what the ladies love to call me
Cause they love when I get it up like wall street
I'm good lookin', rhyme tight, and I flow nuts
Krispy Kreme workers even sayin' that my dough nuts
I go nuts boy....",https://genius.com/Future-smacked-silly-rack-city-freestyle-lyrics

I’m hungry, and I know it
Cause I done been where you was, that’s why I keep that toolie
Because if you budge, it’s BOW

Lil Vee, what's up? Not much, leggo, leggo
I just sit back and observe, I don't say a word
If you come close to my lane you might just hit the curb (skrrt)
I been gettin' my caps in, I can't help but splurge
Sippin' 100 dollar lean,  on the search
Take it to another level cause I got the urge
Flyest nigga around like them dirty birds
You know we shut it down, like when you get off work
Just tell me what you want, my partners got the work
And even gas, 20 dollar fill up
I shoot craps, I made 5 bands off the 
Strikin' everyday, I can't help but come up
I should sign with Nike, gotta run that check up

All this kush cologne on me I splash, squirt
800 a zone, I'm talkin' gas, work
All about my check I need my cash, first
Boy stay out my lane before I smash, swerve
All this kush cologne on me I splash, squirt
800 a zone, I'm talkin' gas, work
All about my check I need my cash, first

My Wrath,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah...it's the Future...the hawk is out..
It's a good look for me man...I'm stronger than ever, I feel great!
Nate Butters, whaddup? It is real, whaddup?
Nemo, I see you, baby! Let get 'em {?} out, YEAH!
Platinum, got another one, baby! Let's do it!

I'm walkin' this walk, I'm talkin' this talk
The boys they got my back up, walkin' wit' a swagga
Sneaks stay fresh, white-tee stay cris-py
Light crease in my blue jeans, y'all try to stay with me
Nate Butters hook my line up, sharp tape in the sides and the front
Jackie Chan style, I do my own stunts, UH!
Black man, watch that, man right thurr
So much dough in my back pocket, I gotta front
I got favor, my back's watched, how bout your front?
Neighbor relax please, cause trust me this ain't what you want!
Too many soldiers walk with He, be easy
The team gives ghosts the heebie jeebies (brotha please!)
I ain't scared of nuthin' under the heavens
I throw wack suckerz, doggy start hoein' and heavin'
Listen, yo' flow is +daffy+, start +duckin'+
Cause my flow is hungry and my bar'll eat your team up, AH!

SECULAR RAPPERS, I'm COMING, uh!
You hear my footsteps I'm coming..
And I mean this brotha to brotha, man
I hope you suckerz got your bags packed
Cause if not you're gonna feel my wrath!

My bible got a lot of +clips+, +baby+ (""Grind-in'"" *brrrrrrrrrr*) *Birdman call*
So relax, boy, before they ask ""What Happened To That Boy?""
(Did you catch that one?) Won't hesitate a minute to get at that boy
I make that sin thing diminish and your flesh could go wit' it, UH!
Future's flow quite attractive and dapper
The chiropractic rapper, I GETS IT CRACKIN', UH!
He's so focused, it's nothing that could distract him
Put a low jack on his ankle, y'all still couldn't track him
I'm not braggin', but the flow is proper
Any bro' close to Future flow probably with Hoffa (uh!)
Meaning dead somewhere under a field
I give props to Pac and B.I.G., but, that's about it, UH!
And I'm glad Jay finally retired
He got out the game just in time, to miss this fire
But the rest of you suckerz get ready
I'm about to have the whole secular industry, +delirious+ like +Eddie+ (WOO!)
I'm not heady, I'm just so sure
That Jesus writin' and Future flow sick wit' no cure
Chitty chitty bang bang, Future doing his thang-thang
Rappers' movin' they mouth, but ain't saying a DANG THANG


You secular Iraqi rappers, it's over for you soldiers
Like Bush and Sadaam, I push buttons and BOMB
Flow hits so quick, faster than Islam
And deeper than a Buddhist, I'll show you how to do this!
Matta of fact, I'll show you how to do it the right way
These ain't just bars of stuff I'd like to say
But these is bars of stuff you might see
If you're even in Vegas (Greenville) or anywhere that I might be
And don't think it's a game!
I'm twenty-plus years old, I stopped playing around thirteen
Am I the only one that's seeing the world is hurt-IN'
And willin' to spit with substance, not about slingin' and frontin'
Bars is wack and empty, not rappin' about nothin'
Empty barrels making a lot of noise, and listen
I ain't scared of none of your BOYS
I got boys too, and we got favor, what chy'all got is na-thin'!
I'm simply too much for ya!
You can't fool with the brotha, if you do he'll bust ya!
Duck tape your flesh up, doggy, and Bible-butt ya
You better chill before it get real and you get touched brah!",https://genius.com/Future-my-wrath-lyrics

You pour up once a week, I drank on lean more den all the time
True Religion Robin Jeans Designer on me all the time
Everytime we hit the club we make a movie all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time

Early morning chasing paper like its going outta style
You looking for it, I know where its at
I been serving old boy for a while
Juugin’, Finessin’, for a while
Hustling gambling for a while
Break the law, fuck the law, 400 hot juvenile
Stupid loud in the crowd, raining money pouring down
All the time you see the future could be holding a hundred pounds
All the time I drank patron and ordered up a hundred rounds
You wanna shot you can take a shot get fucked up til you fallin’ down
All the time I come around theres bitches round
Puerto rican Japanese got several nationalities
They fuck with me I keep it street Dolce G is on my feet
True Religion sag off me I spend them bands like its free

Tastin’ like a sunken soda
Got me higher than a solar
Bird colder than a cola, high roller new V Motor
Did a lot with baking soda, red and white, Coca Cola
DOCE what that is Doce Doce from the flo’ up
From the flo’ up millennium I’m on M&M’s get plenty them

Come to city take a pic

Inside and I trick the car out when I come out know the kid out
From the way I buy the bar out plenty money when the boy out
Like when Pk when just said God I couldn’t just buy one car bought the whole lot
Then I burt out from the car lot when I turn out doing donuts
Doing burnouts want a donut hit my burnout
I’m quick to tell them bitches timeout
When them racks out bring that pack out
We gone cashout til that pack out
Hit the mall and by the store, get your hoe and throw down

Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Going and cop the coupe and trick it Just like I want
Get some extra grams off the blow, Just like I want
Told jewelry make my new piece, Just like I want
Shawty put the ? Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Anytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
If I wanna buy the donk I trick it out Just like I want
I’m a go and buy the coupe just to score extra points",https://genius.com/Future-just-like-i-want-lyrics
Made Sexy*,Unreleased Songs,2020,"Lyrics from Snippet

They made sexy where you from
They birthed sexy people
They made sexy where you from
Give birth to sexy
Take me to your birthplace, I wanna go
Tell me your birthday, I wanna know
Show proof, never say what you saw
Come out the stu', niggas reap what they sow
Niggas never gave a fuck though
I fuck with her because she cut bro
I been tortured, I been...

...you let me know if it's too much
They invented sexy where you come from
You don't let you thank you, but you done
I erase your past, we movin' on
I need a translator, don't call me, no
I trip up when I fall for you
Baby, your love is a drug
Make my nosebleed, baby, give me a rush
Might linger, might linger, might linger, might linger
Keep it close, keep it close, keep it close 'cause girl I'ma need it
She a regular girl, gets treated like a diva
I stuff a passport in with some visas
Oh, oh
They made sexy where you from
They birthed sexy",https://genius.com/Future-made-sexy-lyrics

And brought me some diamonds
I can talk that narcotic talk cause I live it ain't lying
Had to step up my hustle, stack that paper for months
I came back from the coop, I'm in the trap in the booth
I hit the button on da roof, it transform right in the trunk
I'm a superstar and a hustler, I do what I want
Catch me working off my cell phone, and I got that iPad
And I'm doing crazy number you can call me Comcast
Drinkin on that dirty mud and I'm on that good gas

They locked him up, they give his ass 30 years straight
In 86, got 99 for that murder case
Keep that strap and that tooly, cause I know it ain't safe
Smokin on Cush, tryna make that pain go away
Throwin money, cause it can be seen falling from our face
You can see it, comin down my eye
So I had to let the money fly
Couldn’t see it comin down my eye, so I had to let the money cry

This is the thug song, we had to do so wrong
We own a car up now, and it's a new day now
This the thug song, put your hands up
Put your hands up, yeah

Trappin with the gang, runnin up that green
Where I don't pay gold, so you know I took a chance
I done stacked a couple Ms, but I lost a couple friends
But I don’t give a damb, that's why I'd do it all again
I done sold a couple drugs, finessed a couple plugs
Girl asked me if I care, I said I don't give a fuck
I done broke a couple rules, I done bust a couple tools
Ain't shit changed, now I'm grabbin jewels
Spendin cash on all the cars, I done fucked all the stars
Who'd thought a trap boy could make it this far
Put the hood on my back, the streets on my heart
Shout out to all my dogs, I do this shit for us

We toast it up for my people that are dead and gone
I wish my nigga Loco was right here to hear my song
I got blood, sweat and tears inside my tone
Forever gang, to mention I’m proud
I give m money of a student with a college degree
I pop out, and it's like the water is starin at me
My life millions deep, you can never see me
I keep designers on my face, cause I stay as high as can be
I got some real bad nerves, and I still surve
We roll the dice and shake m up, let m go off the curbe
