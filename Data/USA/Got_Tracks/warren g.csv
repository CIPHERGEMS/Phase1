Regulate,Regulate... G Funk Era,1994.0,"Regulators. We regulate any stealin' of his property. We’re damn good too. But you can’t be any geek off the street. You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice,
 
so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats,
 
so I said ""I'm stuck!""

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother, said ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down

They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate


I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, ‘cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel


I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords, strings, we brings melody
G-funk,
 
where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you're high like everyday
And if yo' ass is a busta, 213 will regulate",https://genius.com/Warren-g-regulate-lyrics
Party We Will Throw Now,Warren G. EP,2012.0,"As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

Yeah, all I need is the chronic to keep me fit
A bad bitch, a project apartment and 2 pits
Red chucks, a red Bic to keep my kush lit
Thank god for what I get but never really needed shit
I'm a hustler nigga, that's how I got this red Bentley
Slay the competition and told them that Dre sent me
Walk through the smoke like, ""what up loc""
Cause Warren got that bomb that kind that make me choke
We gonna twist up 8 for Nate, blow the smoke through the clouds
In hopes that it reaches the pearly gates
Now, how many niggas wanna throw up a dub
And be surrounded by the baddest bitches up in the club, yeah
It's the 'math blood, sixes on the ave cuz
Phantom got your girl pussy wetter than my bathtub
Fuck her all night, wake her up at 6
Lil mama grab your shit, get ghost

As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

Click-clack what up, zig-zag run up
Knick-knack paddywhack, twisting up a fat sack
Tic tac toe up, I be in them streets like an
Intersection, I got connections, from every section
Critical, political, it's killer Cal'
Roll it up, now pass that shit around
My mental is cynical, original
Thinking you could see us, I'm like nigga how?
I'm in that diamond lane, I'm in that diamond chain
Glistenin', glowin', I'm sippin' liquor I'm blowin' zippers
My nigga, I'm on one, I'm twistin' the zone up
I'm sitting up low, my pistol shinin' my chrome up
My nigga Game got the gun load, one shot
Mix a nigga brain like some gumbo, uh, oh
All that tough talk nigga, what for?
Shut your scary ass up at the front door

As I travel this lonely gangster road
Just me and my negroes
We still got bomb hydro
We just double independent
And the night falls that's when young girls go home
Big girls put on small clothes
A party we will throw
A party we will throw now

Couldn't, nobody diss my nigga
Damn I miss my nigga, pour out a little liquor
Big Nate Dogg nigga, 2-1-3
From the city by the sea, where them Gs ride
Turn around baby let me listen to the b-side
Slap that, tap that, after that, East side
As I travel this road I see the street sign
Ready for whatever, Beretta's you know I keep mine

It's the L-B, C-P-T nigga we be
OG to BG, that's where the weed be
Killer (what?) Cali-forni-a
Eh, load the strap, hop into the six-trey
Snoop, what up loc?, I'm headed to the East side
G ride, throwin' up everything but the peace sign
Gold Daytonas, gangbang persona
Nigga trip, I'ma pop the top off his Corolla

As I travel this lonely gangster road

What’s Next,Regulate... G Funk Era,1994.0,"This DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
To the hip to the hop, you just don't stop
Producing funky tracks til it makes you drop
Conjunction junction, whats my function
I'm hookin up tracks so that niggas can function
It's not Pete Rock or that nigga Dr. Dre
It's this muthafuckin nigga from around the way
The one that brings you styles on timesy, whymsy
Thats why it's so hard to find me
Conduction, construction when I bust choo choo, bustas
It's a must when I bust when I bust, I gotta come correct
The R to the E to the S-P-ect architect
Yup nigga no I'm not tweaking
Its one of the sixteen minds that I'm speaking
The W-A the double R the E into the R
A-B-C-D-E-F to the muthafuckin G
Ooh shit as I flex I wrecks I checks
So what's next

Oh who's next, to catch wreck on the menu
I snap necks when I flex let me continue
Send you, on a mission when I rock
It goes on and on and on and you know it don't stop
Yes I'm back on another route, ready to take em all out
Now can't get with this, cause they get faded without a doubt
Check em, I wreck em like 1-2-3 why
They can't fuck with that rude one Malik
Will I drop it, can't stop it, lit it up like a rocket
When they get out of line I grip the nine out my pocket
Lock it down yeah that's what I do
How could you come solo nigga when I run through your whole crew
I rule, fool, act like you heard it
The one I run with, can't remember the last he murdered
Dem do away or dem get dealt with
Kill the noise I want silence, no bubbaclad bullshit
Nigga, it's all about my grip
So the one who starts to slip is the one who gets ripped
Kept a chip on my shoulder not now that I'm older
They, all of me, the LBG high roller
Cause back in the days on the side where we sat
Niggas come up missing if they didn't have they strap
So why, try to be, like me
Just when you pull back a G and I think I'm Mr. Malik

Well if the beat is funkadelic then the tune is right
Mr. Malik and Warren G so tonight's the night that we spark
We spark in the dark when we do it in the park

Well its the A to the B (and the C to the D)
Hey my name is Mr. Malik with that DJ Warren G
(Mr. Malik can you hear me)
Yes I'm the host with the most they can't get close or even near me
(I said a tick, tock, ticking to the era)
I said a pick which Glock bitches get shot its still terror
(Terror, terror, pick which Glock)
Which one, (the black one with the big pin lock)
Me and Dre in a five hundred so those who wanna get dropped
Nigga go knock, knock I trick a flow non-stop
Fly double I never slip trip or flip flop
The tune is funkadelic, the crew was right
But if Malik will make you smell it then tonight's the night
For me to stay trump tight up with my nigga Warren G
That's sorrow when you borrow but you can't be oweing me
What's next

I say what's next, what's next what's N-X-E-T
It's me, Warren to the muthafucking G
Flowing with my little homey named Malik
Yes everybody will just tweak
Off the new style ill ease that we got
Yes it's me Warren G on the block
Pump pump, block Glock, let me just tick tock
It's me Warren G on the muthafuckin rock-n-roll
Stroll, then stiff back to the rap
Its me with the big black mack eleven strap
So let me flix into the flex
Woo, so what's next

Well if the beat is funkadelic then the tune is right
Mr. Malik and Warren G so tonight's the night that we spark
We spark in the dark when we do it in the park",https://genius.com/Warren-g-whats-next-lyrics
Do You See,Regulate... G Funk Era,1994.0,"The blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie
As American as the blues
As American as apple pie
The question is why
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere

You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Getting tired of mothafuckas saying, ""
Warren I told ya
""
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggas, ain't shit changing
Got my Mama wondering if I'm gang banging
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rolling with my niggas
Off to the VIP, you see Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that
The nigga that's jacking or the fool getting jacked?

You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growing up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwing up
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it
Thinking every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back, how far, back in time
Dragging to these hookas trying to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
It was all so clear, '87, '88, then '89s the year
You say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick
Way back then 2-1-3 was the clique
Something to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

You make me wanna holla,
 get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's serving time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept saying, ""
Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home
""
I said ""
Snoop, things done changed, it's not the same
We need to get up out the game
Cause we can get paid in a different way
With you kicking dope rhymes and I DJ
""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it
Should I, A: Go back to slanging dope
Or should I, B: Maintain and try to cope
Or should I, C: Just get crazy and wild
But no, I chose D: Create the 
G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up
Niggas talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G",https://genius.com/Warren-g-do-you-see-lyrics

Niggas say they’re hard as bricks but they’re soft as a peach
Claiming the G of all G’s, please
I come blowing through like the breeze
Sitting on the threes
Posted coast it and mash it down Pacific Coast
In the bomb chrome rims, black on black Yukon
With nuts hangin’
From the city, where the bangers be bangin’
It don't seem like has changed and
I hollered at a homey the other day
G’d up at the park, Sippin Alisay
One of the homies took a beatin’
So now we'll start to be a gang and checkin’ at the meetin’
Like cycles repeatin’
It’s just another sunset fall and see
I can hear the homies that pass calling me
And you know what I discover what they keep sayin’
Keep your mind and your money motherfuckers
And shake busters

Улетай на крыльях ветра
Ты в край родной, родная песня наша
Туда, где мы тебя﻿ свободно пели
Где было так привольно нам с тобою

Have you ever sold millions
But yet you niggas persist to talk shit
Get off my dick
Ya never catch me slippin’
Rollin’ with the heat slap the clip in
I never thought the world would start trippin’
My life's a trip though, hit the crypto, blow the whistle
They think I bang, so I pack a pistol
Warren to the G is a G
I don’t fuck with you nigga
So don’t fuck with me, let’s ride
To the East Side, slide like a fo
I packs a fo-fo, when I'm steppin’ out doors
To the bang to the boogie, if I speak then I spoke
Warren G you do it every time, till ya loc
Get the party lit like blazin’ smoke
The East Side of the beach, West side of the coast
You know the niggas that arrive with hogs
Attack dogs to say niggas are down to die with, motherfucker

Улетай на крыльях ветра
Ты в край родной, родная песня наша
Туда, где мы тебя﻿ свободно пели
Где было так привольно нам с тобою

Who’s the man, I’ve been from London to Japan
Stomp land to land
To the Egyptian sands
You can't check me, disrespect me or mock me up
With the bass bumping out my truck
And all these police tryin' to lock me up
Money rules the world, and I made the loot
So don't make me shoot
Cause trying to match’ll
Get you down every time
I ain't trying to hurt nobody
But I'm down for mine, biatch

Money over power, power over money
Money over power, power over money
Money over power, power over money
Money over power, power over money

So Many Ways,Regulate... G Funk Era,1994.0,"Hey, nah ya goin miss up on the G-Funk era
Ya know we said things won for Warren G, him soon turned superstar

11-10-70 that was my intro
But now in 94, I'm rollin a 64
Cuz things get shady where the grass is greener
Niggas throwin up sets in hoods like they neva seen a
Young mack daddy do his thing cuz I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And its a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the niggas you can't fade
So raise up off this young hog
Cuz I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me dog
I got my own thang cuz I let my nuts hang
If you wanna bring it, bring it on no pain no gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

Some homies are bad minded
Cannot take them for no friend
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Cause I borrow, then they’ll borrow but I lend them a violin
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)

Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em

Its all plain and simple
I roll just to serve a lifetime wit my niggas
Idiotic fools can't figure
The way I display or should I say more than that
Its crucial when I name how many niggas got my back
Neva lack, the skills when its time to handle mine
You can't front if you wanna but you still know the time
I'm, the nigga that they call Wayniac (what that mean)
I'm the nigga stayin down for the home team
So if you didn't know let me slow ya roll
This pro is on the go with some shit you ain't heard before
So recognize game in your face
A touch of the bass then I'm gone without a trace

People Warren G rhyme wit are gone put you on front lines
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)
Cause me kofi drop the dime for officer not serve the time
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)
And sure day illegal (in so many ways)

I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you dont look good
So please rearrange and change the shit you doin
You fuckin yourself cuz you the one gettin screwed
As I, ease on down the brick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So blaze up the buddha
Cuz I got drink, and dont think
We dont roll without a full tank
Of that bomb ass shit called the funk
Cuz I am the G and the funk is what you want
Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town
Niggas flip flop and they never stay down
Wanna be all they can be, but gettin held back
Tryin to take what is mine, (what) what type of shit is that?
So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

Some homies are bad minded, cannot take them for no friend
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)
Cause I borrow, then they’ll borrow but I lend them a violin
I’m sure they’re illegal (in so many ways)

What’s Love Got to Do With It,Take a Look Over Your Shoulder (Reality),1997.0,"(Album Version Dirty)
* Intro Ooh, yeah, yeah
What's love got to do
Warren G, rap for me, yeah-eah, yeah, mm mm
* Verse 1
When G-dog, the hog, come up in the place
It's dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face
You wanna live fat, off of my sack
You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act
Cause back before '92 and '93
You didn't give a damn about Warren G
But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's
All of a sudden, you on my N.U.T's
Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop
Cause money makes the world go 'round and the panties drop
I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure
I just wanna dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure
Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep
Thought you was TLC, you had to creep
You say you had love, I said you bullshiting
It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it?
* Chorus What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)?
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it
* Verse 2
Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines
Before I made beats, I was down the grind
Back then, every single homey had my back
Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' bout jack
But I'm the same brother day in and day out
And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out
In a casket
, it's drastic, cause homies is plastic
Break 'em off some bread, they want the whole damn basket
If you's a true homey, you would wish me well
Not plot to make a brother bail, jealous as hell
We used to get the same riches
Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches
Which is, not a suprise, my eyes peep game
211's, 187's it's all the same
It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip
Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips
* Repeat chorus
* Verse 3
Now for these labels tellin' fables
Makin' the fucked-up deals under the tables
You think that you smart, but, fool, I'm the smartest
You can't make no money if you can't keep an artist
Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf
Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself
I know how it goes, treat an artist like a ho
Fly cars, gold, clothes, but no dough
Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine
Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime
Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck
You bend over for the label and you will get fucked
Like how we run up in them trick, and then you're through
The record label do the same shit to you
90% business, 10% show
Ain't no love in this game, cause it's all about the dough

I Want it All,I Want It All,1999.0,"What's up negros and negrettes?
It's your boy Warren G
You know what I'm saying?
Chillin' with the home boy Mack 10
And we gon' lay a lil' sumpin' down for y'all
Let y'all know what time it is
Show you how we keepin' it real wit' it
You know, cuz this world is built on material thangs
But we ain't trippin' off that
We want y'all to know this, check it

I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and drawls
And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all

They say, 'There go Warren G with that envious stare'
I love this game too much, I wish these haters wasn't here
It's a shame, we came too far to turn back
It's a cold world, it gets so hard, you learned that
]From falling, tryin' to walk from crawl
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin'
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy
Believe me, young nigga, fat meat is greasy
And shit stank, so if you plot a lick and hit a bank
And get away, or get gaffled, the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high
And remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga

I want it all, so I got to wake up and ball
And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base
]From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got clout
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leach talkin' about
Slow down player, don't hate cuz you can't relate
The Bently Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable
Will it enable to shoot C-Note ""Yo's"" at the crap table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high
A nigga fly and fly, with the desire to build an empire
I strapped up and took flight like a missle
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official'
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call
I'ma ball and never fall cuz Mack 10 want it all
What

I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and drawls
And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all

Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot
We hot like rocks served on hot blocks
I notice money make the world circulate
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip and perculate
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love)
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub)
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all
Ride or don't ride at all
Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady
I want it all, dog, and it might be greed
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' jank with they Daddy's royalty check
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dog, enough said
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread
I want it all

I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and drawls

Super Soul Sis,Regulate... G Funk Era,1994.0,"Well it's the super, the duper, the Landcruisin' trooper
?Take action? at times, they hang on my rhyme like Mr. Cooper
I'm takin' you to a zone that's much far from wackness
So please could you tell me oh bud buddy can you hack this?
Yo, oh no, grab a hold of fadeables, gettin' her flows on
Like FloJo,
 rhymes in a marathon
Smooth like chocolate, so call me Big Mamma Kane
Feels like another one goin' out for her reign
Step back, because I happen to be all that plus tax
I got more subscribers than HBO or Cinemax
Mile after mile, I rip style after style
Crack dope in all the vials, ooh I'm glad I used Dial
'Cause it can get funky when I'm singin' my song
But I just flow on, and so on, not stinky cause I roll on
And then I hear encore and I won't give it a rest
That's how I got the motherfuckin' Super on my chest

Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)
Fly through the sky gettin' love

Mister it's the, Masta Aces of the spade
Rappin skills are thinner than niggas on AIDS
Up up and away it's the Super Soul Sis
I talk so much shit, I got halitosis
I knows this, I flows this, how funky, you stank
You a walkin' blood bank I'm withdrawing my shank
Thanks for the memories, remember me no remedies
Or end in the vicinity or 
catch a cap like a Kennedy
'Cause I'm the Superwoman rapper I deserve a hail
Chasin MC's, got em on the run like Smurfs from Azrael
No bluff, 
the magic I puff
, I'm chokin' sho 'nuff
I'm takin' a bite out of rappers if my name was MC Negra
(She's hotter than the South land on fire)
All you MC's desire, to run through my pyre
I'm turnin' heads like the Exorcist while flexin' this
'Cause it's the Super Soul Sis

Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)

Sat on the outside, but now I'm in the arena
A superfly mackadocious one you never seen a
Soulful, cause I got a bowl-full of soul
Strollin because I have no vehicle to roll
But bring it bring it back to the topic of this flow of mine
I can flow upbeat, to a slow beat, and be offbeat and still on time
I rhyme, and swim waves of soul like Billy Ocean
Never ashy, lyrics that soothe ya like some lotion
'Cause I can Krush any Groove bust on any move ya make
I keep my rhymes attached, like trains to a freight
Break ya Achy like Billy Ray,
 I'm fuckin up the industry
And fins to be, Nanu Nanu like Mork and Mindy

Fly through the sky gettin' love

I Need a Light,In the Mid-Nite Hour,2005,"I need a light (light)
So I can smoke away this pain
I need a drink (drink)
So I can drink away this rain
Maybe a wife (wife)
Somebody to share my name
I need a song
A brand new song to sing

Long Beach back in the day was all hustling
Young niggas in the neigborhood struggling
Praying to god we ammount to something
By living on the street where they constantly busting
Big Warren told us that they can't hold us
Niggas ain't shit 'till they pass away
So I, watched my step
But when Ola Mae left I was a mothafucking basket case
For real
God bless me
Cause I be on the east where they wanna arrest me
I break bread so they wanna suspect me
But look me in my eyes and say they wanna protect me
Yeah
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, got me a profile
As a child in the Beach I was wild
Ready to die and that's why..


Could it be it was all so simple
Dropping a slick instrumental
Snoop busting 'bout the shit we went through
Nate singing 'bout the city we came from
And niggas so tight wasn't nothing we wouldn't do
Time keep slipping
But I ain't tripping nigga it's all about my children
So you can save that bullshit
Cuz if I pull my shit, nigga I'mma kill you
The streets is watching
And niggas fell victim from L.A. to Watts and Compton
But life goes on
It's just another song if you ain't the one gone
Listen
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
But now I got a brand new G-Child
Big Warren gotta stay trunk tight
Cuz he got the fly and that's why..


Listen
Caviar wishes, twisting stitches, all out race for the riches
Got a nigga missing what rich is
And what a life mean when you do it for the kids
It's for my family y'all
Really the only one who understand me y'all
Cuz it ain't hard to ball
But then who got ya back when it's time to fall
And it's amazing
To stay up on top, your game so close to the pavement
Time brings change in mind
But then don't let the change bring your mind no time
Clearly, a conspiracy
Niggas right near me but still ain't hearing me
That's how it's always gone fly
'till you ready to die and that's why..",https://genius.com/Warren-g-i-need-a-light-lyrics
And Ya Don’t Stop,Regulate... G Funk Era,1994.0,"For 94, I'm a just glide and swerve
Hop up the streets with my heats so observe
It's me Z the whee Z, the Warren to the G Z
The deuces and the treys as kickin' it through E-Z
And the beach and the bottle where I'm found
Fuckin' around with the muthafuckin' Dogg Pound
Fuck it, Warren's goin wild
The G Funk Era and the muthafuckin' G Child
Funk, melody, rhythm, base
He which is I is in the muthafuckin' place
So let me get away, come again like this
I can turn into a murderer so please don't diss
'Cause if you do, you know where I'm from
Rat tat tat tat diddy dum diddy dum

And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit

Well let me grab my stick and shift to first
I'm spittin' plenty game on my second verse
Well let me switch to second just for the rough ride
L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H Eastside
Where the grass is greener, at some times
And I don't do shit but drop funky rhymes
Now I'm in neutral, shiftin' to third
'Cause what you hear is what you heard, nigga
From the G-Funk, G-Funk, 'cause we funk, we funk
And if you step muthafucka you get stomped
Like 1, 2, 3 I'm shiftin' to the fo'
But you don't hear me doe

And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit

I said humpty dumpty sat on the wall
I guess it's time for me to sum it up for all
G Funk, G Child, gangsta groove, locc
Past tense it's the Indo smoke
Choke, off the shit that I'm doin'
I'm droppin' this shit for you and you and you and
'Cause it's me, the Warren to the G
Comin' in 1994 you see
The LBC and that's my locale
Check it out check it out check it out now

And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit

You know what I'm sayin', Warren motherfuckin' G beeyatch
You know what I'm sayin', it's 94 that's how we doin' it

You're not chillin in the house
Ya know why? huh? huh? Should I tell ya?
You know why? Yeah.. cuz ya ya ya ya chillin in the shack beeyatch!

This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel
This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel

Its ya muthafuckin third letter of ya alphabet
Put Knight at the end of it
Its a nigga you can't get with
Funky styles, I be showin niggas
I be blowin niggas straight out they socks, because
The Dove Shack is comin more twisted than dredlocks
Now plot on the shack if you wanna
But if you get caught slipping
We will be dippin
Down your block
Just to street sweep your spot, nigga
But you can still follow along, grab ahold of my nut sack
Because I've got the doja
Oh I haven't told ya much love to my nigga Warren
He's a G, hook me, now I'm gettin funky
I'm chillin with my feet up on the table in the shack
With my revolver, problem solver
Waitin for a nigga to fuck with this
So I can let his ass know who he is

This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel
This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel

Its the nigga 2 Scoops, the Long Beach Eastsider
Niggas start to duck when I come cuz I'm a ridah
So I suggest you get the 411 on the shack
We peelin caps to the front, then we peel em back
Approachin the wrong way, with no delay I blast your ass
Draw for the gat but the Scoop is much faster
You can't miss me with that, step in my path
I let the AK ripper cut that ass in half
I dwells, I bells, in the LBC
The real menace to society
Packin up alrighty
A flow, but watch the one I used to abuse this track
We in front of that ass and you still can't see the shack
So pack up your gear and run and hide
(and pass the dutchie to the left hand side)
We comin like that, it ain't no love for no rat
I guess thats how we act when we chillin in the shack

This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel
This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel

As you enter into the zone called the G Funk (now relax)
Here a lie a war with the west (Dove Shack)
Kicks it is a know em
Rip em will be torn
Dip it as we flip it
Wicked with the Warren G child
See styles, meanwhile freestyles have been rendered
I see the door of your mind, may I enter?
I knock and I promise I won't hurt you
The definition of G Funk is just something to like swerve
To something to smoke herb
To sunk we and we serve
Get with the dope herb
Take a tall kid beat the loccness
Lessons will be taught before caught in the shuffle
Flexin all the muscle, livin large is fuckin rustle
I'm Simmons, I'm Robin, like givin
I know you love this funky style
Out this world, make your head twirl
Hear the less, now play the squirrel as you earl on the track
Who am I Bo Roc from The Dove Shack

This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel
This is the shack, this is how we act

For the Twinz and Warren G to rip shit tonight, right

Hold on tight to your seat
Comin from the city that's low, urban life near the beach peep
So come one, come all, fall into my smooth flow
Its the Trip L-O-double-C yo
The game is trump tight, ain't no need for you to boo me
Cuz after it's over, all you hoes gon' wanna do me
Its part of the plan to get mine from the jump
G-Dub hooked it up, so you know its gotta straight bump
A typical day on the Eastside
A lot of gangstas buck mouths
And some brothers slangin' bean pies
But that's how it goes in the city where I was born
Families mourn, niggas slippin, never gettin born
So thats why you gotta stay alert
Cuz everyday somebody's out, they tryin to put in a little work
For the hood, or just on the solo
Walking in Long Beach real late is a no-no
But don't let me scare you, you do what you gotta do
Respect is a must, checkin niggas that try to check you

Y'alls niggas betta recognize
Focus your eyes cuz my homie's high
Y'alls niggas betta recognize
E-E-E-E-Eastside

Tick, tock, tickin to the Era
Its Warren G with the Twinz funk Era
N to the A to the T to the E
The S to the N to the double O P

I'm a take you on a trip
So keep the game I display mane
I run it to ya in a gangsta kinda way
 (hey)
It's all good when you dealin with the Locc
Stilll blazed the smoke with the homies and the kin-folk
And ain't no nigga gonna be takin mine
I'm servin niggas with a quicka picka up and on as a nine
So if you really wanna watch this trigga flow
It's kinda itchy but I know I shoulda pulled it a long time ago
Cuz I be connecting like dot to dot
So when it gets hot well I gotta shake the spot
And move to that other level see Wayniac coming through in 
94 LBC

Y'alls niggas betta recognize
Focus your eyes cuz my homie's high
Y'alls niggas betta recognize
E-E-E-E-Eastside

Now you know the game and the game's complete
(Why's that?) Cuz the Twinz are bringing nothing but heat
And ya know you didn't wanna see the Cavi flow
(What kinda flow?) The kinda flow that'll make you slow ya roll (ahh)

So open your eyes and pay attention
Its two of my homies on a muthafuckin' mission

And I, kicks up dust cuz its a must
And I, acts a fool cuz its my rule
So need we say more on this topic
Warren G droppped it
Put it on track and we locked it
Nigga, did I rock it?
Nigga, did I rock it?

It really doesn't matter cuz its still only poppin

Lovin this shit called rap ass burnin through your back (Jah Skills

Why oh why oh why well why not
Shouldn't I represent this shit called hip hop and it won't stop

Well are you high yet
Can you recollect ya talk shit you get checked
Mr. Smutly I'm not a punk thief
Let me break thee, smoke thee, choke thee and locc thee

There ain't no puzzle
I lets it be known that I'm the trip
Locc packin mo stackin mo shit than I did before
The real niggas from the Eastside, darkside
Breakin off fools in my way on this whoo-ride
So best believe that I'm a threat
(fuck a chin check)
I'm a shoot him while my nigga blaze up the buddha
And when we light it up, its on
A taste of the Chronic, another nigga gone, but gettin his head
Flown
(so what you really wanna do) I'd a done it
Cuz yo mouth like zip loc so I know you won't run it
Top notch Glock cock so you remember
The flow that I kick is nuthin less than a life ender
So watch yo step before you step into my path
Tryin to take whats mine is some shit I just roll past

Let me tell you how it goes
Prime example of a night stalker
Caught up in that bind
Usin time with my hood as that street walker
(gang bang) so I'm gonna have to take whats mine
Notorious bitches but I dont love no one time
So peep it as I take ya down the backstreet
Show you how I do it (how ya do it)
I breaks em off to get my ends meet (pow)
Victim of the ghetto so I'm sluggin
The man won't give me mine so the whitey I'll keep muggin
I'm trapped up in a cycle but I'm keepin my humanity
Cuz I ain't goin out (us niggas always keep activity)
Niggas say I'm crazy but to others I'm just nutty
Cuz I dont give a damn, ya life ain't shit without no money
Thats why niggas keep doin niggas but I'm not that nigga to be done
Ya fuckin around and set it off Long Beach is where I'm from

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
He mistaked me for somebody who was liable
To more than many murders
LA's a war fields
We keep making war shields
Streets keep souls
Young brothers lose control
I seem to maintain through this
Watch where you kick it they'll put you in a twist
And it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
They do crime and  attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

Slaverys over let us have somethin'
Why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
My profession is music
Your profession is protection with gats
Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today

And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
Cuz I'm gonna work for life
So he can see another day
A hommies a hommie
A fake is a snake
Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake

Annie Mae,Take a Look Over Your Shoulder (Reality),1997.0,"1, 2 buckle my shoe
3, 4 we gotta hit the store
5, 6 back in the mix
7, 8 Warren G and Nate

Bang to the boogy say up jump the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogidy beat
I dont love no hoes they know so they don't be fuckin wit me

A long time ago I met Annie Mae
She was killing me softly like everyday
Penetentiary steel, was stickin for real
Blockbustin through the walls
Now I'm makin housecalls

I thought I'd met a lot of scandalous women, and then I met Annie Mae
Got a thin big butt like steel
But she didn't have a place to stay

She was shackin at mine and shackin at his
Blowin my socks, tellin his biz
Nate Dogg this and Nate Dogg that
213 skirt, and we stay intact
So I told the homey Nate don't be mislead
Ain't no fun if the homey can't shake a leg
So I went to the house and knocked on the door
And guess who it was, Annie Mae you H-O

I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (Annie Mae)
(I once met a bitch named Annie Mae)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (Annie Mae)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae

Remember yesterday I asked you baby have I seen you somewhere before
With just one look, the pussy was took
Cuz I make music that you adore
Now I'm not sure and I might be trippin
But in 94 I heard a song
It ain't no fun unless the homeys can come
So Warren G put a condom on

Now Nate you know me and I know you
I got rubbers, gin and socco too
So lets do the do, on how we do
Never my boot, just a freak that I knew

I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (Annie Mae)
(I once met a bitch named Annie Mae)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (Annie Mae)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae

Annie Mae, Annie Mae, you ran out of time
Warren G and Nate Dogg blew your mind
Cuz if you trickin wit him
You trickin wit me, you trickin wit the 2 1 muthafuckin 3
I came from rags to riches
Trustin no snitches
Thats how we do on 9 C I X bitches
Buck em, fuck em, and put em in the trash
And jump in the 600 Benz and dash

Hold up Warren before you go just a couple things I got to say
Are you goin home, I wanna be alone
You need to take this... home

Oh I like them girls, man I could stay there for days
Ooooooooooooooooh

Why you so cute, why you so big
Why you bullshitin', come and deal with a pimp
Put your bags in the trunk, holla at your boy
You can spend the night, we at the Elroy
Doing things that we shouldn't, couldn't
Girl you got that good chocolate pudding
The best in hood, whats goodin'
She got the Wizard of Westwood, like old John Wooden
But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug
She was less than a duece, I'm telling the truth
Confessing with you, I'm just messing with you
Because on the real baby girl, you put in the S in Snoop

See I rock baby, nonstop baby
Warren G baby, shake that thang lady
I see you picky lady, you be tweaking lady
Pulling that '38 snub out your stock end baby
You put the G in the dub, we hot fuckin' in the tub

I'm trying to get my money right
So you could kick it with baby, but get your mind right
What the fuck is up, you messing with a G

Damn she wrong, bad little candy cone
One head nod from me she out the door
One head job from her she out the door
Back to the beach, back yo, the line o

Get U Down Part 2,In the Mid-Nite Hour,2005.0,"(Intro, Warren G)
This song is dedicated to all my people
That was caught up in hurricane Katrina
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
We ridin with y'all
You know what I'm sayin?
I feel your pain
We gon' make it through this y'all
Yeah
Come on
(Verse 1, Warren G)
We here today, then gone tomorrow
It's got me singin a Marvin Gaye song
It made me wanna holla
So I hop in my Impala
Just to cruise, shake my blues
It's hard to follow
Hard to swallow what they sayin on the news
Good Lord, it's a crazy world
Watchin cops puttin cuffs on a five year old girl
Racism, racism, got our babies in the system
Mom and daddies in the prison
That's intention, no division
They the ones that's all you got
They keep the families divided
Keep it gangsta, keep it real
That's all I hear, but I dont buy it
When it's Revolution time, all these fool's will keep quiet
Like shhhh, you can-you can hear a pin drop
Can't go to one-ten cuz I might get popped
People shootin on the freeway, when will it stop?
But stay strong, cause the rain don't last
And push the war up in 'em, will fix the price on gas
(Hook, Side Effect)
Don't let nobody, no-o-o one
Get you doooowwwwnnnnn
Cause if they do, if they do
I'll be arouuuunnnndddd
(Verse 2, Ice Cube)
Why the black and the brown got to fight in the Pen
The black and the brown, they squabbin again
Them God damned sheriffs, is laughin again
It all stink, keep yo ass out the wind
See the black and the brown, we can share the same land
When I was a slave, where the hell did I ran?
California man, it was full of mexi-cans
Look mu-fasa, this is they casa
Just, kick back and enjoy the sunshine
Live ya life, stay away from one-time
Get'cha money man, find the lunch line
This ain't a joke, homie where's the punch line?
The ghetto is a trap homie, take the cheese
Soon as you do it, here come the police
Invented and designed for us to fail
Homie, don't you end up dead or in jail
(Hook)
Don't let nobody, no-o-o one
Get you doooowwwwnnnnn
Cause if they do, if they do
I'll be arouuuunnnndddd
(Verse 3, B-Real)
What's really good?
What's really hood?
What's really goin on?
Open your eyes and ears
Wipin your eyes from tears
From all the lies and fears
People get blinded here
Let me define it clear
You gotta cross the bed
Tell 'em some thoughts, oppressed
Someone who flosses there
You gettin lost in there
Homie they cost they fares
Niggas get bought and passed
Tell us, get caught somewhere
Never get tortured, kid
I heard the shot from there
Hit on the spot, from where
Right on the street, prepared
Levels of heat, you there
Spit at my feet, I swear
I will retreat, for years
People deceive the peers
Make you believe the cheers
But underneath the smears
I keep switchin gears
Fall in my sleep, I wear
For all the seekin shake
You got a dime to spare?
You sound so sincere
You're bottom line, bitch yea
You sound so sincere
(Hook)
(Verse 4, Snoop Dogg)
I try to do right
I don't wanna do wrong
I'm doin better things
Man, I wanna live long
Ain't too many fools out there harder than me
I love football so much, man I started a league
Oh what a pity, is made for the inner city
Used to be dark, but now the park's real pretty
Lil' boys outside, throwin footballs
In the hood y'all
Hey Snoop Dogg, how could y'all?
Let 'em pass instead of blast
The football field is a class
And I'mma teach ya, teach ya my lesson
Shotgun formation, no Smithson, no Wesson
The haters keep stressin
And everybody wanna ask me the question
Hey Boss Dogg, how you feel now?
You helpin out the kids, and they still hatin on ya, wow!
(Outro, Warren G)
You know what I'm sayin
There's a lot goin on in this world
But we gotta keep on pushin and movin and groovin
You know what I'm sayin?
Yea, even though we got these hard times
We still gotta keep it steady, ya know?
Keep pushin
So I want y'all to ride with me and cha-cha to this
Dedicated to my people out there strugglin (Stay strong)
Single parents, nine-to-five, steady hustlin (Stay strong)
College students workin hard to be somethin (Stay strong)
Anybody makin somethin out of nothin (Stay strong)
Dedicated to my people on lock down (Stay strong)
Anybody lost somebody, wish they still around (Stay strong)

Dead Wrong,Regulate… G Funk Era Part II,2015.0,"She said she wants to come over tomorrow
But I see two dudes and they look like trouble
The doorbell just rang, so I grabbed my pistol
She thought she could set me up, she was dead wrong

Once upon a time, not long ago
I had to go and put the smash down on this ho
Never been the one to chase nothing but my dough
And I never waste time, I stay ready to go
She was thick, lightskin, with the prettiest eyes
Type to make a nigga listen to the silliest lies
But I don't believe her, I see through her disguise
But she so bomb, a nigga had to give it a try
I met her at the club, she was sipping Mojitos
Shots of Patron had me ready to beat though
She told me she was ready to come over and chill
Told her, ""hit me on my celly if you really for real""
Out the corner of my eye I observed
A couple unsavory characters in the cut, the nerve of this bitch
I hope its not what it's looking like
Shit, I guess I'm 'bout to find out tomorrow night

She said she wants to come over tomorrow
But I see two dudes and they look like trouble
The doorbell just rang, so I grabbed my pistol
She thought she could set me up, (uh huh, okay bitch)
She was dead wrong

On the phone she was sounding sexy
Talking all nasty, reckless, acting real extra
I think I hear her nigga's voice in the background
Whispering, something funny style going down
Doorbell ringing, I'm at the peephole with the strap
I ain't hear them coming from the back
I bet they thought they had me, but that fully automatic
I let all them niggas have it
The bitch got it first of all for tryna trap me and set me up
I had to show her what's happening
Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?
Blam, right between her eyes with that laser
One shot (one) two shot (two)
Three shot (three) four (four)
Gun cock, unlocked, bodies on the floor
I had to do what I had to do
If it could happen to me, it could happen to you

Behind tinted windows, car worth a hundred grand
Speakers on tremendo, quaking, waking up the land
Popping my izzim, better holla at this broad
In the Geo Prizm, I deserve an applause
Bruh, I know how to pick them, boobies shake like Jell-O
Not from Pittsburgh but she black and yellow
I said, “where’s your fellow?” she said, “I fired that buster”
Bum ass nigga, couch potato hustler
He spend more time with his homies than he do his honey
Always in her face asking for gas money
I said, “today your lucky day, what’s your schedule looking like?
Can you come out and play? I got a show tonight”
You deserve it baby let your hair down, let’s celebrate
It’s the weekend doll

It's Saturday, time to go out and find me a party
I wanna play, got to have you all over my body
I feel nasty, when the music hits me I get real naughty
And I wanna play, yeah, if you feel me go raise your hand somebody

Sunny skies it’s a beautiful day
Money wise it’s a beautiful day
When the sun goes down all the fun goes down
Thongs go down and tongues go down
She looking for a man I’m like damn, look at this here
I’m looking for a freak, but not this freak here
It’s time to switch gears, full speed ahead
Some weed and some head
New sheets on the bed
All they want is sex, trees, and ecstasy
All I want is all bitches all next to me
Surrounding me, all around me
Hounding me like they all wanna pound me
And I’mma just let them, I’mma just hit them
Like it’s my birthday, everyday a workday
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday work
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday…

It's Saturday, time to go out and find me a party
I wanna play, got to have you all over my body
I feel nasty, when the music hits me I get real naughty
And I wanna play, yeah, if you feel me go raise your hand somebody

That’s how I do it pimping, woke up with two beautiful women
I’m ‘bout to hit the carwash and the barbershop
Then I might dip to the mall and shop
Just ate at a nice little breakfast joint
On my favorite day, so what's the point?
The whole town’s in a good mood
Smoking good weed, eating good food
And I’m thinking, wish I could go the beach
The girls flirting, damn, they must know I’m a freak
You wanna be the best I ever had in my life?
Shoulda seen what I did last Saturday night
Told these girls in my stable
Call the VIP house and reserve a table
And make sure you wear a new fit
Rock and patron man we too lit

It's Saturday, time to go out and find me a party
I wanna play, got to have you all over my body
I feel nasty, when the music hits me I get real naughty
And I wanna play, yeah, if you feel me go raise your hand somebody",https://genius.com/Warren-g-saturday-lyrics
Smokin’ Me Out,Take a Look Over Your Shoulder (Reality),1997.0,"If you wanna be with me, yeah
Let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G
If you wanna be with me
Well, well, well, let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G

Smokin me out to the finish, I thought you knew
I thought they knew, who was up in this
Ron Isley, I's be Warren G
Baby said would ya please come roll deep
Chocolate Thai, I said I
Got the hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly
Peepin them lips, hittin two finger sips
On the 710 freeway, I straight dips
Wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
Tokin nothing but the bomb thats without no doubt
As she twist up another split she's straight smokin me out

She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love

I slinkin while I'm thinkin just how good it is
To do it how we do it in the hood I live
Passin homies on the block, gettin major respect
And by then y'all the hen dog is taken effect
Never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right
Pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice
With the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries
I'm diggin on her figure as I glimpse her thighs
She's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back
To twist another zag and to grab a six pack
She went back, so we proceed to parlay
Everything is lovely and we doin it always

She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love

This ain't no love ballad
But see baby I gots to have it
When I see that bomb I grab it, cuz its a habit
So dont come with that toe down stretch
I ain't stressin, Long Beach baby keep smokin me out, she learned a lesson
Floatin high as a kite as I chill and lay low
Bumpin time is collected, sunday nights on the radio
Oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat
Dog said she need
So conversation ain't needed
When she know that I'm weeded
Headin to the hotel to regulate it and beat it
I exhaled, I seen a cloud of smoke
I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced

She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out

Ghetto Village,Return of the Regulator,2001,"Would you like to go with me, down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me, to village ghetto life?

Let me tell you bout the village where I dwell, it's a...
Living hell still tryin to make a heaven outta this right here
Watching fo' the postman hopin fo' paper
Please stop the bus mister driver, wait up we got...
Rock fights where the dead end meets
The stop lights is out so it's dead in the streets
The countyline look long, but I'm kinda hungry
So I pack a sack lunch, and got on
Late for class again, it's half past 10
And moms gonna whoop ma ass again
Now and then I get the feelin that the world is mine
I start sittin back watchin time fly by
But uh, I'm so proud to say
That the ghetto is the reason that I'm loud today
And you come get a glimpse of what's happenin
See for yourself how it is where I live at

Would you like to go with me, down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me, to village ghetto life?

It shouldn't take long to see, the place that belongs to me
It's all good, ain't nothin like home to me
No Diplomas but I, got some knowledge out of
My other partners that made it up outta here
And now not a whole lot of us get rich
But like the old saying goes ""Ain't life a bitch?""
Ah shit, the Landlord just raised the rent, fuck that!
Dem old days that came and went like this
There's more ways you can use your time instead of
Looking for shit that you used to find
By the age of 16 ya finally come to grips
Livin life like this and nothin else mean shit
Looking for a smooth getaway
Cool, cuz soon I'll see a better day
And if not - then I gots to deal with it
I ain't makin this, up hell naw it's real nigga

Would you like to go with me, down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me, to village ghetto life?

No more suprises hopin I can open your eyes
And so I'm trying, instead of lookin up in the sky
I'm in the fast lane speed dreaming
Nappin on cruise control please believe it!
In my city when you see it at night, look different than it does in the day
Ain't no tellin what'd happen if it wasn't this way
I ain't trippin off of shit it's a good thing
I made a name off the local neighborhood gang
And at that time I started rhyming
And, set up a hill without help to start climbing
And I've been around this for a minute
You gotta get your own mix and get wit it
I made myself, learn to pay myself
Nigga the game don't wait so I'ma stay myself
And now you can go and tell another nigga
On how the real ones is livin in the ghetto

Would you like to go with me, down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me, to village ghetto life?
Would you like to go with me, down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me, to village ghetto life?",https://genius.com/Warren-g-ghetto-village-lyrics
In the Mid-Nite Hour,In the Mid-Nite Hour,2005.0,"Make love to you, tonight
Touch you, feel you, tonight
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love to you, in the midnight hour

Another late night, yeah, usual, locked in the studio
Thinking 'bout when I leave, what I'm gon' do to you
Talking dirty all night while I'm mixing records
It's 11:30, don't worry, I'll be there in seconds
Forget getting pretty, baby, just get naked
Put on some old school grooves, a Marvin Gaye record
Teddy P. , close the door; a love T.K.O
Play The Whispers and The O'Jays, it's on fo' sho'
I remember when I used to be a youngin
First time I heard Barry White it made me feel something
Tonight's the night, let's do what you like
Sip some Dom Pérignon, a little candlelight
I got the whip cream and strawberries, take a bite
Gon' have to call in sick cause this gon' take all night
Then early in the morning I'mma tap it right
You make me wanna get married, I'm just playin', syke!

In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love to you, in the midnight hour

Grab your lover or your friend and just step together
It's just a moment in time, make it last forever
Barbecues, house parties, skating breaks, whatever
With someone special in your life it don't get no better
So even when the rainfall changes the weather
We could do like Al Green baby, Stay Together
Girl I love it when we almost break up
Fight and fuss, kiss and hug, then we make up
Make love all night then we wake up
Early morning, sunshine through them bedroom blinds
Folks smile cause I'm yours and you still mine
Cause real talk everyday ain't valentine
Somehow some way we do just fine
So remember when I'm gone out there on the grind
And you at home all alone with me on your mind
I'm just a call away

In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love to you, in the midnight hour
Touch you, hold you, feel you, make love to you
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love, in the midnight",https://genius.com/Warren-g-in-the-mid-nite-hour-lyrics

This Is Dedicated To You (Nate Dogg tribute),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Put it together from the start with the homie
Couldn't picture ever having to part with the homie
And even though you're still here in the flesh
It's different on the West, your voice is truly missed
The missing piece, I'm saying it ain't the same
Never leave you alone, praying for one more day
Who these niggas come and get their hooks from
When they need their radio shit spun? Nate number 1!
A true artist indeed, you made your own lane
All these albums we drop will never be the same
Without your voice on them
. I'm thinking that's the key
Choked up, smoked out, riding to these melodies
Reminiscing memories, on my way to visit you in therapy
Hoping God make it clear to me on what the plan is
This dirty game is hella-scandalous, so this right here
Is dedicated to Nate

This is dedicated to you
It's really something special
Making dreams come true
Seems hard to figure out
But that's what it's all about
This is dedicated
This is dedicated to you

From the dope spots, to popping on the charts
Grinding in the beach
 to make it on the streets
Touring overseas, submitting legacies
Writing history with every song you sing
Regulating the era, staying side-by-side
And we gamble whatever. was the days of the past
Now I'm looking to the future like
I don't even wanna do music!
But I gotta keep it crackin
It's a challenge when your homie's talent
Hanging in the balance and life is such a trip
I know the world is full of maddness
Learning how to walk and talk again? I can't imagine..
What that rehabilitation is like
When that doc said that you couldn't sing on the mic
What the Hell is going on?
He's been writing songs
Hell no, that ain't Nate Dogg!

This is dedicated to you
It's really something special
Making dreams come true
Seems hard to figure out
But that's what it's all about
This is dedicated

I could exit the drama the same way that I came

Smoke with me tonight
I just wanna smoke
Let’s get high, put it in the air
‘Scuse me, may I have a match or light
I just wanna smoke, let’s get high
I’m on cloud 9 smokin’ on the good green
It ain't’ no secret now you can smell the reefer now
And I’m higher than a mutha fucker 365 I’m higher than a muthafucka
O.G, granddaddy what’s the newest name?
Do Purple kush and indo still smoke the same?
Do you like it in a bong, paper or a blunt
Cuz I get high on bongs paper and blunts
But not the flavored ones only like originals
Swisher sweet or backwoods, or I smoke originals
White papers zig zags for the chronic smoke
And if you can’t grow, shit you just wait to smoke
Let’s get high do you have a match or a lighter?
Newborn Cali weed boy and its fire
Strike a lighter lets get high put it in the air
Its 4:20 everywhere with the chronic in the air
Do you wanna smoke with me
Do you wanna choke with me?
Do you got that indo smoke? well you could loke with me
Renew, revitalize, rejuvenate, accountability, stability, bomb tranquility
You trippin’ cause I’m usin’ big words
Mixin’ words verbs, pronouns and herbs
We heading back to the ghetto now
Just bought a Cadillac ey you got a 20 sac?
Let me get a couple what you do for 300?
Yeah I got some zig zags can you put some trees on it?
Hm, so I can get a piece of mind in this cold cold world that’s hard to define
And uh it’s a miracle but smoking weed is spiritual
We all need high learning so I keep the fire burning
Heeeey now you know, inhale exhale with my flow
So roll antother blunt
I killed my high tryin’ go
Nigga played a smoka- a lot
So they call me broken stove
Since a tiny G I been off the reefer leaf
Choking off the sess weed
Now its kusha keef
That light green is some good green
But that dark is the creeper, ya boy know its reefer
Roll it in a zig zag fat like your finger
And be careful with it, ya boy blow ether
The marijuana will keep your eyes low
And make you lean in your seat, glide in your ‘64
Im so cool plus high in the ’64, im old school
White paper wrapped around the smoke
I just wanna smoke
Somebody roll a blunt
Somebody fill the bong, somebody roll a joint
Strike a lighter lets get high put it in the air
It’s 4:20 everywhere with chronic in the air",https://genius.com/Warren-g-lets-get-high-lyrics

With your eyes fixed on tits and fast whips
It's funny how we call cars whips
We slave for it
How many times were you beaten by they tricks
You looking at an eclipse
Faded dark spot in front of the light
Shut your eyes quick
International KRS passing through
When you spell Hip-Hop the H is always capital
Here's what we have to do
It ain't hard to see
KRS, Lil' AI, Warren G
That's the power
Ain't no calming me
An open hour
They see the god in me
Pardon me
In hip-hop, your heart is free
What you telling me, KRS, LBC?
Chorus (2x)

South Bronx, South Side Bronx
Boogie Down to my G-Funk Productions
Mic check, one two
Move a little somethin
Something with my peeps
Hip-hop declaration of peace
Street movement (let's go, here we go!)
Let's keep it music (let's go, here we go!)
I'mma prove it (let's go, here we go!)
If you've got beef with Hip-Hop (let's go, here we go!)
International incomes so we're in the suite
Watching Ichiro hit in runs, life is sweet
I take it back where I'm from
Knowledge rules supreme over nearly everyone hmph
It's a shame how we caught up in the material lifestyle
And our next generation living wild
It's time for discipline time for listening
To this declaration of Hip-Hop christening
Chorus 2X

My name is L-I-L AI, I'm Lil' AI, yo

Streets of LBC,Return of the Regulator,2001,"{*gun shot*}

I saw paper dancing in the streets
In the streets of a Long Beach City
Listen to the beat
My people stroke their feet on the funky concrete streets of...
Streets of a Long Beach City

Some niggas quick to get it confused
This is where it's cracking at (wassup my man?)
Big city of music, we more than half of that
What happens after midnight goes unspoke of
Cause broke niggas where I'm at, they don't show love
And I done witnessed the concrete junglin
Watch the nigga turn soft and leave humblin
Since I was young, I hung out, hard knock
Played my hand when they dealt my cards
Now check it out, what's real is what's happenin
Now this is what I deal with and where I live at
Not too many of us make it
To see the day that we able to make a statement
The ways of the world has gone crazy
Two things never change
That's the music and what the rules of the game is
Now everybody knows yo name
It ain't no other place to turn
But I yearn to get a hold on this street shit, I learnt it

I saw paper dancing in the streets
In the streets of a Long Beach City
Listen to the beat
My people stroke their feet on the funky concrete streets of...
Streets of a Long Beach City

Take it back when I ain't had much
A little bad nigga scrappin over bad much (gimme that fool)
But I was born with a hunch for this shit
My nigga did beats, still I hustled a bit
Helpin my mother's ends meet
It's hard, is God watchin?
Non stop while the cops keep rollin by on my block
I see paper dancin in the streets
So what's the chance I can make the money work for me?
But it hurts to see ya niggas doin dirt
For a livin so I put in work with this gift I was given
Now might I mention I been blessed by God
And I'm down with anything to make life less hard
No matter where you are, it can happen to anybody
That's how it was where I came up and now I talk about it
LBC, city of music
G-funk you tell me, we do's it

I saw paper dancing in the streets
In the streets of a Long Beach City
Listen to the beat
My people stroke their feet on the funky concrete streets of...
Streets of a Long Beach City

Is you forgettin 213? (Warren, Snoop and Nate)
You must be trippin and forgot that it was me nigga
Well check it out, you remember DRE
If you ain't know, well listen here, that nigga's kin of me
And I don't know, but maybe you can sense this
Snoop and Nate, them niggas I been friends with
And I'm a frontline soldier to the fullest (fullest)
My punchline burns hotter than bullets (bullets)
But the way I play this game
Displays too many ways to get paid
Now I ain't trippin of shit, not one of ya'll say (I ain't trippin)
Cause ain't nothin like the spot I'm from, and not
Too many niggas walk the block I'm from, it's 2-1

I saw paper dancing in the streets
In the streets of a Long Beach City
Listen to the beat
My people stroke their feet on the funky concrete streets of...
Streets of a Long Beach City
I saw paper dancing in the streets
In the streets of a Long Beach City
Listen to the beat

Hardly any
Walking down sunset boulevardnelly

Hey you acting like earning the
Best rapper walk the earth yet (no)
I guess some big tymer tapping her
I huff, and puff
Blew her fat rat ass off
Blaze her
Shit, in the face
The most rapper
Why she acting like it didn't know
While I pulls up on her Rolls
I gets in it

Best you write down your number this minute
Catching her going
Just sparking off
And she came to her sister
Before the car took off

I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
Y'all know me, the G from the 213
LBC, Regulatin, skatin' on all them Dayton's
Bankin' back on them singles
With the Henney's and the Jimmy's
Like I'm all tall, short, and like dark, thick and skinny
I'm a ladies' man, Mercedes and
Proper ice, livin' nice, as far as gravy stands
Ain't nuttin' changed, me and Snoop's still the same
Plus Nate droppin' weight with the classic thang
Now I remember way back, at the bachelor set
Slip my brother, Dre, Snoopa tape it, put it in the deck
The party started bangin' and they both shook hands
And made it legitimate for the G-Funk Fans
Now after that, they hit the top when The Chronic dropped
Remember 187 on the motherfuckin' cop(I wanna)
It's Still A G Thang (with my), where we hang and claim
East Side 'til I die, or I rise to fame
(Chorus x2)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
I got my own style, I got my own pal
If you don't know now, then nigga, you better slow down
Spendin bills, bendin' wheels, people think I steal
Puttin' cameras in my grill everywhere I chill
Kick back, I spit facts, and twist our tracks
Drank gin with The Twinz, see a bitch I mack
Cuz if I ain't in the studio, I'm deep in the hood
Anyway gettin' paid like Warren should
Dre teachin' me to work a beat, now I'm bangin'
And I been with platinum, now my album slangin' (I wanna)
Hangin' with my G's (with my) from the LBC
With the homies that I know will put it down for me
Well known, keep my chrome, and I hold my own
But I'd rather roll and flow and be holdin' the shows
With the G-Funk Family earnin' a Grammy
You can't see what I see, and don't understand me
(Chorus x2)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
I'm on my way to the studio, beatin and thumpin
Scoop D from Long Beach got some heat from Compton
Hit the Eastside manages to see whats crackin
Got some MGD, just watching for jackin
Its a hard knock life, ya heard Jay-Z featuring Annie
No Limit like Snoop, thats when the grammy
Hit the Beach in the Long gray and black caddy
Reminiscing on my great escapes through the alley
Damn I done grew up and things done changed
Just shakin my head, trippin off the game
Its so much you gotta do to keep it real out here
But ain't nothing guaranteed cuz ain't nothing goin' give

I need a dope beat, a dope beat

Bass take me to a place I ain’t never been
My ink pen touch pace, take my pain away
Songs, take away my wrong, make it right again
I know we’ve been through some bad shits
A lot of ups and downs, just me and my bitch
But every defeat only made me stronger
I rose to my feet and I stood up taller
For you at the end of the day
When I say I'm gon' stop this shit, turn around and walk away
I can't, ‘cause that bitch pay a nigga so good
I wouldn’t do it different if I could
‘cause it’s me for you and you for me

It feels like we’ve been together for so long
Me and my two turntables and a microphone
Hold on tight, I can’t let you go
Bringing Snoop to Dre? That was a stripper’s stool
Building blocks, west coast infrastructure
From hip hop to the whole gangster rap culture
First California nigga on Def Jam
Nowadays niggers getting signed out of webcams
Look at some of these damn labels I grew up with
They got rich and switched up on some other shit
We millionaires, damn near billionaires
I’m like damn, I helped all these fools get there
But now niggas only call when they need something
I’m in the lab, puttin' to Al Green
Baby, I’m


I ain’t write this for nobody, I ain’t trying diss nobody I’m just being real
Up and down since training wheels
And I’m fly, no co-pilot
Now what you know about it?
Me, my stuff and I, respect my rep
West up, chest up, vest up
Recognize the real lies, who’s next up?
If you ain’t ready for a ride, don’t step up
I’m OG’ing the lane, gotti in the league
So how the fuck you gonna coach me in your league?
Put the wrong out fire for another kush tree
Haven’t seen more dollars that you ever could see
Sum it all, rap it ain’t nothing but love

What We Go Through,Take a Look Over Your Shoulder (Reality),1997.0,"(Whats up Warren G?)
Whats happenin? I'm just chillin, you know
Checkin my game you dig, you know
Trippin off these fools around this situation here, you know its like that

I went from hustlin and slangin' to bustin and bangin
I got to keep it real, so fuck not cursin when I'm sangin'
Now let me tell y'all about this shit, went down the other night
Me and the doggs see some niggas, just caught up in the hype
Tryin to ride and get by like the FBI
Cause we know bout them hk's, they right outside
But we never knew y'all had a clue bout what we go through
So tell how the fuck could you speak on my crew

I went from dirt to large work like boatloads of keys
It's hard work and it hurts to live life on ya knees
So God please have a lil' mercy on my soul
What my eyes see, my mind think, my hand should hold
The outcome of these actions warm hearts turn cold
Lil' snake tryin' to blast me with the gun he stole
We hang out, banged out, same route as the day before
Blessed with perception, but don't know how my days a go
Could see my nigga hittin' with some pay, a few days ago

Blaze up a flow, sit watch my paper grow
Cautious, in case niggas wanna cross this
But they can't cross me, I'm way too flossy
Out here making millions
All in with the villians
Let's turn these millions to trillions
I've seen it all pop slow unfold, and go
Now it's time to get mo' dough, ya know
I play under the wrath of thunder
Electric shocks hot as the summer
More foul than funner, gun ya
In the open range, man it seems strange
Even sometimes deranged inside my brain
I hold the key, identify then flee
Every MC close to me
Cause I'm supposed to be all in with my chips (nigga)
I'm all in with the crips and bloods
Grips for thugs, I nudge
The homie on his shoulder, cause every day I'm getting older
As the world turns and gets colder
Laid back I shot me sumpin', Perfec from dynamic, banging G-Funk

Well I moved from the East to the West
Word on the street, niggas wanna test
But these MC's, is scared to buck
Plus they talk too much and smoke too many blunts
You fucking rookies
Sweet as Mr. Smith's cookies
Ya hate me one minute and the next ya wanna buck me
He sent a ho, in the back seat of my fo'
While ya Going Back To Cali, watch how you flow
Now ya know, about this Warren G Era
G-Funk terror, look into the mirror
And what you see is the don of the company
That nigga, (Warren, Warren, Warren to the G)
Do you still see, what I see
All of the homies in the LB
Sittin back, and we makin the cash
Warren G, Perfec, Hershey Locc and Bad Azz
 x2
And we never knew you had clue of what we go through
So how in the fuck could y'all speak of our crew
Ya thought this, ya thought that, we thought y'all should laid back
Yeah it's like that, homie it's like that
Sittin back, and we makin the cash
It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Azz
Sittin back, and we makin the cash
It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Azz

Ya know what I'm sayin Warren G
With my homeboy from the pound Hershey Locc
And the homie Perfec, ya know what I'm saying and Mr. Bad Azz
That's how we doing it fool, yeah

Hahahahahahaha, yeah! It's Kurupt Young Gotti
Hehaha, sup Warren G? It's my homeboy, huh?
With my niggas Crucial Conflict, huh?
Chillin, huh? Bumpin, puffin on a little bit of that Hay
*TOKE* Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

Dollars make sense, it's all incorporated
I'ma get it all, since a BG I done did it all, was in it all
When I first thought I was in the wrong
Couple tokes, alcohol
Got everything I need, Hennessey and weed
Since my arrival, based on this modern-day survival
Evrything is technicality, everything based on reality
So how do I get paid, all these licks nowadays
They want me laid, dropped and plagued, AK mouth is sprayed
It's like I'm blind, and I just can't see
Warren G, I'ma holler at the homey Shorty B
""Shorty B IT'S ME!"", G Dove, I'm out to make a grip
So call Crucial Conflict and let's make us some bomb shit

Look at me on the M-I-C
Tryin to stack my tips, comin in a big ole ride
With all that bumpin side, livin up in your eyes, surprise
Hangin on the corners where the young brothers be comin up
The gangbangers be gunnin up, the type of brothers that roll with us
High tech with much respect, with all that G's swarmin
Like G-Funk in your eyes and make you see we about that cashflow
Put em in a lasso, don't try to sweat, no joke
We illa your side, in the back we get hot, trade bump and hit em up
With the jigs up
Freaks from the West to the east to the South where they chief
Kurupt in the mind, Young Gotti down with the raw dog Flict
I ain't no tricks, nigga Wildstyle, enemies get closed down
We rock the shows, slammin do's, Cali to Chi-town

So chop it up, I'm gonna kick some shit about what's goin on
Have to get my loot up so I suit up
Looked in the mirror said to myself ""It's gon' be gone""
I'm sick of goin thru the things that I have to do do
Cops are happy to jack fools, I'm strictly ever gon' gank move
I hate to be the one that have to take it
But you best believe I'd die to make it
Anywhere in the world I'm standin with my pockets naked
Set it out set it out, that's what I'ma holler
On some slick, tryin to come up quick, witta trusty ole dollar
Watchin you watchin me, hope I slip and bust my knees
I'ma have to greet you at the pond, you should just be thinkin C's
Comin out at ease, no matter what I'm still hard to please
Flap flappin sky, be real til the day I leave so sneeze
Chorus: Reel Tight
Talin bout that money, dollar
Gettin that money, gettin paid
*repeat x3*

We, smackin and stackin, packin, strappin, what's happenin? Rollin
Cruise-controllin, the fo' and Daynes swell up
Get the hell up, trump-tight click just in case I'm lavish
Tryin ta fade me, you crazy ladies, babies created
Men are shady, straight make me drink til my thoughts get swavy
I think, maybe if I blink things will get back gravy
But loccs in the hood they lord be makin it hard so lately
But I gotta stay at the table, cos that raw dope is that will pay me
Westside of California, on these corners pimpin daily
Retire out on the lakefront, smokin blunts
Takin the sale G, trap me like the male be
To the Westside I'm a mental, all the regulators trail me

Don't kick it out, let's do this
Comin out the do', we down to wall
Gotta get in the business
Tell me waht's the call, we to the fall to ball
We can't just fold up
Gotta whole bunch of homies dependin on this, sho'nuff
This only hustle is for brothers
Feel to bring the business so slow up
And we still up on a mini gold rush
Ready to make the world go down
Bound to get it cos I'm down wit it
Now shitty the city, Conflict's causin critics to bite tongues
Ain't the one, with the shotgun, showdown
My town to your town on the rebound for them papers

It's like brother brother brother how you make em get down?
From the LBC to the Chi-town, Westside straight gettin down
Hittin switches and we checkin all snitches
Gettin all riches, and flossin in our pictures
It's time for some new hits, one of us

Hey
We came here to ride
Falling back to ready
And set to collide
Niggas you won't know the death you died
Suicide, it's a suicide
(Verse 1, Warren G)
I'm deadly as ever
Ready for whatever
Tryin'a keep my pockets heavy on the cheddar
Got nothin to prove, just really expressin myself
While y'all niggas in the studio stressin yaself
Ya got to do it, so why not do it big?
Drop the music, and spit fluid to they wig
Under dig, I'mma split the game in half
And leave 'em all mad, like Warren what'chu done did?
Hey, we came here to ride
Never slippin, Beretta sittin on my side
Blaze up, cause I'm tryin'a raise up, and flow
I came up, from broke, to papered up
Don't test me, I bust like a twelve-gauge sawed-off
And hoes jump on stage and rip they drawers off
And I see through, all that's see through
Make up a weave in ya head this evening, but hey

(Verse 2, Warren G)
Sworn to the streets
Born in the beach
Armed with the heat
Mourning my peeps
Makin niggas respect mine
I came to collect mine
Comin through with the Tech-9
Lettin my neck shine
Might let a nigga slide with a pass
But next time, I might disconnect his neck from his spine
Run up and catch him from behind and stretch him
We squeeze triggas like ketchup
Wet'cha whole stretch up
Scared of the truth
You fear it, don't wanna hear it
Til' the Smithsons bust
Then you listen up
Cause I'mma tell it like it is
Like it was, or like it always will be
Give a fuck if you feel me

(Verse 3, Warren G)
Who am I?
W-A, double R, E-N to the motherfuckin G
Suicide, niggas hang they self
Might as well bend over, and finger-bang they self
Sell they soul for the fame and wealth
And end up broke and lonely
Nobody to blame but'cha self
But me, I keep it all business
Cause this is business, can I get a witness?
See I been chillin like a villain
With a million and my children
Plottin on revealin what the game been concealin
I got a little older and learned a bit
Applied the effort, and earned a grip
Now I notice it's a hater, in every circle
As I roll another Vega, heavy with purple
Take a puff and inhale
And hold it til' it gets stale
In my chest, exhale my stress
My nigga R-B-X

Young Locs Slow Down,Return of the Regulator,2001,"(Butch Cassidy talking)

Take notes young locs, I advise y'all to slow down
Glocks, K's, and Eagles trying to put a murder down
Watching fools servin' clowns
With your eyes on the prize, hitting switches
And getting bitches with plenty riches
And if you bang homie, do that
But when your ass gets slapped with that 25, handle that
And all you see is the glamor and gold
Don't know the other side of the game is where it's scandalous and cold
Your destiny is in your hands, you got control
Wasting time with your life until your ass is old
Trying to be bold, a hog and a pimp
Eighteen years old, HIV and a limp

Careful of what you ask for
Sometimes you just should let go
Get what you need and not want
Some folks believe and some don't
These are the ones that don't last
Hard head makes a soft ass
But it was something that I had to have
I just had to have

Whats crackin' youngsta
Little OG sick with it
Bangin loose Dickies sagging, house shoe kicking it
Blaze with me, nigga let me swing with you
Hop in the cut dog, and spit this game to ya
I see them niggas have got you tatted and caught in a pattern
Of clutching a Glock, and banging on niggas at the bus stop
Putting in work, in your Pro Club white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain stripes for the turf
But loc, what up, shit I knew your brother
Used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker
Until they amputated both of my legs, circled the block
Caught your brother slippin' and filled him with lead
The retaliation was swift, furious, and just know this hood shit is serious
And for the sake of his memories, see about your paper
And remember locs, success is the best revenge on these haters, nigga


Murder, murder, murder

I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Murder, murder, murder

I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Niggas have got the game twisted
Yet if these busters pump 'em up
And distort their vision, fool listen
Life is like a crap shot
You can either hit the jackpot
Stack a knot and get your cap shot

Live you life homie, do that
But don't get pumped up to dump and get cracked
And moms put a block on the phone
You's a hard motherfucker, now you all alone

All alone in the streets it was on

In Case Some Shit Go Down,In the Mid-Nite Hour,2005,"(INTRO)
He he ha
I'm serious nigga one of ya'll niggas got some bad mothafuckin
Breath up here hey baby hey baby hay baby gimme some
Bubble gum in this mothafucka somethin man lets gone
And get somethin to eat study long study wrong nigga
With so much drama in the LBC
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D-O double G
But I somehow, some way, keep comin'
Up with funky-ass shit like every single day
May I kick a little somethin' for the G's and make a few ends as I
Breeze through two in tha mornin and the party's still jumpin
Cause my mama ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till 6 in the morning (six in tha mornin)
So whatcha wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my home boys do too
So turn off the lights and close the door
But for what--we don't love dem hoes
Yeahhh so we gonna smoke an ounce to this
G's up hoes down while ya motherfuckas bounce to this
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody's got their cups but the ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you're listening to the D O G
I got to cultivatin the music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And to mackin' this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the home boys' lady (Oh that bitch)
80 degress when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N.U.T's
Could you get some of these at ease
As I rhyme with the dog pound feel the breeze
Biyatch I'm just
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Later on that day my homey Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat-ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit--this ain't no joke-- I have to back up
Off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin' I'm still poppin'
Dre gots the bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me--not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nutt
I'm raisin up out the cock
Don't get upset girl that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes--I'm out the door
And I'll be...
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Laid back--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice
Biyatch--with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street smokin' endoe sippin' on gin n juice

You Never Know,I Want It All,1999.0,"(Snoop)
Got a little something for the summertime
While you on the grind
Getting yours
Hell yeah! I'm getting mine
I take trips and dips just to recline
I blaze up the orange weed
To relax my mind
Spend time with my kids on the weekdays
And I holla at my momma and my
Grandma on the threeway
She say, If you do right
Baby boy I promise you live
A long life
I can't argue
I try hard to
Not blast niggas
I walk past niggas
With my head up to the skedai(sky)
Nigga tried to pull a fast one
On Snoop Dogg
To get some shut eye
What I do to him I can't speak
You know the episode
And the code on the street
I keep it all the scriffin' y'all
But real street for y'all
Cause you never know
When you're gonna go, no
(Chorus)
You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you
Just Hold on
You never know
(Warren G)
]From the killing
The robbing
The squabbing
And jacking
Car jacks to kidnaps
What? Niggas be acting a fool
Trying to set me up at the park
But I'm cool
Act a fool
My daddy said throw them thangs
And stay strong
My momma got sick
So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game
Fuck the fame
I got a little boy to see through
And him without me
Is like me without you
Keep it true
And stay down for your grips
Homies and licks staying tight
Like this
You never know
(Chorus)
(Phats Bossi)
You niggas never know
Which man are blasted for
Never know which man to kill
Just to settle the score
It wasn't long ago
I had this partner of mine
Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double
We just in this
Trying to get rich at the interest
Keep it pimping
Stay with niggas that's relentless
Smoke dough
Just because I say so
Money pronto
And niggas never would know
They never know nigga

Well few dreams ever come true
Well some do, so nigga say (I'm from the beach too)
Long Beach City G's Funkin
And its a pity who many we's punk and drunk
In a hotel lobby at a town near you
Housekeeper's high, and drinkin beer too
Cleared through the nite
My niggas movin with the skirts
In the boxes, houseshoes, and slingshot t-shirts
Its gettin late, I'm runnin out of gas
So Warren G tryin to see whats up on some ass
Really doe, y'all enjoyed the show, good
But what you know about these Long Beach boys in the hood
Should anything go wrong and niggas act shitty
Remember fool this is Long Beach city, punk

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Well it was boring until Warren G came on the scene
Put the G-Funk with the gangsta lean
Its been about 2, is he comin through?
I dropped this one just to show you I'm true
People say Warren where'd you get that speech
In the sandy city right down by the beach
Speak, dont speak on, if you wanna speak on
If you wanna get yo groove on, LOC on
To the fullest, bounce rock skate
A new time, a new rhyme, legislate
Thats how we do it in the S-I-X
LBC, 213, and we straight shit at the next
So lets party hearty like Lodi Dodi
We punkin yo city you betta ask somebody
Cuz if you dont, we ain't showin no pity
More bounce to the ounce and we rockin yo city

Can you feel it

Can you feel it
Can you feel it

From city to city and state to state
This DJ gonna regulate
So playa hate if you want to, I dont give a fuck
I'm still G-dubb and I'm subbin in my truck so good luck
And have a nice trip
We got y'all town locked down like a vice grip
I'm on the dice tip, shootin C-notes
A dollar and the bones hollerin G-oats
Cuz we quotes, them gangsta raps
That ya'll paid for, and we banks the snaps
We perhaps, if you could see what I see
Then you might be gettin paid like this nigga Warren G
So fee, fie, foe, I'm from, the LB to the C nigga dont act dumb

It Ain’t Nothin’ Wrong With You,Return of the Regulator,2001,"It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you (we do it nasty, nasty)

I once knew a girl named LaShonda
Short little cute thing
With a pinky diamond ring
She was iceless
My game was so priceless
Givin her a facial
I was G'd up
From the feed up
Pushin the bent
With the midnight tint
Huh, heaven sent

I once met a girl in the valley and
Half black half Italian
Ass like a stalian
Coke bottles shake
As she likes to watch herself on tape
Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more
She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel
Pranksta with a pearl
Held my balls so long
I call trouble when I'm with my girl

There's a law for that
We ain't trippin, we hogs for that
Uh

It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you
(we do it nasty, nasty)

I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie
She was as bad as Carmen
Chillin in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem
Straight dime
Body bangin like a baseline
And the face fine
I had to spit dip waste time
Mr. Passionate
Everything her body was immaculin
The presence like a gift to men and got packaged

Fuckin fabolous
She say ""damn he fat""
Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that)
Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it
Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin roll, goddamn it
Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash
To lick me baby and I might lick you back

Lickin you back
She's gaggin with a dick in her trap
And stickin is fat
I'll pull it out and tickle your cat


I put the smash on her like Shaq
She want the cash on her
I ain't havin that
You need to check yo' trap
I got rose cap
G'd up, 213, please believe that

I stay pimpin in a bubble I Benz
With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends
I slide up on 'em like a cross fader
The hook up later
And serve this dick like a waitor
I ain't tryna date her

When it comes to bitches
I got more game than the olympics
I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology
For no reason I'm recievin apologies
Break her down mentally
Have her stockin and follow me

Trick be swallowin me
For a nine on the vein
Cuz I'm the fuckin boss, she's my employee
I ain't hatin, I appreciate you freaky ass style
Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile

Walk These Streets,In the Mid-Nite Hour,2005.0,"I make music for block pushers and go-getters
From gators, to house slippers, and Mo' sippers
The old, and new school, the hard hitters
And fuck whoever that don't roll with us
This here is international player
Fuck the Senator's daughter and have lunch with the Mayor
I'm in a league all by myself
Everything I done I did for me - by myself
Walked away from bullshit and called the inner circle
Had to get my head right (fuck Universal)
I took the time to be free again - grinding
I finally feel like me again

I gotta walk these streets again
I'm gonna roll on with my friends
I'll talke my time, I'll read the signs, I'll be just fine
Mo sipping with my chicks
So hold my telephone cards
I'ma just keep doing my thing, stocking this game, stacking my change

A range meeting with lawyers and stock brokers
Then back to the block pouring liquor with shirt soakers
When it come to the dough, I'm about my cheddar
50 Cent ain't the first off to pop Berattas
I'ma walk this road and G here forever
Born and raised, addicted to this Cali weather
It feels good to be me right about now
If my moms could see me now she'd be proud


All across the globe they know me
I regulate, international G
It ain't nobody as fly as, fly as who
Warren G and Raphael Saadiq, stop acting all edgy
Mentally it's cut already
Bet you won't bet me that your pussy ain't ready
I'm on track on my back, the monkey ain't heavy
Rock on with the mic gangsta beat rock steady
If music should die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take
Dedicated to hits, and that's showbizz
Can't eat, can't live, can't no busters alive fuck with this
I ain't gone miss, I'm gone ride, put it down that's on my kids

So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon

Nigga back up, see I came to stack up
Bodies like hits, whats that
You wanted to act up, and diss the click
A sister, put my niggas up wetted the grave
You wanted to get richer, so offer your beats that made by fade
Cascade, because yo ass is soapy
Mr. Locc you wanna be Mr. low key
When yo ass used to be low key
You know me so act like you know my click
And I'm an assist to kick the shit that you and MD could never get with
And speakin of MD, another nigga that used to be from my click
Act like he double to down, but when it go down, go down he splits
This is strictly for all of y'all niggas that diss me
Y'all think y'all skills is up to par well stars come out and get me

Well let that nigga loose
No better yet just let the dog loose
So he could fetch, goin to Vegas to see what he catch
Ain't gonna be no cases
Just tell him what he faces and watch him snitch
While I lay up in Vegas
Its either the Raiders or the switch so he did
Switched over like electric shocks
Moms got on pregnant static
So they suspected pops
Did they know about me
Mr. K-9 see, clicksta in deep, in your Mama's panties
Did they know that I was bangin it
Where at, oh your Daddy's bread be back
Now she's pregnant and I ain't claimin it
Your husband's cryin cuz he feels like a chump
What, your son is fit to die and he ain't nuthin but a punk huh
She can't sayin nuthin cuz she needs my support?

Never leave you alone praying for one more day
Who'd these niggas come and get their hooks from
When they needed their radio shit spun
Nate Number One
A true artist indeed, you made your own lane
All these albums we drop will never be the same
Without your voice on em

Choked up, smoked out, riding to these melodies
Reminiscing memories
On my way to visit you in therapy
Hoping God make it clear to me
On what the plan is
This dirty game is hella scandalous
So this right here, is dedicated to Nate!

This is dedicated to you...

Grinding in the beach
To make it on the streets

Standing side by side, man we down for whatever
Was the days of the past, now I'm looking to the future like
I don't even want to do music
But, I gotta keep it crackin
It's a challenge when your homie's talent hanging in the balance and
Life is such a trip, I know the world is full of madness
Relearning learn how to walk and talk again, I can't imagine
What that rehabilitation is like
When the Doc said that you couldn't sing on the mic
What the hell is going on
He's been writing songs

Here Comes Another Hit,Return of the Regulator,2001,"Waiting around a crew of thugs
That parade in blue, and yelling cuz (whats up cuz)
Ate by selling drugs
'38 snub in the waist, in case fools lose love
These days still the same
I concealed the flame, eyes kill with the pain
So I advise y'all to chill with the games
Entertain for the cheddar and the change
So fuck whoever, in the fame, forever remain
Around my dogs, banging the pound, swanging the town
How we choose, now I'm aggravated and assault is my next move
Success means issues, so I guess it's time for me to disclude
Handle mines, we use pistols
G's move with the conscience
When we disapprove of that nonsense
Ex-cons with that gangsta gangsta gangsta shit
Here come another hit

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination, in the industry
Here comes another one

I can see us smashing up the shore past laws thats lost
2000 Ucon Excel, duel exhaust
TV screen, DVD, E-mail
Passenger, bad female, what the hell
Stash spot, with the hollow head shell
Niggas start trippin, I'm on the next tail
Hands free, callin' up my nigga Warren G
I pull strings, like Meyer Lansky
Bulletproof, limo tint you can't see
Mr. G rollin' up weed, afghany sensee
Bad MC, Mike Fiend, you the know spinage
Like winter green mint, talk shit
Sleep with the fish, you cement
New residence, with no hesitance
It gets tints on the floor
Staple center chick, next to Denzel and Nicholsen
Phil Jackson whistlin'


Mean mugs in the club, mean nothing to us
In South scene, me and the team trying to fuck us some sluts
Dying to fuck, I chuck us when we step through
Poppin' our collars, with our nephews
Next to you, you got millionaires moving
Hitting the dance floor, stealing their groovin'
Doing they damn thing, and ain't worried about a damn thing
But man, thats the celebrity ways
Poppin' a litty got some rappers scared of these days
Industry ways, thats how Hollywood pays
Uh, top dollar when I dip my Impala
In front of the club, make your woman wanna holla (holla)
At a playa though, what's your dude yo
I keep it gangsta, I ain't trying to be rude ho
Oh, you know how that shit go
Or give when cats get fed off the four or fifths",https://genius.com/Warren-g-here-comes-another-hit-lyrics

This Gangsta Shit is Too Much,Return of the Regulator,2001,"1, 2, 1, 2, yeah
All yeah, we doing it like that
We flip that, uh
More in the crib
Dru, yeah, D-Funk allstars
Thats how we do it, G-Funk, yeah

What's y'all thought, I wasn't gonna return with a hit
Too much smokin' that Sherman shit
I learned this from the best, and got y'all sprung
The, the doctor, Andre Young
Compton, LB, ain't nothing y'all can tell me
Going hard on the yard, 'till me dogs bailed me
They tells me, I can't precede with it
I came back and got ole G'd with it
We get crunk, spit it when we drunk
Commited to that shit, that makes the gangstas stump
Chumps can try, if they choose to to
With these locs love my dogs like the Blues Clues
So excuse you, I'm the reason for the fame
And all of a sudden, you ain't believing in the name
What? Butch Cassidy, show 'em what we working with

This gangsta shit is too much
Don't be suckas, can't touch
It's working in the LBC, nonstop to the NYC
Warren G, with the gangsta three's, oooh wee!

And the win, on the 7-10 southbound
Duece and gin, getting guzzled down by the mouth now
Smashing a hundred in the car pool
Thats the type of thing that hogs do
My concern ain't the fame, I hope you know that
Status: millionaire, still don't show that
Go back to where I was raised
On the porch is where they got braids, never not afraid
To test my shot, drop a hundred dollar fade
Holla, don't be a major see me in the hood
Off TV, totally un-Hollywood
Still to the good and you know that
Still with me, still when you show that
And Big Snoop Dogg we gonna blow that
Still with it, we all say that we real with it
Until bustas reveal, how we really did it


So what's crackin' now
Got these haters actin' now
Backin' down to this gangsta sound
Westcoast circus clowns
It's on purpose how I spit rounds
You trying to get down
Abnorm with the form, swarming heated
Hitting fools Glocks like we got cheated
Repeated simotaneously
I'm bringing bangers with me
So hopefully, moves can be made
We can all get paid, relax in the shade
Sun, snow, it really don't matter
We can all make dough
Eastcoast, westcoast, midwest, dirty south
And big heads, is what I'm all about
And big heads, is what I'm all about
And big heads, is what I'm all about, fool",https://genius.com/Warren-g-this-gangsta-shit-is-too-much-lyrics

All glassed out with the count of the bitch

Relax Ya Mind,UnKnown,1997.0,"Its that nigga Gz WheeZ
Back for the 9-c
I ex sippin on the yak so people wanna know whats next
Ain't nuthin changed, another day a new time
With this uptempo beat with the G-Funk rhyme
Regulatin state to state, coast to coast
Its all about the call of greens, yak, lets toast
Cuz its a ballin society
I try to be the dopest I can be in this industry
But you dont hear me
I think ya betta, I think ya betta
Cuz when I, get it goin on I ain't gonna let up
I set up, the g-funk family and we
Funkin up the industry until eternity
Its alright with you if its alright with me
We'll get down to the sounds of the LBC
Chorus: repeat 2X
Relax your mind, your mind, your mind
Relax your mind and let your conscious be freein you down
To the sounds of the Warren G
It ain't easy bein Gz
But the lifestyle I chose, the status to which I rose
The doors, I open, I'm loccin, I'm scopin
Through the eyes of the G Child
I see many try to duplicate the LBC style
But it ain't even happenin like that
I was time I had to make a comeback
And get mine, you know I'm genuine
Been in motion with the potion with Snoop since 89
Devotion is the key for me so
Relax your mind and let your conscious be free
The homey just touched down, foolin wit a pound
Put yo gun down, so you can walk a safe ground
Chorus: repeat 2X
I know it's been hard on you for about two, so
I had to relax your mind, I thought you knew
Ain't nothin but a Long Beach party
With yo hands in the air, with the twist of Coke and Bacardi
All the homeys around and the slingshot t-shirts
Skirts wit the baby fat it'll work
Pass me the indosmoke and get locced
From the beach to the bay, makin them sway
Like the ocean in motion, we coastin
Relax your mind and keep floatin (floatin, floatin, floatin)
And walk a safe ground

Snoozin' in the fast lane
Speed Dreamin'
Now I'm in overdrive
Speed Dreamin'
Nappin' in cruise control
Trying to get back to where I should have been by now
Cadillacs stand in the tree line
I'm making them be like
Swerving to the curb
Tires squealing, rubber peeling
Pull up to a halt
But then we're thinking someone ought


I got funk for all yall from me to the bid dogs
Get your asses up pass the blunt
Smoke som', after this go and poke som'

Um, excuse me Warren I got something about substance abuse
Roll a half ounce up jump in my shit
Hit a switch watch it bounce up (GOOD GRIEF)
Meet me in the 
Elco with gold leaf
 (WHO)
Grimm big pimpin' like Filmore Slim

Tilted brim Mista Grimm rollin' shotgun
 hop one
Drop one, nigga 
hit 'em with the Bop Gun

Yeah I got the chronic its ferocious
You can feel it in your bones like osteoporosis
West coast shit, Im grabbin my gonads
And slangin' gangsta vocabs straight of the notepad

Aft the dope sack quote that gangsta funk
Warren G, what y'all thought?
Bringing the funk


You listening to G rhymes and I'm here to drop lines
I got that funky fly shit that you wanna hear all the time
All in your system like menthol, yes y'all
Just remove cd from package then install
In your stereo here you go
New material grand imperial
Eat your Mista Grimm cereal
Hit the floor whats rough rugged, twenty four karat nugget like the microphones I carry in my Gucci luggage
I'm Thuggish Ruggish
To the bone marrow
 and soak in linen apparel talkin the double barrel
Black super hero rhymin'
Rappin sittin busting like its nothing still puffin' coughin chokin
Wild up in the fan's in Oakland floatin
Swerving, taking the dirty version between Persians
Sippin burbon brand new Excursion
Message: Salt kills snails (Saaaaalt)
Nah playas 
its that West Covina rhyme sayer
, yeah


Mista G.R.I.M.M. we done dropped one
With my Uncle George we done lock one
Atomic Dog

Knee Deep
, in the fast lane

With the 454 engine block burnin' rubber for a block
Psycho like a Hictchcock flick
Trick, sinister thoughts streamin' while let'n out shots adrenaline pumpin'
G Dub say somethin'

Supercalifragilocus
 you could quote this 
off that purple
You can blow this
Light up pass it around
We make the world go round like 
the G Funk sound

I keep the pedal to the medal
Speed dreamin', slidin', dip n glidin'
Chocolate Thai high
Come on, jump in, let's ride, hop in the Mothership
And dip with Mista Grimm and Warren G
We got that shiznit


Heres to that someone who can't take the pressure
Mercy for that poor fool who made the news
Who feel pissed on that insist on killing all men
Can't take the sorrow of the horrors of his abuse
It ain't worth the sorrows to cause the death ......all men
He's a disgrace to the species in to his face with some feces
Big nose mothafucka got it comin'
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a sucker?
How late do you have to be before you get absent?
Warren G with the P you beta step aside, I'll stick my foot so far up in your ass
The water his knee will rise above your head and drown before you get your ass kickin'
Stop stepin' in footsteps hard to keep up with

Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them

Every since I could remember
I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend 'em
But as time went by
My life got a little strange
And the rules of the game seem to change
Trust, honesty and devotion
And money, money, money is the poison potion
There's no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me
Or even bad to me it had to be
Cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically
And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get
But my friendship with niggas always ends up as bulshit
I listen to my momma though
She always tried to prepare me
Byt how could she do what I
I mean I'm do or die
But my life on the streets
That shit is suicide
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke
I'm mashin' with the click 2-1-3 that is
They my homeboys ever since kids-
Real friends to the end

Hangin' out with my homies and I'm feelin' just fine
I've been ponderin' lately
A lot of different things on my mind
It seems lately my friends list
Done took a slight decline
And if you wanna know the trith man, man
Them wasn't no friends of mine

You jackin' me up, you takin' my cash
All my life L-B-C, for my city I mash
All those OGs and BGs and wannabies and L-O-Cs
The only friends I got is my 2-1-3s
That's my nigga Snoop D Woop and my nigga N-A-T-E
I can't forget about my nigga H to the Deezy
Pressure and strikes
Don't wann take no lives
But these jaws, cracks and hood cracks
Will make you break bizacks
Whussup homie, can I borrow some cash?
Last week I agve you 500, so kiss my ass
I got a baby to feed
A familly to see through
And shake busta snitches tweekin' like you
Homies and friends that's what they for

Devoted and quoted back in 84
Growin up in the LBC
Platinum city, where the big gamers be
Involved in everythang from Pop Warner
To whats poppin on every corner
Find a skirt if you wanna
Tryin to come up in this world
Where everything is drama
Beverly was like my mama
W-A-double R-E-N
Tryin to get in where I can fit in
Catchin a bus with a homey I can trust
3 homeys from the hood straight kickin up dust
Enjoyin my days and everythang is fine
15 years old Snoop d whoop on the grind
Tryin to find ways to make it, dice shake it

We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do

Nobody does it better on which you do the weather
The days we used to call first year playin get like me
Gettin in fo of zines, I loved em
Long Beach was the hometown
And every spot that we rocked, you know we got down
Outside at the club just spittin raps
And every busta that ran up was gettin cracked
Underground tapes used to be the claim to fame
Long Beach Was A Mutha was a classic mane
Tellin tales about how we was strugglin
And surrounded wit tha homeys that was all clubbin
Tryin to make it in this music
Quick fast, quick cash, and hittin on the quick dash
We in this game to make hits
And make everybody respect the G-Funk click

We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do

To sellin million overseas
Rollin Dees
And makin money by the trees
To killer Bees, evading all enemies
Catastrophies, young GFC's
We made it now, livin good wit no hassles
But still a lot of problems dealin wit shady acts doe
Its all a part of makin hits doe
See our careers take off like a US missle

They're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' bout jack But
I'm the same brother day in and day out And
I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out in a casket It's
Drastic 'cause, homies is plastic Break
'em off some bread they, want the whole damn basket If
You's a true homey you, would wish me well Not
Plot to see a brother fell jealous, as hell We
Used to get the same riches Now
Your trigger-finger got the itches schemin', on my riches Which
Is not a suprise my, eyes peep game 211's
187's, it's all the same It's
All a shame homies'd, jack you for your grip Ain't
No love involved because, it's all about the chips Repeat
* chorus Verse
* 3 Now for these labels tellin' fables Makin'
The messed-up deals under the tables You
Think that you smart but, fool, I'm, the smartest You
Can't make no money if you can't keep an artist Sign
The dotted line put, 'em on the shelf Break
'em off some crumbs keep, the rest for yourself I
Know how it goes treat, an artist like you know Fly
Cars gold, clothes, but, no dough Since
It's all business I'm-a, handle mine Keep
Track of my stack down to the very last dime 'Cause
In this rap game it's, all about the buck You
Bend over for the label and you will get bucked Like
How we run up in the skirt and, then you're through The
Record label do the same thing to you 90%
Business 10%, show Ain't
No love in this game 'cause, it's all about the dough",https://genius.com/Warren-g-do-what-it-do-lyrics
My Momma,I Want It All,1999.0,"Yo I wanna take this time out to dedicate this song
To one of the most beautiful ladies in the world
Could never imagine
Yeah, Ole Mae, that's my momma, y'know
To one of the most beautifulest ladies in the world
I love ya momma, keep it strong for ya
Chorus: repeat 2X
My momma, used to tell me quit smoking weed
My momma, gave me everthing I need
My momma, said keep faith in God
My momma, momma, momma, momma, momma

From the beginning, soon as my feet touched the earth
For what it's worth, she loved the boy from birth
Kept me fed, combed my head
And tapped that tail when I didn't do what she said
Through the years comin up momma always provided
And when the times got rough momma always tried to hide it
Divide it among us, but pardon the youngsters
Told us never to lie, smoke dope, and cuss
She stood tall and proud like a supermodel on a catwalk
And momma didn't take no back talk
She's the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this to Ole Mae
That's my momma
Chorus

As a young teenager I started to clown
My momma did all she could to try to slow me down
Tired of her son be brought by the cops
Sent to go stay with my pops
He taught me to be my own man, and when I disrespected
He put me out on the streets to find my own land
Now I'm servin on the urban street corner
Smokin bud, sippin Coronas in Long Beach, California
But I promised my momma I would make it to the top
And use this rap to put her in the drop
She the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this here to my Ole Mae
Chorus

As I grew up, blew up in the G-Funk Era
I see my momma everytime I take a look in the mirror
I'm thankful she gotta chance to see me shine
My momma's in my heart and my soul and mind
Controllin mine, so I can stand strong
For ya grandkids to let em know that ya spirit lives on
I really miss you, but I know ya looking over
Lead me on the right track, the angel's on my shoulder
Chorus

So I want y'all to treasure ya mom
Ya know, so if y'all got a bad relationship
Or y'all on bad terms, patch it up
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Thats a precious jew-el
Remember that, we all gotta go through it
So stay strong, down dis, dis road, ya know
But I can't forget about all the poeple
Out there that I love, and got my back
So I'm gonna go ahead and im gonna shoot a shout out
My daddy, my sistas, my brothers, my girl, my kids
My cousins, my aunties, my uncles, my grandmomma
My granddaddy, all my homeboys, all my homegirls
And everybody out there that got love, knowwhatI'msaying?
We gotta keep it like that, we gotta keep it groovin",https://genius.com/Warren-g-my-momma-lyrics
We Brings Heat,Take a Look Over Your Shoulder (Reality),1997.0,"Playaz, playettes, macks, trues, wannabes
All you muthafuckaz, we gonna kick it like this
For the trues

Yeah this crew was tight, went from planning dreams
Now we rockin mics, gettin shit right, stayin on beat
And servin this heat, through yo streets, jealous hoes peep
But me, I dont sleep
So you know I catch you watchin
While they comin with drama, I'm blockin and steady knockin
The post is won out the box, it dont stop, hittin our areas and shakin up spots

I'm bakin blocks in four wheel motion
Everywhere I look I see 21 ones floatin (21st Street!)
Then I made a stop at the P-A-C's
Wassup y'all? You seen Tripp L-O double C, now
I'm headin to the back where the homeys is posted
Niggas on gat in case plat wanna get roasted
But you know how that go, in the city of snakes, fakes, hmm and bitch brakes
I shakes, back to the topic called heat
My beat, your treat, can't nobody fuck wit me
Cuz I'm known from Cali to Rome
We brings heat, so now its on
 x2
Bring heat to the table and play your cards right
My crew got heat we got game air tight

Through thick and thin, see we like kin
And it won't stop no matter what happens
Man you not knowin, who's tops they be blowin
I brings heat, independant and I will release
The ultraviolet, bangin beats for the pilot
Got the sky lit now who really wanna try it
Its warm when we swarm, your area gonna get torn
And a job that work g funk in the purest form
For what its worth, I'm a let you know
I'm hyperactive for those who react too slow, all alone
My fleets movin fast,  hand in hand with the aftermath
My skills was built to last

Forever in a day, but some days we gotta trip
Throwin lics for grits, steady stackin our chips
The money clips dont fit, now is it the way we dip on
These and those, mo Gs and hoes, I assumes on a mission, (on a mission)
Conditions ain't the same got the average nigga wishin, but still missin
The simple facts it ain't like that
Turn the tables when the label dont react, its Wayniac
 x2
Bring heat to the table and play your cards right
My crew got heat we got game air tight

Too much clout I'm havin so niggas be grabbin at my wealth
At test a math, set them back on the shelf
They say we love your skills, I'm good for your health,,
My lifeline droppin the dime on them like a stealth bomb
Will calm a nigga down with my one round
Suppose they act up, my back up's involved now
GFCs included, my crew is undisputed
Heavyweight champs, known for blowin out yo amps

I had patience but now I'm anxious
Lurkin like a cat on the deal with my sack
I know somebody watchin the Locc
Can't stop cuz it just start poppin please
I gots tah have it like Mickey D's
Over 60 billion served rollin on the daily
Can't tell me shit put it in and I won't notice
Me and my niggas nothin but that top notch
Long Beach postin up the road blocks
You can't go through, or around, you gotta turn back
I'm gettin turned back, ridahs and killaz that dont play that
Known to bring it on when it pop, missions to clock
Stages to rock, when I'm done lounge at the spot

Keepin’ it Strong,Return of the Regulator,2001,"Sometimes I sit back and think about how it was
When I was young, I used to think it was you I couldn't live without
Somehow, life took a sad route
Sometimes the wind blows bad enough to take a plane down
Your straight bullets killed children on playgrounds
Bullshit got me about to smoke a whole pound
Meanwhile, I smile, hoping I can rebound
Somehow the LBC streets ain't the same now, without you
Things ain't been the same since you ain't around
But I stay strong game tight, hold it down
Warren G, I never played a blackground
This song is fucked up, because you gone

Oooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
Oooh, It makes me reminsce
Over and over, again and again

Nothing means more to me, than family
When one lost, its sad to see, damn its me
A friend you will always be
Above all things, you taught me to persue my dreams
With joy it brings, at times when I sit and think
I know inside you smiled down, proud at me
I just need one more drink, damn
At night I can't sleep, I admit that its hard to eat
It's all good, I ain't trippin'
Tried to show me the right laws and guidelines
But I ain't listen, I'm sitting here lavishing and living
And I'd give it all back because you still missing


Lord please hear me, ease my soul
I woke up one day and my mom was gone
I'm in the zone wishing I could call your home
Sing your song, tell ya that I'm out on tour
All alone, I just needed to hear your voice on the phone
Mother and son, though I'm grown
Life moves on, I need you mom, a quiet storm
Differences and right and wrong
As I move on, since Warren G ain't gone
The stitch is on, set the tone, the page I'm on
Is having fun, having a ball, living life
I'm still here, wishing you was home

Over, over, over, over, over
Again, again, I miss you
Ohhh mama, don't know, don't care
How I keep it strong, keep moving on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on

C'mon (The Ruff Ryders)
Flame on (Double R, baby)
Flame on, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Aiyyo, y'all niggas take too long wrapping them up in duct tape
Me, I just make sure they stomp like crush grapes
I make the hardest shed a tear
Give 'em a gun, if I had two right here
Two over there, fuck playin' fair!
Y'all niggas like loose-leaf paper, easy to tear
Drag just burn that up and get it outta here
Y'all think y'all goin' from heaven to hell?
Y'all ain't goin' nowhere
But in the same town on the same dirty ground
And I don't care how you livin' it up
I even got dead niggas shiverin' up
You can bet I come diggin' you up
Them niggas bust guns just to make niggas run by
Me? I squeeze mine with one eye and one closed and focus
The one open is at the tip of the nose
When it blows, y'all so-called-pimps die hoes
Don't bite rhymes or flows, just air mark
Snap with a finger, have y'all wanted in dead park

Anything that's dealin' with dough, we got that
Cock back, hold in position for combat
Stand clear, all y'all cowards have been warned
Duck, nigga, run for your life, we airborne

Anything that's dealin' with dough, we got that
Cock back, hold in position for combat
Stand clear, all y'all cowards have been warned
Duck, nigga, run for your life, we airborne

Yo, yo, aiyyo, who the fuck you think spit mean?
Same bitch that tried to put Irv Gotti teams
Since I had a snotty scream
Was taught to die in a red beam
Never ask when I need cash
I'm a customer, I snatch your cream
Soldier, cross-over, knock on my door
Wit' Jahovah, huh, know the population's over
I'm causing early retirements
Cuz you blast last when I'm firing
Dyin' in the blood you lyin' in
Went from the full house to the raw house
To niggas tryin' to rip my draws out
Try it now, nigga, blow your jaw out
You don't want my gun to go pow-pow
Well, I'mma have your face the same color
As a tongue of a chow-chow, nigga
These ain't water pistols- they shoot many missles
And when I set 'em off, they scar your bones to the grissle
Only I knew how it was gonna come
Put up in your baby-mom, for your only son
I'm takin' e'eryone

Anything that's dealin' with dough, we got that
Cock back, hold in position for combat
Stand clear, all y'all cowards have been warned

Anything that's dealin' with dough, we got that
Cock back, hold in position for combat
Stand clear, all y'all cowards have been warned
Duck, nigga, run for your life, we airborne

Uh, I'm psychologically fucked up, know the truth
See, I's sick, throwin' up Henny and ?Gook?
POOF! Me gone, I pray for the death of my mother
Until I woked up and hugged her, and told her that I loved her
Sick sin, my ink pen stay in the ring
Crown me king, I spit through the eyes of a fiend
Golden ice, I stole for the love of my wife
Then she ran out and dumped me, and po-po pump me
Came home, of course as the king of my throne
Back to Roley's, back to smokin' bones with coley
My demo was better than a lot of y'all records
Bed rocked your ass, calm down, so let the gun go
I murdered some quick for dough
Hit 'em up fast, watched them die extra slow
I lock shop when I come through with the blue tops
Smokin' a oo-whop, with all Glocks cocked

Anything that's dealin' with dough, we got that
Cock back, hold in position for combat
Stand clear, all y'all cowards have been warned
Duck, nigga, run for your life, we airborne

Anything that's dealin' with dough, we got that

She young, she young, she young, she young

I hit the 21 blocks each and every day
Niggas peepin they shoulders in each and every way
No sweat, cuz if I sweat it
I stay true to the game, so I'm not gonna let it
Take control of me, fool you can roll with me
From OG to OG you can reminisce with me
About the hutch, about the milk bowl
Two dee took a bank left knockin fools out on
It was me baby boppa and the homey tic
All my folks locked down, gotta make it legit
So I'm a spit, and keep my spittin straight real
I know that you can feel penetentiary steel
Locked down all around for the homies touchin down
When my rags get out you walk a safe ground (walk a safe ground)
Cuz I'm a let them ride killah
You betta stay inside and keep yo shit on yo side nigga
Set trippin wit me
Because what I see is greenery, and thats all I see
As the day gets older, dont tweak, take a look over your shoulder

Young, dumb, full of fun
Dum diddy dum diddy you'll get done

Livin this life
I can't help but diss my dream
Maybe since West anthems I want to roll a beam
Clean, but only had to be a mex
Now hopefully that 850 lookin spiffy, will come next
I bounced to 120 and Figueroa
Yeah, my house posted across from the store
Just like that hit by the drive way and park in the back
1986 fools is known to jack
Around this click of the hood you found no punks
Many gang bangers, dope fiends and drunks
I learned, bunny hops, still rocks and cops
I ran out of boys with toys
And nights sees on hot days
Just apple sticks on death
RC cola to break a sweat
Now I bet that everybody's comin up
If you turnin the wrong street
Lie you bout to get stuck
Now what

Dum diddy dum diddy you'll get done

I ain't no muthaufuckin murdera (nigga) I'm a killah
Cuz murderers get life nigga and killaz keep killin
I'd ratha die with my eyes open
So I can see how these muthafuckaz wanna do me
They set me free bullet loco head with the beat what
And these niggas know they have to retreat when I speak
The younger dumb wanna have some fun
And drinkin liqour way before the age of 21
So how you figure that'll never put in work for that hood he love
You never paid him no attention so who should he love
And to keep a strap on him or a phat sack on him
And some bomb but be patrollin the hood
Ran a ho's name through the mud
And these crooked's stick a strap in your mouth, without a doubt
Thats the reason got lost and turned out
He shoulda keep patient
But you was still money chasin
A double life is what that young nigga facin

So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So spark up the doujer
'Cause I got the drink, and don't think that
We don't roll without a full tank
Of that bomb that we called the funk
'Cause I am the g and the funk is what you want

G-Funk is Here to Stay,Return of the Regulator,2001,"Definitely On The G Funk Vibe
This rap shit got my own cactuses
Like we never slept on the same mattresses
Young age football practices
Biscuit shine, Five of the ones on the waistline
I ain't worried about no platinum change
I'll give ya a 59 with a batman ass go range
(mumbled speech)
Ok, musta being the zodiac
V.I.P I really don't let this shit get to me
I just flip tracks, spit facts
Get relaxed, with G Funk laxed in the back
We stay in the ghetto, havin a tap with rugrats
Cats, and taps, with flaps
Foul language, old english it's dangerous
It stays the same and never changes
(Crumbling cries)
G Funk is here to stay
I pop a cap
Domino's and spades
With a bag of gange and smoke it all day
There's a staircase, its a true 21
Here's a toast to the thugs
High drop 4 sheezy, drinkin' ma bud
I still love n-a-t-e
Rollin from the sheezys
With a dress code like dubsy and a circle arse

We just tryin' make you see, nobody does it better
I'm sittin' here trippin', my mind is blocked
Nate Dogg just spit it so it's time to cock
No one can do it better like this 2 man crew
They say we're one hit it quitters, now what cha'll gonna do?
Always into somethin', that's my name
Only out for money, hey 'cause that's the game
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch
He who has the most is he who won the match
Strike one, me and Nate Dogg is a match
Strike two, leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three, you can call us 2-1-3
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G
My exhibition started back in '93
No one, nobody listenin' but Warren and me
To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see
Nobody does it better than me
They can come closer than close, yeah

So when we make it to show love, bangin' in your club
Hangin' with your thugs, givin' up G love
Do you remember back on the East Side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you think you really wanna step to me
Keep this is mind, nobody does it better than me
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah, yeah
We just tryin' make you see, nobody does it better
Wow, make you say go now
Hot rap singles on the charts now
Got a baby, so I'm breakin' hearts now
On your mark, get set, it starts now
All you pimp playin' hustlers, now you know
You can't keep me out once you crack the door
Either join a team or it's best you flee
Nobody does it better than me

If you wanna dip with me, trip with me, get rich with me

Another day on the grind, it ain't much to do
Fuck with some bitches, hit a couple switches

Had to get checked, niggas best respect
Everyday you see me on the paper chase

Throw your hands high, where all my G's at?
They all comin, to where Warren G's at
I keep my game tight, money and money and mo money
And ain't a damn thing funny
How could I live like that, I just can
And when it comes to this game, I'm just too far advanced
I'll leave you waiting, homey whats crackulating
Is it cracking or not?
In the back of the lot?
But this is all I got, I thought it was known
Warren G, Neb Luv, K-Bar and its on

If you wanna dip with me, trip with me, get rich with me
Then you a world wide rider (rider)

Ride with Nine Inch Nails last night and shit

Keepin it locked like my zip drive
We goin stay high
Out for the Motza, get you strung out like pasta
All into the roster lady, baby
I'll drive ya crazy, pull your car for the diamonds
I'm gettin shady, swayzie in the plush
Too quick to be touched, give you the head rush
To the front of the stage, like you bout to get paid
I'm lights, camera, watch you blow like grenades
I never serenade, I just party
Marinate, get your cash everybody
Come on and ride with me, dip with me
Get rich with me, sip some hennessey

Give me some portraits of some dead niggas
Take two shots of the best made nigga
These niggas, talkin too much, they flossin too much
Instead of makin they bucks, bank account runnin out of luck
Now you stuck, do deals fulfill your dreams make cream
Keep my pockets long like streams, no strings
Attached, attack any nigga plottin on my stack
Mo bounce to this, smoke an ounce to this
Make more gold than fish, one wish
Live on top of the world
And better livin for ghetto boys and girls
Peanuts is for the squirrels

Talkin bout thick wallets and livin lavishly
Mash on thee enemy

Can you do what we do when we sipping on the brew
Conjunction, junction what's my assumption
I'm sipping on the St. Ides Brew
That's my function
One for the money
Two for the Brew
It's the L.B. to the C. with the G-funk crew
Ooh
What would you do when we do
What we do when we sipping on the brew
Grab the deuce deuce or a forty-ounce
Dipping through the hood bumping more bounce
I see some P's on they knees
So I turn around on threes
Jumps my ride, checks my Dz
Dz on down to the spot where my knots made
'Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
Fade in the wind

And hoes jump on stage and rip they draws off
And I see through all that see-through
Make up and weave in ya hair these ignit

Sworing to the streets
Born in the Beach
Armed with the heat
Mourning my peeps
Makin' niggas respect mine, I came to collect mine
Comin' through with a Tech 9, lettin' my neck shine
I let a nigga slide with a pass but next time
I might disconnect his neck from his spine
Run up and catch 'em from behind and stretch 'em

Might as well bend over, and fingerbang theyself
Sell they soul for the faim and wealth

See I been chillin' like a villain
With a million and my children
Plottin' or revealin' what the game been conceilin'
I got a little older and learned a bit
A plot the effort and earned a grip

What’s Wrong,The G Files,2009.0,"Halla, listen
My cousin got 15, he was only 18
Cops hopping out like they the A-Team
Chilly in the projects, picturing that rock
Same old old head sitting on the block
I was wild as a ghetto child
Mean mugging out, used to had a kool-aid smile
Tuesday night, we came up to the ring with the heaters
Fight broke out they let it out on tweeters
So momma say, Halla, take care of your kids
And never do dirt and business where you live
Stress give niggers more reasons to get high
And hit the thing once and swear to god they could fly, bye
I'm off to the turf if they let me
He game bring the hood like the set going to accept me
It's all in the day of the life from where I'm from
I'm not a statistic, cause I made twenty-one

What's wrong, What's wrong
What's wrong, What's wrong
I think I need to ask somebody
I need to ask my uncle Marvin
What's wrong, What's wrong
What's wrong, What's wrong
I need to ask somebody

Let's speak for the hood, baby
Homies are out here crying
My granny telling me I need to go to church
The homies in the hood telling me to do dirt
It ain't shit changed, yo, we in the same game
It's hard to get a job when you live with cocaine
My brother is a gangster, my uncle is a banger
Living in the projects, looking out for danger
Crookedwith a hanger you can see it locking up
Yeah, the fierce on my ass they don't want to see me up
I hear the streets talking, we all need help
Keep some real niggers with you cause it's hard by yourself
I'm speaking for the hood, yeah, I'm straight off the block
Where it's hard to get sleep, you hear them gun shots
In the studio apartment, your baby's still starving
What the fuck is going on, ask uncle Marvin
The homies in the hood telling me to do dirt
But my granny telling me, you should go to church
(church)


We used to steal fifths, put on our big brother clothes
Slide up to king park and try to mack some hoes
Took one to knew us, yeah that was my home
When the sheriff killed my home boy, t-bone, Tyrone
Hanging with the D boys, chilling with the crooks
Killing the game with ? and Ronnie Brooks
We used to run shit up under that bridge
Smoking coochy and brig, that's how we lived
Me fruity baby pop, rowdy little kids
Things changed nowadays you're some rowdy little kids
Up about the park when we heard that lit (pop pop pop)
And the next thing you know, Louis lost his leg
Now we ducking the police and dodging the feds
Fuck hustling, I'd rather get a job instead
Fuck struggling, I can make money, doing these songs
Cause your closest home boy, would do you wrong",https://genius.com/Warren-g-whats-wrong-lyrics

Drinks Ain’t Free,The G Files,2009,"Been such a long time since I held you
All the while you used to talk to me
All the things you said made me so strong
You know what, I would say I would keep movin' on
Sometimes I sit back and think about how it was
When I was young, I used to think it was you I couldn't live without
Somehow, life took a sad route
Sometimes the wind blows bad enough to take a plane down
Your straight bullets killed children on playgrounds
Bullshit got me about to smoke a whole pound
Meanwhile, I smile, hoping I can rebound
Somehow the LBC streets ain't the same now, without you
Things ain't been the same since you ain't around
But I stay strong game tight, hold it down
Warren G, I never played a blackground
This song is fucked up, because you gone
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Nothing means more to me, than family
When one lost, it's sad to see, damn it's me
A friend you will always be
Above all things, you taught me to pursue my dreams
With joy it brings, at times when I sit and think
I know inside you smiled down, proud at me
I just need one more drink, damn
At night I can't sleep, I admit that its hard to eat
It's all good, I ain't trippin'
Tried to show me the right laws and guidelines
But I ain't listen, I'm sitting here lavishing and living
And I'd give it all back because you still missing
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
Lord please hear me, ease my soul
I woke up one day and my mom was gone
I'm in the zone wishing I could call your home
Sing your song, tell ya that I'm out on tour
All alone, I just needed to hear your voice on the phone
Mother and son, though I'm grown
Life moves on, I need you Mom, a quiet storm
Differences and right and wrong
As I move on, since Warren G ain't gone
The stitch is on, set the tone, the page I'm on
Is having fun, having a ball, living life
I'm still here, wishing you was home
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again
I still see you standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, over, over, over
Again, again, I miss you
Ohh Mama, don't know, Mama, don't know
How I keep it strong, keep moving on
Keep it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it, oh Mama, keepin', oh Mama
The things she told me
I promise I'll be the same to your grand children
What you worded me
Don't worry
I still feel you mama
The things you say
I feel your arms around me everyday

Whats happenin? I'm just chillin, you know
Checkin my game you dig, you know
Trippin off these fools around the situation, you know its like that

I went from hustlin and slangin to bustin and bangin
I got to keep it real, so fuck not cursin when I'm sangin
Now let me tell y'all about this shit, went down the other nite
Me and the doggs see some niggas, just caught up in tha hype
Tryin to ride and get by like tha FBI
Cause we know bout them hk's, they right outside
But we never knew y'all had a clue bout what we go through
So tell how the fuck could you speak on my crew

I went from dirt to large work like boatloads of keys
It's hard work and it hurts to live life on ya knees
So God please have a lil mercy on my soul
What my eyes see my mind think my hand should hold
The outcome of these actions warm hearts turn cold
Lil snake tryin to blast me wit the gun he stole
We hang out, banged out, same route as the day before
Blessed wit perception, but don't know how my days a go
Could see my nigga hittin wit some pay, a few days ago

Now we back in the mix with some more clips and paper though
I can't do nothing but enjoy myself
Gotta do it myself, got a gang of wealth
Its bloodclottin muthafuckaz seem like they want it all
But they can't, trying to fake on me and my doggs
If I fall I fail, gotta retrace my trail
Cross C's to clock G's I bell with bell
I keep the throw downs for mine
Warren G, Dogg Pound clockin the doves and come
Serve your whole fuckin hood with some bud and rhymes

Plus you niggas dont mash like mine, throw em 17 times
Money like a muthafucka, homey give me mines
Paid, I come stomping like a parade, the escapades
Psychoatic analysis, as I consume, always cartin the mushrooms
With clear sight, the daylight's like the night
A closet full of Franklins, a G's paradise
A nice 40 ounce a O.E. on ice
Precise poetic performing nice on mics

Well I flew from the East to the West
Word on the street, niggas wanna test
But these MC's, is scared to buck
Plus they talk too much and smoke too many blunts
You fuckin rookies
Sweet as Mr. Smith's cookies
Ya hate me one minute and tha next ya wanna buck me
He sent a ho, in the back seat of my fo'
While ya Goin Back To Cali, watch how you flow
Now ya know, about this Warren G Era
G-Funk terror, look into tha mirror
And what you see is the don of the company, that nigga
(Warren G, Warren, Warren, Warren's to tha G)
You still see, what I see
All of the homies in the LB
Sittin back, and we makin the cash
Warren G, Kurupt, Hershey, Daz and Badass
(Chorus) x2
And we never knew you had clue of what we go through
So how in tha fuck could y'all speak of our crew
Ya thought this, ya thought that, we thought y'all should laid back
Yeah it's like that,for me it's like that
Sittin back,and we makin the cash
It's Warren G, Kurupt, Hershey, Daz and Badass
Sittin back,and we makin the cash
It's Warren G, Kurupt, Hershey, Daz and Badass
Thats right
Ya know what I'm sayin Warren G
With my homeboys from the pound Daz Dillinger, Kurupt the Kingpin
And the homey Malik, ya know what I'm sayin and Mr. Badass
And thats how we doin it fool, yeah
We ain't bangin on wacks nigga, we doin it like we should be fool

Yo Sassy Ways (Feat. 213),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg)
We'll like to welcome y'all back to the club
I'm your host this evening, Mr. Tadah!
Ya dig, club Toe Jam, is once again off the hook
For ladies night, ya dig, everynight
Right now, we would like to bring something very special for you
Check it out

Oooooooooooooooh
I like them girls with the tight black skin, dark and fine
That's the kind of girl I wanna play with tonight
I wanna do some nasty thangs, wanna make her scream my name
I like the girls that don't say, ""what?,"" know that she fine
Always knows her line, because she knows she's a dime
Put her on platinum chains, got her own cash and things
I like them girls, their sassy ways, sassy ways
Oh I like them girls, man I could stay there for days
Ooooooooooooooooh

Why you so cute, why you so big
Why you bullshitin', come and deal with a pimp
Put your bags in the trunk, holla at your boy
You can spend the night, we at the Elroy
Doing things that we shouldn't, couldn't
Girl you got that good chocolate pudding
The best in hood, what's goodin'
She got the wizard of west wood, like old John Wooding
But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug
She was less than a duece, I'm telling the truth
Confessing with you, I'm just messing with you
Because on the real baby girl, you put in the S in Snoop

See I rock baby, nonstop baby
Warren G baby, shake that thang lady
I see you picky lady, you be tweaking l",https://genius.com/Warren-g-yo-sassy-ways-feat-213-lyrics
Something to bounce to,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Paroles de la chanson Something To Bounce To :
(feat. Soopafly)

Suckas be hatin when they know we makin cash
I don't give a fuck I'm still down and ready to smash
Haters be sayin Warren G fell off
How is that when I put the beach and Snoop on the map
The only way they comin to jack you
You better come right to save case and Glocks on site
Ain't know body I know checkin for you
I got gold platinum look at my wrist fool
It's a million and one ways to what people say
They gone say what they say but they fail to display
Where I went wrong, can't I do right
In the city I face snitches, with no britches
Quick to judge and hold a grudge
And all this time I showed them love

This is somthing fo you to bounce to
It's for the summer time I'm a hit switches for you
This is somthing for you to bounce to
This is somthing for you to bounce to
This is somthing for you to bounce to
This is somthing for you to bounce to

It's them niggas from the LBC
And we back with the stone cold mack
Cuz the summer time bout to crack
Bud and the bitches come free
It's so lovely dippin wit the Dub G G'd up blazin weed up
Rollin wit a shooby doo
A nine at least let alone die in peace on the eastside
These niggas really keepin' it G
If they don't then they wount, fuck a hater nigga I keep a heat
I am P Soopafly bond to go double plat
Fuck a rat I'm a show you where the trouble at
Step to close I let the duce go strut off wit two hoes
Look how the jucie flows
It's a party and the eyes on me
As I fall in with a small grin, talkin with the tall kain in my hand
I'm so cool, I swear I'm do that damn thang
So vicious with my champain bitches


G'd dub what's really crackin with you
I just signed with universal this game so persal
What's up with you and your boy Snoop
That's my dogg for life how you figure we ain't tight
What's up with 2-1-3
It's comin so start your tape that's runnin
They wanna know is you keepin it G'd
As big Lou Dogg from 21st street
It's amazin how time flys
Some time I sit back and wonder why
Most people don't keep it tight
And most G'z don't G it right
And me I always bounce it right
Make you wiggle that ass till you get it right
Baby what you perkin for
Mo' bounce to the ounce if you wan't some more",https://genius.com/Warren-g-something-to-bounce-to-lyrics
So Many Ways (Clean Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hey you gon miss up on the g-funk era
Ya know we said things won for warren g, and soon turned superstar
11-10-7 D that was my intro
And now I'm makin dough, I'm rollin a 64
Well things get shady when the grass is greener
Brothas throwin up sets in hoods like ya neva seen a
Young mac daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And it's a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the brothas you can't fade
So raise up on this young hog
'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me dogg
I got my own thang 'cause I let my beats swing
It ya wanna bring it bring it on no pain to gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em
I'm bein true ain't no fakin wit me
Brovas plottin on me trynna test if they can see
But I'm peepin out the sain for the peeps who gimme props
For stayin out that madness you know it ain't gon stop
In so many ways I let 'em know
In so many way I let it flow
But you still don't hear me though
So I'm gon break it down 'cause it's quite elementary
This is for da homies in da penetentary
Ab baby papa
Big rotch from the block
And the homey j dogg down 'cause you'ze a hoe
I got plenty love, and homey love stays
I can only bring it to ya like this, in so many ways
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em
I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you don't look good
So please rearrange and change the things you doin
You playin yourself 'cause you the one gettin screwed
As i, ease on down the rick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So spark up the doujer
'Cause I got the drink, and don't think that
We don't roll without a full tank
Of that bomb that we called the funk
'Cause I am the g and the funk is what you want
Now lets take a trip to the other side of town
Brothas flip flop and they neva stay down
Wanna be all they can be, but gettin held back
Tryin to take what is mine what type of lick is that
So this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag

Relax your mind, your mind, your mind
Relax your mind and let your conscious be freein you down
To the sounds of the warren g

But the lifestyle i chose, the status to which i rose
The doors, i open, i'm loccin, i'm scopin
Through the eyes of the g child
I see many try to duplicate the lbc style
But it ain't even happenin like that
I was time i had to make a comeback
And get mine, you know i'm genuine
Been in motion with the potion with snoop since 89
Devotion is the key for me so

Put yo gun down, so you can walk a safe ground

I know it's been hard on you for about two, so
I had to relax your mind, i thought you knew
