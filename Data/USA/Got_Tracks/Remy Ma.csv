ShETHER,UnKnown,2017.0,"Free Remy!
(Word)
You know what? Free Remy!
Fuck you, Free Remy!
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you dumb?
You wore a pink diamond chicken wing chain (Are you dumb?)
You had a leopard beehive on your head (Are you dumb?)
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you forgettin' that I pressed you before, bitch?
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)

(I) Fuck with your soul like shETHER
(Will) You ain't the queen, I'll show you
(Not) Lipo your ass and belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already
They told you your whole career
I'd come home and kill you, right? Ha-ha!

I told you I wasn't talkin' about your dumb-ass
It looks stupid, you literally got a dumb ass
Talkin' cray, and we all know that you dumb as
You get Donkey of the Day, yeah, you dumb ass
Let's be honest, you stole that line 'bout bitches bein' your sons
How you take my '09 jail tweet and run?
Talkin' about bringin' knives to a fight with guns
When the only shot you ever took was in your buns
And I saw Meek at All-Star, he told me your ass dropped
He couldn't fuck you for three months because your ass dropped
Now I don't think y'all understand how bad her ass got
The implants that she had put in her ass popped
I was like, ""Damn, 90 days and you couldn't have box?
Did she at least compensate? Start givin' you mad top?
Her name Minaj, right? She ain't throw you some bad thots?""
He said ""Nah,"" that's when I knew you was really a trash bop
You was screamin' ""Free Remy!"" when I was upstate doomed
But now that they freed Remy you don't sing the same tune
Locked me up, threw away my keys, threw away my weaves
Snatched me from my son, braids to the back, state greens
Daily News, ""Her career's over,"" ""She was kinda stupid,""
But you saw a opportunity 'cause you a opportunist
Left your Day 1 'cause you heard he was on some cheat shit
Then got with the dude that told you on some creep shit
But what happened to Omeeka? Nah, on some G shit
Left him and took a pic with the dude he had beef with?
And we all know it was a beef that you started
Pillow-talkin' out of your ass, this bitch retarded
Now you gotta die, you dearly departed
Bloodbath when I catch you, a real red carpet
Now what I'ma do, I'ma just stick to the facts
Bitch so scared of my future, got this bitch goin' backwards
Been through mad crews, you disloyal hoochie
Now all of a sudden you back with Drake and Tunechi?
After he said you sucked his dick, you back with Gucci?
Who next: Puff, Deb or Fendi? You a A-list groupie
And to be the Queen of Rap, you gotta actually rap
The whole industry know that your shit is a wrap
No, to be the Queen of Rap, you can't have a ghostwriter
And that's why this is my house; Flo Rida
Niggas done seen Drake pennin', Wayne pennin'
And since your first boyfriend left, bitch ain't winnin'
You a Internet troll, a Web browser, I'm sorry
You can't get a on line without Safaree
Mentionin' guns, you Pussy Galore, James Bond
Only time you touch a trigga is when you fucked Trey Songz
Coke head, you cheated on your man with Ebro
I might leak the footage of you sniffin' them ski slopes
They gassin' you up, but you been on E, though
""Pills and Potions,"" yep, you been on E, ho
Got your ghostwriters back, so you think you lit
Rem Belushi, I'm a Ghostbuster, bitch
I'm supposed to be scared
'Cause you bought your Barbie chain back?
I'll revert to ""Ante Up,"" you'll get your Barbie chain yapped
Tried to front in February, catch you in that Maybach
Show you how to use your name, you be usin' your name wack
I'm sayin', how you mix Nicki with a Minaj?
I'ma park this bitch, put Nicki in the garage
I'm gettin' money like Nicky Barnes, I'm the big homie
I responded in less than 48 Hours; Nick Nolte
Gettin' close like Nick Jonas, grippin' the gauge
Then blaze off, Face Off, bitch, Nicolas Cage
You animated like Nickelodeon, you fake, bitch
Only the kids believe in you; you St. Nick
Now when I shoot Nick at Nite, they won't understand it
I'm Wild'n Out, 'bout to hit Nick with the Cannon
How are you on the VMAs, actin' like you hood?
Way across the stage, talkin' about ""Miley, what's good?""
That's Hannah Montana, she was always happy
You only fronted on Mariah 'cause Mariah don't carry
Tried to disrespect Taylor 'cause Taylor wasn't Swift enough
Pillsbury Doughgirl; Remy pick the biscuit up
I'm jealous? Bitch, you was happy when they took me
Best thing that ever happened to you was when they booked me
You said you never fucked Wayne – how stupid I look, B?
Get the picture, I'll expose you, I'm kind of a bully
You named yourself Nicki Lewinsky, the mind of a rookie
'Cause you was suckin' his dick and now he tired of your nookie
You claimed you never fucked Drake
Now that's where you took me
You fucked the whole Empire – who you tryin' to be, Cookie?
Boogie Down Bronx, I come out of the Boogie
To let you know real bitches never lie on their pussy
And stop talkin' numbers, you signed a 360 deal
Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic
Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it
Any videos, promotions come out of your budget
Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it
You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat
I own my masters, bitch, independent
So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten
Stop comparin' yourself to Jay, you not like him
You a motherfuckin' worker, not a boss like Rem
You're done, them pop chicks ain't get the news yet
Bitch, I pop chicks, yeah, and I'm the new vet
I kill rappers, and you good as dead, bitch
Talkin' shit about me to a deaf bitch
And usually I have sympathy for the impaired
But not when you hard of hearin' from untreated gonorrhea
But you point your fingers at me? I’m the bad girl
When she the one out here misleadin' the black girls?
All these fake-asses influenced by that girl
Dyin' from botched surgeries – what a sad world!
But before the butt job, you was a Spongebob
Suckin' cock for records, captain of the cum squad
And I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz
Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj
You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul
How you spendin' money to support a pedophile?
He a walkin' dead man, sendin' threats to him
I guess that’s why they call you Barbie, you was next to Ken
Talkin’ about your money long and your foreign sick
Why you ain’t help your bro hide his cum from forensics?
You probably somewhere overseas, foreign sick
Thought you could fuck with me, by far Rem sick
Meek, Drake, Safaree, I see men in your pants
We call that Jelani, get it? Semen in your pants
Uh, I got trigger fingers, you got bitter fingers
Yeah, you must think you Drake and I'm Twitter fingers
VH1, watch this
You just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch

Don't ever in your fuckin' life play with me
That's on the set!
You tried it on the Rae Sremmurd record
You tried it on your little freestyle
They was both duds, just like every other one was duds
Just like this last one was a dud
But what you not gonna do is keep subbin' me
Big… Pun!
I send a fuckin' headshot, you dead, bitch!
Will not lose!",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-shether-lyrics

Remy, not another one
Why?
Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again
Rem!

I guess you know now who the head bitch is
I'm a savage, I be killin' dead bitches
I bet you wish that you ain't never said shit
Now they so busy shootin' videos and I'm like nah
Where the fuck is your song? I mean, come on
You know the pub want some bars, I'm Remy Ma-
-Rgarito, I ain't sparrin' with you bozos
My raps too hard and you Miguel Cotto, uh
I swear to God, this chick a real fraud
Bet you wonderin' how I know your problems?
It's a lot of people that you really bothered
They was sellin' footage and you know I bought it
This ain't a little L, wait, wait
You took a Big L, you diggin' in the crates, yeah
I put you on the bench, you really press
She was absent, an automatic F
Waited four days, ma,  where you been?
I came here in the 'Rari playin' Lil' Kim
Don't know what made you think that you could fuck with Rem
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make ya spit

Already took a L, now you got another one
I secure the bag, now I got another one
I caught the W, now I got another one
Yo, what's that shit you be sayin', Khaled?
(Another one)
Already took a L, now you got another one

Heard you callin' everyone
Now call 'em back, 'cause I got another one
Heard you was kiddin', sayin' I ain't havin' none
But that's okay baby, 'cause now you my son
They like, ""Yo, Rem go in again""
My flow cold, her ink froze in the pen
You gotta go, you gotta go, lil hoe
I kick a dead horse till it don't move
Don't come around me, now I got the crown, see
I beat you with punches in 48, you Ronda Rousey
The wigs and nose, you a whole clown, B
I better not ever hear you say anything about me
I came from behind bars like a bottle girl
No candy bars, I raise the bar, I'm like a bodybuild
All blue Maserati, sawed-off lil shottie
Put blood in your head, leave your whole damn head red, Lil Yachty
Oh, and if you doubt that, you can catch me outside, bitch, how bout that?
When it's dark and hell is hot, I'll DM your ex
Sittin' here now like, ""Who I'ma DM next?""
I handle these bars like a BMX, Grrr
Get at me dog, DMX
And I'm waitin' for a bitch to talk outta her neck
'Cause we got pictures, we got videos, and we got texts

Already took a L, now you got another one
I secure the bag, now I got another one
I caught the W, now I got another one
Yo, what's that shit you be sayin', Khaled?

Conceited,There’s Something about Remy: Based on a True Story,2006.0,"See this ain't nothin that you used to
Out of the ordinary and unusual
You gotta have the mind state like I'm so great
And can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal
And ain't nobody in here stoppin' you
Show no love, cause you's wassup
Look in the mirror, like what the fuck
Damn, I look good
And can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah, okay, I got a little fat butt
My shorty tell me he like it like that
I'm happy, another me there never can be
See, I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin on top of the world like Brandy

See I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearin' this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See I look too good to be drivin' that
And I look too good to be buyin' that
You know I look way too good to be tryin' that
I'm conceited, I got a reason

Now who's that peekin' in my window
Nobody cause I live in a penthouse
Baby I'm sorry, but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waitin' on
He said he love when my jeans look painted on
With this tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always gettin' hitted on
Now shorty tryin' to 
push up on me like a wonder bra
Listen when I speak, I wouldn't want you to take it wrong
Now, number one, I don't need you
Your name's Q, I only see ""u"" when I see you
Listen, two, you could never play me (why's that)
Cuz I'm such a fuckin' lady
Three, it's all about me
I don't wanna talk about it
If you'd like to hear it, here it go
I wrote a song about it

See I look too good to be fuckin' you
And I look too good to be lovin' you
You know I look way too good to be stuck with you
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See I look too good to be gettin whipped
And I look too good to be havin' kids
You know I look way too good to be in a crib
I'm conceited, I got a reason

Oh, I know what I'm doin'
I can't stop my body from movin'
I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music
He keeps watchin' me and he's about to lose it
I'm droppin' it hotter then the ?????
""Face Down, Ass Up,"" on some Luke
 shit
I'm outta control wit it, dip it low, pick it up slow
Poke it out, now roll wit it
My thong showin', but it's cool, my shoes go wit' it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See I look good and I'm knowin' it
And I was never too proud to be showin' it",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-conceited-lyrics

Always,I’m Around,2014,"One look in your eyes and there I see just what you mean to me
Realize that being single ain’t all what it seem to be
Been around the while and I see the scenery
But when I go to bed at night is you that I want sleep with me
Here in my heart I truly not for nothing do believe
I don’t need shelter, don’t need water, don’t need food to eat
I don’t need clothes, I don’t need sleep, I don’t need air to breathe
For me to live your love’s the only thing I ever need

And you ain’t never sleeping around right? (Right)
You never treat me like a clown right? (Right)
You ain’t never try to play me
You my daddy I’m your baby
I’m your queen I got the crown right? (Right)
But you gonna always be around right? (Right)
You gonna always help me down right? (Right)
You gonna always really love me
You won’t put no one above me
I’m your queen I got the crown right? (Right)

I look in your eyes there I see what happiness really means
The love we share together makes us sweet as jellybeans
Together forever yes 24 is you and me
Just call us after A ‘cause we will always be
This our love feels so right I know that it can’t be wrong
This how I feel inside nah this just ain’t a song
If they say infinity, I say that it is
They say they couldn’t be alright because we are still going strong

:
When I look in your eyes there I see all that love should really be
There’s no facade with us, you’re really you I’m really me
I need you more and more each day your going’s a vacancy
There’s nothing on this planet that can take you away from me
You’re forever mine, and I’m forever yours
They should have never said never we gonna weather the storm
We’re like that raven in that poem, we forever more
Our love got different meanings, we a metaphor",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-always-lyrics

Feels So Good,There’s Something about Remy: Based on a True Story,2006,"We up in this room (yea)
And I'm puttin it down on you (mmm)
Now your pushin back at me
And I don't want to let you leave
But baby girl you feel (so good)
Little mama that thing is (so good)
Girl the way that you movin (so good)
I wanna do it again do it again (so good)

Stop actin crazy I'mma keep it real
See I just need some one that gives me something I could feel
Have a little small talk and a night on the town
It could all be yours if you go another round
Dont wanna lose you in it cause the groove is in it
But it really don't matter long as you be in it
Boo what's gotten in to you? - I told you I got a interview
But you wanna get intimate - why you tryna get in to it?

Baby I know you got moves to make
But you ain't leavin' 'til I get another taste
I ain't ashamed to say you got a nigga open babe
And I'mma need some more before you get away (ooooh)


Yea you pushin' further and I'm seeing that you lovin it
I'm pushin back and got you callin out my government
Like reminisce - I'm really feelin this
And I don't like to kiss, but I really like ya lips
See I'm tryna hold it but I can't control it
My mind is tellin me stop but my body it keeps goin
You want me to stay and I wish I could
Another day but tell me why I should
 + 

So good you can't even keep your hands off
So good you feel you need to go and put ya mans on
You got ya blackberry off and your phone vibratin
And all you wanna know is why my legs keep shakin
See we both grown and I know when the feel is right
And wat you sayin is makin me wanna spend the night

Dying To Be Me,I’m Around,2014,"I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest
Is there a doctor in the house for the bitches I make sick
I gotta keep a condom cause they stay on my dick
Can I get a moment of silence please?
Rest in peace to the bitches that's dying to be me
Dying to be me, dying to be me

Hair done, brows waxed
Lashes laced, lips MAC'd
Nails nice, toes match
My clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, shoes from Saks
Now the bag is dope, the jewels is crack
And I pulled up in the what-the-fuck-is-that?
And this pretty face really don't help
It's practically masturbation the way I'm feelin' myself
And I'm not alone, nah, the dudes be on me
I mean when I'm regular in my Abercrombies
Tank top, flip flops, no makeup, hardly
They still can tell I got a body-ody
I don't need no friends, I'm a one-bitch army
They say I'm a ton of fun, like a walkin' party
This is my prerogative like my name was Bobby
Dial 646 that bitch, you wanna call me

I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest
Is there a doctor in the house for the bitches I make sick
I gotta keep a condom cause they stay on my dick
Can I get a moment of silence please?
Rest in peace to the bitches that's dying to be me
Dying to be me, dying to be me

I'm pretty, attitude shitty
Do I think about  care these hoes? Not really
I mean really, I kinda understand
No one likes the bitch that's fuckin' their man
But damn I got swag and he's into fashion
He said I be killin 'em, fatal attraction
I'm a 1 + 9, call me MAC 10
You a 5, I'ma call you Jackson
They say I talk mad shit, that's a fact
But ain't none of these bum bitches smack me yet
I be so lit, cute as ever
I go all the places you could never
My bag say GG or CC
Some say MJ or CD
A few got MK or LV
Your bag say H&M or AMP

I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest
Is there a doctor in the house for the bitches I make sick
I gotta keep a condom cause they stay on my dick
Can I get a moment of silence please?
Rest in peace to the bitches that's dying to be me
Dying to be me, dying to be me

I'm sittin' in the drop that look like cotton candy
That's probably why they say they can't stand me
Their man be all in me every time we fuck
That's probably why they say they hate my guts
My buzz is so crazy and they can't take it
That's probably why they say I'm aggravatin'
I'm killin' y'all broke bitches and all y'all hasbeens
Put my condolences and flowers on your caskets

I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest

When I See Her,Blasremy,2008.0,"January to December 12 months of the year
60 seconds in a minute it's a problem when I see her
7 days a week, alternate sides of the street
I'm a drag that bitch like the mothafuckin' beat
That's word to me I'ma smack her when I see her
You the type to be like ""I'ma ask her when I see her""
And still be scared to death, you walk past her when you see her
See I treat her like a check and straight cash her when I see her
I'm a leave her when I see her, casadia when I see her
""It's me bitches"" yea Swiss beater when I see her
See it's on when I see her, she a goner when I see her
Word is bond I'm on her, I'm a stomp her when I see her
I'm a put hands on her, I'm a snatch her when I see her
Like my lil' cousin Pat say trash her when I see her
These broads is garbage I be laughing when I see her
They be copping pleas like ""Rem what happened? "" when I see her
I don't question her when I see her, I address her when I see her
Wash her up and permanently press her when I see her
Apply pressure when I see her, disrespect her when I see her
This is chess but I'm a chin check her when I see her
I don't give a fuck yup! I'm a duff her when I see her
I swear to my mother I'm a snuff her when I see her
It's nothing when I see her, no it's something when I see her
That bitch best bets to start running when I see her
I dare her to talk back and start frontin when I see her
I just might snap and start gunnin when I see her
Now I'm a step to her like a grown woman when I see her
Naw, I'm lying ya'll already know I'm dumbing when I see her
Yeah I'm coming when I see her
See it's over when I see her
So don't act like I ain't never told ya'll when I see her
I'ma Ether her like Nas did Hova when I see her
And then come back like HOV, and take over when I see her
Ya'll could call me Diddy cause I ain't stopping when I see her
I ain't Lil Mama, but my lip gloss poppin' when I see her
She ain't rocking when I see her, cause I'm rollin' when I see her
I'm a have her whole fucking face swollen when I see her

Put your hands up in the air if you feel me
Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night
Treat niggas like hoes

And I'm hotter then hoes that work at the Days Inn
People tryin' to make shit to make niggas bop
I make shit they play then niggas get shot
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Right hand got a blunt, left hand got a cup
And you already know the rules don't apply to us
We gon' do what we do, it's 'Whuteva' 2 fuck
We got that fly shit here we go
Drivin' backwards down a one way like Big in the ""Hypnotize"" video

Black Love,I’m Around,2014,"With every passing moment

I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

Remy Ma & Papoose Freestyle on Flex | Freestyle #027,Funk Flex Freestyles,2016.0,"Y'all had to listen to garbage I know y'all glad remy back
Getting that paper, that bag
You're not bad you're doing bad
Mad cause I'm not mad
Can't take you serious, period
You live in your moms pad
Heard you was at the freestyle and you was way scared
Bitch I'm so secure I wrote this on the way here
Been killing kids while they nap, since daycare
I got this sewed up and on track like fake hair
When niggas ask me to spit, they know what I'm bout to do
When they ask you to spit, they wanna see what that mouth do
When I talk greasy trust it ain't about you
I don't shade, I say names you don't want me to shout you
Every bar is a bar, bitch what you know bout that
They calling me bars bitch or kit kat
You get that
You broads never go hard on a rap
Okay, maybe once or twice but you ain't all of that
See your whole style, bitten
Pieces ain't hitting
When I said it was written, I was talking bout y'all bitches
Y'all trying to play chess, but why would I play you
When I could knock the whole fucking board off the table
See I been the difference I don't do the shit they do
When I'm around they quiet, I'm loud you bitches k2
Im straight remy no chase boo
And y'all a bunch of old birds, y'all just grey goose
I'm probably the only chick that make flex drop bombs
Got more punchlines than thirsty niggas at prom
I ain't gotta fraud for you, black love be how I live
Before I made it cool you was HOP positive
I put you on punishment, now I gotta beat yo ass
You like a disobedient teenager, you wanna be in the streets so bad
All this talk about my and your son
I'm hot and your whole world revolve around me, bitch I am the sun
Wanted to be an icon, ended up like Akon
They finally let me out now I'm an XCON
Everybody ratting, I really need some d con
Told flex put the beat on, so I can go pecan
I showed hoes the way, I'm the light, I'm the beacon
Looking for that real bitch, I'm the one that y'all seek on
I'm on paper I'm over here blowing dank, y'all bitches really haters over there shooting blanks
But who knows, you might really hit something one day
But right now, your shit is weaker than Monday through Sunday
I'll take your wig off, no literally take your wig off
It's funny when she's talking tough, cause we know the bitch soft
And if she soft you sophomore
That's why I school freshmans and juniors, but let me tell y'all what for
Cause at 3 us, 2 can shoot the one
I'm 195 ten you little bitches is done
I got that face on pretty, attitude on savage
NEW York city I'm in the center like javage
Now this the part where I talk shit, I know y'all hate that
This part not about bars, it's just all straight facts
In 2 years, no album, no solo single, no tour
3 million followers and got 2 BET awards
Got the album of the summer, independent and the shit popped
Legitimized an entire franchise of love and hip hop
Ratings be Monday night, football to be toward thrice
Had Hov on my remix, deadass I am nice
Appointed black love, I made it cool to be cuffing
I body every beat I touch and then I married my husband
Brought NEW York rap back, rapping how I really rap
Bodied summer jam twice, what you know about that
Two soul train awards, yeah female rap changing it
And yesterday I woke up to two Grammy nominations, FACTS",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-remy-ma-and-papoose-freestyle-on-flex-freestyle-027-lyrics

And every hood chick wannabe like Remy
They say I walk and I talk like New York City
Ok, motherfucker so what's really?
These bitches ain't doing nothing, I gets busy
Cheap deck a ho can get smacked silly
But on the contrary , I packs the mack Milli
And believe when my gun pop, it's gone be a head shot
They locked me up, yeah they gave Rem a pen

Could it be you're fallin' in love

Could it be, it can't be, hun I'm callin' ya bluff

Have the Spanish mommies illin' cause I'm sittin' in front
And niggas on the block sick like ""Whatchu doin' wit' that spic?""
Y'all don't know Puetro Ricans and Blacks make the cutest kids?
Ya hair, my eyes, ya nose, and my lips
If it's a boy, hope that God bless him with his daddy's dick
Shit, to tell the truth, with you I know I'm safe
'Cause if another nigga frontin' he'll get blown in his face
And I like that
You give me love and I give it right back
But when you flip don't you think I ain't gon' fight back
Hun, you got dough, but you know I got a nice stack
So when you mad, go ahead take ya ice back
I just throw on some lipstick and The Stylistics ""Break Up to Make Up""
And you know I hook a steak up
Take you breakfast in bed, nigga, soon as you wake up
Get my jewels back and take another trip to see Jacob
Lovin' the way I do this for you
And every kiss that I blew, Papi Chu', was a kiss for you
Stayed true, faithful, and you can never say I played you
Cuz you ma boo and I can never say I hate you

Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug right now?
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's lifestyle?
Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now?

I swept you off ya feet, you was just walkin', crossin' the street
Said ""Was you talkin' to me or was it my boys in my jeep?""
She said ""Either or"", said she loved the way I play ball
Go after the bigger niggas even though they was twice as tall
Shootin' dice in the hall inside of my doorway checkin' my drawers
Up North style right next to ma balls
Just the little things would impress her a lot
Like when I let her sit in my Lex' tryna guess where where the stash is
God blessed her with ass, she had the perfect mix
She thought ""morena"" was an Indian Twist
She had the cinnamon lips, match of rimmy and crisp
Thought she was Dominican the way she was swinging them hips
I never had a clue that she wanna ride for me
But like Donell, shorty had eyes for me
It's a quarter past one, but that's another song, what was wrong?
Why you took so long to put a brotha on?
It wasn't long before we start Bumpin' and Grindin'
Crushin her spine and had her soundin' like Busta was rhyming
Bustin' her hymen, the slightest touch when I bust had her cryin'
Her bus went by and she was already up in there rydin'
Cussin' and wildin', talkin' dirty in the back of the Porsche
Whose pussy is this?
(Come on daddy, it's yours)

Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug right now?
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's lifestyle?
Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now?",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-thug-love-lyrics

Got my own money but I still get his
Got sidechick pussy with wife privileges
I post on the Gram and she be sick
But I don’t want your man, I just need dick
Maybe a bag or two, fuck the bullshit
Perhaps a lil sloppy toppy with his full lips
Mommy’s home, now they all dubs
It’s on sight, stay away from all clubs
Said Mommy’s home, now they all dubs
It’s on sight, you should stay away from all clubs
I’m a real bitch and they all fake, the hood feel me
They fuck with Remy, yeah the long way

Who's really the best female if Rem ain't there?
If theres a answer to that its cuz Rem ain't there

You ain't do a bid, you was out on bail and
You wasn't in prison bitch you was in jail
Big difference word to my innocence
Most of these so called killers ain't never get fingerprints
Ain't glorifying crime I love my freedom
I ain't a gynecologist but I know pussies when I see em

All I really wanna see is blood on the concrete
Bodies in bags and flowers on caskets
Corpses swarmin' wit flies and maggots
Innocent girls and boys turn into bastards

And niggas fucked in they ass, turned into faggots
They balls cut off and mailed to they parents

We ran trizz on his lips and made him dress up
And I got it on tape, we straight fuckin' raped him
Don't get it confused see I hate male groupies
Pero he's willin' then I'm ready to take the opportunity
My bitches is the illest so really we don't gotta care

 Mmmmmm Mmmmmm Heeeeeeyyyyyy
Why Didn't I See The Signs I Was To Busy Getting High
Runnin Up The Studio Smoking Dro Writing Rhymes
To Blind To Notice My Abdomen Was Growin
Having Sex Wit Out Protection Now My Belly Is Showin
Nobody Know That Me And My Boo Trying To Decide
What To Do He Buggin Like That's A Little Me Inside Of You
It Ain't True And I'm Scared And I Can Tell He Is Worried A Bit
So We Proceed To Get The Weed And Straight Ignoring The Shit
My Jeans Don't Want To Fit Every Morning Hurling And Shit
I Had To Tell My Family I Knew They All Was Goin To Flip
And His Was Happy Thinking He Was About To Be A Daddy
But I Knew It Wasn't True Even Though We Both Wanted It So Badly

Tell Me What's Goin I Know What I'm Doing Is Wrong
Can You Hear Me Lord When I'm Callin For Give Me My Baby
How Am I Supposed Feel The Situation Is Real
Neva Wanted To Let Cha Baby Go We'll Meet Again I Know Baby

We Love Each Other Madly So Much To Gain So Much To Lose
I'm In Pain Your Mind Frame Change When You The One That Gotta
Choose Talk A Walk Step In My Shoes Think In Negative Thoughts
Politics And Shit Quit When The Doctor Says Positive It's A Life Living
In My Body But It Don't Gotta To Live It's Up To Me But If I Keep What
The Fuck I Got To Give I Mean I'm Still Young And I Don't Really Have
Shit And If This Nigga Up And Leave Then My Child A Be A Bastard
This Is Drastic Nobody Really Understands Me And My Mom Don't
Give A Fuck And Neither Does The Rest Of The Family They Like
Remy You Can't Afford It You Expect Us To Support It
I Feel My Seeds Apart Of Me And I Don't Want To Abort It So:

Tell Me What's Goin I Know What I'm Doing Is Wrong
Can You Hear Me Lord When I'm Calling For Give Me My Baby
How Am I Supposed Feel The Situation Is Real
Neva Wanted To Let Cha Baby Go We'll Meet Again I Know Baby

I'm Not Steady But I Can Get Ready For Responsibilities Shit Where
Would I Be If My Moms Got Rid Of Me I'm So Stressed And I'm
Under A Lot Of Pressure But All I Need Is The Remedy To Make Remy
Feel Better I Knew I Couldn't Win So I Chose To Forfeit Its A Shame
I'm Over Four Months And I'm In The Doctors Office I Swear To All That
I Love That I Wanted To Leave And Wait Five More Months And Birth The Child
That I Conceived But I Sat There Because I Felt I Had To And I Cry Everyday
Because I Realize Boy Or Girl That I Wanted To Have You Don't Be Made At Me
How It Is Is How It Had To Be And Any Pain I Put You Through Is All Coming
Back To Me

Tell Me What's Goin I Know What I'm Doing Is Wrong

Like you you and you with the Timbs hi nice to meet you my name is Rem
I don't drive a caddy but I'm stuntin like a pimp struct
With a diddy bop looking something like a limp
I cleaned up my money now I'm filthy fucking rich (shit)


See I'm from where niggas stash packs in the backs of their ball sack and pump crack, yak, D, weed and that
Put more baking soda in there coke to get more back
Roc Timberlands uptowns White Tees and sports hats
We kill all rats tell lies cheat and steal
Tints pitch black even gotta em on the windsheild
Liscense suspended Vehicles rented
Warrants open cases several offenses
No phone no cable notices of eviction
Parents is addicted kids don't listen
No rules no school no food in the kitchen and the staircase and elevator smell like piss
You can only talk tough if you do tough things
If you ain't from around here you better tuck them blings
Only difference between me and you is that I got out the hood but the hood is still in me",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-im-lyrics
White Benz,I’m Around,2014,"(Remy Talking)
Nah, Ion want that
Nah I want a purp..
What? Naw, not a Beamer
I did that already, red is crazy
I want the white,  want a white, I want a white
Blue? Nah
That's just not right...

I want a white, droptop two door Benz
With a custom interior, 22 inch rims
I want auto parking, auto brakes
I want an automatic starter with a jet off take
I want satellite radio, internet, phone
Know I gotta talk to my nigga when I'm on the road
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want

Rem really rappin', these broads just yappin'
I press a chick quick like ""bitch what happened?""
I'll never see these hoes in the trap
And if you think I'm throwin' in subliminals, bitch catch
Got a gun charge cause I'm a lil' ratchet
And all you hoes dyin' to be me get a casket
Bandana in your back pocket just fashion
When I do it, I'm reppin' my gang, I'm flaggin'
BP, Exxon, Shell, who gassed 'em?
Bitches scared to breathe in my presence, they're gaspin'
They can't eat when I'm around, stomach's touchin' backs and
I'ma call it Remadan, yeah they fastin'
Y'all done signal lights just for flashin'
Ms. Martin in the Aston, yeah ask 'em
I'm laughin', and I don't want burgundy
Brown, blue or black, bitch


I ain't even gotta try hard, these hoes diarrhea
Their shit watery, get the fuck out of here
Niggas like ""Rem, please, you gotta drop quick""
I'm like, ""Easy, hoes can't even fuck with my old shit""
I'm talkin' rhymes that I spit six years ago
They still listenin', nah but y'all don't hear me though
These chicks comedy, yeah they Mike Epps
I'm a fucking horror movie and they're scared to death
Not for nothin', bitches frontin', they don't want me to come back
The fans is kinda smart and they can see that you dumb wack
My swag, tried to jack it, but couldn't quite catch it
Your flow is mediocre, your whole style plastic
This ain't just rap, bitch, I don't give a fuck
See it could go down, mothafucka what's up?
What's good, what's hood, what's really, what's Gucci?
What's Farragamo, what's Prada, what's Pucci?",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-white-benz-lyrics

(Chrous)

Fuck Rem look like twerkin'?
Fuck twerkin' she put that work in

And her mase in her Birkin
They try to close her curtains
But shawty, cuz she ain't hurting
Rem free as a bird
But yall still out here chirping
After six  and a half years
She sorta like a virgin
She operate that dick
She sorta like a surgeon
The girl cold
Her 36's is Perking
Rem so fresh and clean
She dont need detergent
She don't need no Urban, she don't need no Burban
Her sex drive is crazy, no red light she swervin
She speaking in 3rd person
Charge his card for what she purchase
But he don't care bout prices
Like Revlon cuz she worth it

Secret Location,There’s Something about Remy: Based on a True Story,2006.0,"See most niggas call they girl when they wanna give a dick
My shawtys call me when they wanna get a brick
Cause even when I'm not spitting I'm still that bitch
In the the kitchen with that  Pyrex Vision
And the way I chef up make you hang your connect up see
I guarantee to bring back extra
Take a buck thirty of white Make 200 hard and its butter
Plus 70 grand for Remy Ma
Oh god now that's a profit see I'm like a prophet
And see I'm a have all of my followers run through ya projects And smack the shit out of anybody
That's not on my dick
See they planned and plotted
But what they forgot is I'm a lunatic
A crazy ass bitch with not enough sense
But too much dollas
I pop the top right off of your fucking collar...
Young Rem, easy you know who I be nigga holla

I just copped a lil crib in the secret location
Laced it
Put a strip pole in the basement
Never keep the guns the same place where the safe is
Neva keep the funds the same place where the base is
Now that's word to grandma I'll cock the hammer
On the block and blow ya face off in front of the camera
And plug that hole with ya little bandana
And I still got my jewels like my name is Santana
Look lil homie yall really don't know me
Looking for the squad but see I'm by my lonely bitches
Gon pay like yall motherfuckers owe me like puff n mase
Can't nobody hold me down from the boogy Bronx style with my hoodie
Got pounds of the brown right on the boulevard
Getting so down in that motherfucking tittie bar
Like fuck these bitches I'm tryna get pissy
And I'm not gay so fuck ya body-ody
Look around it's a sausage party
When I pull up in the pink Benz
With the powder pink Tims on 22 inches half black chink
Friends hop out with the pink tims
Laced with the mink trim platnium with the pink Jims
What yall gon think then? Bet you gon love Rem
Yall wanna fuck Rem
But yall was saying fuck Rem
So now yall just fucked up

I ain't too hard
These broads is just too easy
That's why everytime I rhyme I be doing 'em greasy
Please believe me I'm hot no matter the season I spit
So sick the track be sneezing hook be coughing
Got the whole studio freezing if you hit me and I hit you
We still ain't even cause I'm not leaving 'til you stop
Breathing ain't nothing worst than getting popped for no reason
I wanna see shot laid out just leaking ya words
Can't come out cause ya mouth keep bleeding ya
Tanktop burgundy white tee burgundy
I know yall bitches wishing that them niggas would've murdered me
Remy Ma
You know me if not you heard of me
The reason you gon have to invest in plastic surgery
I'm good with a hood n some tims
Fuck burglary
My weed is on the island and my guns is out in Germany",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-secret-location-lyrics

Out of the ordinary, unusual
You gotta have the mind state like ""I'm so great""
Can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal
And ain't nobody in here stoppin' you
Show no love 'cause you wassup
Look at yaself in the mirror like what the fuck
Damn, I look good
And can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah, OK, I got a little fat, but
My shorty told me that he like it like that
I'm happy
Another me there never can be
See, I'm so outstandin'
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like Brandy
See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited. I got a reason
See, I look way too good to be driving that
And I look too good to be buying that
You know I look way too good to be trying that
I'm conceited. I got a reason
Now who's that peaking in my window?
Nobody 'cause I live in a penthouse
Baby, I'm sorry, but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waitin' on
He said he love when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty trynna push up on me like a Wonderbra
Listen, when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one, I don't need you
Ya name's Q, I only see you when I see you
Listen two, you can never play me
(Why is that? Why is that?)
'Cause I'm such a fuckin' lady
Three, it's all about me and I don't wanna talk about it
If you love to hear it, here it go
I wrote a song about it
See, I look too good to be fucking you
And I look too good to be loving you
You know I look way too good to stuck with you
I'm conceited. I got a reason
See, I look too good to be gettin' with
And I look too good to be havin' kids
You know I look way too good to be in the crib
I'm conceited. I got a reason
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know what I'm doing
I can't stop, my body gone moving
I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music
He's watching me and he's about to lose it
I'm droppin' that hotta den drop it like its hot
Face down, ass up wit some new shit
I'm outta control wit it
Dip it low, pick it up slow, poke it out, now roll wit it
My thong showin', but it's cool, my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See, I look good and I'm knowin it
But I was never to proud to be showin it
See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent

Straight promo whore
Dildo in ya butt that should be your logo slore
I send you prostitute bitches on a porno tour
I had few exclusive spots but they ain't low no more
I heard you stopped by now I don't go no more
I send  40Cal shots through your Volvo door
Yo I rock more Chanel than that Coco girl
You coppin knock offs acting like its really a Gucci
I hops out the Porsche in Emilio Pucci
And walk up in the corner store and get me a loosie
And I dont even smoke just to shit on you groupies
And get a brown paper bag so I can sit on the stoop see
It dont more hood than your girl Rem truthfully
Like Keyshia and New Jack City the movie
Rock a bye baby you niggas is Pookie
And I got that crack
I dont know nothing about slow money
Grey base, pure white
Call me a snow bunny
You never fired a gun I keeps it so gully
My gun fire like Mike Saunders for  Payola Money
I'm conceited Rem could never be ugly
I take a Chinese chick ass before a face like Buffie's
The rumors is crazy, I must really be that bitch
How can I have time to pipe Pap and yall on his dick?
Picture me robbed by a washed up video chick
And how I'm arguing with Foxy and she can't hear shit?
Matter fact dont even ask me nothing bout nobody
With a clit, a pussy, a ass, or some tits
I ain't gay I can only tell you bout dick
And thats word to the saliva in my mouth I spit
That shit like none other
Fuck ya baby mother
We piped in the crib
I wipe my pussy with the baby covers
Yeah I'm crazy I know bitches hate me

I took my hand and put the gun in my pants
I took my pants and pulled 'em up on my ass
Got the cash out my pocket, dropped it and got my ass out of Dodge
And put it into the car, started it
Stepped on the gas, looked at the dash
95 really don't seem fast when you so fuckin mad
And you so fuckin high and you can't stop cryin
Oh shit, I just ran a stop sign, fuck it
It's nothing, this nigga got me stressin
I can't believe he got me buggin now I'm drivin wreckless
I can't even see and my highbeams ain't really helpin
But nobody really be usin the streets before 7
Got the pedal to the metal like I, lost my mind
And I ain't even see the school crossin sign
Car and the bastards yeah, wind blowin in my hair
Seatbelt light's blinkin but, I don't care
Somebody was crossin the street, came out of nowhere
Ran right into him, body flew in the air
Oh my God, my face already covered with tears
Sayin my prayers, I ain't even seen her I swear
I stop out of reflex, saw blood everywhere
Mostly 'round the head of the little girl holdin the teddy bear
I'm sorry, all I can hear is I want my mommy (mommy!)
And then I ain't hear nothin from the little girl's body
I'm scared but I can't stop, what I'm gon' do
The first thing the cop's gon' say is it was drug influenced
They ain't gon' understand what this nigga was doin
How he made me drive fast when I shoulda been cruisin
And they probably won't believe that it wasn't the weed
And shorty just popped up, in the middle of the street
And they really gon' be hatin, this gun on my waist
And I checked shorty pulse and I don't think she gon' make it
Dial 9-1-1, or damn should I run
I'm just weighin out my options before somebody come
If I stay I go to jail, if I run I'd be wrong
This is takin too long, fuck it I'm gone
Hit and run, damn I shoulda hit my brakes
Hit and run, sometimes we all make mistakes
Hit and run, I guess I'm not that heartless
Hit and run, cause now I got a guilty conscience

Ain't a need for cash cuz I don't pay for shit
Security see my face and valet my whip
Rem!

Me I'm nothing like the average see
You a bad girl, me I'm a bad bitch
And now that we got that established
Yall can stop askin how I feel about female rappers
Me, I don't really give a fuck see
And you dont wanna rump with bumbaclot me
Whether it's for free or a hunnid G's
Or your imaginary but it's got GT
Me, I'm in the hood with a hoodie on
On the run getting eating getting my Sam Goodie on
And I'm looking so good , homie got a Woody on
Either I'm so right or these hoes are really wrong
Me, See I'm quick to say that anytime you can get it
Not only can I rhyme I'm photogenic
And everybody got camera phones so the windows tinted
The rims is spinning but you gotta stare and if not it looks like I'm floating
I call video hoes ghost its like they not there

Tek 9,The BX Files,UnKnown,"(Chorus) (2)
Tek 9 plus a AK (2x)
Chrome to ya dome! (2x)

My name is Remy Ma and I don't play
I let that led fly in the broad day
A nigga push up like a bra I'm strapped
He like ""yo ma what's that? ""
I'm like ""Oh thats in case you  wanna get clapped""
I just click (pow)
Chrome to ya dome leave you face down
Bullets logged in ya bone
Yeah I'm a rapper but it ain't just rhymes
So what's you know about turning a autograph singing to a crime scene
Throw something on my stage and I'ma bust in the stands
Wouldn't mind going to jail for clapping one of my fans
You don't want it with Ms. Martin see
Everything bother me
And I really got a serious problem with authority
Keep thinking cause they  always think a chick a never shoot
Till I bust at they feet leave him doing the Chicken Noodle Soup
Tone Woppin it's a reason why I'm bopping
Resurrect the dead so he can tell you what I got bitch!

Yall Dont Really Want It,The BX Files,UnKnown,"(Chorus)
Really it's really nothing
Bitches be really frontin
Niggas don't give me nothing
Take everything that I want and
Soon as I get confronted
I'm telling niggas run it
Yall don't really want it
Nah yall don't really want it

I switch my flow but I'm straight from the Boogie nigga
You know my style black Tims black hoodie nigga

I kicks that southern slang it's from from right thurr
Oh you got bitches coming? Where they at? Right where?
Wife beata, Nik-errs, nice jeans, nice hair
Gun in my purse, ice all in my ear
So who the fuck you think you talking to bitch?

The Bronx Bomber ,Ms.Martin  government name is Reminisce
And you don't really wanna piss me off
Look you dont wanna push me
They say you are what you eat so you know that means you pussy
(Right)I'm in my  Hummer stunting, I'm on the Henry Hudson
Don't care which lane, so  I switch lanes from left lane to right lane its nothing
And I'm doing like a 100
So how I'm gone dump my Dutchess
See niggas is nervous
But I'm swervin on all yall mothafuckas
(Chorus  2x)

Terror squad and you already know that
Bitch threw two at me  I throw four back
Bitch hold that, yeah throwback

Get some weed and roll up

And these bouncers is fucking cowards

WSBH,I’m Around,2014,"Hand me my motherfucking Pelle Jacket
I'm off this
The Hoes, Bitches, Shorty, and Wifey
Which one
Do you
Consider me to be?
Tell me....

Wifey, Shorty, Bitches, Hoes
Wifey, Shorty, Bitches, Hoes
Wifey, Shorty, Bitches, Hoes
Which
One
Are you?

Now Wifey think she popular, she in the crib
Wifey out food shopping, she got the kids
Wifey doing the dishes, she folding clothes
See she don't care bout his Shorty or the Bitches and Hoes
'Cuz him and Wifey been with each other since they was younger
Wifey know shit like his social security number
When they get into a fight, Wifey call his mother
But what Wifey don't know is that its Shorty on the come up
Shorty the one he take to the barbeques in the summer
When Wifey get the voicemail, Shorty who he in front of
Yeah, he still love her but he love Shorty too
Plus the sex is so crazy and Shorty is so cool
Now he ain't even fucking Wifey, Wifey is old news
Wifey in the house crying, taking they kids to school
He don't answer the phone, Wifey calling niggas in the school
When he don't come home Wifey calling Shorty phone too


Now he mad, and wanna leave Wifey but it's reasons he need her
And yall know how the saying goes ""it's cheaper to keep her""
Wifey wanna leave but she scared to lose her status
Besides she rather suffer than to let Shorty have him
Now Shorty chilling, she sort of in the best position
Shorty got her own house and none of his children
Well at least none that's living, 'cuz Shorty stay in the clinics
He barely pipe Wifey so with Shorty he raw in it
Shorty she know his mother, his sisters and his brothers
And they all know not to mention Wifey when they in front of her
He with Wifey Christmas, but Shorty get gifts
And Shorty can't stand his Hoes and his Bitches
She knows he only sees them once in a blue
But feels she shouldn't have to put up with Wifey and them too
So Shorty getting mad, he gives her an excuse
Fuck her and eat her pussy and everything is like new",https://genius.com/Remy-ma-wsbh-lyrics
Still,There’s Something about Remy: Based on a True Story,2006.0,"Seems crazy cuz people be thinking that I be changing, but it's really them that be changing, yo

I remember the day, I first signed my record deal with Lyle everything was so good everyone was so proud
I was so very happy, still with my baby daddy
Living with my granny, but we was all family
It's like when the tour begin, that's when the war begin... you would be flipping, ripping soon as I'm walkin in
And I'm so sleepy, could barely stay awake, you don't understand I been in the studio for six weeks
Straight till 4 in the morning tryna finish these songs
And all you wanna talk about is how many times you was calling
And I'm always lying, it's never the truth it never crossed your mind that I could've been in the booth
Tryna hurry up and get back home to you, tryna get these cheues so we could get out the 'jects
I wasn't thinking 'bout no niggas, wasn't thinking 'bout sex... tryna do this show so I could get this dough
All I was thinking was I gotta finish Remy on the rocks and I'm not tryna flop so it gotta be hot
Everybody on my back saying hurry up and drop so I'm asking you, what I'm suppose to do?

Listen y'all, I know it seem like I be dissing y'all
I'm just tryna reach my goals and remain focused but
Ain't shit changed, now, I'm still the same
So wish me well
Sometimes I might scream and yell
But even people with a fan base have bad days but
Ain't shit changed, for real, I'm still the same
You was the only child until I came
See we was buck wild back in the days
I was scared to have a boyfriend cuz you would beat him up
We'd eat cereal together, watch cartoons when we got up
So I couldn't believe that you flipped on me right in the streets for a bitch so weak that ain't got shit but
A fucked up weave and
I'm your blood, your little sister, I started to cry said it must be the liquor
See I almost died when you took sides with her then walked off and just left me there like I was nobody and you really ain't care
Said you would die for me, how you ain't gon' ride for me, how you see me on the block and don't say hi to me
It's all love now, and it's all done now, but you never took the time to apologize to me
It may be hard to see, but it bothers me... I know you ain't gon' let nobody do no harm to me
But you can't be acting like you fathered me... so I'm asking you, what I'm suppose to do?

Mommy you was the one that made me but you didn't raise me
You left me all alone I had to hold my own
But now I'm all grown and far away from home
I know you love me but you did me wrong
I guess it was all the drugs that you was on or the beatings you got from my foul step pops
Remember the time his punk ass had his nerve to raise his hands to me bitch nigga blacking my eye
I was wishing he would die but now I wish him life
I know he seeing me blowing and it's killing him slowly but what kills me is that you watched him hit me, so I'm

And when I'm not in Miami, it's hot like Miami
I got twin Glocks call 'em cotton and candy
I got cousins that get it poppin' named Tequila and Brandy
I spent like 10 thousand just shoppin' for panties
Know these bitches can't stand me, catch me hoppin' out that Cadi
Shawty gased up 'cause I'm frontin' and I'm callin' him daddy

Got the ghetto barbie but I got a lil' pop, pop

See I know how to rhyme and I'm nice on the mic
And I know how to ride 'cause I'm nice on them bikes
And not for nothin', I'm the type to wife
See I can cook and clean but I like to fight
I had this shawty like to bite I called 'em Iron Mike
Changed it to Jack Frost 'cause he started buyin' ice

Believe me Remy is of the heazy I run shit round here
Like my name was M-Easy
Ain't a need for u to ask where Rem been
You know I'm getting guap , when the face of my watches spinning

The cover of the XXL, and The Source see
The Vibe is next, they signing checks left and right
Everyday I'm catching flights was in LA last night Miami this morning
See I can go thru any weather , curls got me G-foreign
So when I say I gets fly

Smoking haze on the plane or then really I'm getting high
And you just be getting by looking for a handout
Stop Hummer stunting you frontin let the can hang out nigga

Look Pun opened the door and now I'm in it
Terrors the squads and cook coke Cracks the lieutenant
I always thought of Remy Martin as a sergeant
But I'm cool being a kernel cuz now I'm poppin'
I spit so butter I'm still so gutter
Switched up and still flows like no other
I'm like yea yea yeah lean back
I'm in a NY state of mind stressed , like where the fuck the pheens at?
Cuz I got that crack
And I ain't talking bout a pack
See my niggas gone dont make me have to bring em back

Cuz they been getting fucked and pimped like prostitutes
And still your crew so soft I ain't even gotta shoot
I can punch you in your face, put the footage on Youtube
Whats wrong with you, you ain't part of the crew see
If you ain't the rapper then your a male groupie

Lately they been calling me Lady Louis
The Vuitton vixen, female Fendi
Shorty Chanel Rodeo Drive Remy
I'm fresh but what you expect
Yes I take cash , credit,  and personal checks
Oh yeah I'm a bastard
When I shop I ask the cashier if she want paper or plastic

Shesus Khryst tell me who's fucking with me
And if shes so nice tell that bitch to come and get me
The Queen of NY I gets busy

Get me got me
You can't stop me because I'ma go-getter
If you need that snow, then my name cold weather
See I keep that white girl, Christina Aguilera
Whip proper, Betty Crocker (no one can do it better)
No need to argue or debate it
I'm like Floyd you should appreciate me sparring with these haters
You ain't never been the best, and you far from the greatest
You like Mayweather father , you swear to God that you made us
I read the website pages and they saying I'm the illest bitch
You look like a puppet and you need a ventriloquist
These females are fans, these guys are groupies

In school I walked the halls with a sharp pencil
Now I'm drawing a pistol, let a nigga do a bitch move
Or let a bitch move I'm shitting
Wiping my ass with em like tissue
And then I gotta flush em see Remy really don't love em
Same shit different toilet, so like a plum I'd hate to plunge her
And If a nigga got some trees and a nice piece of lumber
And could make some paper than I might just fuck him
And If I stick em , than  I stuck em
Like a chicken I'll pluck em
Gave him some scrambled eggs
Now he walking so I duck him
Niggas got bubblegum blow
Pop broads like Rem some sorta sucker
Put some money on that bitch and I bet you I Lady Luck her
If she want a problem , cause a uproar or a ruckus
It's never nothing for me to quickly Timberland chuck her
Dead in the middle of ground zero
I'm like a Superhero, female Joe Pesci, Al Pacino modern day Robert De Niro
Defend my niggas that do murders like Robert Shapiro
Drink Malibu, pineapple juice and puff piff by the pillow
Forreal tho, Tell my flow ain't so crazy
Just shot at yo crib
Not where you live but where you lay yo baby
And lately I been spittin on some I'm real yo Conceited shit
To me chicks is like dicks
I'm quick to tell em beat it bitch
You hang around boxers, but your no tough cookie
You only get hard when your around pussies
I do chick greasy K Sleazy know my M.O
Why you runnin round like  please, please listen to my demo
I'm in a new MB bitch and I'm buggin at the windows
With the tints, limo black cause I'm blowing down the Indo
You may stunt round them other broads
But you don't want it with Rem tho
Take your posters down on some petty shit like my nigga N-O
I ain't saying that you garbage
You better stuck where you started
You could neva ever ever ever be Ms.Martin
I flow retarded, You can't stand to see me
I know you was wishing I was really banned from TV
That still wouldn't stop me from talking reckless on mixtapes, and CD's FM, XM, Satellite, and DVD
I'm remarkable it don't matter who I'm talking to
They all flow mediocre and they faces ain't marketable
Look ma you need more than some shades and some shiny lips
For me to believe you a rapper, and you really can spit
That you even next to me, Do yall hear this bitch?
I wish I was Foxy right now I don't wanna hear this shit
You need to fuck back, I know you been sneaking round back
You and your weave is loose I can see your tracks
You ain't fire , no bitch you ain't poppin
You a burning sanitation truck, ma you hot garbage
You a bum bitch, you hear the trumpets
It's the Queen of NY, Remy Ma

Only chick I like is Lauryn and she Hennessy
Call me infinity cause ain't no end of me
You ain't a blood relative you a fucking enemy
I smoke alot of weed but I got alot of energy
Type to fuck your man in ya crib where your dinner be
Wearing yo robe making noise while ya kids asleep
Call you on the phone so you can hear while he digging me
Yeah I know you feeling me, these females be killing me
I'm a grown ass woman so you can't be kidding me
You need a laxative cuz yall bitches can't do shit to me
No you a hoe you can't change your identity
See I bust guns, and I cop keys
You in the studio like (I'm tryna catch the beat)
You really think your better than me?
Bet your G, bet your piece , whatever I got extra cheese

It's a problem out the gate
And you know they gone hate

And that hear that nigga Gates
Steady tryna catch the beat

Unstoppable,Girlfight (Music From the Motion Picture),UnKnown,"(Chorus)
Remi Martin step on the scene like wha
Pun album number 14 like wha
Bout to take the whole industry like wha
Like wha, what the fuck I can't be touched
We got the BX locked the
Mo less, T.S. has got me
No stress cause y'all can't stop me
A bitch like Rem is unstoppable
(Verse 1)
I wish every breath I take, could taste like 'dro
Every sentence that I say will come out in a flow
So I'll never have to write, or spend no dough on smoke
I was never a comedian, but y'all ho's a joke
I use to be the loud one, the only bitch in a bunch
Standin in the middle crowd, puffin a blunt
Like it's legal, never put the coke in my cut
Just shotties and dead bodies layin up in the trunk
Y'all ho's is drunk, you sound like her, you sound like him
But I don't really care, long as no one sound like Rem
Get into hot shit, y'all better stop shit
Now I'm only spittin, in a minute, I'ma haul spit
Make yo' record label take yo shit of the market
Take ya name off the roster, and write Remi Martin
I'ma a monster, to y'all fraud broads, I'ma probelm
I spit so sick, and I flip so quick like wha!
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
Once I get started, you can't do shit
But get pissed, cop the album, cassette, and compact disc
Put me in a mansion, still a project bitch
Party shit, come threw bombin shit
In a Benz tesseler, wit the darkest tips
So expensive, niggas hesitate to park the shit
Niggas got big funds, so we copped big guns
Y'all scared to death, since I got wit Big Pun
If I ain't the baddest Bicth, in this rappin shit
Tell me who the fuck is so I can slap the bitch
Tell her stop writin rhymes, memorize her lines
Get her own shit, she wastin my time
I'm a double don, none of y'all can't trouble mines
Make a remix, kill the same verse double time
Hot to death, fuck around and stop ya breath
The find ya hat, ya soul, and bloody the rest like wha!
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
I think my flow, got a few hoes mad at me
They run around tellin cats they wanna battle me
Ready to put up the dough, the truck and the V
I'm like whoa, y'all know who the fuck I be
Y'all know that my nigga's call me hannibal
Cause I be eatin bitches up like a cannibal
Wild out, like a muthafuckin animal
I got a thing for a clip that's expandable
And that's no kiddin, and no bullshittin
Murder you, yo kids, and ya grandchildren
Body the bird, the dog, and the lil kitten
You can stop the beat and all, and Remi still spittin
And you still flippin, how she the hottest bitch
When I get my shit written by the hottest kids
Cause you so pussy, so don't push me
And i'm way to loud, so you can't shush me, like wha!

And your daughter I spoil her, I know you really hate me
Damn, what has your man done for you lately?

Cause from the AM to the PM we be fucking when I see him
We be touching, sucking, humpin, lustin, loving when I see him
You be buggin, I'm wassup, it's really nothing when I see him
When you see me you get sick, you know I'm doing my thing You probably puked, cause I'm cute, when you saw me in King
And whats really fucked up, is that my album's coming soon
Got damn, it must really suck to be you

C.R.E.A.M.,Shesus Khryst,2008,"Yeah - started out on the good side
And shooked to the hood side
'Cause that's where all the crooks reside
And wherever there is crooks, there is crime
Wherever there is crime, there is cash
And wherever there is cash, there is eye
Anywhere is eye, there is my guys
The society of people that are all fly
Bolt niggas and bitches only dance for the ritches
Any place that I walk in, I make a grant interest
Classic image, you've got to admit it:
There is no one that can get all the attention from all of the women
But these hoes slow down, so I make 'em steady dissin'
Sayin' tryin' to figure out - well keep my clock tickin'
Walking into the office meeting with my watch hittin'
Not because I am scared of getting robbed
But I don't wanna be offensive to the executives in here
I got more money then 'em, and they supposed to be the ones with good jobs
High spitter then that nigga, I'm a hood star
83 cut dough - that's my favorite hood call
Corner park it up time that was my favorite hood walk
Pass me the chopper, I show you what it’s good for

Cash rules everything around me - C.r.e.a.m
Get the money - Dollar dollar bill, yoo

Cash rules everything around me

Jay from Jamaica rolled in papers, smuggled in bouncy
I am 'bout to get money, bitch - dollar, dollar bill, yeah
I got a live crew that is dyin' to kill ya
Niggas feel my New York slang like they feel mob
Yeah, I mean, fuck outta here, son

Go back to Hollywood ? that's where you got a chill guard
Never letting my nils ? I put that burner in your grill, Pa

Whatever hater say - he or she don't like
May whatever they wish of me come back to them, Christ

I am just here for Currensy, so tell me where the cash is

What’s My Name,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She says she love my nature
She don't love me, she love my gangsta
She don't love me, she love my paper
Caught me creepin with the next door neighbor
It wasn't me (If it was, it was)
She'll still love me, cause love is love
He said he love my body
He don't love me, he love my punanny
I'm in love with the things that he buy me
Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby
It wasn't me, (If it was, it was)
He'll still love me, cause love is love
Now what's my name? (Daddy)
What's my name? (Daddy)
And I still love him even when I'm aggy
He has me wrapped around his finger
And in my cell phone, he got his own ringer
Now, sometimes he get heated
And I know he don't mean it
But as much as he accused me
I should have cheated
And even if I cheated, he wouldn't believe it
Cause right after I read it, messages gets deleted
And I know we even but, I don't never see it
When I step on the scene, the groupies gotta beat it
He caught, it's cool, but we break up
New bag, new shoes, and we make up
He buy me diamonds, that's my darling
Guess I really believe that he sorry
As far as I can see, he called for me
How could I not accept his apology

What's my name? (Baby)
And once I get it, I'm gone, I'm Swayze
I do the damn thang and I run
I knew she was a freak, cause she had an earring in her tongue
Cop a whip, I cop rims, I'm not those dudes
How you gonna buy a suit and don't cop no shoes
Put the sugarfoot inside her stomach
Man I have her climbing up the wall like Spider-Woman
She gon' ride through the hood on back of the motorcycle
Sexy, she got more thighs than the Bible
Can't tell a woman you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love, you gotta prove it
A man give you his trust, you can't abuse it
Annalyze your choice before you choosin'
Ask Snoop Dogg, I let it bang
I got the hardest chick in the game screaming my name

She don't love me, she love my gangsta
