Sound Is Vibration,Overcast!,1997,"I'm sparked, waiting for the dark to hit
Cause once the moon gets above my apartment
I catch fits for starting shit
I'm smart with it, I give it that special touch when I push it
Cause I'm also a label rep, and I can't allow no bullshit
So shush kid, shush baby! Shut your eyes
Lay your head back, shed the fear and let the tears crystallize
I wish the flies to land upon your forehead
When I extract the essence from your head
And leave your body resting Moorehead
I left more dead reputations than HIV can
But for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's, man!
I'm watching C-SPAN, waiting for the first state rep
To take the first step, to have to kill off to make this world perfect
Well lets get shit right, right here! Right now! Right away!
Atmosphere motherfucker! If I need to I could fly away
I'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew
Serve you with seafood
You can't cloud my vision cuz you're see-through

You need to recognize the size of the Atmos
You ain't as tall as half this - Madness- past what you practice
RSE you can't fuck with my tactics, you bastard
Thats why you breath fast bitch - no need to ask

We dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp, then peeled it
Sent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip
Now bite your tongue, this is how the mic gets stung
A whole tree to pick some fruit from, man!
You had to choose the ripest one

That said it all, it comes from inside, and how you ride
The sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right
Catchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time
With lines, makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight
Your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee
So listen please use discretion when you breath
Sound is vibration, I choose to use it with a vision
And then comes the style and precision...

No more longer will we hold your hands
Why? Cause you're too damn old
Oh yea, the network called
They told me to tell ya you've been cancelled
They also said big up for all the support
Thanks to your devotion, they now control the world
So let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang
I'm rising past the bank, with smile I'm flashin my fangs
I tumble over some, cuz some I don't over stand
I got the plot from Spawn, from now on, I know the plan

It's the noise it makes, that generates the passion I have
It's the void it breaks, that stimulates when mics get grabbed
It takes shape - escapes from these vocal chords I have
Atmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab

Come now, who fi me gwan test the giants when we apply this
Vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print
The tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced
Don't breath a sigh of relief 'till you hear the rescue sirens

Supreme, be this team, we got this shit on lock
RSE we hid the key under an upscale rock
So you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in
You could try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in
Nigga, what! My definition is raw, I got you all
Wishin' I'd fall, so things could get better for y'all
But I'm tall, and got game, remain the same for the duration
Area code 6-1-2, my present location...

Atmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not abuse it
Blessed with insight, friends and influences
Thats what keeps us dope, what makes us dope is the surroundings
Inspiration stems from love and stress compounding
Stamina: that is achieved over the course of time
In fact, time taught me how to breath, battle, not to court my mind
Defined as lyricist - the Atmosphericist
Makin sure you fear this hit every time you hear this shit
 Sound is vibration
 This sound is taken
 Sound is vibration
 And the ground is shaken
 Vibration is sound
 Yo, we found your replacement
 Vibration is sound
 Now who makes the sound?
 : Now who makes the music/sound? (*fades out*)",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-sound-is-vibration-lyrics
4:30 am,Overcast!,1997,"So Tootsie Roll the fuck back to your seat cause I don't like you

Hey Spawn tell me a joke
Hahahahaha
Hey yo Spawn, what you doing?
Hahahaha!

I sever heads just to sharpen my skills
Zoom in on brains like a John Carpenter kill
Surprise, that's the element, your confidence is delicate
Never recuperates, 
I leave you mute and celibate
Break the victim down to a jelly consistency
The brain twisted spits, now tell me who gets with me
I felt they were listening and the smell of fear amps me
Sweet tooth, room full of candy wrappers, I get antsy
Mission activated, attention captivated
Vocals ring bring the so-called king on stage assassinated
You're nice, where you from?
That's the question I ask
Distraction got struck pull their heart out their ass
The blast is nuclear, when the crew appears
So seek shelter, the only helpful advice
Is that you should steer clear of the exits
I take reps and make messes
Broken, when the spot closes we're off to breakfast
Invested breath, skills, adrenaline
Refill the gut then to my hut to build with the pen again
From Hennepin to Lexington the first section conquered
Laid seeds in the soil, peep the props and honor

It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?
It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?
It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?
It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?

Can't expect everyone to see shit the way I see it
Can't expect anyone to be dope the way I be it
So be it, 
Atmosphere leaks through like sunbeams
To snap you like a bungee when the
  Sayers takes the country
Hungry, and this emptyness makes me grumpy
Take an emcee, stuff him between some bread, cheese and lunch meat
It's just a snack,
 
rely on Ant to thrust a track
Into the mind as I slip behind the whack and crush his back
Must react, if we don't we have no work
So I stomp them, let his team remove remains up off the astroturf
Now who's eager to be made a believer?
It wakes the dead when I shake a rival's head until his teeth hurt
Knee jerk, when I yank your brain into a fever
And melt the weak channels in your receiver
You need to keep your beaver in your pants
Fuck your leisure and your plans
I wear a Van Halen T-shirt
Bust a stance and crush your plans
It's all inside the flow's balance, we figure well
Your style has the personality of a Speak and Spell
You need development to reach the plateau I'm at
So take a fat step back so I don't mistake you as a bat

It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?
It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?
It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?
It's 4:30 AM, do you know where your head's at?",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-4-30-am-lyrics
Complications,Overcast!,1997,"Yo this is dedicated to this girl that I dated
Complicated maze, Complicated maze

At first sighting, only a stranger to my eyes, couldn't keep them off me
I'm sure your friend recognized, I didn't care, I had to stare, stood there at attention
Not many words mentioned still I felt the thought connection, wanted the sex then
Got to know you, wanted more, Things got complex when
You had a man and wasn't sure
My thoughts were pure, Is it gonna be him? Or is gonna be me?
Cause that's the way I have to have it
Grasped the idea, Ms scribble head Talia
Wanted you to feature but your man is screwing up the procedure
What is it that you say? I'm on your mind all day
But still say you're content, how the situation lay
Why you play? Why do you stay? There's something better
Know you felt it when you received my first poetic letter
Why you fronting? Tell me something
Is it that you want your cake and stuff it down your face too?
Did I have to chase you?
Why oh why do you cry?
Said afraid of losing me? I think that you're confusing me a lot
No wait a minute, stop, bring that back, I missed a page
Was it that time of the month or were you going through a phase?

Complicated maze. (This phrase fits you perfect)
Come back in later days. (Talk to me when you're certain)
You're always changing. (Never stay the same person)
Come back in later days. (Talk to me when you're certain)

Miss Merriweather, the partial, the martial artist of fake imitation love products
Now facing you is irritation
Know you used to have me placing you on pedestals like a goddess
Personality changes it seemed to be to me you were the oddest
Soon to depart us like red seas by Moses
Our friendship's diseased, unfeasible, hopeless
No reasonable answers to my question of focus, Caused my tension
Nothing made sense when you replied with a tied tongue
Said you feared abusiveness, I never swung
Why all these excuses miss? What have I done?
Figured I had the right kind of lady, yeah maybe it was fun, for you
But not for me, I found it quite unamusing
You were using me as a bridge just to pass what was left behind
Play times for dangerous minds, but why'd it have to be mine?
Why'd it have to be mine?

Now I'm not really trying to come off abrasive
But why you messing with my man's head?
I mean I'm spending time trying to keep his mind on rhymes and beats
And you're a distraction. I mean you got my man just shook
I mean honestly, I guess what I'm trying to say is...


Virgin torn from sleep, the newborn
( Why are you doing this? See you're always playing games)
And it was easy to get too deep, the water was lukewarm
Virgin torn from sleep, the newborn
( Oh, what now? What? You wanna come back?)
And it was easy to get too deep, the water was lukewarm

Do you know what today is?
It's the third anniversary, you came back to flirt with me
For certain, you must mistake me for a fool
See I know how you are, I see those tricks in you
Tried to make amends, there's something new
Had problems with your friend, so it's me you always run to
Come to and smell the coffee, go drink the pot with extra caffeine
Cause next to acting, you win awards for cloudy vision
Tired of fishing for the what, why and when
Will this repetition end, step away and give me oxygen
Not interested in talking, say nothing, keep walking, go 'bout your away
See the colors of these areas have started turning gray
See you later, goodnight, got no more candles to light
Yo, it's time to move along cause baby something isn't right
Still I'm glad I met you, it's too bad you screwed it up
The only thing I regret is that I didn't get to f-

Adjust,Overcast!,1997,"I woke up on the wrong side of my head
Converts the day into search for awake until I go to bed
I drove up, but misplaced the directions they learned
Ignored the arrows and the signs
Just follow the sense
I don't know whether or not you can comprehend
Levers and knobs got stripped and that was just within the launch of it
They found me in up to my neck
All they saw was this head floatin' on top the ocean
It didn't stop the motion
They kept goin'
Perfect, didn't recognize Slug
Or the effects he'd have when he disrupts the class
Mission bound, twisting around my realm of lost
Cash is expensive, I think I can smell the cost
Decomposion, something died right behind that wall
TV gave me all I needed
It only took a phone call
Pay by the minute
85 percents a second coming
All over the breasts
 
of she who left the water running
Flood the basement, drown the MCs and centipedes
Filed complaints, civil suits and try to sue the sidle tendencies
Energy drained, drain plugged -- hence the flood
Find the fault line, shift plate, take blame off of Slug

Ayo Money let's sit down if you've got the time
Cause if you can take the time, I've got some substance on my mind
No I don't really know you, but I know who you are
We've spoke a few times, joked a few times
We even toked a few times
I can remember one time purchasing weed from you once
Yeah, it was worth it
One time we even discussed maybe hooking up and workin'
It didn't happen, but that's not the reason for this
I know I should just get to the point
So let's all get to the point
But let's all get to the point
You may get pissed at what I'm about to spit
Bottom line is mad or not, somebody needs to say this shit
When I'm finished, you might wanna fight
But I don't wanna fight, I've seen you fight
Go ahead, get wild, and I'll still smile for bein' right
See me and mics are like marriage -- makes life complete
And you've been fuckin' with nasal drugs, renders love obsolete
I dare to speak upon you, not to front on you
But I'd rather address this here matter
Than have to duck and shun you
It's getting close to harvest, time to count your livestock
All I've got for a hype is five spots to shovel my sidewalk
It's still within you, I can see it, I think it froze
Cause you keep cooling it off putting winter in your nose

Man, I don't know about you no more kid
I mean look at your shit, I mean your shit's all off balance
I mean I don't know, you're fucking with these drugs and shit
I just don't know, I don't know

He pinned me down, gave me the right to shut up after I used my voice
Well guess what? Fuck You
And that's all I wanted to say
Go tell your kids about my crew and the next venue we're gonna play
Stressed out, but that's nothing new, everyone is
And it's gonna stay that way cause nowadays that's how we're runnin' shit
Punishment: that's just another fancy way to say it's time to wake up
Fuck your fame, I'm trying to build some game for my man Jacob
That's my son
Some say spittin' image
Same smile, different grimace
When grown, I hope he's never prone to heed the limits
Of life. Life: probably the biggest word I've ever said
That says a lot, cause there's a whole lot of words inside my head

Clay,Overcast!,1997,"When I first landed the damage was outlandish
Anguish, anxiousness, and taking it for granted
But when I first landed, I was so relieved, I lost my focus
Soon exceeded recommended dosages
Now I hold the crib that holds the soul that holds the poet skills
Exclusive: it leaves illusions of unfocused flows
I don't suppose you're taking too much time
Breaking too much mind trying to unravel the babble
That dismantled and left the lines in need of some assembly
So I can find the secret key and free all the emcees
This planet spins on a thin axis
All-access passes won't help you to grasp the Atmos
I mean, what did you think
My agenda was to freestyle, smile, get paid to smoke weed
And grab the mic and spoonfeed?
There's more to this than just paying the rent
If you're riding on this song you need to ride it to the end

What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
Planets as small as balls of clay

Some shells get broke
Some keep their wigs closed
Some get exposed as little man big pose
Some make moves and some stay daydreamers
But everbody seems to want some loot, food and a beemer
Well make mine hunter green with camel insides
10 percent tints, Mr. Pibb, and some french fries
Inch by inch I take it closer to the shoulder
But day by day it's getting harder to stay sober
Once again on the edge, head's inebriated
Movement needs motive, it's easier to be sedated
What makes me mighty and another tiny?
Why does my psyche give a damn about whether or not you like me?
If this crime's right I might be wrong
I grip this mic tight because it's all I really have a grip on
So let the losers lose and let the players play
The only difference is the day to some dust on the clay, what


Whose world is that? it ain't mine, and I'm grateful
Already got a plate full of clay on my table
I'm capable of handling fate, I know this
So do the people that get pissed when this microphonist spits
Too many get caught up in the lines that emcees thought up
But it's clear to me the ones that fear me are the ones that oughta
I spot a blemish on your planet's existence
I deliver subtle terror submerged in clever sentences
Instantly pissin' away the misfits
The only residue that came of the hypothetical spew they sprayed
When they swayed I'd have 'em
Half of 'em can't fathom
Where the maths from
My man Beyond knows
You can ask him
At last, when we get down to it
There's more than sand and fluid
Involved in how I revolve and evolve
Can we solve the secrets? No
Can we take trinkets? No
So when the ink hits it's more than just a sequenced flow
I can't bring it with so I'm a leave me here
Centuries from now they're gonna study Atmosphere
Carefully I steer, I'm aware life is fatal
When I go, I wanna go like hope, taken by the Plato",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-clay-lyrics
Brief Description,Overcast!,1997,"[Sample: ""Have you heard it? Sing along
If you didn't hear it you're gonna hear it right now.""]

Bam, the doorway opened for me
I saw ways and told the story
Raw daydreams of holding glory
Junior high hallway kings
Locking, Bagging MCs
Beat boxing, breaking Zulu Nation wannabees
It didn't take long to see who would stay strong
High school came upon, some B-Boys put their gang bangs on
But some kept on doing, stepped on to ruin
Others that were pursuing the same shit we thought we ruled in
But what a surprise: the passion for being the best
Puts a quest for allies to rest
Dead
In the Midwest where heads
Is just a handful
In a land of gangstas
Players, replacements, priests, banjos
We scramble to break MCs that may appreciate it
Guided by their envy, insecurity, and their hatred
Separated by the ""gimmie props"" technique
And the desire to be the tops this week
I gotta floss the speak
Cause talk is cheap, even the broke kids can afford it
That's why I stand close and if you're dope then I'm supportive
But if not: we'll keep the mic warm
For the next one, respect the artform
And make your wishes on the stars born

Within the movement
Fact checking, trying to completely avoid all channels of backstepping
From the lines of painted concrete
That reside on Lake Street
To the way we close our eyes to sleep
And drift through Deep Space 9 type shit
To find this
I've been around for as long as sound
I've been to that not-so-fresh phase
And to that not-quite-that-serious state
But I've evolved, metamorphed manifestate

I used to be young, dumb and full of vision
Like it was religious rituals
I made initial decisions
I wanted to be a rapper world renowned
From Minneap to the Bronx
Capture girls and crowns
Snap, tackle and stomp
That's when I found
The abyss that sits in-between the one that holds the mic and those that
Don't even listen
Formed some crews
Rocked talent shows at schools
Saturdays on the 18 making my way down to the record pool
I met a grip of people that was bullshit
Was down with a lot of people that was bullshit
But I'll pull shit from the asshole of an angel before I let him hassle and strangle
The love triangle between me the mic and the turntable
Went to studios
We want to make demos
We want to do shows and rock our own instrumentals
Do our own production
Fucking around with this kid Kazir
Nitwit engineer
Barely knew his own equipment, Atmosphere
The prefix was urban
Wrecked shows
Made friends, made foes
Overall, we made flows
And right now as I sit here, right now, writing this
I'm bugging off the people in my life that made me like this

Within the movement
Fact checkin'
Tryin' to completely avoid all channels of backsteppin'
From the lines of painted concrete
That reside on Franklin Ave
To the dead bird on the elevator
To that short in your crossfader
I never got lost later
For efforts to pester
Just throw your hands up in the air like a leper
I've been to that not-so-fresh phase
And to that not-quite-that-serious state
Metamorph and manifestate

Well sometimes it rings and I don't answer it
That's it, no asterisk
No thirst to find the circumstances
It was planted in me deep
It was nurtured and it grew
Gave it sleep and nutrition
It was efficient, let it through
There's a few that have developed to where I let them in my spectrum
For the rest of 'em, I give them just enough to cause infection
Not tripping on attention
But if you have it, it's welcome
Open arms, potent charm
I know the words and I can spell them
Seldom is it, when one inquisits
Do they leave with disinterest
In fact most begin crave the visits
Bringin' me to the table
That's it, no more no less
The love, the life, the stress
Slug, the mic, the mess
Testing. Yes, I've been tested and I've tested some
Not saying I'm the best
Believe I'm not like the rest of 'em
Just saying I'm better than you
That's my mind state my rhymes take me into
When I check one two, I guess some do get pissed
But intentions were to inspire
Build the empire before I get tired
The ones that tear me down don't know it
But they're the same ones that built me
Now quietly in your head say, ""Yes you can feel me.""

""Asking himself, even before the curtain goes up: What am I? I am now 80 years old, and more, and I am determined to find precisely what I am, what I amount to. They tell me I am everything, they flatter me every day of my life. I am now going to subject myself to a rigorous test in order to find out really what I am. I don't care about kingdom. I don't care about rule anymore. It is of no importance to me, as such, but I must find out what I am before I die.""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-brief-description-lyrics
Cuando Limpia el Humo,Overcast!,1997,"Patterned around the thought and the will
We shattered the sound of perpendicular noise
Now gather 'round, blueprints to rebuild
On top of that, I found I'm gettin' sick of your voice
Retentive, the Earth makes me tend to introvert
And I've presented the worth of these kicks and this wrinkled shirt
Ingested verse for seconds and a big dessert presented
Thirst with sprinkles of dope indisbursed
When you burst, it won't be an accident
It'll be a worldwide web of heads takin' this shit back again
(6-1-2) Now find the emergency exits
Cause I'mma snap a spine to make an example of the skeptics
(Atmosphere) I don't care if you know me or you hate me
Just come check out the show and travel back home safely
Lately, a weird thought occured to me
What if I was to grab the mic, which one of y'all would service me?
(Watch the rhythm) 
Inventions to rock the restless and kill your ego
Your whole karma's vibin' off the Beck's
It's best if you take a hard look at what you're givin' me
(Cause your name and your rank don't mean shit to me)

Stars and Stripes are like cars and bikes
They're just vehicles you steer to ride other people's fears
Stars and Stripes are like nails and spikes
They're just tools that you use against the physical rules

Put down your weapon son (Slug talking)
Put down your weapon son
Put down your weapon son
Would you put down your weapon?

I heard a grip of little voices in a thousand heads
Calling me out of my rest to come and plow your steps
An elder once told me to always use precision
(Discretion and vision when you start the ignition)
Cause any engine is highly delicate and what you got to say
Is irrelevant if you're talking for the hell of it
I smell some shit; check your sole, brotha, did you step in it
?
Now who suffers from my control deficit?
I can't go out like you (cause you lack dopeness)
I'll break your whole crew down to (a bunch of wack poets)
Shrapnel gets lodged under your clavicle
When your man exploded, Atmosphere concoctin' antidote shit
Fuck 'em and the record deal that they rode in on
When Sean is in his vocal groove I come to choke your truth
Broke your screws, now it's open and loose and it's took
(Beyond came along and stabbed a DJ in the foot)
The spokes bend and buckle (and the wheel collapses)
There ain't no need to even ask whether or not you feel the Atmos
I'm peelin' back heads performing brain surgery
And sewing 'em back up (There, now you've heard of me)

When the smoke clears, you won't be able to choke tears
When the smoke clears, when the smoke clears (2x)

Put down your weapon sir (Slug talking)
Put down your weapon sir
Put down your weapon sir
Put down your weapon

As I sit here with my head between my hands
Attention span focused on trying to read the plans
I can't shake the thoughts that it might be in vain
So I play the radio while I drive me insane
(I travel like the wind) I travel like Avis
I feel as if I've been to hell and back and I ain't even been to Vegas
Pages and pages of notebooks dedicated
To separatin' snake skin and amputatin' fake lips
(Underestimated) But when you heard me, your masculinity went girly
And your whole crew broke out early
(Self-preservated) Avoidance is the first choice
Calculated: Step the fuck away when you hear this voice
Moist, thats how we leave 'em rendered
Either the brain or the pubic region, depending on your gender
And if you're a female head (no disrespect intended)
Unless you step to me on the mic, you must be sheddin' your placenta
I wear the honor of an emcee's past
Where I wonder ""Is this wasteland encased in cheap glass?""
Reflected to find the status where you stand
(You're just another victim with a mic in your hand)

When the smoke clears, you won't be able to choke tears
When the smoke clears, when the smoke clears (4x)

When the smoke clears, you won't be able to choke tears (7x)
When the smoke, Smoke",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-cuando-limpia-el-humo-lyrics
Multiples,Overcast!,1997,"Right now, we gonna get together and give you a tune
That we had a lot of requests for...

I never gave props to emcees who don't deserve it
Never smoked rocks, never had guts to serve it
Never had a Glock, never seemed to be worth it
Never had I thought life was gonna be perfect
Never hit the chicks unless I have a jimmy hat
Never leave the crib unless I have my shit intact
Never do I say a rhyme unless the beat is fat
Best believe that, never will the Spawn come wack
I never went to court, never had to serve trial
Never went to jail, had no records on file
Never disrespect, never treat my friends wild
Cause I never had real friends till now

So this goes to those
Who be supporting at the shows
And this goes to those
Who's always working on they flows
And this goes to those
Who use music intake to escape
Finding love and happiness inside a mix-tape
And this goes to those
Whose criticism is constructive
And this goes to those
Who lyrically we just can't fuck with
And this goes to those
Whose love is so strong
You can shut your eyes and see them when you listen to they songs
This goes to those
Who eat and sleep with turntables
This goes to those
Who say ""Fuck the major labels""
And this goes to those
Who, unsigned and dead broke
Can still make a name before they even make a demo
This goes to those
Who keep the freight trains lit up
And this goes to those
Who roam the night just to get up
And this goes to those
Who tag and paint walls with aerosol
Lost city crew, from Minneap to St. Paul
This goes to those
Who flip the b-boy acrobatics
And this goes to those
Who put the ball in the baskets
This goes to those
Of you who listen to the lyrics
Cause this flow's for those who can dig the Atmosphere shit

It's like that shit
It's like this shit
True heads are the real music critics
Was always better with flows
Then I was with shoulder pose
But no matter where you live my man the love is multiples

Anxiety: That's my new drug of choice
Society: Where you go when you lose your voice
Rivalry: Stems from the shit your man's telling me
Don't lie to me, I know the real definition is jealousy
Observation: That's my tactic to complain
Conversation: Distract you while I pick your brain
Atmosphere: Up-there lyrical unit
That leaves the average emcee confused like a eunuch
Nonetheless: That's how I often change the subject
Second guess: That's what they all do to Slug's shit
Ironic: Most kids pale in comparison to my phonics
So come inhale some embarrassment
Roller-coaster: A metaphor for my delivery
Overdose: Results of having battle tendencies
Activated: Every time its my turn to rip
But ""masturbated"" means that you finally came to grip
So reality must mean: guns, bitches, and weed
Cause salary is what comes from: guns, bitches, and weed
Integrity means you're in pain cause you're in love
Collectively means that none of y'all could fuck with Slug
It's like that, never the wack, an actual fact
It's like act transglobal and local, so hold me back
It's like damn aimless, tenseness, wandering

Primer,Overcast!,1997,"Hey Daley, Get the fuck away from my sister you punk motherfucker
(intro) I do... I do... I do...
Hey whassup, can I kiss the bitch yet?... I do...
First of all bitch, I never promised I'd be rich
So fuck you and your wishes, ya need to do the dishes
And change the damn cat litter
I thought I told you to get rid of that crazy cat last week
Yo, don't you get sassy with me missy
Because I'll go upside you quickly
But yo, she's kinda sneaky when I sleep she'll probably stick me
But it be a threat, and threats make her respond
She probably grew up watching pops beat her mom
Until the break-a-dawn
I could pop shit, talk shit, hostage to herself
Because there ain't no where to walk; this is the middle of hell
You've got no job, no diploma
Might as well kick it with me and live in Hinckley, Minnesota
She's my trailer park chick
With the pop tarts and venison hard liquor to cop a buzz
Off the over the counter medicine
The rent is in the mail
Bitch pump the keg
Fix the antenna, act your age and spread your legs
It's my CAS-STLE, white trash ho
And if I want to I'll put it in your asshole
You wanna battle baby? I'll put a shadow over your sky
Now shut the fuck up and fix me turkey pot pie
I own the camaro and the mobile home, so where the fuck you gonna go?
(4X)
Go, go
Go ahead and call your mom if ya need someone to cry to boo
I guarantee that that bitch is gonna lie to you
Fuck ya crank head, soap opera, pastries, and diet soda
Everything she'll ever need to know she learned from Oprah
You what the hell she's gonna do for you?
That bitch is stuck too
Get off my phone, tell her I said what up, and muthafuck you
And tell daddy if he wants some
To bring his drunk ass on
I beat that fat bastard with a cast on
Ay yo honey I'm trippin
But why you always flippin
Dress slutty everytime that we go drinkin with my buddies
Won't be long before you carrying my puppies
Speaking of which you bleeding yet bitch?
Cause you gettin kind of chubby
Yo, where the hell'd you put my stash?
Better tell me quick fast or catch a foot in the ass
Oh no, you did not smoke all of my pot
If my remmington was out the pawn shop, you'd get shot
Stop, and put that knife back in the sink
Baby, Baby, Baby, why you fucking trying to take me to the brink?
What you think?
Quit thinking and pretending that you're smart
Happily ever after 'til death do us part
I own the camaro and the mobile home, so where the fuck you gonna go?

I love you",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-primer-lyrics
Ode to the Modern Man (Lightning Blend),Overcast!,1997,"This is an ode to the modern man
It's the ode to the modern man
This is the ode to the modern man
Word up, this is the modern man
This is that ode to the modern man
This goes out to that modern man
This is the ode to the modern man
It's to the modern man, lightning blend

Word to B E, I'm a tad bit too easy on self
And maybe I should keep a closer tab on my health
I suppose that it's simpler said than completed
I thought me to attack but in fact again retreated
Completed this word search, crumbled it up and ate it
My hunger for my blue-collar heaven keeps me sedated
Escaped it, last night in a dream
And now I sleep, with a flashlight and it seems to keep
The nightmare demons and semen-laced portions parallel and apart
Like Stephen's Avenue in Portland
A much-traveled one-way, or a slow residential
And if the camels don't stump me I'ma grow with my pencil
Once I climb the skulls of this MC graveyard
I'll see the sun again, I'll jump and run again
So come on over, visit, cause I got a lot to say
And tell Stress I ain't mad, cause I got my way
But my man Spawn's here now, so I'ma make it brief
Finish up my coffee, gather up my shit and leave
I got an army of peers, we fight single-handed
And I won't damage your brain until I understand it

You have only one chance to advance to the next stage I'm at
Do you really think you actually will pass through?
I have to ask you, did you see what happened to the last dude
Tried to compare styles, word he got his ass chewed
Now with this in mind, do you still wanna bring your shit and find out the hard way
Spawn's not the one to play with, trade blades with
You might as well slit your own wrist with the razor
It's best cause I'm crazier
Blazing you, for my own amusement
In tune with your body, when I split your whole fixture
This is what happens when you're on my shit list-er
Brains to give a blister, so next time you call me sir or mister
It's the word-twister tongue used to make the verbs hit ya
Now do you get the fucking picture?
Well if you gotta save you you better call up
Cause my behavior blows kids away like a tall wind
I take you all in between my jaws for consumption
MCs and coffee at my luncheon
One or two lumps, and some cream, call the team for the gathering
Bring mics and turntables, let's do our thing

Ha, cause it's an ode to that modern man
This is that ode to the modern man
Yeah, this goes out to that modern man
From Minneapolis, St. Paul to that modern man
And it's like a dedication to that modern man
This one here, this is for that modern man
From Atmosphere goin' out to that modern man
It's to that modern man, lightning blend

What, now for the umpteenth-time we kick rhymes about something
Can't front, I'm frustrated with heads that don't listen
My position's off-balance
It's a constant challenge between the talents and the underlying mission
I can fill your head some more with metaphors, some cute catch-phrases
Filtered through accessible things
But if I don't stay sincere to love and hate
How do I differentiate between chasing cream and chasing dreams
Oh yeah, fuck an MC in my city that wants to diss me
If I was to bounce to Atlanta with Shocker y'all would miss me
So kiss me, smack dab on the asshole while you battle
I'm with your wife sharing a Newcastle
Big up to Gene Pool, cause he's the modern man
Word up, that kid Abuse, that kid's a modern man
To Self-One, yo, that kid's a modern man
Full Circle, you know them kids is modern men
The Native Ones, word up to that modern man
Beyond Extreme, this goes to the modern man
Dynospectrum out to that modern man
From Atmosphere goin' out to that modern man
Word up, this is the ode to the modern man
It goes, like, one time for that modern man
This goes out here now to that modern man
It's to that modern man, it's to that modern man, kid
Yo, this is the ode to the modern man
It goes word-up, yeah to that modern man
It's for that modern man, it's for that modern man
It's for that modern man, lightning blend",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-ode-to-the-modern-man-lightning-blend-lyrics
WND,Overcast!,1997,"It's summer, and I'm chilling on my steps with my little crew
Just like the videos, just like all the little rappers do
We voice love to the heads we know that walk past
Sunshine and smiling, living out of a shot glass
And I talk fast when it comes to girls
Hey baby I'm just a nut trying to fuck a squirrel
Maybe we could shut the world up
Let some slug into your life
Suddenly she hypes an eyebrow up, like
""What do you mean?"" and I start bugging like
""If I was to follow you home would you keep me
Would you feed me, would you pet me
Would I fuck you till you're sleepy?""
She said I'm creepy, and walked off
Too late, I already got off on the fact you even stopped
You knew I'd treat you like an object
You knew I was a rapper, you knew it was the trend
For us rapper men to disrespect women in front of friends
Nonetheless; here comes that kid Sean that I used to be cool with
Went to school with, now this kid is talking fool shit
Getting supper touchy with his lips about
How I stuck his bitch supposedly
What the fuck is this supposed to be
Sean's got nuts, he's alone, I'm with crew
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
I spew. Look here, this makes believers of cartoons
And I happen to know your bitch sleeps in until the afternoon
Honestly, my man, you don't bother me
Cause Everybody bleeds, now go and ask your seed who his father be

I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""

Now Sean kicked my ass, I ain't gonna lie, ain't gonna laugh
It wasn't fun, but fuck 'em, I'mma get my gun
Shit gets done like that in the world of rap
If they pushing on ya vibe, you just a pussy if it slides
So I sprint up three flights, didn't do the feet wipe at the door
Dragging dirt and blood on the rug, and the wood floor
Couldn't believe my squad just stood there and watched
Word to God, Spawn is telling me to blame it on my cock
I'm amped, and I'mma shoot every motherfucker out there
I'm ill, and I'm gonna prove that shit when I get back downstairs
Into the bedroom, my passion aimed at the closet
Visualizing the top shelf, that's where the shoebox is
I push the top up, enough to fit my hand in
Reach into the box in a frenzy, realizing that it's empty
Hand rests in the box, head festers in an open stun
Then I remember, I don't even own a gun

""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What, (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What, What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What, What Kid What""

Witnesses, bitches and kids fronting to bring their shit
You get nothing from this, write redundant, I leave the dumb shit
I never half-ass, my blast has you overcome with
The basement aroma, should've waited for your diploma
Instead you dropped out, now you grab the microphone to
Let the fox out, I box out this center
Ripping to end your agenda cause I'm the microphone pincher
Since you started rhyming you been barred from flying
Tryna push me to peep, I didn't buy your tape cause pussy is cheap
Pushing me deep, so I brush it to fuck it
You get rusted to rubbish cause my stuff is conducted
On some thoroughness, that ""fuck the world"" shit don't make it happen
You roll without friends and that sure as hell don't attract 'em
The five-man travelling band, I stand sagging my pants
Caramel skin color, the slim brother
I cancel and contort your financial support
A&Rs ridiculed for having thoughts to deliver you
Give your crew brain lacerations
You having dreams about stardom is only fame masturbation
My name has awakened the criterion
So judgement is passed, anybody budges I blast

No excuses, I feel that there's none needed
I know that you resent me cause I study how I'm greeted
I'm quick to touch the mic for the rep and for the loot
I'm known around my village as the mouth that likes to shoot
Now I no longer have time for your irrelevance
Because the ignorance is just as dangerous as the intelligence
It's all about the passage, I'm trying to grasp it
And hopefully my son will forgive me for my habits
I manage to pity those flavorless with shitty flows
Amped off their camp acting out their favorite videos
Save it, give me those trophies you call balls
For my display case, now walk away and save face
Fuck the beef, even you believe it ain't needed
I know that deep down you respect me cause you study how I'm greeted
It's sewing up seams, it's plugging holes
Slug knows it takes more than toy flows and a B-boy pose
See, he keeps it clear and he strikes the fear
And he even caught a Grammy for marketing strategy of the year

The Outernet,Overcast!,1997,"For starters, I contemplated on where to split you
Marked a spot with a dotted line, then ripped you
Used careful procedure, if you listen closely
You can hear the ghostly moans of foes bleeding through the speakers
The voices of various toys who ate the poison
Fucking up the solo juts and the ones that snuck their boys in
Like a free-for-all buffet when my team cultivates a crowd of loose heads
And boosted heads get called and all of them fall this way
Used to be on a mission to destroying emcees' existence
Now I'm tryna build so we can make this shit efficient
Strength is in the mind and strength is in the numbers
Too much sleep, then you slumber
 so we linked the bees and stung you
I brung you three times as much as your fucking idols brought to you
But since you know me locally, you dismissed me as an obstacle
Fuck it, Rhymesayers already got the twin cities locked
Support's overwhelming, ain't no need for you to give me props
(Hook X2)
It's time to reach out, grab the nation and the earth
Let's see where your hearts at, let's put the outernet to work
(Chorus X2)
I spent my whole life working to get to the point that I'm at
So now I spend my time tryna reach my destination
I'll be at the end waiting with my crew for the rest of you
To arrive to shed the destitute mind state supplied by life

He said what? He's telling all of his boys that I can't rhyme
Then I guess the shit's a success if I'm even on his mind
He's doing what? Recording a project? Good, he should be
I'm not impressed, it's obvious y'all never understood me
I dwell in a land of ten thousand Hip Hop fans
And every fan thinks he's an emcee, heads are heavy but they're empty
I dwell in a land of twenty thousand emcees
But only half of them are head influenced, tense confusion stems
Damn, no need to worry about what the next man's doing
That's what keeps you from perceiving what I'm pursuing
Here's a clue and kill your demo, I'm tryna make history
On a bus full of empty seats, now who wants to sit with me
?
In case you're unaware, we've been doing this forever
And ain't damn thing changed, financial status nor the weather
However, lack of cash reinforces passion
Fuck the rapping, man if I was wack, I'd promote ""The Happenings""
(Hook X2)
The difference between the average head and an emcee is effort
Pick a side, either side, let's begin the network
(Chorus X2)
I spent my whole life working to get to the point that I'm at
So now I spend my time tryna reach my destination
I'll be at the end waiting with my crew for the rest of you
To arrive to shed the destitute mind state supplied by life

As an emcee, I run rhymes to distribute the fun times
As a lyricist, I promise to heat up your brain like sunshine
As an emcee, my goal is to make the whole show dope
As a lyricist, I wanna spit that shit that you can quote
As an emcee, I provoke my producer to stroke your spirit
So as a lyricist, I can't be choking on my lyrics
As an emcee, I know the key is originality
And as a lyricist, I command other emcees to respect me
That's it, respect, that's all, in fact the same respect
That I offer to you and your crew after y'all rip the set
I'm just a man, but I roll with others and we've got this plan
To let the voice expand across the tortured land
Education starts at home, six-one-two
From there we roam through headphones coming soon to your war zone
The aftermath, I'll have to plant some gems into your passive ass
Amped to cut trees and branches so ya'll would have a path
The more you feed it, the more it needs to consume
If you're coming through the region, hit me up, we'll rock a room
Let's network, let's work, let's all get work
So we can build the overall network
(Chorus X2)
I spent my whole life working to get to the point that I'm at
So now I spend my time tryna reach my destination
I'll be at the end waiting with my crew for the rest of you

Caved In,Overcast!,1997,"The door opened, in walked my brother
Terrified, teary-eyed, I'm wide open
Only to hear our father died
It's not true, I'm hopin'
I need some air, I'm chokin'
Get me off this ride, where's life goin'?
Feelin' I'm lost, I'm frozen
Suspended in mid-traumatized state
Why I'm chosen for this fate? I don't know
Head shakes back and forth emotional
Unsociable, not speakin'
Remainin' silent, cause I'm weakened
Deep inside I'm freakin'
Want my father back, I need him
Why's God cheatin'?
Takin' half the two that gave me life
My mind replaces thought, now no longer can I sleep at night
Not feelin' right, insecure, now what's my future lookin' like?
Ain't dealt with death before, age 11 and can't take no more
My hands on the floor cause my stomach's feelin' sick and I was mad at the Lord
Because he took him all too quick that day
On his way to pick me up, he never made it
Blamed it all on myself, therefore I dwelled in self-hatred
On a path called destruct, many thought I wouldn't make it
I hate it, the way I feel, but I just can't seem to shake it
Somebody take it away, this mad situation
My world is breakin', and I feel I'm 'bout to cave in

I tried to take it all in
After it all settled I couldn't begin
Accepting you were gone, but understood

Hey dad, I miss you, for every day gone
And for the rest of my life, try to remain strong
Until we reunite, live on, your memory
From the seeds you planted gently
Thanks for being there for me
And all the time you spent with me
Love sent for me(?), if I could only have that day back
To sit down and rap, shoot the breeze and have a chat
But the fact still remains, still later, on the day I have to meet our maker
I write my feelings on the paper, for now
Along the golf course where you once played
I see you as I drive by, I feel you like your presence is there
I stop and I stare, I see the pictures of days we shared
Well aware that you cared, makin' sure I was prepared for life
The hardships, the struggles, the garbage, and the troubles
That come with it, always kept my head lifted
I grip it close to my heart, everthing you taught me
My dad, my hero, you have my love for all eternity",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-caved-in-lyrics

(We did an album, with no stopping
Now were working on another one)

Shit gets tense well before I henceforth
Use common sense and don't bring your ass up north
Built a tall fence, so high you can't see in
Tilt your defense, bitch, you ain't hard you just pretend
The force much too big, so you could never conquer
Fuck you up, kid did, then once more for the encore
I'm much more emcee than you could ever fucking be
And you thought it was you, but I control your destiny
The A-N-T lace a track for murder
Spawn sets the attack with words, the insert blurs the vision
Time for the decision, thumbs up? No thumbs down
You shoulda' known it was us
When you felt the shaking, ground making
Sound waves that pave ways for us to go
It's not who you know, it's what you know
So let it go, I got a lot of angles
Too much for simple minds to count
Yo, you wanna tango? You better off and you just bounce
The last ounce of breath is now left your body
Life now past tense cause your rhyme skills are sloppy
You couldn't stop me, that's what it comes down to
You can't out-rock me, b-boy, muthafucker old school

Grabbed by the shoulders
Ripped in half like the broken flyers to your show
Told ya not to try to flow
Not cause your weak, it's cause your don't freq. the speak
With any type of technique from deep inside
I peeped your vibe, it seems to thrive off the shit of the minute
But I've come to stop the cries, and let my feces fossilize
And when it's hard as a granite rock, rocker was classic as Planet Rock rock
I grabbed your flask of thoughts to make the planet stop stop
Understand the understated, cause it's unnecessary to undermine the underestimated
Underrated, under one nation, of underachievers
Who undercut by fucking under the table, under the nose of unbelievers
With that in mind, how do you find the time to dislike me?
Bitch, give me the mike and I'm a gut you like a Pisces
What's fucked up, is I don't even know you
But we got a track left to kill so I'm a show you
And you can show your whole crew

Every man that escalates is easily erased
And your faculty is a fallacy to my family, that's to your face
I grate the gravel and grass to dig graves for gremlins

Over and over the observations had to open me
Peripheral vision and pitch control to prove the potency

Did you read the rest and did you reach your point of reference?
See now it's simple, call me ""son"", I'll refer to you as ""surrogate""
The turntables turn cause you was tugging on your tourniquet
Underwent the upset and made your whole unit urine
In the vents, sprayed a variety of verbs on the vermin
The weasels, weaknesses was wrecked on a Wednesday
X marks the xenon, be the xenolith on my X-ray

I had the strangest dream last night
I dreamt that we went on the Serena Tour with Peter Frampton and Roxanne Shante
Damn, I pray some day I'll receive my eight CD's for a penny
Or even better any pennies for my CD's that you purchased
So that I can buy more vinyl even though my needle is worthless
To feel that I've got a purpose
The change ups have been disturbing
The aim was broke
But I ain't no joke
Because MC's I chain smoke
See lungs in flames
So I swing with them
But if the mic had no filter it'd kill your central nervous system
The mental serpents rips into your head and words reign loose
Submerged in brain juice get introduced
Here I am
What do you mean my ticket's invalid?
It started off erogenous and now it's getting callous
Instrumentally challenged
It grabs my balance and shakes it
But I take it, I walk through it butt-naked
Eat the tribulations, drink the disconnections
Smoke the defections, over-slept and failed the lessons
Find a friend in Jesus, he turns rocks into bread
But my man Travis did it, now he's locked in the Fed
Where the fuck is the finish line?
Innocence is defined by the black form
And that's why I lack pronunciation
When I walk amongst the fake men that swarm the time clock
Trying to find lunch break

I'm at the end of my rope again (x5)

At the end of my rope again
Searching for patterns in the grey
When my stay reaches finished
Diminished semi-dramatic anticipation is massive
When can I have it?
All of the senses are alert I claim
Towards fear for main courses
Take the tenseness for dessert
The end of my rope again
Victim stands blindfolded on the corner of 24th
And Hennepin I hunt ya and punch ya
Your brains with my bangs
I can never function with toys strictly b-boys
Headshots, vandals graffiti head trip
Had an illest fixation with Edie Sedgwick
But I'm cool now
I fled with my crew now
I keep my flow deep inside my pocket
Cuz' I peep now you lost it
Him who vomits is the one that ate the jizm
So kill the plagiarism
I feel as though I'm swimming in the negative energy
Osmosis used by those with the tools who know how
To render me hopeless
Choked with a tiny opening enabling one last gasp
And one last chance to stir backlash
The end of my rope again
Suspended in mid-atmosphere
God must want me here
Treating the loophole that these birds fly through
Greetings, no
The pupil in my third eye is huge because I'm peaking

I'll hold him tight while he chokes, 8, 9, count to 10 drop the body rip the pockets

Come on, keep up the pace you already won the race
Cute baby hamster let's try to make him run in place
Look at the wounds, it's destined to die soon
And the way I see it, we're obligated to eat it
So treat it, with grins while it's standing on it's last limbs
Feed it to fatten it up for when the feast begins

So when the rain starts they won't be able to read our plans
And I'm compiling a list of demands
So let me get a show of fists and hands to see who's down with the program
Party over here free love, free truth, free care, care free
Bring your whole crew affair
Freedom of speech and thought

It's cool because we died with honor
Comma
Don't worry -honey I ain't goin' hurt you
I'm just trying to strip you of your pride and your gear and your virtue

It's not clear
Proceed with caution
Cause fear, is no longer an option

And maybe, and maybe my issues are not your issues
But everyone has to sleep and everybody carries weight
You can't escape regret, but you might regret escape
If you closed your eyes and held it would you recognize the shape?
Regardless, give my regards
To the inner child that managed to break
Free from the confines of this skull sized cell
The taming of the shrew, the high hopes fell
The shaming of the true made your own private hell
And maybe I'm not here for you to listen to
And I'm not here to steer you just share my vision
Maybe drop a hint or two, maybe a few opinions
Maybe learn from you by watching you and studying your positions
The mission started off as nothing but better living instead of giving truth
Better living was found through keeping secrets
Enlist me as a crunch
Spreading the message of funk
Lettin' the rest of the spunk
Clog their veins with that junk
All limp, swingin' like the willows in the wind
Moving like the mountains when Armageddon begins
Vampires you're all a bunch of demons
When you talk I close my eyes it sounds like your screamin'


I no longer have the patience to deal with most of these patients
Ignore the preferences and relevance to they favorites
I look for love and I identify deceit
Within the facial structure of every human being I meet
I can smell your contempt when you enter the chamber
So I act apprehensive and pretend that there's danger
As I watch from the tower everyone looks like ants
They all scramble to be appears as if as they dance
Well for all of y'all keeping y'all in hell
I'm only tryin' to help peace out to one self
And if I did have a car I would speed down the road
Until I reached my goal or my engine explodes
The glass was half full so I drank it
I got impatient and anxious as I was waiting for the raffle
And when they drew the number it pulled me under
Cause I was sitting on the seven
Which had never made the entrance (x2)

The Ocean,Sad Clown Bad Dub,1999,"Tap tap tap click the globe against the moon
For the next tune we'll let the camera zoom into the bedroom
The more she raises her voice, the less I really hear
The more she leaves the house, the less I spend on beer
All thoughts are clear
Chain smoke a box of Reds
Got to shed this excess gear before we cross this bridge
If we make it to the opposite side of where we stand
We can get some land and make a plan
Woman and man
But your only twenty something are you ready to change?
You've accomplished plenty running
Are you tired? Are you hungry?
Up to no good, but down to try to harder
To depart and sever the old ways of gauging the weather
And when they ask if you treat me right
I have to lie and yes if I'm to answer the question
Here I dance again in front of the mirror, solitaire
Wondering where you are, what's the time, why am I losing all my hair?
If I could cook half as good as you looked
I'd trade in my head phones and my notebook
For all the time you took up to shine
Shook up my alignment, hooked up to silence
Cause these footsteps is my steps

Ok enter mommy's little sociopath
Hoping I have the sober cells left
To taste the smoke on her breathe
Chosen my steps
Prepare to pour an ear fill
Trying to drive her soul
Keep your hands on the steering wheel!
One at nine the other at three
Won't ever find another like she
I call it thief because she took it
Put the key in the hole and started upsetting cruise control
BAM! Hit a tree, my fault I wasn't looking
Distracted, but ain't no body acting surprised
Mapping out a plan to put me back in her eyes
She laid her hand on my thigh
Damn near went blind
And spread my wings to fly and clear my mind
And usually I'm at top of the game
At least I used to be
This is new to me
I can't explain what you do to me
Moving me, seducing me, inducing me, reducing me down
To figuring or not how I can go about improving me
Soon we'll see
This whole world will see this
Superhero features
But girl is the weakness
Speaking to the mirror trying to gather my reflection
Sold my sense of direction for some affection
Now I'm straining, striving, trying to see the ocean
I'm riding, driving, I'm trying to make it to the ocean
Lifting up every shell and holding it up to my ear
I'm trying to hear the ocean, I got to feel the ocean (2x)

Deep within I swim a river of lust
Beginners luck
Rising tide injures the crust
Hunger, feed my need to free my seed
I cry, I bleed, I fly, I flee
I try an be everything to each partner I find
But the bottom line is rain always starts in the mind
I climb inside the rhyme
And riddle the growth of the stone
And sip and swallow her aura
Hit it closer to home
It's a quarter 'til two
I'm still waitin' anxious
Got to surface, the tools, the motivation to paint this
Don't know which colors to use, detail is not my game
So now I’m through differentiating heaven and pain
I'm just another stray cat trying to rest my tail
Prepared to go to war but scared to check the mail
She's a bird with crippled wings
Intrigued by the simple things (you’re too simple, you're too simple)
You can take the bone out the chicken
But you can't take my girl out to lunch without me thinking
Probably something’s up
If you can’t take it with you then fuck it I ain’t going
I’ll just sit here for now and dream about the ocean
Caracoling through this contagious carnival of carnage
Wearing a name tag that says artist
Holding the harness, controlling the motive
Floating the waves
Looking for that ocean
Now I'm straining, striving, trying to see the ocean
I'm riding, driving, I'm trying to make it to the ocean
Lifting up every shell and holding it up to my ear
I'm trying to hear the ocean, I got to feel the ocean (2x)",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-ocean-lyrics
How I Won The War,Sad Clown Bad Dub,1999,"The first time they came to get me for their war
They were easy to play-I acted dumb and grinned
Contrary to what we might assume everybody loves a dummy
Cause you ain't gotta squint when the lights are dim
They read their papers out loud to me
I smiled and nodded my head up and down, careful not to make a sound
They told me when and where I'm supposed to arrive
Never gave a second thought to whether or not I would oblige
I imagined the look on their face as they looked
At the face of their clock, tapping their foot as they wait
How long would it take to realize
I must have skated or got lost on the way before they called it a day
Fuck that, I'm on the other side of the city
In a bed breathing heavy with my favorite Betty
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna catch a slug for you
So I changed my name to Slug so that ya'll would never catch me

The second time they found me they wanted to drown me
Guess man doesn't like being made into mice
Started running their spiel about love and dedication
How I should feel, as if I owe their nation my life
""Look boy"" they say, ""Don't you love your freedom?""
I told them freedom is a road seldom traveled by the multitude
Man I said they were suckers, as I pulled out my mess
And started jerking off right there on top of their desk
Picture this, me standing there, dick in my fist
Like, what what what? Bought to bust on a nut on their list
They cursed and gave me an informal dispersal
But I'm like ""sir won't you let me get my rocks off first yo?""
It's weird how acting like a hype is like being a hype
It's just a thin line that separates the two
And now my mind likes to walk both sides of the stripe
Only I could manifest my fate for the way I do

The third time they came was a charm
And I was tired and tried barely hanging from this yarn
The last two times I lost my path and my mind
What the hell I might as well as loose the farm
Take me, make me, train me, break me
Teach me to hold my anger like a lady
Show me the right way to save these babies
Throw me into this world that hates me
Here I am in a land that don't feel foreign
Following a plan, trying to find my portion
Still lost and still fondling my foreskin
Make me into a man but I still feel like an orphan
But I learned how to stand behind a purpose
The world is a circus and I'm a soldier guarding the tent
Weapon in hand, I represent and defend
My hip hop nation until the end

I pledge allegiance
To the flag
Of the Hip Hop culture's four elements
And to the originality in which it stands
The Zulu nation under god
Peace love unity and justice for all",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-how-i-won-the-war-lyrics
Hungry Fuck,Sad Clown Bad Dub,1999,"I wrote this in Denmark, check
Starin' at my paper like I'm waiting for something
But nothing is going to happen if I don't make it happen
I walk around like I don't know where I am
28 years old, yes, I'm still rappin'
I'm gettin' fed up with American cities
I don't want to pay my taxes
Until they stop killin' blacks
And every woman in my life thinks she wants to be my wife
But that thought only comes when they're layin' on they backs
I don't agree with suicide, but I understand it
There comes a time when you're ready to leave this planet
But dammit, I'm take it all for granted
And I'mma have to die before I every try to land it
And I'm just waitin' for that brain aneurysm
If I get bored, I'mma start my own religion
I'll teach people to worship the drums
And to speak in tongues and no longer will my country eat its young
Oh yeah I got something to say
But nowadays it's a novelty
Like either try to make me smile or try to bother me
If all that you can offer me is apologizes
I probably rather you just pour me a cup of coffee!
I don't know, y'all leaders must of lost me
I gotta go isn't no one gonna stop me?
And if they do I'mma scream ""GET OFF ME!""
I'm gonna take a little nap in this lobby

Do we have anybody hungry in the house? (cheers)

Superman,Sad Clown Bad Dub,1999,"(Yo, what happened to you man?
What, you just woke up like that?
You weren't like that yesterday
What have you been eating?)
And he got bored one day and jumped out of a third story window
Hit the curb in a sprint position (what?)
And that was the first time he found himself different from the rest
Thus began him on his quest for individualism (why?)
He felt he had some big decisions to make
Superpowers can't be all fun and games
Piece of cake in the park under sun rays
I mean wait, he wishes he understood
Wait, hold up, does this mean now
That he's obligated to roam around and do some good?
Maybe he should keep it hidden from his neighborhood
I doubt his girl would even try to comprehend it if she could
And he ain't trying to be nobody's circus sideshow freakshow
Better keep it discrete and hide it from these people
But one day on his way to Falafel King for some lunch
He was approached by these three cats that he'd gotten stoned with once
He cracked a smile, extended an arm to give the first one a pound
Brought the fist down, and sunk him deep into the ground
Whoops, cat's out the pillow sack
You see that puddle?
Well that particular molecular displacement has a mom
Who's gonna want an explanation
As to why her son Jason, her pride and joy
Is now liquid boy dripping down the pavement
Save it
You'd better bolt and hide
Because war patrol gets a hold of your throat you'll probably hope to die
Oh snap, you can fly
It's time to take it to the air
And quit tripping, who ever told you that existence was supposed to be fair?
(Ayo man, why you squish my homeboy, man?
Yo dawg, this kid owed me like ten dollars, dude
Why'd you have to kill him?)
Made it, landed in the backyard
Fast like a track star
The flight was basic
And the landing, it wasn't that hard
Now act smart
Pack the things you need and leave
Say your peace to this diseased place and keep it free
Face the east, spread your wings
Wait, I hear police sirens coming to inquire about the deceased
I wonder if your chest can deflect bullets
Contemplate surrender to escape this excess stress
Bet nobody thinks about the emotional drain
That it takes to have special strengths and advanced brains
And now he's dancing with sanity solo
Trying to hold his inner ground
Devising a rushed blueprint
Blocking all sight and sound
And pictures of all the childhood trauma
All the livelihood, the drama
The time spent wondering, pondering the secrets of imagination
No way could anyone have understood this present situation
Yo mom
If they take me down, believe I'm gonna miss you
And if I ain't around take comfort knowing I went out with a fistfull
I swear it was accidental, I never meant to
It ain't my fault
I don't know how it started off nor how it shall result
But I'll be damned if I give the man the satisfaction of taking down the man who could have taken out that man with all his bastard plans
And at one glance it was romantic if you think
The freak slit his own throat
And bled to death in the kitchen sink

No longer worried about health or wealth
A superhero's true weakness is themselves

That gets caught between my toes of worries and woes
If they would take my hand
Maybe the pains of man
Wouldn't seem like such a bad dream that you can't control
All the thoughts that come
That make you toss your lunch
Every time that you think that you can hold it down
So now I'm off to jump
To bunny hop the bumps
That life sets up to hold my head underground
Cause I move back and forth on a swing set
The scenery stays the same
I ain't learned a thing yet
It comes and goes (and it comes again)
The sun the snow the rain the wind (the wind) and ain't none of it pretend
If I could bend all the barbed wires and bars
I could escape the playpen and make my way toward the stars
Pick up the pieces of broken keepsakes
And sprint across the field until both of my feet ache
I hung from my limbs
Off of the jungle gyms
Until my muscle got sore and my hustle got bored
And when I jumped down to take a look around
The only faces I recognized were the ones I ignored
I took the obstacle course at full speed
Still it's probable that the home team will hold the lead
But if it's possible I request that they let me take a seat
Stop the coach and ask him how I got into the league
It goes six six something miles beneath the surface
Championship
It's the skin verses the shirtless
And I don't know which side I'm supposed to be on
And I can't tell if it's getting closer to dawn
Well excuse me
But I had a rough evening
I was shaken out of my rest when I stopped breathing
Awoken from my sleep awoken from my dreams
Chokin' on my ?
Holdin' on to my screams
And the sea turned blue and the sky turned blue
And when I sing the blues all the lies come true
As we convince each other what's old is now
The books, the rent and the end is overdue
The waiting pool is full of the blood of the unbound souls
Submerge my urges as I plug my nose
And swim laps around the momentary laps of loss
Use a stick to write my name in every line I have to cross
Toss some change into the fountain to make a wish
But most of us are wishing for a little bit of change
Sneak a cigarette break between first and second down
And play match of hind and seek with your heart and your brain
Well olly olly oxen free duck duck gray duck
King of the hill fell off and broke his crown
The neighborhood runt lost his voice from yelling, ""Wait up!""
And the needle ran away with the spoon Hell's Playground

We all, learn to share the same pains

It just taste that way some times
It depends on the angle
On how you read your lines
For every brick we stack to come together to build
There's a sick little crack in this foundation still
Humans! I can't accept them
Trying to understand them
And what fuels them and their essence
I'm looking for some leverage
Catch up, trying to catch me
Curse-ed, depress-ed
Here to make you happy
'Hey daddy tell me why the clown is crying.'
'Well son he's got the task of cheering up the ill and dying
On top of that everybody thinks that he's insane
Can't fathom why he'd wanna ease their pain.'
Walking through this maze made of concrete walls
When you're not allowed to climb there's no way to possibly
Fall
When your hands are restricted to hold nothing but self
How can you get a grip?
How can you pick up what you're dealt?

The ground stays hard
With a couple pounds of migraine, a pocket full of scars
But the face stays painted on for everyone to gaze upon
Continuing the bad dream till he wakes up gone

Would you help him, if you could
One for a walk, but always stood
Would you help him, if you could

Would you help him, if you could
One for a walk, but always stood
Would you help him, if you could
Do they see me?
Do they know that I exist?
I know they do
I can tell by the way they wave their fists
Weirdo. Freak
Words of endearment ring in my ears
And cling onto my tears
My purpose on this earth was to brighten the sun ray
At the circus or parade, house call on a birthday
A bag of balloons, I can build you a farm
Became worthless when they took away both of my arms
Snake charms
Magic tricks
The world is flat
And the traffic is thick
Got my back to the wind as I watch the inhabitants
Every thought I come across is bigger than this planet is
I used to be a normal person
But I held a hunger to experience it firsthand
I wanted to turn every frown upside down
Some how my feet separated from the ground
And the clown stays sad the people stay lost
Nah, the people are sad, we lost the clown
But the face stays painted on for everyone to gaze upon
And it will stay that way until the break of dawn

The River,Sad Clown Bad Dub II,2000,"Verse 1: Slug
It was a purple-purple sky and an orange-orange moon
And everyone was whistling the same damn tune
Except Brian, Brian stared out across the field
And watch the horizon blossom to cop a feel
Over the edge of the world
The one they're all afraid to walk
The rationate for why they're so high on the small talk
But Brian knows where the crows all go
To find the if's, and the and's and the but's and also's
Chorus
If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light
I’d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight
If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock
I’d figure out how to keep Hell off of my block
But as it stands, I stay content
Tryin’ to be the magic man, and pay my rent
Wishing that Brian would turn me on to the secrets he sought
While we keep burning the dawn, just to keep the day hot
Verse 2: Slug
If I could ask you one question, I’d ask where you went
You could teach me a lesson every time I got bent
But the alcohol don’t make me forget about it all
Doesn’t matter the season the leaves can still fall
They slipped hidden messages within the cards that were dealt
Trying to understand myself and all of the sorrow I felt
For as simple as I am how'd it get so complex
Got me studying the margins and disregarding the text
I open the curtains and listen to the traffic go
But I still get nervous each time my piece passes go
The residue is thick and the memory fails
I still laugh cuz the path feels a lot like a trail
Chorus:
If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light
I’d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight
If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock
I’d figure out how to keep Hell off of my block

Verse 3: Slug
We used to be a couple of pimps walking the hallways with pride
Drunk or sober, life was nothing short of rollercoaster rides
Trip to the clubs, nod the skull to the rhythm
All we wanted out of life was what was given
And when you passed I wanted to take back the time we wasted
I'd trade all the buzzes in for one more conversation
We can sit in the shade and discuss the meaning of sacred
Cause I can't see the garden no more, just the aphids
But the wind still blows and the plains still grow
And I wish your name was on the guest list at my shows
I got to believe that you can see me when I find my freedom
Cause you got to meet the sun before you got to meet my son

Protect your jimmy, keep it fresh
Anything is everything and more is less
It's all sight sounds smell taste and felts
Knuckle up and buckle up your safety belt
Lift with your legs, speak with your mind
See the bigger screen, read between the lines
Brush your teeth, squash the beef
Judge the tree by both sides of the leaf
Save your soul, spend your money
Laugh at it's jokes and pretend they're funny
Talk about your goals and hide your wants
Give them something they can hold and get a better response
Believe in karma, truth and honor
Respect the youth and understand the drama
Think about your move before you make it
And see the motive for the info and advice before you take it
Traffic lights and stops signs
Cops and crimes
Top of the line
I lost my mind, I found my feet
Look over my shoulder before I cross the street
Dead zone, when in Rome
I'm begging for attention to be left alone
Headphones in flesh tones
And little Slug was having trouble trying to get home
Write a song, write a million songs
But they all the same song it's like one long song
Fight the wrong and make them sing along
Continue to consume until the hungers gone
Speak your peace and move on, move on
I need to buy time but first I got to find the coupon
When I climb the mountain I'm gonna teach I promise
But for now you can reach me at the office
Get a job, catch a buzz, learn something, cook dinner
Find a mate and Copulate, but try to pick a winner
Go to school, teach something, 
be a voice, paint a picture
Turn the TV off man you don't need a babysitter
Read a book, write a book, plot a move
Take over, watch for motorcycle
Calm down be a donor
Nine out of ten doctors prefer their secretaries
Because they're sick of going home and going down on what they married
Do your homework, solve the problem, celebrate
Tip the bartender, breath and meditate
Oversleep wake up late, push snooze take a bath
When you finish with your drink they let you keep the glass
Skip class, jump curbs, walk the dog
Run slow, leap fates, stand tall
Sit still, take control
Yo you throw like a girl
And you hate the world
And you lost all your nuts trying to chase a squirrel
Some of these cats don't know to meow
I try to open my eyes to take a look at me now
Alphabetize the records that sit on the shelf
I think you need some advice on how to think for self
Aiyo they want the light, but they don't want the light
They act like they don't know wrong from right
They say they want the truth, but they have the truth
They act like they forgot how to move

Who qualifies to try to judge me now
Love is what grows off the synthetic of happiness
I wear a warning sticker that says health to the hazardous
Since all of minneapolis fell into that river
It wouldn't disturb a word that i deliver
I found my confusion
I lost your religion

Corrupt the optimism

Write another piece
Read another book

Do you mind if i steal this pen?
Im not as a bigger fan as i once was
I gotta learn to respect that lunch buzz
Such and such and nothin much
What the fuck girl I'm thinkin that we should couple up
So here i stand from the outside in
Tryin to recall how i swam to this island
I wonder if i was to scream till my voice quits
Would they let me push the buttons
Would they let me hold the joystick
Well maybe if i acted a little crazy
They would play me
They would feed me to they babies
Can't help but laugh at everything i cry about
Cuz ive been staring at myself from the inside out
Well whos that knockin on my head so early in the a.m
Must be the landlord im late on my payment
Or maybe its my ex cuz i owe her some affection
Its probaly the deparment of corrections
Cuz i've been doin it wrong for to damn long
Chewing on a soggy blade of grass
Put the money in the bag and make it fast
Cuz can't none of yall fools save my ass
How can i hold
When i dont know what i hold
The outsider tryin to climb out of the cold
Time and time again
I question the asnwer
Cause the soldeir always falls in love with the dancer

Fashion Magazine,Sad Clown Bad Dub II,2000," (repeated throughout song)
Lady of darkness
Night of my midnight

She flips through the pages of her fashion magazine
It pulls her out of her reality for a moment
We all need our moments
She forgets for a couple of seconds about the hopeless situation
As the plane seems to take all of her focus
Riding that afternoon plane from Dallas back to Minneapolis
Two and half hours, shes out there
Reading some column about spit verses swallow
Everything reminds her of him
And its not fair
How could she fall on her face for some man-child?
Maybe it's his voice, or maybe it's his damn smile
Maybe its the whole package
From the kiss to the mattress
To the sarcastic jokes, to the social status
Maybe it's none of the above
Maybe she only needed somebody genuine to show her love
It was all about the right place at the right time
And even with the drama they find that
He's still always on her mind
Well, nonetheless then two hours before she lands
To put her feet on the ground and take her man by the hand
And this time around when the laugh starts to sting
She'll just take a breath and dig into that

The Pill (Interlude),Sad Clown Bad Dub II,2000,"Intro:
The pill. Fuck it. Swallow it
I stopped reading the paper, quit watchin' the news
Don't answer the phone and I'm payin' the dues
I pace my steps to match the speed of my breathing
Place my bets and keep my feet upon the ceiling
Waiting for the stop sign to turn green
I ain't got time to learn the hardway
I gave candy to the babies, kisses to the ladies
And charisma to the kids playin' down at the arcade
Par-ty
In my think straight type advice
Bake the cake and sink your face into the frosting
Take a break from all the aches and strifes
This pain is just another stain on the box springs
Sometimes I sit outside and watch the people walk by
And try to understand why they don't fly
And other days I lock myself up in my room
And let the four corners close in until I'm consumed
There ain't a whole lot of continuity
And all I want is what I already gave up
I give advice that I don't follow
Cause it's twice as hard to swallow
When you know precisely what the pill is made of
Take the pill. Swallow it",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-pill-interlude-lyrics
When It Breaks,Sad Clown Bad Dub II,2000,"Fill the dream
Fill the description
Kill the steam
Vivid 
Build the team
Assume their positions
Spill the beans
And feed them off my religion
Cook the bird and 
What's absorb rock progress in 
Shook the Earth and rest in peace
I missed the sun
Don't mean to trip
It's just a gun
Let's sink the ship
When it's done we'll be descript
I'll stick my tongue between your lips
Goals, goals and goals down the hill
Souls, they don't know to take the pill
Truth, you don't get it, you don't get it
Move, as I said I was presented
I the more I am the less I be
Try, stole the jam that's more likely
Fly, 
Jump off a cliff
Die after you, get high to live

When it breaks it'll all come together 

Feed her sore, I walked a lot
Popped the floor and talked to god
Stop the bore, go get a job
Give me more don't let it stop
What's my name? well, I'm not sure
Who won the game, who found the cure
I'm not insane, just insecure
I love the pain, it feels so pure
Don't got a car, don't got a wife
I'm not a star, I hate the life
But I work hard all damn night
Take off your bra, turn off the light
No, you don't know
The question go
Destruct them all
The lesson's burned
Unstable purge came to mail
Bricks, order the clutch, keep it tight
Gets, nothing much seek the light
 jump off a cliff
Die after you, get high to live

When it breaks it'll all come together 
Yo
What the fuck is going on?
Where's the break? (Where's the fucking break)
I thought it's gonna break

I rather hear a break than a drum machine
Just in case you are wondering
I am more about the ass than I am the breast
'Cause I put any questions to rest
I listen to Indie Rock, but not much Hip-Hop
Because most rappers suck
I wish they shut up
There goes the trash, put it back in your mouth
Because you don't even know what you're talking about
I rather drink beer than hard liquor
But if the beer's gone I'll share the bottle with ya
And if the bottle's gone I'll probably gonna kiss ya
When you're gone girl, I'll kick it to your sister
You're making me laugh on the inside
Is the sky too high to keep you on your toes?
I rather live to die than dying to live
There not everybody knows

Don’t Ever Fucking Question That,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights
To place you dangerously close to that sun
Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore
And recognize the cause of what's done is done
More than enough to put my name behind my ideals
And neglect my logic twice daily
Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems
When I remember how you used to call me baby
Enough to look in my mirror with detest
For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept
Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth
Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath

I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs
I love you, I love you (faded)
Never, don't ever fucking question that
Don't ever fucking question that

Riding the public transit, I study the blank stares
To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs
I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord
And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord
Single file lines, to give her a pound one at a time
But when I faced her, I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine
I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me
To submission and I still walk with my religion
I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror
Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer
I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin
Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within
For every eclipse that stares at me
From the other side of a paper cup of espresso
I light a match beneath a kettle
And for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program
To seek success, I bleed my ethics out a slow drip
I know a man who met a woman, don't remember where
Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair
She was from the 'burbs, he was from the south side of the city
This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty
Two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town
We all know how people like to get down
Here we go, Aquarius, Pisces
Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul
Push shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain
The magic from up above what it does for the brain
Make the love, paint the picture, write the song
The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, write the song
The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, and write that song
Till the break of dawn

I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-dont-ever-fucking-question-that-lyrics
Like Today,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today
Woke up, got up, near eleven o'clock
Butt naked except I was wearing my socks
And that's cool, cause most the time this floor is cold
Stand up and stretch look around this mess
My place has been a cave since she left me
Make my way to the kitchen, start the coffee
Then dip to the bathroom, begin the triple-s
And wash the previous evening off me
Now out the shower, get dry, shove a q-tip in my ear
Well, what do we have here?
It appears as if a piece of me has got motivation
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little morning masturbation
Fresh, dressed like fifty cents
Clean and awake now I'm ready to commence
Spark up the caffeine and nicotine binge
And that's pretty much the pattern of how the day begins
And I write for an hour, maybe half hour more
Then put on my shoes and grab my key for the door
Put my headphones on for this world I ignore
Trek down the street towards the record store
""hey, bro - how you doing, anything new today?""
""nah man, how you been? it's the same old same again""
Well, then I'll be gone, friend, I'll see you around
And I'm out, destination uptown
In the summertime the women wear a lot of skin
And if I sit in one spot I can take 'em all in
Sometimes I even talk, to see if I can make one grin
If not, yo, it's cool I ain't gonna take it personally
From Anne Landers, to Ani DiFranco to Orphan Annie
I love all women, but most of them just can't stand me
I don't know, maybe it's my hair or clothes
""...or maybe she noticed that you was diggin in your nose...""
Either way it's okay, I wasn't tryin' to get laid
I just wanted to say ""I hope you have a great day""
And then she stopped with a smile that began to blush
""here, take my number, call me up, I'll come over and make you lunch""
I got up and headed down towards the book store
To check the titles, that my man Michael's got me lookin' for
My visit was short, cause I just couldn't feel
That cat behind the counter actin' like I'm here to steal
So I dipped back out into a cloud of tattoos
Pierced body parts and colorful hairdos
And I questioned, did Babylon resemble this?
Are we getting any closer to the end of the list?
A sensuous kiss, placed on apoco-lips
We teach them how to make a fist, but not to resist
And I'm wondering how'd we find this position
But people are people and I still love 'em, especially the women
Onwards to the coffee shop, maybe Muddies(?) for a refill and some
Sociological studies
See the junkies, while they co-exist with the sobers
All the bugging of eyeballs, the shrugging of shoulders
And that's when I saw her, sippin' a water
I wanna kiss her mom just for having this daughter
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to come across strong
But I've been waitin' a while and you've been taking too long
And she smiled and I began to blush
She asked if I'd like to go to the bathroom and make some love
And I got visions of us, and the mirror getting steamed
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream
Woke up, got up, near eleven o'clock
Butt naked except I was wearing my socks
And that's cool, cause most the time this floor is cold
Stand up and stretch and look for my soul
In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today
In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today
In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today
In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-like-today-lyrics
Mama Had a Baby and His Head Popped Off,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"Trying to lift her, pull her

Six, Six, Six in the mornin' and I'm takin' a nap
In the back of the car, waitin' for the stars to snap
The stars on my cap remind me of the time
We went to Fargo, with a car full of anxiety
An angel's breast, and a tank top
She started at my heart, she's trying to make it stop
And if I haven't learned nothin' then I've learned a lot
Mama had a baby and his head popped off
Give it up turn it loose, for the sake of life
If I knew now what I knew then i'd make her my wife
I been chasin' these mics for too long
Debating with God bout who's right and who's wrong
Got a new song to sing, a little happier, hurtin'
That I didn't learn the words until after
The fact of the matter is a matter of fact, I doubt that
I'll ever even try, to work it out to having her back
Use to skip classes, now I skip breakfast
Never skip practice and I need to flip the mattress
To help me forget the kiss, the lips, the soft
Mama had a baby and his head popped off

Mama had a baby and his head popped off
We did all that we could to try and re-attach it
I couldn't do it so I picked it up and threw it
Off the building, just to see if all the children
Were quick enough to catch it

So I'll tear down these walls, let the chips fall
Let's all go outside and play a game of kick ball
Laugh a little, and live a lot
She squeals and giggles when I hit that spot
If you give me a minute and I can finish my beer
And move a tad bit closer to the limits of here
And when it gets clear, and the sun comes back
We can drive too fast, we can fly off the tracks
Tuck in your shirt, hike up your skirt
Welcome to the jungle where the tigers give birth
I only took my time because she looked so fine
And it makes me crazy trying to pay em no mind
You should save your spine and stay on the struggle
Shoot the trouble and keep the temper subtle
My rent just doubled, because they took my roommate
And I'm keepin' these movies cause they all past the due date
Close, cover, before striking
Lick a missile at the bird and try to cripple it's right wing
And I end every sentence with a dot-dot-dot
Mama had a baby and his head popped off


Say out loud, we must network
Should have been, more specific
Now have this, daily pressure
Some of them, just don't get it
Leave me at, the beginning
Start over and do it well
Shut my trap, stop complaining
Stay sober and step on shells
My oh my, yours oh yours (oh yours, oh yours)
And when it snows it pours
And when I'm running out of fire I just open the doors
And go sit on the porch and watch the neighborhood wars
But I've got the sun, and I've got my son
And I've got my will to run until I'm dead and done
And this is for the love we found and the love we lost

Party for the Fight to Write,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"Hides the eyes beneath the bill of the cap
Walks amongst the flies that hover over the mat
He lies, but only when there's a reason
Measures life by the tragedy, the comedy, the season
Poor at handling and managing income
Got enough love to pass around and then some
Been done, that there a name you can trust
Read the whole match book and put a flame to the brush
Good with pets, and rips up sex
Put the show in biz, try to give what you get
When you let him run free with the thought
Pull the line in, try to see what you caught
I ain't all that bad, but I ain't all that great
I went back to the lab and began to mutate
Wait. I still look the same, still got the same dumb name
Ain't a damn thing changed
But if you like surprises, I know of a party
Where they all dance around to your heart beat
Bring your own agenda and embrace your flaws
Lets put a face on this common cause

And he said some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, and write on
Stay gold, Ponyboy, stay true outspoken
Make a record Mr. Gangster and get 'em all open
The theories, the stories, the truths, the myths
Its all therapy, on top of turntable riffs
This indutry's big, so big, in fact
We can all get some, and we can give some back
And if its done correct, we'll make more than noise
So pick it up, and pick me up when you're bored with the toys
As a child hip-hop made me read books
And hip-hop made me wanna be a crook
And hip-hop gave me the way and something to say
And all I took in return is a second look
Son, you're shook, cause ain't no such thing as half way there
Getting good at actin' like you just don’t care
The circle of life, tryin' to make it square
Conditionin' self to sit still and stare
Oh where have all the sheep gone…
Burnt down the farm and turned the TV on
John Coltrane, Marvin Gaye and Bob Marley all get invitations to my party

And if I spent anymore time inside my head
I'd probably need some leather straps attatched to my bed
And if I go another day without eating a meal
I'm gonna show you what it means to keep it real
And if they keep shooting guns up and down my block
I swear to God I'll be the first one to call the cops
And if I gotta hear that song ever again
You're gonna have to share some of that beer, my friend
They mistake me as happy-go-lucky
Just another base-head bobbin' nobody
But from where I stand, they sound like spies
Fillin' all the children's heads with lies
Well alright, get your money right
But right now tonight I want you to pick a side
So when you got your power and you got your cheddar
Let's get together soldier over throw this hold and make these roads better
Bring it on (right now)... He said, ""Bring it on"" (right now)... he looked you in the eye, and he said, ""Bring it on"" (right now)
Ain't nothin' but a party y'all... let's get it on",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-party-for-the-fight-to-write-lyrics
Tears for the Sheep,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"A city of fools
I wanna bash whoever's responsible for this incomprehensible lack of passion
The sucker's been seduced down to the stick
And the peasants fill their bellies with the poisons you omit
I've come to separate the heads and shoulders
Of these tracing paper soldiers
That have been designated to take it over
I'mma roll a couple of boulders off the cliff
On the road below (look out below)
Cause I don't know what I'mma hit (yeah)
I live by the word until I die by your sword
Even when I'm dead my head will live inside your RCA cords
I wait for the right time, but it resembled now-a-days
Descended on the Earth to put an end to all your holidays
The assassin covered in plain clothes
Smothered the sunlight and set flame to your rainbows
And then came the storm (and then came the storm)
Bewildered those that didn't contemplate
Fake disguised as the norm (as the norm)
And when the smoke evaporated and the damage was accessed
The casualties were counted as they looked upon the mess
As they focused their eyes on the horizon, who'da guessed?
All that stood on top the hill was number seven silhouette

(And with this) head splitting tears, cement breaking
Weeping for these people walking in their sleep
(these people walking in their sleep)
My talk is not as cheap
And my thoughts are not as deep
As the day I woke up to discover I lost my sheep
Head splitting tears, cement breaking
Weeping for these people walking in their sleep
(these people walking in their sleep)
My talk is not as cheap
And my thoughts are not as deep
As the day I woke up to discover I lost my sheep

They say a picture's worth a thousand words
Well I beg a thousand pardons for each word I've used for personal gain
But the letters that float through my head to mold my sentences
Could never be contained by a simple picture frame
For every intoxicated moment, I hate life
I strive to balance my aura by dancing with the light
And sometimes it's difficult to stay quiet
I fight it, each time I find myself walking across your eyelids
Wishin' the malnutrition, the imagination of yours
Could see the truth you breathe through each one of your pores
And now the days are drastic, the nights last forever
Wanna tear this motherfucker up and put it back together
I'd like to ask the cats that act like they might hear
If you spent the energy I've spit, trying to count the tears
One of these days you're gonna climb the tallest building of all
Give a warning to those below and let the tears fall

(And with the) head splitting tears, cement breaking
Leaping for these people walking in their sleep
(these people walking in their sleep)
My talk is not as cheap
And my thoughts are not as deep
As the day I woke up to discover I lost my sheep
Head splitting tears, cement breaking
Leaping for these people walking in their sleep
(these people walking in their sleep)
My talk is not as cheap
And my thoughts are not as deep
As the day I woke up to discover I lost my sheep

Nobody sees 'cept my mirror on the wall

The damage...overseen by anyone that comprehends
The anguish...felt only by the ones that invest
The language...was primitive, the listener complex
And everybody was trying to define success
All the self-proclaimed prophets dressed up to look like poets
Pretending to be martyrs that they're not
You can learn all their names
And ingrain them on your brains
Memories so you can spout them off the top (spout them off the top)
Yo kill 'em all, and let God give 'em haircuts
The flood has begun, and no one has been paired up
So I'mma take a second and beckon the downfall

They’re All Gonna Laugh @ You,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"You'd better find a way, you'd better do it soon
It's like the middle of May and you've only got 'til June
And if I'm forced to watch you touch that torch to that spoon
Even one more time, I swear to God I'm gonna implode
Sky's too high to hold; too thick to pet
So fold up your two-bits and hide 'em in your wallet
In your pocket full of trauma, in love notes you wrote to the angels
Gathered around the pole, crude and star-strangled
The banter; married in the bed made from propaganda
I've roamed the avenues of humility
And I've kept a toothbrush in the glove compartment
Next to the napkins
For when I'm finally privileged and touched with a permanent address
And I'll be relaxed after this gin and tonic
And I'll bless your track after the impact of a comet
And I'll pay the mortgage after I'm finished paying homage
I promise, consider it accomplished!
For every cigarette butt that's tryin' to climb out of my ashtray
Signifies another phase in this cascade
The great mind, great migraine
We think it's difficult enough to just live, much less gain
Well I put my two bucks on the table just like the sign says
Proceeded to ask God to give me one good reason why we shouldn't perish
She says as careless as we are, unstable as we seem
""Selected few of y'all have found something to cherish.""
I countered that, maybe just to be argumentative, I don't know
But I was like ""Yo, can't we spare the ones that are worth it?""
She's like ""No. I need the comparisons.""
I think she could tell by the way I'm responding that I'm getting a little nervous
So I went far left and just said thank you
Thank you for the time, for the mind
For the breath, for the flesh
Thank you for the quest, thank you for the vision
This vision that spawns anxiety trying to see and feel why I'm living
Time is money, every moment is costly
So I ration emotion because existence exhausts me
Oddly enough, I'm happy I ain't famous

I bet god thinks you're amusing",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-theyre-all-gonna-laugh-at-you-lyrics
It Goes,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"Now, when you come to apply for a job
Don't tell 'em you're homeless
Cause I promise they won't hire you
And if they like your songs
Just nod your head and play along
Never tell 'em what inspired you
I bet my fans know me better than my friends do
Because my friends don't pay that much attention
The fans memorize every single sentence
Which makes them far too smart to ever start a friendship
I need to start writing pieces about other people's problems
Cause the strangers are starting to get worried
I'm in a hurry to try to slow the system down a bit
And find happiness before I hit thirty
OK, OK, I've said too much
I wear my heart on my sleeve
When all I need to do is write a hit
Somebody shoulda showed me how to shut up and breathe
Cause there's a time and place to bite your lip
It goes peace to Fobia
For the boots made for walking
Now if only Best Buy could break me off with a Walkman
Everything would be fine
I could spend time smiling
Instead of pulling a sad clown around this island
I've got no suggestions
Well, maybe one: Leave my type alone
When you decide to touch that microphone
See, me and you
We're on different pages
We're in different stages
We've got different flavors
I'mma let you do your thing
Just as long as your thing
Ain't got a single thing to do with me and what I'm trying to bring
But if my name crosses your lips
You better guard your tongue
Pardon me, give me my respect, and keep it all in fun
If I had extra time I'd walk around and shake everybody's hand
Like, ""How you doing my man?""
But I'm not allowed
I'm trying to beat the clock now
So I'm out, right after I rock this crowd

It goes: ola ola olaaa (yeah)
Ola ola olaaa (2x)

It goes: 
one two three four five
Six seven eight nine ten
And all I ever wanted out of live was rhymin'
Either from me or an innocent bystander
I wasn't that picky, just give it to me quickly
Whatever it takes, to cook these cakes
You wanna hear your voice but don't know nothing 'bout the breaks
And it's obvious you haven't found your place
Got me askin', 'Who is he?""
""How did he end up in my city?""
I'm the crocodile that the trucker tried to wrestle
I'm the main ingredient from yesterday's special
Close the hole and push that level
I'll chop the head off the devil and I'll throw it at you
And I'll be damned if I ever climb another tree
From here on, the squirrels and birds can come to me
From sun to sun and from she to she
(Girl, they call me Slug, do you wanna make love?)
Now all the leaders in the place, throw your hands in the air
All the feeders in the house, throw your hands in the air
All the thinkers here tonight, put your hands in the air
Anybody we forgot, you can stand there and stare
Yeah, you remember, tracksmart, off to a bad start
The weight I used to carry got buried in the backyard
Caught between a scotch and a cinnamon Pop-Tart
The bell doesn't work, foo, you better knock hard
Line by line, I'm doing fine
I design my mind for my time
And when my kind does leave behind
They'll find that I was the one that died trying
I would never trade the way I am for the way I'm not
My crew is kinda popular, we get to play a lot
And my son thinks that I am the coolest thing in the world
Cause he's still too young to fall in love with girls",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-it-goes-lyrics
Homecoming,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"...Little boy can't seem to find your place now
...All your funny friends, the ones who have shitty jobs

Sometime in NY, perhaps in the 
Decepticon era
Like seven or eight grades up from fitting blocks together
Graf kids after school to get chased by rival letters
And skate boards and truck cars and rails
Funny shapes of grip tape
I own a Mark Rogowski, I rode it goofy footed
Sicker, I learned to ollie on colt four-five malt liquor
And that's it, to me it got not any more acrobatic
Who would pedal around Manhattan, for lack of better action
One kid is the point man at Pakistani bodega
He sold those loosey camel unfiltered to under-agers
Smoke 'em on a promenade, water balloons drop
Hit car, run from cops, skate quick
Basically loaf on the low 
On the laugh with dangerous, nearly vacation
Under the Brooklyn Bridge, across the Brooklyn Bank, show up uninvited
Some kids are drinking beer tonight they're excited
Brooklyn Tech., Brooklyn Friends
Stuyvesant plus rich kids, thug wannabes, and hippie chicks found some escapist shit
We felt the separate fashions and cliques trading places
We formed our own section comprised of 
Nike Uptowns
Worn on mediocre skaters, it's like this:
Yo, this kid Ivan made the trek from Rhode Island
From plastic cup of cold duck and a relaxed social environment
He jetted from his section when the meat heads started whilin'
His aesthetic wasn't their style, so they used bats to re-design it
 (El-P)
Homecoming, (Homecoming)
Homecoming, (Homecoming)
(Sometimes it was good
Sometimes it was just a moment of vis-a-vis the definitions
And other stimulus that cause your growing)
Homecoming, (Homecoming)
Homecoming, (Homecoming)

Sometimes I was good and other times contradicted
But no matter where I stood, I still managed to stand
The last time I laughed this hard I was a child
It was the kind of giggle that would make a young mother smile
I can't remember the ""Why"" but the wallpaper patterns
Had me running in circles trying to defend my Saturn
Just me and my box of Makaveli and cheese
All I really want to do is show you my disease
She didn't have the courage to kiss me goodnight
But I'mma give you my word that everything will be alright
Like, what the fuck?! This phone is disconnected
Just my luck, I need advice before my love gets misdirected
Guess it's just another symptom of, just another victim of
The warfare and those caught between Sean and the Slug
Did I mention the drugs that used to make her spew forth
Carried barely half the pleasure of a pack of Newports?
Breathe it in, breathe it out, what'd it really be about?
I'm trying to lose and allude all excuses to scream and shout
For every moment I spent wishing my parents back together
Would've been better linked to preparin' me for the weather
Rocking my t-shirt that reads ""Whatever""
All in an effort to relieve the pressure
That Minnesota good sleep
This wood is cheap, and now fire's back in style
If I had better teeth, I would try to crack a smile
Well, here I am, Mr. Typical
Ridiculously meticulous when painting pictures of pitiful
And little did I know and less did I care
They would chew up an swallow all that I threw out there
""It's not fair,"" screams the one without a voice
Arm that boy, tell him to aim at the ones that got all the toys

Homecoming, (Homecoming)
(Sometimes it was good, and other times contradicted
But no matter where I stood, I still managed to stand)
Homecoming, (Homecoming)
Homecoming, (Homecoming)
Sometimes it was good
Sometimes it was just a moment of vis-a-vis the definitions
And outer stimulus that cause growing

There it is, is that what you want?

Is that really what you want?
I'm coming home, is that what you want?",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-homecoming-lyrics
Lost & Found,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2001,"To my surprise, discovered that I really don't know much
Most of much of what I know catches a (what?) (3X)
(what are you doin?)

Runnin' from the law, not my favorite hobby
I'm relieved that I saw the speed trap before he saw me
I don't need another ticket, I've gotta collection in the glovebox
They make great souvenirs cause they weigh less than rocks
Man you better slow your roll, let the numbers get low
Like a 55 stroll to move past the patrol
Hope he don't already know about my top speed
Like the helicopter radar that caught me outside of Milwaukee
I'm still livin this life, tryin to escape the problems
Quick and quiet at night just like the insects and the goblins
It's the gas fumes, the fast food, yo its all of the above
It's meetin' women for a weekend and fallin deep in love
As good as it gets, and its as bad as you make it
But ain't nuthin' like bathin' in a freezin' river naked
And I really don't know much but I know enough to know
Now that I'm lost I've never been so found... (so in touch)
Take this job and give it to someone else
Corn on the cob is better when its hot with melted butter on top
Could warm the soul, but this ones cold
Cause I stole it off the side of the road
I'm not a real thief, I don't steal more than I need
Everything I take I eat, I never do it for the greed
I'm just a gravel trail type of man
Pull the car behind the brush and get in touch with your farm land
So if and gotta healthy lookin' garden in your backyard
I'll pull over to admire then I'll check for a dog
And if the area is clear I'll be back here tonight
Set dinner for one under the moonlight...

Discovered that, I really don't know much, most of much of what
I know catches a, ""what?"" to my surprise (X2)
In the moonlights when to strike, under the stars gettin' ours
There's a breeze every night
Carrots, tomatoes, green beans, cabbages, rhubarb, cauliflower, corn, radishes

Here it comes, here it is, and there it went, sunrise
Alright, now its time to get on witcha life
Loaded up the Ford, with all the rations supplies
And hit the road to fly the friendly skies
It's been about a month since I left St. Paulie Girl behind
Punctured the heart but it was for her own good
Left her sittin' in the kitchen with the breakfast dishes
And gave a name to this distance that she never would've understood
Roll the window down, got the sounds distortin'
And I got my last paycheck and half a carton of Newports man
And I'm never gonna quit 'til I face my challenge
And I use your mathematics just to average my gallons
And if you buy my tape it puts work on my odometer
10 bucks'd take me 300 kilometers
Runnin from myself won't stop until I pop
So keep an eye open for me at your local record shop

To my surprise
Discovered that
I really don't know much, and most of much of what I know catches a
What?
And I found myself, when I lost myself (until fade)",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-lost-and-found-lyrics
Scapegoat,Overcast!,2001,"It's the caffeine, the nicotine, the milligrams of tar
It's my habitat, it needs to be cleaned, it's my car
It's the fast talk they use to abuse and feed my brain
It's the cat box, it needs to be changed, it's the pain
It's women, it's the plight for power,
 it's government
It's the way you're given knowledge, slow with thought control and subtle hints
It's rubbing it, it's itching it, it's applying cream
It's the foreigners sightseeing with high beams, 
it's in my dreams
It's the monsters that I conjure, it's the marijuana
It's embarrassment, displacement, it's where I wander
It's my genre, it's Madonna's videos
It's game shows, it's cheap liquor, blunts

It's angels, demons, gods, it's the white devils
It's the monitors, the soundman, it's the motherfucking mic levels
It's gas fumes, fast food, Tommy Hil', and mommy's pill

The list goes on and on and on and on
It's all according that life on a whole
It's in the water, it's in the air, it's in the meat
It's indirect, indiscrete, inconsistent, incomplete
It's in the streets, every city and everywhere you go
In every man it's the insanity, the fantasy, the casualties
It's the health care system, it's welfare victims
It's assault weapons

it's television religion

It's cops, police, pigs with badges, guns, and sticks
It's harassment and a complex you carry when you're running shit
It's wondering if you get to eat, it's the heat
It's the winter, the weather
It's herpes, and it's forever
It's the virus that takes the lives of the weak and the strong
It's the drama that keeps on between me and my seed's mom
It's that need to speak long, it's that hunger for attention
It's the wack, who attack songs of redemption
It's prevention, It's the first solution
It's loose, it's out for retribution
It's mental pollution, and public execution
It's the nails that keep my hands and feet to these boards
It's the part time job that governs what you can afford
It's the fear, it's the fake
It's clear it can make time stop
And leave you stranded in the year of the snake
It's the dollar, yen, pound, it's all denominations
It's hourly wages for your professional observations

1597,Overcast!,2001,"Henceforth, step within my psychoanalysis
Callouses upon my mind make me strain for my lines
Out I ripped it squeezed the brain, it made some liquid
Drained it in a cup and then I sipped it
Atmosphere, the mic let me clutch it
Thoughts take flight so fit Slug in your pipe and take a puff kid
Fuck it, I heat it like a tea pot, steam hot
Upon the roof shoot a marble with the verbal slingshot
Take aim, here I came, I'm the same
Back in '86, I'da tag my name upon your window pane
Stained the mind, a deep shade of residue
Voices within the head make choices multiple
Multiply Spawn, Slug a little buzz
And Atmosphere the scuds, cause here comes the judge
Blasted, so pass the kid a mic so we can paint this
Image of the gifted-anxious, to flip the language
It's the noun meltdown from the outer-shell
Now smell the burning flesh fresh from the hell-bound
And come on down here, this mind path, I'm half-
Mathematic Atmospheric staff with the rhyme craft
Comin' to capture, your after-laughter
While I'm hanging from this rafter, I have to rip this rapture
Cause the cramps in my stomach, dismantle
When I tamper with your amplifier, you damn-you die
Why try? The sky presents an eternally unfolding spectacle
One moment puffs of cumulus clouds skidder across it
And next a billowing thunderhead
Perhaps ten miles high looms over the horizon
Probing the structure of the sky
Why try?

Cause I can read an emcee from front to back
From the cover to the classified, I've pacified
My mind with my rhyme skills, I climb hills
And leap, foolish twitch with a single bound
Sending tingles down your spine, designed to swing a pound
This ax handle tripled, inch spike protruding
From the tip of my mic distributing fuckin' headshots
Shots to your head, now you're knee-deep, you need sleep
As you trudge through the sludge and the slugs and the bird shit
We swarm with the bees and diseases
And even if your deejay was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids
I swarm with the bees and diseases
And even if your deejay was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids

Yeah muthafucker, you know who you fuckin' with
You know what kind ass whooping comes with this
You whole crew could get some of this
You whack-as-fuck kids is what the subject is
Roughnecks live, for only a second
Then they give. Oblivion's what you've stepped in
Your reps token, should have been lookin'
I'm sick of you bitch-ass crews when
You tried take what's not yours but you couldn't
Take mine, your fake rhymes, spit them you shouldn't
What will it be now, another victory
Yo who will it be now, it's Spawn that emcee
Complete, a true champ, stamped that on my essence
Amped shootin' presence, fattenin' each fuckin' sentence
When it's time, then it's time to go
That's what I know, be rippin' mics at every show we flow
But who's got my back though?

Between the Lines,Sad Clown Bad Dub,2001,"(What it is, it ain't, and what it ain't, it is
It's the theme of where we're goin')

See the police man, notice the lonely man
How do you think he keeps his head on straight?
Can you feel his rhythm? What do you think he visions
When he squints at the line from behind those shades
Feel the summer's crest, overdressed
So much sweat, his skin begins to chafe
It's the surface wet, the nervous mess
Overbearing and jaded from carrying the weight
Irritated and constipated
And its all covered, player hated, funneled and consolidated
Into the shell of one man with a gun
Riding that thin line between the program and the sun
And I don't hate you, I'm trying to relate to
Wishing you could find a trap door to escape through
But if I see you as a threat to my seedling or my sibling
I'll die to pull the plug on your machine

And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill somebody

Can you see her?
She spends her whole day in a theater
Living her time in the life that she would prefer
And she stirs nothing, comes and goes she wishes
Surroundings oblivious to her whole existence
But if they only knew
About the thoughts that she can't seem to stop from coming through
Coming across
At a loss for dialogue
Walking through the fog
With her eyes closed and her mind gone
And now she lives in the films that she sees
And daydreams that she kills us repeatedly
I'm impressed with the tolerance she brandishes
If it was me, I would snapped from the sheer overanxiousness
I'm waiting for the day she strolls through Muddy Waters
And slaughters sons and daughters and bloodies mothers and fathers
Lovely little case study castaway cutie
Masturbating in back of that matinee movie
And someday, one day, when the credits roll
She'll hold a pocket full of gunplay for the ignorant souls
Then we'll know to what death awake touch the sleep
Make me walk the thin line between shallow and deep end

And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill somebody (myself)

He used to write his rhymes and recite his lines all the time
Sometimes he'd make them up right off the top of his mind
After doing shows for years, getting respect from peers
Killed the ego, looking at these people like they're weird
Road trips, turned into head trips
Became a hunger for sedatives and eccentric etiquette
Optimism needs to feed off self-esteem
But it seems that he doesn't see it, hasn't felt a thing
Records sell well, but still underground
Travels town to town
Holding hands with fans that love his sound
When it comes around let's hope he can enjoy it
Don't slow down momentum, afraid he might destroy it
When he stops to shake the hand, I doubt they understand
That here now stands only the shadow of a man
Having a hard time with life on a drumroll
Walking that high-wire, passing it off as humble
But it's a thin line, between screams and smiles
Seen the miles, wishing he can go home and read to his child
But tonight's the last day, put the butt in the ashtray
Locked the door and slit both wrists backstage

Encore, ignorance wrapped inside of innocence

I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping razor
, I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin' my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies
Oh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird
And if you didn't hear, then fuck what others heard
I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I don't like you, I just don't want to speak
You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live, 'cause God loves ugly

God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage - ""Who is it?""
My name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other, so they can steal each others' sound
If it's all about getting down, with the get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in its simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest
Measurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin' short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly

God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Why scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen
Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams
I'm rolling with the brights on
Scared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with
Paranoid, walking around, careless
No wonder you're in love with your therapist
Go to sleep my little time bomb

God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Fuck You Lucy,God Loves Ugly,2002,"It - leave - never - would - you - you - show - could - I - if

She say that she still wants a friendship
She can't live her life without me as a friend
I can't figure out why I give a damn to what she wants
I don't understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like
Is about you and how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you, I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what I showed you, how you could leave it
A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent
If I stay around I'm bound to break resistance
Fuck you, Lucy, for defining my existence
Fuck you and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad with a part-time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother, I digested her pain
And vowed no women on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And I travel with feel, so I can deal with touch
It's like that, thank you very much, fuck you very much

(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Fuck the 'What happened?' I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck, used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I want to stand on top of this mountain and yell
I want to wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star-fighter was wounded, time to give it up
On a pick it up mission, kept it bitter
Gettin' in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled
Cookies for the road, took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder
Interpret the eyes, read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?
Fuck you, Lucy, for leaving me
Fuck you, Lucy, for not needing me
I wanna say fuck you because I still love you
No, I'm not okay, and I don't know what to do

(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Do I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed
Every action has a point, five points make a fist
You close em', you swing em', it's hurts when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits
I got an idea, you should get a tattoo that says warning
That's all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left
And save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream, ""Fuck you, Lucy""
But the problem is I love you, Lucy
So instead I'ma finish my drink and have another
While you think about how you used to be my lover

(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Modern Man’s Hustle,God Loves Ugly,2002,"The first time I met the devil was at a Motel 6
She left hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About 5 foot 5, big and thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands, and long hair
I said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

Who cares what Jane says? She always spits the same spit
I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion some how she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling, but she'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the grey matter
Little baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lucid dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

Hush little lady don't say a word
Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let them know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)
I'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The modern man's hustle I dig it, I shuffle
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (it's coming down)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She looks at the mirror, she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest, speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest, before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position
And if you didn't know, you better listen (you better listen 'cause)

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you

Lovelife,God Loves Ugly,2002,"Individually wrapped, placed in neat little rows
Becoming a piece, of everything that grows
Some numbers, a name, to indicate you played the game
Came empty handed and left the same
A soul is a soul, and a shell is a shell
The border in between is full of everything you felt
Some cling to a cross because they're tired and lost
They leave it up to the weather to measure the cost
And every time I look within I recognize the darkness
Familiar to the image of the artist
Staring at the bathroom mirror in a stranger's apartment
Can't remember her name, don't remember how I got here
But here I am, thinking about death again
Humbles out the stress, helps the breath get in
I need to check my friends as well as my next of kin
To let them know I love them all to the end
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve, to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream ""Love your life!""
Love your life, quite cliche but I guess that's me
A ball of pop culture with some arms and feet
As discreet as I've tried to keep the drama and cancer
It's no secret I hunger for someone to feed the answers
I never expected a bowl of cherries
I'm just a Virgo trying to find my own version of the Virgin Mary
And when I let them carry me to a cemetery
I wanna be buried with a pocket full of clarity

Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius

Let no tears to fall from none of y'all
Just remember it all, the beauty as well as the flaws
L-O-V-E L-I-F-E
Here lies Sean, finally free
And as I look across the sea I smile at the sun
While it feeds the weeds the nutrition they need
The people still breathe, the city still bleeds
I'm going to love it to death and keep planting my seeds
I'm going to love it to death and keep an eye on the seeds
I'll be in love till im dead, I keep reaching the seeds
I'll give all I got left just to teach you to read
Love life to the death and keep planting my seeds
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve, to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream (Love your life)

Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius

Swimmin' in a bottle of imposters
Losin' my ground in the name of takin' it farther
We can thumb wrestle or we can make a daughter
I thought it was supposed to get easier when you worked harder
Stole the city, I still feel helpless
Baited the hook and caught me a selfish
I'm gonna gut it, clean it, cook it, feed it to a she
And see if I can get her to need me

And now I'm standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue

All it takes is a stroll down the street
A pro and he greets a new soul he'd like to meet
Showed you the beating of the artery he keeps on the end of his sleeve
As he pretends he can breathe
Lend me a piece of your superiority
I feel alone on this mission, I'm wishin' there was more of me
A pair of me, apparently I'm a parasite caught inside a paradox
A paradise, a parody, the hair police have got what you need
For you to get over me and move on with Godspeed
I'd let it all go and break eggs for a livin'
If I wasn't so conditioned to just take what I'm given
Get it, got it, catch it, caught it, and lost it
Yet I can't stop it, it's embedded in my optics
Plus the frustration is a product of the gossip
If you can't walk away can you at least change the topic?
Overextended the amount of time allotted
Broke the engine, I don't know, cracked the block
Now I'm standin' at this gravel roadside festival
And I ain't tryin' to move cause this view is incredible

Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue

Fall in love with all of she (Fall in love with all of she)
Hasn't stopped callin' me (Hasn't stopped callin' me)
Message in a bottle (There's a message in a bottle)
And I stepped inside a pothole (I stepped inside a pothole)
Somehow forgot my name (Somehow forgot my name)
Blew out the flame (She blew out the flame)
A means to an end (A means to an end)
Can't even be friends, it's a song about a friend
She's still in my dreams (She steals all my dreams)
Angel spread your wings (Angel spread your wings)
Tryin' to comprehend (I'm still tryin' to comprehend)
Can't even be friends, it's a song about a friend

All together...(Crowd: WHOOO!)
Smile while you do that shit, you know what I'm saying?
Cause like some of ya'll, if you ain't smilin' you're ugly I swear to God
Alright,  some mean mugs
Alright, on the count of three. 1. 2",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-a-song-about-a-friend-lyrics
Saves the Day,God Loves Ugly,2002,"From the fifth floor I schedule my meeting with the moon
Stress, let it go so it don't completely consume
When the vegetables bite back, and the grass starts to sting
I yell up to heaven to get me the hell out of this dream
I fell out of my stream of self-consciousness
And I got welts on my mind to signify all my accomplishments
No matter whose math you use to count the dead
Progress will never rest, in the hand that has no head
Bought my brain a cane and asked it to be my pimp
You know, to make sure I don't get stuck up in my fuck ups
A little overanxious I was, to bust nuts
And find the answers making love
Out of a canvas full of touch-ups
I dip my brush into the what I've wept for
And wonder out loud as I can, how long I've slept for
I should rob a pet store, let the dogs wild
I should close all the schools just to make the kids smile
Seize the limit, let the sky be the moment
Put the key to the ignition, I'ma ride these donuts
And when it breaks, lock the door, walk away
Won't be nothin' else to talk about, nothin' else to say

I'm just waitin' for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin' for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin' for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin' for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
See I'm just waitin' for the moment, I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin' for the moment, I can break away

Let's stand on the corner, throw rocks at people
So there's no surprises, written off as evil
I sleep next to women that I don't deserve
They like to hurt my pride, while I work their nerves
Once upon a time, it was worth it
When the urges get fed
And the purpose finds a path to the surface
Is respect considered a breakfast food?
I'm guilty of the type of attitude that wrecks your mood
The truth can be pain, and I hate to do it
Either face the music, or get away from me stupid
Super glue it down, now it better not move
See I'm not the best, but I'm in the top two
And I'm not that friendly, when this cup is empty
It's a side effect from trying to find the fucks that sent me
See I didn't just happen, I was made this way
By the same egomaniac that paved this way

See I'm just waitin' for the moment, I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin' for the moment, I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day

See I gave up lying, but I still tiptoe
I'm as stubborn as they come, and I'm known to hit low
If I had a chisel, I would carve out a hole
For me to hide in every time the mighty wind blows
Since no one knows where the hell we gonna go
I'ma stand right here, until the end of the show
I'ma clap my hands, so don't pass the chance
To unsnap my pants, get on my lap and dance
No longer am I mad about the things I don't have
All I'm living for is love and laughs
The last starfighter's weapons were rendered useless
So we pulled the scissors and cut the cord to end this music
Music (fades out) (fades in and out again)

You want the fucking window rolled up?
You roll up the fucking window, you piece of shit!
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
Don't fucking talk to me at all!
You act so fucking ugly!",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-saves-the-day-lyrics
Hair,God Loves Ugly,2002,"Could I throw my panties on stage
Like, can I be a fuckin' groupie and just fuck you cause
You're on stage and other girls want to fuck you

See bands like us don't get groupies

Nawww
You're so full of shit, I'm sure

No, its not full of shit, I mean, have you ever heard our songs
I mean, basically, exactly, that's what I'm sayin'

Smile, smile with me, smile with me, smile with me
Please won't you smile, smile with me, smile with me
Smile with me, please won't you

Oh look at her, she's lookin' as good as dinner
And she's lookin' back at me as if maybe I'm a winner
I'm in my late twenties little girl don't flirt with me
I've got the capabilities to program your circuitry
You don't have to believe, do yourself a little justice
Don't let Slug undercook your muffins
Oh wait, did I say that, I did
Must be losing it
Cause it almost felt that it might just have some truth in it
Now back to the platter at hand
She said she's twenty-one and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus
Cuz now she makes rent and now she drives a Taurus
Unwindin and hangin' out at the bar
I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
My self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles
She wanna know how I find the words I use
I don't really know but I can lie if you want me to
Angels sing to me in my sleep
I sold my damaged soul for the magic of speak
Now she's laughin', she likes the sarcasm
Naturally, I'm askin' if she's got a captain
A captain, you mean a man at home, the answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heaven's to Betsy, enough about boyfriends already
Just tryin to keep the conversation heady
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
Ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress
I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
To women that I meet at my own gig
I don't know, can't imagine anything as small as
Alcohol and hormones turnin' out to be anythin' big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's givin' me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin after
She says hopefully hangin' out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, thats not fair, you're throwin 'boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be me with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm comin' home with you tonight
You're probably right, probably right
A few more beers, a couple more laughs
Undressing my past with the questions she asked
Yes, I love cats and I would love to take a bath
If I would spend the night, would you massage my back
She's closin' in for the embrace
And slightly tucks her head under my face
Her hair smells so good, I gotta have a taste
Where's your Ford, let's ditch this place
In the parking lot, she sparked it off
She must be starving for someone to hit the heart
I've never been kissed with such passionate bliss
Pornstar damn near tore my lips apart
Honey slow it up, hold it up, start the car and
Leave this garage, let's go to your apartment
Lyndale Avenue
, on the way to her rest
Her drunk-ass turns to look at me and she says
You're so beautiful from the hair to the soul
I can't believe that I've never met you before
It feels like I've been waiting for you my whole life
She missed the red light, hit a pickup truck and we both died",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-hair-lyrics
A Girl Named Hope,God Loves Ugly,2002,"She abandoned me, left me out in the cold
No surprises, I guess that's how it goes
Sits across from me, at a booth in this dive
I contemplate how much more I can survive
But I'm alive, so I should be content
Then tell why the hell my whole world is bent
I was sent to make and frustrate the population
In-between the alcohol and the copulation
What you call it, if you build it I will break it
""What's wrong, how you doin'?"" Nah, save it
Gave it a fraction of all I had to give
I guess I hold a grudge, cause you still got my rib
With your beautiful eyes, unscrupulous lies
Now watch the circus clown run around in circles and try
Seems like all I get to eat is hope
Girl, if we got along better we'd be dope

Four walls, they surround me
Loneliness, has found me

And for as much as I complain, I'm lovin' it
And I only mention it so that I can rub it in
Wake up to the sunlight, shake off last night
Check what's left and try to get the rest right
Decision, splitting, headache, lifting
Symptoms, matching, Mama was afraid of it
Knowledge of self ain't as evil as they made it
Call it what you want, if you build it they will break it
The plain truth, there's no substitute
But sometimes she wears a disguise (Yes she do)
A storyteller deals with life not hope
Girl, if we got along better we'd be dope

And that's the sound that a dog will make when he's just been hit by a car
And that's the tone that hits close to home, when the cocaine outlives the star
And that's the noise that disrupts the boys when the cue ball smacks its goal
And these are the words that disturb your earth when I walk away with your hope
*whispers* Come on, let's go",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-a-girl-named-hope-lyrics

(Yeah!)
""Shut the fuck up!""

The way she listen to what the MC said
She might as well plug the RCA cords into her head
Taking that into consideration at the center of creation
Cats still criticize my frustration raps
Well off he goes, coming cop some flows
Cross your toes and hopes that I don't climb you like an obstacle
Mission impossible, fishing in the kitchen sink
Ya'll fall for anything so what you think this kid will bring
Poker face, let me hold my place
The name-sake is Slug, but you, you can call me stoker ace
Open invitation to catch today's ejaculation all across the front
Of your pretty little apron
This goes to those that own a mouth full of Sean's load
Thanks for starting, now you're barking down the wrong road
Sacrifice plays a part in grabbing mics
From now to the afterlife, I'll continue passion-like
I love this fucking whore with all my heart
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from doing my part
It gave me life, it saved me life, it raised me right
So slide, shoulder slide, and please hand over that mic

Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of ya'll even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of ya'll even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame

So point a finger at the sucker that's having a good summer
Ain't got no bread, no wheat, no wonder
But I got the phone number to this weakness
I know who can put me back together, make me feel whole
So take me apart, try to break me down
Spend all you got just to hate the clown
You can fake the frown, imitate the sound
Underworld, world-wide, wide world of underground
It goes, one little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpacks watch 'em all piggyback
Switch up my styles, they all complain
But see which kids next year sound the same as me?
The same shit yesterday was like today
Only difference is I trust even less of what you say
But all in all I still make the noise, I still break the toys, I still hate your voice
I still say fuck a major label till it limps
Put your deal up our table and we'll show you who's the pimp
There is no sympathy for the careless
Fuck the extra credit and fuck the demerits
Class dismissed
Pain
Pain
Pain
(You're all the same)

Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of ya'll even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of ya'll even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names

Give Me,God Loves Ugly,2002,"Jimmy got shot in the parking lot...

I'm a slow typer, a so-so writer
Been the shit ever since I was an infant in diapers
And I'mma be dope, all the way to the end
From the cradle to the grave, the Pampers to the Depends
Get enough love, got enough friends
But on a regular basis it's safe to say I've got the bends
And I didn't mean to ignore that vibe you sent
I guess my mind was probably on my rent
Oh I got my mind on my tummy, and my tummy on my mind
Some assembly required, let me run it down the line
The factory is open, time card punched
Until lunch time it's crunch time, back to work
Fool, the first rule is to keep the verse true
Even if it hurts you, you gotta wear the pain like a stain
Respect the listener, respect the game
Because there's more to game than some dinner and fame

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'mma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'mma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll

See I'm that cat that used to sit in the back and study
Looking for some proof, that God loves ugly
Flash forward a decade later in your town
Somehow, a good number of ya'll got down
And it's solid, fresh, dope, whatever you wanna call it
Not bad for an aspiring sociopathic alcoholic
(Ahh shit) Look at Slug still rockin' the same outfit
Tryin to make the belly grow bigger than the wallet
Ay yo man, how you doing, (what?), how you been?
Just been makin it cool to rap about love again
Not that hippie stuff I'm talkin 'bout that bitch that gets you nuts
Did he say bitch? Yeah I'm sorry, don't tell my baby's mommy
Speakin of baby, when done, there'll be a crate full of albums
For my son to page through, thinking daddy was a gun
With a handful of heads that put me up
Til they had some samples from Ant, and faith in What the Fuck?
I said, still goin, still maintainin
, still standing in the land of snow and purple rain
And I'm still waitin for my date to kiss me or slap me
Cause there ain't no way that I can be happy, when I'm happy

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'mma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'mma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll

I've had the pleasure of speaking with some of you
Yeah you, come on now, don't act like you don't know who I'm talking to
After that show, when you approached me like you know me
The cd I sold you, the secrets that you told me
On that world you vision, through the layers of tears
The ones you choke and keep hidden when the players are near
I watch you chase it with beer, some frustration and fear
Try to figure out why the hell I came here
Well I don't know either, and I'm not ready to take a breather, neither
All I know is I'm still a believer
So you can beat me up, or you can beat me off
Pick a side, any side, and let me do my job, come on
If you've got a lot of love to give, but you don't know who to give it to
I'mma turn out the lights of the cigarette, and write a song about you
This one's for you

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'mma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name

And the music ain't supposed to stand still
And little bit of, you know little bits of Negro
Into the music isn't enough
Music is all consuming, let me tell you...

You should have stuck with the original plan: To be a little man
Should have kept it simple, before the shit hit the fan
Give the kid a nipple cause he sucks
Take the microphone from his fist he doesn't know how to clutch
You wanna treat it like a playground?
Well we can joke about your take down
And let your pride get hurt when I tug on your skirt
Like ""Shut the fuck up! Professionals are tryin' to work.""
And to the people that don't feel us: Fuck em'
Don't need em', can't see em', never leave em', never loved em'
Stuff em' full of dick till the hole rips
And let em' know that's what they get for that ho shit
""Oh my goodness, Sluggo went and flipped his style
I haven't really heard him act like this in a while""
Bullshit! Still broke and I still fake the smile
Blow ahead and download my dick to a file
Yo, you heard Slug sing his songs about women
Like he must be a weakling, I know I can fuck with him
For those who wanna ride, come on, climb aboard

You know you gotta get lost because you know you're soft
Huh huh step, step, step, step, step, stepped on
Is all you gonna get when you try to test the Sean
You need to park that bitch and get a starter kit
You might as well hire me to come write your shit
At least then nobody'll know who you bit
It won't hurt so much when they don't like your shit
Silly Putty in a puddle of beer
Quit steppin' in my cum and get your gum out your ear
""I heard your new song son, yo this your year""
Why don't you run along and tell your girl to bring it here
You got no balance, combined with no talent
Disgraceful, you can catch a face full of phallus
Color me calloused on a retribution tangent
How'd the love die!? How'd the hell you lose the magic?
These cats is lazy, layin' down on the job
I call Musab, this whole playground'll get robbed
Those your props? Gimme that
Your girl? Gimme that
A three-pack of Jimmy hats
I show you who the skinny mack
You can keep the change. Hit me back when you're stable
If she give good brains she can play with the halo

Onemosphere,God Loves Ugly,2002,"You're so Ugly
You're so Ugly

Atmosphere and maybe you don't like us
But of all the stars in the sky believe we're one of the brightest
My life is as trite as your favorite rap record
And I'm possessed with that insight that enables me to laugh better
From the last letter back to the 'A' come around my way
Out of the wrapping paper without the fucking holiday
Can't never be captured, they can toy with my shell
But only after they walk a mile backwards through b-boy hell
From here on out the sun rises at noon thirty
And it ain't quit pressing till the whole f-ing room heard me
Soon the birdy will fly with or with out the wings
As straight as the equator, as nosy as the owl sings
Let the poppers pop, let the breakers break
Make the dj's and the assholes and all the rappers snakes
Well most graff writers are weirdos nowadays
So I hang out with myself and a rafter and a belt
Every chapter that I happen to skim
Appears if it must've been written by me or the brothers Grimm
And the moral to the story comes equipped with a sting
Once again I'm picked for the wrong fucking team (fucking team)

Now I'm sleeping on floors of temporary friends
But I'm keeping the store front as clean as I can
And I'm sweeping the sky for today's revelation
And I'm needing some time and some proper ventilation
And I'm building a house for everyone to hold
And I'm filling your mouth with the keys to my soul
And your spitting me out. Piece together the puzzle
You got to get it all out while you're learning how to juggle
And the bricks weigh more then they led you to believe
Remember never let nobody lead you to believe
September was the first time I had to breathe
So I learned to hate harvest, thought it had a trick up its sleeve
Not fucking with the Joneses, I guess that I been jonesing so much
Nothing gets noticed but the mess
And I'm smoking my stress through an empty beer can
It goes one Minnesota, two Minnesota, three

Vampires,God Loves Ugly,2002,"I do believe in monsters, I call them officers
I know enough to know to keep an eye on how I talk to them
Some of ya'll are peace, but even one too many
Is still a decent number for the breeding of a beast
With no release, she keeps and teaches no remorse
More resembling of a thief than a horse
Plans long range, attached to some fangs
And an arm that's strong, watch the song when they change
Nothing's strange, cause you know before you saw it
It's all the same, there ain't no such thing as flawless
But all I want is a little more security
A little more safety, a lot less uncertainty
Override the circuitry, the sun is your guide
Recognize the urgency, uncover your eyes
When I turn on the lights, she vanishes, hides
But I can feel here essence in the air
Acknowledge the night stalker and regard her as a hunter
Count the amount she takes from the slumber
Summer ain't as hot as you would think
Martyr the child that wears the target for the teeth to sink

This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This country's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This city's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge

She lurks in the alleys with the wrong reality
Allegiance, honor, keep it all in the family
Consumes the young, blind, deaf, and the dumb
Drains the vein and puts them under the thumb
She's on the television, celebrate status quo
Energy, push mute on the remote control
Break the beats, shatter the measure to pieces
All I've left is the breath and the will to prove the thesis
It's difficult to figure out who to fear
Gettin' older by the minute, younger by the year
Will the hunger disappear, metabolism slow
World domination is the goal
Now let's gather the kids, and take em' out to the sticks
Teach em' all how to live, come take my hand and walk with me
Before the vampires lock down the Twin Cities

This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This country's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This city's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge

Through the mud of the evening she trudges
The name, the blood is tainted with traces of loveless
From up above, truth watches in bewilderment
Contemplating how he really isn't feeling it
Just another chapter of another moving picture
Another after thought looking for a new elixir
But if she goes even when she has to climb
Out the window, out of sight, out of mind
Look out for me below because I've never been on top of nothin'
Other than a stove inside a pot of water bubblin'
And boilin' between a puzzle and poison
Two games in the same toy bin
But when my times comes you better beat the drums
And aim the guns at the ones that eat the young
If we let her, she'll do whatever it takes to survive
You don't stop till you take her life

Shrapnel,God Loves Ugly,2002,"Shrapnel...
I can't remember who asked me, but someone asked me
How long I thought that I would be allowed atop this trash heap
I didn't answer cause I'm tired of criticizing the masses
Inspired the support the devouring of the self
All the power to the people who dig potholes
Placed me in a glass case full of lost treasures and fossils
Got a right to be hostile, my love is gettin' gang raped
By an army full money hungry crocodiles
Quantity is up, market in a flood
But the party over here has never steered through so much love
I'll take the laughter, but I'd rather have the women
Who am I kiddin'? I'll be content with whatever I'm given
Work for food, rent, sex, money, or water
I don't know what else that you have to offer
Your first born daughter? No need, already got her
She came to the set hungry and left hot and bothered
My posse's full of women, computer nerds, and thugs
Much to my dismay, I'm none of the above
Someday I'mma be the mack of the minute
And you were so damn good I'mma have to forget it
Listen to the mimic, it's almost on
Drink, til ya hit me with a tall potion
Think quick, how much more insult
Will it take for me to break your light bulb
Shrapnel...

Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain
Of course I've came to show you shrapnel
Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain
Of course I've came to show you shrapnel

Check your mail, climb your ladder
Count the pieces you've managed to gather
Does it matter? What are you trying to achieve?
Let go of your throat if you're dying to breathe
And finally we've begun to make a little progress
Ain't a single dock in this river that can stop us
Lost in the mix like a feeble over dub
Got me screaming at these shippin' till these people know what's up
Yeah Slug's back, but his collection of hub caps
Caught a buzzin' brought a notebook full of love raps
Open the pipes and tuck that voice in
I'mma sit on this corner and nibble on my poison
Baby once in awhile I find a reason to smile
But most the time it's spent deep in denial
It's all make believe, I want the cake to eat
But this lake's too deep, tryin' to stand on two feet
Wonderin' about the thunder runnin' through this blood
I try to keep my cool, but the hat fits too snug
Study the love, took my degree
Shoved it into a bottle, chucked it into the sea
Shrapnel...

Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain

I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand pretend you know my man
Blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game

{To cold dis another's a thing that we love
So here's another one to get jealous of, do it Ja!}

So put your hand up if you remember the Juice Crew
They don't make em' like they used to
This supposed to be the new school?
Your guns are aimless, songs are nameless
How long you been famous?
I claim this region to hundred-mile radius
Twin Cities' flavors Rhymesayers got the tastiest
And you can hate me, it's part of the territory
As long as you know it's impossible to ignore me
From middle fingers to hugs, tofu to the drugs
The fight fists, might as well just take pictures of Slug
And live out your own life to the fullest
Why you starin' at my feet when you're standin' in this bullshit?
You could never learn how to ride a bike without balance
So what's the point of trying to grab the mic without talents
Go get your brakes looked at, you fucking fake hood rat
Wanna be the basement's greatest? Too late, already took that!
Father knows best, but Father knows stress
But Father needs love, a back rub, and some rest
Damn he could use a good home cooked meal
Been burnin' both ends since he broke the seal
Up, up and away, watch him take off
Give himself a little hell and quit the day job
And ignite the sunlight, tryin' to write about life
About face, break the fear, and you're here till the plight

And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand pretend you know my name
And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game

Cats be walkin' into the spot like they own it
Wearin' a face that they should save for they opponents
With the shoelaces tied, yet too wasted to drive
Either way I've arrived to bless this place with my vibe
Yeah right, my vibe ain't even cool
I sit in the corner and drink until I slur and drool
The t-shirt says shoot pool, not people
Kill time, not life, grab the mic and let the beat go
(Beat go beat go beat go)
But that's good for me
It's hard to hide a magic card when you wear a short sleeve
Force feed what I've got when they not hungry
Tryin' to replace everything that they ripped off from me
Bloke the tummy, and choke the dummy theory
Beat the point dead until these folks hear me clearly
Keep it all simple, a simplistic intricate
Rebuild the robots with bigger tits and little fists
Repo man, a world full of slow jams
Grab the prize and clutch it tight with both hands
Why go to serve tall talk?
Anyone that calls this fall off can suck my balls off
I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm still here, right here
Same spot that I stood when you first woke up
The same guy that grabbed the mic and made your girl wanna fuck
The same MC still runnin' on an empty tank of luck

And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand, pretend you know my name
And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Come here take my hand, pretend you know..know..know
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)

They can't sleep yet, too many regrets
Got em running round in circles for the respect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys
I stay up-set, with all the pup-pets
Submerged in the drama cuz they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain
Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down
And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words
And I'll be back when its happy hour

Too overanxious, the goods will get damaged
Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?
How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)
Coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs
I'm out, I wanna live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

Flesh,God Loves Ugly,2002,"We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh

Now when they started to holler, I thought about how a couple dollars in my pocket could've doubled as a power and it could get him out of the situation and help him gain some control
I'm taller than most, but never tower over I don't know if I could trust or if I could sits on my shoulder (hell no!)
I waste time by talking to the drama, the world was mine but gave it to my baby's momma
It goes one for the cuervo, two for the line, spill that girl and get that from behind

Bobshow Murderous
Insane verbalist, lead protests, kill women and children
Feminine, weak type, beat a brotha down in the middle of the street
With police watchin, full of various toxins, sicker than a slave when he's boxed in
I bring Glocks in, C4 with the clocks in, to watch it function and bubble out your lunch

We've been listenin to the vermin, squirmin
Tryin to find a way to get the words in
Twisted space through a missile at the middle of existence, missed it and hit its face
That's my place, give it back
Didn't react, too busy choking on the fat
Follow for now, swallow this spit
You velvet you get ripped

Gift of gab, this mic gets grabbed
Life gets dragged like racist lip stick on men's faces
Complacent as a passive racist
Pathless makeshift, glass knife
Aim for the face lift
I wanna break shit, run up and take shit
I can't take it, runnin a space ship
Escapism, great livin

(Yo, man, how you doin man?
I'm chill I'm chill
You lookin like you doin pretty good, man
Nah I ain't doin that well actually
I was wonderin if I could...borrow a dollar
Nah you can't borrow shit!


Can I run up in the settlement
Should I change you like the government
Burn rhymes like sniffin on double-mint
Make troubles then I blow off suckers then
Bourgeoisie brothers talk about sufferin
Burn rubber in a silver Delorean
We aim to win, made to end
Fraudulent styles but you play em again

The face card!
Mimic of an action-figure
Embedded in the trash can
Last stand on an ocean of sweat on a path to the sun, how close can you get?
Must be high off the cost of livin
The life of rhythm, get lost in the vision
Toss that fish in a lake of snakes
Self and Slug came and caught the brakes

Hell - been through it
Jail - seen
Melanin brothers like chalk on pale
It's all good from time to pale ale
Had 50 G's sent straight in the mail
I keep that on stock for all hard rocks
We camouflaged stone cold
Don't stop cause your songs on
You could crip walk before gettin laid straight on a futon
I got screws gone
Members of my crew gone, bustin off in the center til the roofs gone
I'm too strong, dealing with snakes on the regular, take 10 shots to the jugular

Come on, order the special, I dare ya
Get served that riddle that kills your character
Cuttin at the beams with a hacksaw, on a camel's back
Killin yak through the last straw
I'm glad ya'll made it, now let's see how far we can take it

Body Pillow,Sad Clown Bad Dub II,2002,"(verse 1)
And then there was this one night when I took the time
To examine a napkin in a chicago hotel room
I wasn't alone it was a night after a show
Space was full
Energy was consumed
There was a girl emphasis on the ""L""
She was noticin the detail as well
And the two of us found something with each other
Previously undiscovered
Hell is full of lovers
And the daylight is bright always makes me squint
But it feels like magic when it touches my face
Suffocate myself
Overwhelm myself
And let the sunrays abandon me floatin through space
(chorus)
And she still wonders why I'm so insecure
She giggles because I sleep with a body pillow
Intentions are never nothing short of pure
But theres a price to pay when you try to live a little
(verse 2)
And attractive as that napkin ever could've been
My how it unfolded - hold it to the wind
Try now to be a rock but she's caught under the skin
Ex-lover and a best friend
Just like the rest of them
Then there was this one night
I stopped to watch someone bite the tip of a cigarette
To hold it inbetween her lips
Never met nobody like her please brace yourself
Danger danger
This might hurt
The playground feels a lot different when the sun's out
She wasn't messin round she came in with her guns out
Screamin bout the ocean
Anybody wanna go with me
Never knew punk rock could be so pretty
Now catch your breath and then catch the ball
And sit by the phone so you can catch the call
Write catchy one-liners on the bathroom stall
Here I go wouldn't you know
Still learnin to crawl
Chorus
(verse 3)
I've always dug the way you love the way
Your tattoos intimidate men
I guess I'm one of them
Standin right next to you from way over here
Ex-lover and a best friend
(best lover and an ex-friend)
Then there was this one night I noticed a tree
That stood by itself about an hour up north
And I can picture her holding onto the limb
Wearin a summer dress and a grin
Swingin back and forth
Talkin bout the breeze and how it easy it is
To leave all the worries in the backseat
Teach me please I need the abilities to live
Silly me I tried to measure it by what I can give
But she didn't need anything
Just a pair of ears some strong fingers
And someone to share the tears
Read the fear feeling it inadequate
Now lets make-believe that I can handle it
Chorus
(verse 4)
And I still get to talk to you every now and then
Definition of ""over"" doesn't have to be the end
It's good to see you grow girl
Shake my hand
That's all I want from my ex-lover and my best friend
I got your back
Don't ever fucking question that
I got your back
Always have
I still got your back

Bleed Slow,Satan Hates Beauty (Atmosphere),2002,"I think her pony-tails a little too tight
Because she's alone walking with me in this moon-light
Tonight she fits in my palm
The storm isn't anywhere close to calm
Look I've gone and captured the mortal
Put my face to hers clutched her by the torso
And when the lips touched I inhaled
Didn't matter that she hadn't been kissed much
It's such a shame some have a name
And everyone becomes the same
Can't help but adore each one he's torn
From the pores of the face of the earth's core
This is ones more difficult than the last one
This one had an open window she could ask him
If someday he'll be the one to come and save her
Take her away before she takes her away

Take her away to where she didn't need to go
Life fast, bleed slow
Will he ever know the power of speak
Wouldn't be what it was if the prey wasn't weak
Take a peak into the way I seek
The water for the creek
The daughter of the speak
Slaughter of the meak
The Godly technique
The monster marches to a different beat
She don't love herself no more
Won't be nobody elses whore
No one like him spoke before
Now he's gonna take her to see the seashore
There you can stare at the waves
Be brave, take your place
Your safe slowly
He traces her face with an index fingertip full of hate
Love 'em and leave 'em
Love'em or they leave you
Some see the glow but some glow is see through
As life leaves her body sometimes he screams me too
All he ever wanted was to teach you to reach you
Death is the cousin of sleep
Just close your eyes count sheep and breathe deep
Think about the sound of relief that surrounds you
You were already gone before I found you

My Songs,Satan Hates Beauty (Atmosphere),2002,"Throw your hands up in the air
And wave like you just don't care
Say, you deserve a break today
Oh yeah, work that body, work that body
Make sure you don't hurt nobody
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?
I like the party rock the body
You like the party want somebody
I sang too, listen to the song..

Sittin' on the steps, with ANT, that's my man
Flippin' pig-russian, discussin' politics and contraband
Karma cut me clean as if I asked for it
Seven travels offered states with a case and fake passport
I want to shelter everybody from the snakes
And my sleeves know a couple of tricks for huntin' breaks
(Ten thousand lakes) Multiple choice of where to drown
So I quote the voice, it goes ""What floats is what's found""
Gettin down like they did in the 7-2
With the red and blue, had the opportune to bless you
Before you knew about a phone bill
Before you had to hold still
Before the Kool-Aid got diluted with Golden Seal
I used to ride around this town on a dirtbike
Child touched stillato, wild stages just to earn stripes
Read my lips, act like you heard right
And keep an eye on your chick, I work my rubber like a turnpike
It ain't nothin' for me to come swing from your tree
I wear the love like a ring and I sing until it's free
What? You bringin the weed? We break a measure
And let the hook ride just to tie it all together
Whatever..

My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to my songs

And when the party starts, I'm in the corner actin' smart
Spittin' game at your girl, just to take your world apart
I hang with the secrets and the cats that paint pictures
While you sleepin on life and writin the same scriptures
(What you gonna take witcha?) I take it all but the fall
And when I'm sittin still you can blame the Benadryl and alcohol
As far as the stars are above the boulevard
I keep my feet on the tar, with the heat in the car
Keep the beats in a jar, wait for the time to unleash
And when it comes everybody only gets one a piece
You better learn the words before you try to quote 'em
I'm sittin' on mixed nuts, who wants to hold 'em?

My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely, I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to my songs

Now let me get a collective amen (amen)
I put tame on the monsters the moment that I came in
I talk to the voices-- that speak through my headphones
Communicate the life while I decipher all the info
I got styles I ain't even heard yet...
Words like rain it came and left the earth wet
Let it drip-dry, focus eyes on the catalysts
Standin' high in the middle of SOUTH MINNEAPOLIS
They try to figure it out, they try to break it down
But they're distracted by every accent that's makin a sound
Grab it by the throat, lift it up and shake it 'round
Till this whole world sees me as a naked clown
And while I'm pullin on her bra, shes
Tuggin on my drawstring
Screamin' and shoutin to figure out how you lost me
Chewin up my cigarette and smokin' my gum
Out of respect for your boyfriend, I'll use my thumb
From the start to the done, I never claimed to be right
I quit sleepin, now the day looks the same as the night
And I'm the type of DJ that only plays what I like
A handful of mixed nuts, everyone's takin a bite..
My life ain't as cool as yours (3X)

My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to me songs
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm OK, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm OK, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up

(Come here, come here, come here, right now, come here)

Come here little rabbit, I'm going to give you a treat, take a seat
I'd like to tell you a little story, about a boy; he couldn't make ends meet
Not only that but he couldn't make sense out of the daily walk
Or the way we talk
Or how much though can be put into the price of advertising
I was watching him when he stepped forward to speak
Under the impression that he was just another local freak
Never would have guessed that he was capable of taking out a cluster of droids
Just to make noise
What some will do for attention
Sometimes it's too honorable to mention
And what we're dealing with here is a systems malfunction
Catching visions after the treasure was sunken
Not to be mistaken for a role-model husband
Because I'm only interested in fucking
Just my luck I'm a narcoleptic nympho
Petal to the metal with my dick hanging out the window
Anyway the wind blow
It come ten fold
Must be the season of the info!
And sometimes I talk to the trees
I'm a dope fucking rapper, and I'm not trying to be abstract
I'm saying that
Hip-Hop is larger than the politics, the karma
And accessories you carry in your back pack
Oh, and by the way
Big thanks for all of the support
I'm amazed you all want to hear what comes out of my mouth
And I still keep my finger nails short
So I don't tear your girlfriends from the insides out
Now do you get it yet?
Well you will
Just hold still
And god bless the road kill
With an empty can of oatmeal
In case you're unaware, it's been a long time coming
A lot of mind numbing
Trying to climb something
I used to walk into this room unnoticed (yup)
And as buzzed as I was, you all was lost in my focus
And if I could keep from my knee to hurl
I would leap into your world
And feed my seed to your girl
Just to prove you've no clue as to what your boo likes
But you got a good start, if you spell my fucking name right
So show the tag on your shirt that says bitch made (come on)
While I push the mental switch blade
Deep into your rip cage
Kill the stage
Sweat death
Have a drink
And piss ink
Fill the page and spit life, just to make these kids think
See I came tonight to play the role of Pipe Piper
But first I want to know who stole my lighter?
And while were at it, someone asked, ""Who stole the soul?""
I can smell food, but who's holding the bowl?
Let's take a little stroll through your tape collection
And check the UPCs to see who raped the essence
Yes it hurts
Because it's a business first
And it gets worst
When you jerks
Let it get into your verse
And I still can't seem to adapt
But I'm a dope fucking rapper
And I'm not even trying to be abstract

And If I could fly, I'd lift you up
And take you into the sky, and she you Slug
And If I could fly, I'd lift you up
And take you into the air, and she you Slug

You get a piece of my mind, and the number to my fanline
No wonder you're WHACK, most of mankind is WHACK
Can't nobody read that sign that says ""there ain't no turnin' back""
Step in the AT, you better be prepared to have a hobby to do
For when we through with your career submit a copy of them papers that
You think gave you the right to even come within a 100 yards of this mic
But here I am, breathe deep, count to ten
Keep the beat, locate the loose screws so I can pound it in
It's all SPREAD love, GET love, city to city
I ain't mad at none a y'all, cuz can't none of y'all can fuck wit me!

I'm on the Poverty Tour, wit Jay Bird, my man
Gettin' every wall sole across this desolate land
Estimates and expectations, get woken and cornered
Tryna strangle the stupidity, and choke its supporters
From this day forward, I'll be the voice that you wait for
The one that you paid for, or the one that you hate more
Whether you drive a Ford, a tugboat or a skateboard
Put my tape on, open up, n face forward
Cuz' when we land, anywhere near the mic stand
It can reason with the meaning of your lifespan
Motivation you've been waiting for to make a tight plan
Got you like I think that I can, yes I think that I can!
Well go ahead, take a sip, introduce us to yourself
Place us on your list of influences, ima live forever

 I'm gettin' busier
I'm double barrel, huntin' me a grizzly bear
I'm an arrow, aimed at the sun
My number's seven, that's six-plus-one
Never had a gun, but as a kid I used to front
'Cause I wasn't trynna be nobody's punk
I used to run with the ones that would squeal, ""Keep it real!""
While they distorted their reality with alcohol and blunts
Now I'm grown up, got the mic sewn up
Spent enough time getting junk and throwin' up
And I've been livin' in someone's livin' room for a year
Back and forth, between the record store and here
So I'll be damned if I loved you rapper
You can all eat dick, big label and independent
As far as I'm concerned, you're all germs
Only ones I fuck with are the ones that I'm friends with

Bendin' over and blowin' like the wind in the willows

This soldier is well trained at how to touch a brain with a felt tip
Pucker up buttercup, enough is enough
Kids is on the nuts like my dick was a bus
I'm like, ""What the...?"" - Fuck it, I'm like, ""Where?""
All you got is a mad face, wack beats, and pretty hair
So while you try to find some trend to ride
I'm inside your girlfriend, fuckin' with your pride
Rhymesayers for life, run free forever
Climbing in your ear, to jest it, infest it

You wanna battle? Man, act your age!
You paid to get in, and I'm about to go on stage
Just give me a pound and I'll assume that you're down
With the plan to expand and make room for the underground

No punchlines left
I took a step back to take a look and make the most of my breath
Kept a close eye on that closed eye
You wanna post high, but you rolled in and got no style
Y'all are pork, put a cork in that leak
It's hard to believe they even let you in the club
Do you work here or something? Is the door-man your cousin?
Or maybe you're the one suckin' dick and givin' back rubs?
Lost - But you act like you're not
Cost - How much they want for that spot?
Tossed - And when it landed it broke
Y'all fools can't handle the weight - so you choke
Sure as the snow is gonna gonna come down
My people'll be plantin' seeds in your hometown
With a remote control even you can behold
All the boulders that get rolled now - Roll out!!!

Something sinister sits in the corner
Ignore it if ya want, but remeber that we warned ya
There in the basement, behind the furnace
Feeding off all of your fears so I can flurish
Puts the shook in your bones (in your bones)
Making all my noise when your parents ain't home
And if the bulbs burnt out in my underground layer
Guaranteed you're gonna sprint back up those stairs
(It goes) Step by step by, let me get by
It's all in your mind, you do it every time
The darkness scare us, anybody care?
Try to stay strong, pray for help
Well you can bring that fear I survive on it, I thrive on it
Im aloud to shoot aloud? when I climb out of your mind to eat your time
You can redeem your fear now
And all the white girls sing along
You can hear me growl (growl)
You can smell me, foul (foul)
But as hard as you try, you'll never see me prowl (prowl)
You can feel my touch to the heart and spine (spine)
Some have all the luck all the time
Fear that I might take your life (take your life)
Fear that I might fuck your wife (fuck your wife)
When you hear a gun, you hear my voice
When you hear a crash!, you hear my voice
That tingle on the back of your skull
Cut the edge off of sanity, the blade is dull (the blade is dull)
They gave their all, but I took a little more
'Cause I made a promise that I would win this war
'Cause I made a promise (I'm FEAR MOTHER FUCKER!)
'Cause I made a promise (I'm HERE MOTHER FUCKER!)

The BOOMS
The BUMPS in the night
And when it's on, when it's on

Get over it
Get over me (get over me)
You're the one that left me my opening (opening)
Forgot to put the lid down tight to the truth
So I climbed out and set my self loose (set my self loose)
The only thing to fear is fear itself (I'll KILL YOU!)
Love, money, God and Hell (I'll SPILL YOU!)
Where do you put your trust? (I'll KILL YOU MY DAMN SELF!)
Is it within or is it with us?
Is it breath or is it death?
What in the name of God do you run from, run for, run to?
Someone done for
Sit still and take it like the bitch you are
You can fight and resist, you won't get too far
You made me all the power you gave me
Cultivate the hatred and fed it to the babies
Spent lifetimes pretending on a clue, but I'm a product of you

Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life, veins
Head, pressure, senses, clutch
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life, veins

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

It goes one for the cannabis, and two for your Dianetics
Three for your reasoning, and four for those that try to get it
Five for your love, and six for the stress
And seven for the day that I climbed into this mess

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

I'm catching ulcers from the childproof lighters
And all of these fine-tooth biters that keep the wires in my head tighter
I'm tired out by the distances achieved walking in my sleep
Floors got shifted since the high got a tad too deep
Ask dad to keep cool, I'll call him back soon as I resume normal
And get out of this bathroom
And call management to seek some reimbursement
For the nerve endings that burnt from the first hits

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

So fuck needles, fuck smoke
Fuck lines that make the sinus choke
Fuck chasers, trails, fuck waves and rails
Fuck hangovers, fuck hallucinations
Regurgitations, mandatory sentences and UA tracing
Blind my insight and dull the common sense
Give me inhibition, kill the superstition and the confidence
Built a tolerance, now it's more that I consume it
When it boards up my room, the world's whores will croon in unison
Unify the eulogy, autopsy pages read euthanasia, i.e. irony
Well here I be within a pool of my drool
Sedated, windows dilated, comatose, life overdose
Tell Jacob Miles to keep it wild style
I'll promise I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile
Tell Jacob Miles to keep that shit wild style
And I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change

Bird Sings Why The Caged I Knows,Punk-O-Rama 8,2003,"It's the bird, it must have been the bird
Disgusting critter, it must, we should have known better to trust
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Gotta tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
What's she thinking? Does she really believe
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets?
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodies she play, the music she make
Rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us, it's time to awake
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I turn them into screams
My feathered friend's end will justify the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles until she's too dizzy to speak
Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly) She's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?
I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest

Of people that I look upon as buster
I continue to keep one of my feet in this gutter
Maybe that's my way of puttin' the day in place
Ain't too much okay, you can tell by how I wear This face
But don't you worry, this is my journey
Fellas keep your fists up, women keep it dirty
Fly little birdy as I walk through this puzzle
Puttin' it together makin' sure the laugh stays Muffled
They congregated on the corner of the block
Tryin' to come up with the plan so they can close Down the shop
Unsuccessfully all attempts oppressin' we
Testing we, bringing we one closer to the Destiny
Yes it be the fool that burnt down the school, tryin' to turn around the frown and make
Everything seem cool, sittin' on my stool showing
Off my muscles, caught between a chuckle and a ""Fuck you"" and ""I love you""
They buckle and bend When I start up the binge, this structure can't Handle the whole weight
They struggle cause they Pride won't let em give in, so I'm a let em cuddle With they own self hate

Come on mash that dream into a telephone pole, Catch that beam let it caress the soul, she don't Need me, he don't need love, they won't see Through, they caught a bad dub, I walk down the Street in search of a home, a virtual me inside My head roams, way too buzzed and the ride's too Rough, can't read what I wrote last night on the Bus

I put footprints across each inch
I've left fingerprints on the way that you listen
The women distract me, I give in, gladly
Stayed Vision, try not to stray from the mission
Holy cough drops, am I the next to get knocked off?
Played a game of hop-scotch and stepped on a soft spot
Can't fall off if you don't reach for the top
So I'm a stay below the radar and keep what I got
I don't sleep a lot. I don't like to dream
Shoved my thoughts in your mouth just to stifle your screams
If the light was green I'd put the Pedal to the metal
Put the flame to the kettle tryin' to keep the pain settled
Change up the level, turn the treble down
Dosey doe with the Angel and spin the Devil round
Gotta get a better sound out of this mis-matched system
Got a city full of heads, can't none catch the rhythm
So let me run through these motions some more
We Gon' see the light once I kick open this door
We Gon' be alright, DJ spin the breaks

Come see what daddy got
Players on the sideline
Screaming out ""That ain't hot!""
Drama, what got you the answers in the first place
Pants held tight with a shoelace
Keep life in a suitcase
Handle broken off
Dick stay soft and a brand new smoker's cough
Over and over, dodge that boulder
The best type of baby powder pimp man soldier
Wake up from sleep, climb down from my treehouse
Get into your lawn and pull the weeds out
If it ain't been fixed I ain't gon' break it
But hot damn, woman, you look good naked
(Take it) off the record, I got them records
I'm not impressed
I want my fucking hasenpfeffer and my Dr. Pepper
Doctor, doctor

What's the deal, dunny?
You got some real problems?
Show me some real money

I like my black girls clean and my white girls dirty
Doesn't matter, either way they're all out to hurt me
So what's the deal, girl, can I talk to you?
Cause I got a head full of voices telling me that that's what I ought to do
(Why don't you give that girl shit a little bit of a break?)
I do, twenty times a day - I call 'em cigarette breaks
But my heart, my head and my balls ache
From trying to pile on the weight to see how much she can take

Mama never told me all they wanted was a daddy
Baby I could look just like him, maybe even act exactly
How he did. Uninterested, out of touch with what your mama needs
Hard to get through to, hard to please
Hard at work avoiding the family, talking to his secretary's tits
Measure the distance of pleasure mixed with business trips
As usual eyes wander, unscrupulous minds ponder
Possible outcomes over time('s on our side)
Some stop to smell flowers but they're toxic
I don't punch clocks, I knock 'em out the box, Rick (knock 'em out, Rick)
Then some jock until I start the moshpit
Ladies' night at CBGB's hitting on punk rock chicks
Like blaow, how you like me now?
Inscribe my digits in my steel toe so you don't have to write 'em down
Embed it in your head to help you remember, it might help
Slight swells on your back from the cracks of a spiked belt
Trendy poser, she ain't mad at me
""Bend me over, spank me, daddy""
Disciplinary measures existing in every treasure
That's why I keep digging (digging, digging, digging)

Keep Steppin’,Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7,2003,"It goes job after job after blow to the self value
He doesnt get along with powerful people
The mind is a box kept locked
Inside is the pride and the ego and he can't find the keyhole
Compensates with alcohol and hate
And contimplates whether or not he wants to be awake
Bounce around the words, all the nouns and verbs
But better the latter then never doesnt work for work
Can't hold employment, can't hold a girl
But he can hold a weapon and keep this whole world steppin
Another angry arrogant american
One frustrated step away from where you stand
Put your hands up for PHERE or fear itself
Or write it off as balances and cheques
Or take the sign out the window and change it to say you want to help
And maybe we can talk him into walking up these steps
 {2X}
Keep looking up
Try to count them
How many left
Look em up
One at a time, until your out of breath
One foot infront of the other
Right, left
And spend your whole life climbing these steps
(Brother)

For every boy that she allows to step on her heart
She comes one step closer to findin what she needs
The sad part is shes still stuck somewhere behind the start
Still doesnt know what it takes to make it leave
That tattoo bleeds upon the paid dues
Break the rules, to balance the odds, challenge her God
The untrained eye thinks shes got it all together
But the first time I seen her smile I knew better
Write down the letters, piece them in order
Make sense out of a sentence, give the picture a border
Got to sort through the images that clutter the soul
But the photo got fried cause the shutter didn't close
Over exposed, too many steps, too soon
Killed the pain with a Jameson under a Blue Moon
She climbs, she cries, she waits
How many more can she take before her legs break
 {2X}
(Sister)

So if you're doing bad I'mma sing about you
And if you're doing good I'mma sing about you
Whether or not you knew I've been singin about you
It's all I know, I don't know what else to do
When you take a step I take a step
Or maybe it's the other way around I'm not too sure
Right and wrong got together, the vision was blurred
The path was crooked but the intentions were pure
And I count these steps getting closer to home
And I love each step like it was my own
And when I reach the top of the goal or whatever
Maybe finally they'll let me forget her

We travel like the blood that surrounds your brain
Atmosphere has landed, demandin' that we raise the curve
Expand the kingdom, calling all heads of the earth
The first tour brought us all the way to Dallas
Seven deep in the MPV to keep the balance
A van full of talent, with no place to sleep
Hey yo Abuse, do you really think this food is safe to eat?
Yo peace to that kid they call orgy (check this out)
Without him, no heads in Texas would know me
That fellow hooked us up with a hotel, and mics to rip on
And Deep Ellum is decorated with Rhyme Sayers stickers
And that same journey took me to Kansas City Missouri
I think Danny boy still owes me money for tapes
I met a writer named Gear who let us crash on his floor
And drank a 30 pack of beer with that kid dirty Dave
From the Rave to the Y-Not, why not love Milwaukee
Aaron Way and JB got that late night hype
The rusty pelicans are eloquent at rocking a party
And my man Selfone keeps the jam hella tight
And speaking of tight, have you ever been to Atlanta?
That’s where the Micranots live, Kool  and I Self
Hey yo Shocka, I vow how until the end of now
No matter what where what why how, mi casa es su casa
You gotta love St. Louis, where the culture’s awake
With the dance, the paint, the beats and the rhymes
Yo peace to B-Money, SOLO, no matter where I go

And let the mans work stand behind his words
I gotta give my peace to the people out east
My man Amall, standing tall in the belly of the beast
In Adium Lounge, and out in NH, hold a space on your couch
For when I make it that way
Yo Alias I feel your pain
So keep saving the children and keep praying for rain
Cause when the water falls, the puddles will never drain
And they’ll discover the love that lives in Maine
There’s a garden that’s growing out in Baltimore
Lab tech runs voice through a monitor
Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Boston on the paper
In the car, I get lost quite often
Crossing the border to Canada, and watching it grow
6’2 in Buck 65 knee deep in snow
Aaron Knewal introduced me to the newfi groupies
And the Toronto, Doc’s got the studio hot
New York, New York, big city of dreams
Get with me when you’re ready to be part of the team
My man Aesop Rock, prepped the theories for the launch
And in the Bronx, it’s where Mike Ladd holds the Conch
And out west, yes, the weather’s blessed
But I could never mess with ya’lls earthquakes
I’m trying to live to see another birthday, so
I’ll only visit for a minute to kick it with Sole
Mood swing, Anticon, and a Cron and Nole
DJ fingers down in San Diego
Gotta a sense of my flows, for the wake up show
Yo did you feel that tremor?
I think its time for us to go
We travel like the wind across the rotten-fruited plain
We travel like the blood that surrounds your brain
Atmosphere has landed, demandin' that we raise the curve
Moving town to town, looking for work. Cincinnati!
Doseone is a weirdo, Mr. Dibbs is a hobo
Illogic is my hero, I give nobody a promo
Moid Pippis in the studio, with Yonie on the Oboe
And no no, you cannot play with Lioness’s yo-yo
And to Chicago! I don’t even know where to start
Every time I leave your parts you keep a piece of my heart
The Double Door, Royal, Berama, and the Metro
Rubber Room, spow juice, lawful, All Natural
We’re all trying to get there; the truth is we can't alone
So peace to the soldiers from the parlor to Gramophone
And love to HBK, and AMC, and NUR
And DJ PNS needs a new cassette deck in his car
You can catch me free styling on top of Molemen Breaks
But trying to think of something sick to drop on vinyl, add in kicks, bass
And to my little brother Jel, what the hell, its time to party
We should dip to Mardi Gras, and find ourselves some women
I travel with Ant; we travel at the speed of tongue
No matter where I’m at, I don’t forget where I’m from
In your Walkman, or in your girlfriend, it’s all alike
I’m just grateful that I'm capable of holding this mic
And holding it tight, and knowing what’s right
And showing some light, and glowing so bright
We travel like the wind across the rotten-fruited plain

Ode To The Modern Man’s Hustle,Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7,2003,"The first time I met the Devil was at a Motel 6
She left Hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About five-foot five, good and thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands and long hair
I said ""I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it""
Chorus: 2x
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you, through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must hustle

Who cares what Jane says, she always spits the same spit
I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion
Somehow she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling
But you'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private Saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the gray matter
Little baby doll, she doesn't know what to say to y'all
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lose a dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down, I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found
And I'll tell her that
Chorus:2x

Hush little lady don't say a word
Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let 'em know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow
I'm a chapter in your text book
Read me like a check book
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The modern man's hustle, I dig it, I shovel
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it get I'll keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (it's coming down!)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She look at the mirror she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest, speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position
And if you didn't know you better listen
{you better listen 'cause)

Gimme that freak fool, another jack move sit still
Mr. Dibbs, yo homie how her tits feel?

Dig a hole just to see if I can fill it
I stay away from you rappers, flip a dime, and wipe her off with some napkins!
With the M. P. L. S. and the S.T.P., Musab and that's Ali
Here's how I remember ya 
Ass up for the camera!
Feels good when you caught in the dark
Cmon baby lemme hear you bark
Raise up, and roll over on your back
You'll say, “I ain’t ever been photoed like that”
By the end of this tour I'm on, everybody on the bus gonna be like

Put the love on your face and take a picture while it runs off
Warning: hide your wife piece, cus Slug and the Rhymesayers are jackin' your freaks!

Huh, and even if you down with my crew 
I'll jack you too!
She saw me first, autographed Overcast, told her ass to buy a t-shirt
Lickin cookies, 21 and over, no sugar for your daddie's little rookies
I stand by the bar with the boose cus right about now, backstage is full of dudes!
But you never seen me party or shake my butt
I leave that to the suckers with the trendy hair cuts
World-wide I touch, steal your girl, and give her that midwest loooooove
Casual passion, say hi to the instamatic Polaroid flashin
Ya baby say cheese, cus Slug from the Rhymesayers, is jackin your freaks!

Cus him and I are getting old but we know where your mom lives
She's not a bitch, she's a beautiful woman
That only loves you when you're smart, rich or talented or something
Sometimes she'l let you trade your words for some pussy
And if you listen close you'll find out her name is Lucy
And all I ever wanted was to pick apart her brain
And put the pieces on the bed to see if it would leave a stain
And your relationship is strong enough to handle it
So don't get mad when you see her with a laminate
Well you think she's your own now?
Well she is until we come do a show in your home town
Love and War is so hardcore, but you left her at the bar so you could hold the floor
I hope you're sure that she's secure
Or the next rhyme I write might be about her!",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-jackin-your-freaks-lyrics
The Snare,Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7,2003,"Innocence
One of the things we had
Until the flag got through it
The snare doesn't work no more
The snare doesn't think like me
I wish that I could shake it free
Then smile and pick your teeth
The snare doesn't work no more
The snare don't breathe like life
Can't see how you rest at night
The snare don't care, it hides
The snare doesn't work no more

I've got a picture in my head of what you look like when you're sleepin'
The skin sinks into the instincts of a demon
Can't believe the words exist with your breathin'
The evil-eyed eagle flies high into the evenin'
Every season has a reason
And every allegiance was inspired by some type of a treason
You can keep your secrets, nobody needs 'em
Convinced everything'll get better after you leave him
Skip the proper impeachment, not enough to call the bluff
Of the cotton thief rotten top feeder got a fever
Caught him stealin' from his own father
Caught the globe fucker off with his mother, no don't bother
Got a better plot, a lot more dignified
A little more historic, a lot less truth to hide
Do it right set a precedent
Be the first one to ride into the sunset, successful suicide

The snare doesn't work no more
The snare doesn't see my side
Or the people you leave behind
Or into the fear of the crowd
The snare doesn't work no more

Didn't think that you would, give a little of a damn
About the interest of the man, woman, child
Look at now with your crooked smile
Put it into the perspective of a skeptic
Well versed at hittin hell head first (boom!)
All you wanted was all of it, callin' in from the office
Unaware and lost of where the watchtower sits
Power fits in your wallet, too much for the mountain of big guns
Death count, it's got you all surrounded now
Dubya dubya dubya dot six six six dot net
Fuck ya fuck ya fuck ya lots of kiss kiss kiss got wet (splash!)
Break the body, set fire, no loss
Make the dollar holler, how much will your soul cost?
When you die, are you gonna be surprised?
Will you see it coming? Will it be your summons?
When you face the judgement of death
Reinterpretation is all that's left, now hold your breath and

Close your eyes
Prop up your disguise
Reap their loving eyes
The snare doesn't work no more
The snare doesn't trust your words
Laughing at what we've heard
Stab and then cut the nerves
The snare doesn't work no more
The snare doesn't do us just
It marked my ignorance
The snare assembled us
The snare doesn't work no more

So I'm just trying to figure out, like if you're down with the party?
What's up with the pants? You ever seen shoes?
They're almost like spaghetti except they're funny and not French
Sorry to call you so late, uh, Sage... Francis...Fuckin' nerd rapper..",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-snare-lyrics
The River 2,Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7,2003," 
And when I see (the) lightning, feels like my buzz is heightening
Everytime I feel the sun, I can smell the love
Everytime I smell the air, I can hear a child trying
But everytime I hear a river I think the mother is crying

It was a purple purple sky and an orange orange moon
And everyone was whistling the same tune
Except Brian, Brian stared out across the field
And watch the horizon blossom to cop a feel
Over the edge of the world
The one we're all afraid to walk
The rationate for why they're so high on the small talk
But Brian knows where the crows all go
To find the if's, and the and's and the but's and also's

If I could run through the woods and speed like the light
I’d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight
If I could fly through the fog and look down at this rock
I’d figure out how to sweep hell off of my block
But as it stands, I lay content
Tryin’ to be the magic man, tryin' to pay my rent
Stay bend, try to turn on the secrets you sought
While we're still burning the dawn just to keep the day hot

They slipped hidden messages into the cards that were dealt
Trying to understand myself and all of the sorrow I felt
For as simple as I'am how'd it get so complex
Got me studying the margins and disregarding the text
I open the curtains and listen to the traffic go
But I still get nervous each time my piece passes go
The residue is thick, the memory fails
I still laugh cuz the path feels a lot like a trail


We used to be lost walking these hallways with pride
Drunk or sober, life was nothing short of rollercoaster rides
Used to trip off the music, speak to the rhythm
All we wanted out of life was living
And when you passed I wanted to take back the time we wasted
I'd trade all the buzzes in for one more conversation
We can sit in the shade and discuss the meaning of sacred
Cause I can't see the garden no more, just the aphids
But the wind still blows and the plains still grow
And I wish your name was on the guest list to my shows
I want you to see me find my freedom
Cause you got to meet the sun before you got to meet my son
 
And when I see the lightning, feels like my buzz is heightening
Everytime I feel the sun, I can smell the love
Everytime I smell the air, I can hear a child trying
But everytime I hear a river I think the mother is crying

And when I hear a river I think the mother is crying
But when I hear a river I think the mother is crying
But when I hear a river I think the mother is crying
But when I hear the river..",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-river-2-lyrics
Tonight’s Man,Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7,2003,"There he goes, tonight's man
The one that's putting God's smile back upon my hands
The plan this evening, is hiding behind leaves and brush
Quiet the breathin hush, wait for the right time to rush
Grabbed your man by the forehead, slid the device across his throat
I hold him tight while he chokes, 8, 9, count to 10
Drop the body, rip the pockets
Come ups, cash, and plastic wrapped rockets
Hey mister, mister, you think that you're the shit
But you looked really funny when you felt your tendon rip
There's a thin line between fire and fear
Hey mister never should have set your shop up here
Cause ive been thumping chumps that push dumps to zombie tree stumps
Big man on the avenue becomes mommy's little speed bump
And this punk was easy, musta hated spinach
And the pigs all smiled they never liked you to begin with
Ain't trying to be the man no more, cause I'm a man now
I'm 'bout to take your crew to war
I've got a plan now
I'm used to blood and death, outgrew the gut wrench
So tell the devil I said fuck'em when he finds you on the bus bench",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-tonights-man-lyrics

Oh that is one sorry ass motherfucker
What do you say there bob?
Guy like that make it, yes or no
Uh-huh, uh-huh. I'll have to tell you that's precisely what I saw
I mean sometimes I can just look at a guy
And I know, this fellas not gonna make it
There's no fucking way, there's no fucking way

Man fuck this rap shit
I should go back to whorin'
Letting it loose
Spreading my juice
Catching my portions
Cause this lifestyle is justice done
As fucking your wife wild
For the excitement of a buck
With a torch and a crossbow I walk
Through the corridors of hiphops castle
Observing the personal battles
I climb through with a blind mans additude
My life is a mix tape and your stuck in a fucking interlude
Who the hell are you?
You ressemble bait for the type of hatred that escaped
From the center of hells lake
Chained to two pillars, one attatched to each arm
Ignore the voices til it's over and the devices keep calm
This pain dates right past the hate cats honed
Towards rap rock'n'roll soul and government control
For as much as god loves me, because she loves ugly

All That I Have,Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7,2003,"Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before they invented the internet and ravers
You could find the Sluggo standin' on this very spot
Holdin' up the torch for his Minnesota hip-hop
City bus cuts through the snow twice as good
As your imported all-terrain vehicle ever could
And these boots were made for keepin' my feet warm
And that's just what they'll do until the day we're all reborn
The headphones I wear push the wind off my ears
Turn the volume up to seven so I never have to hear
These people that keep tryin' to make me insecure
With the toxins they continue to breathe into the air
The music that my soul hungers and hurts to hold
And the women that have watched me unravel and unfold
The worries that carry me through my busy endeavours
And the passion that compels me to withstand the weather
The child that I vowed to teach and guide
And keep me fired and forever tryin' to reach the sky
I'm just a man, a musician, a brother, a lover, a dad
Take my hand
All I am is all I have",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-all-that-i-have-lyrics

Fashionably Modest,Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7,2003,"She's a formal princess
From the moment she wakes up to rinse her face
All the way to when she lays to sleep in space
She creeps through life
Energy she uses exclusively to keep all of these people in their place
If only she would understand her
If she understood, how good, or am
Or maybe, find the root of the problem
With a plan, is it plausible ?
Can't be the princess, carries the pride of a deity
Sexy little goddess, fashionably modest
Obviously falsified, honestly doubtless, lotus
Of course I've noticed the imaginary roses made it impossible not to focus
Hopeless, I'll never get my point across that bay
Hopeless, tried and denied at least once a day
I dont need your advice
What I need is some shade to keep the sunlight out of my eyes",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-fashionably-modest-lyrics
Pride’s Paranoia,Sean Likes Ugly Girls [2],2003,"This was the year he fell to pieces
And ironically this was the year when more people then he knew even existed scrambled to put him back together again
And as they tried they didn't notice that he was smiling, smiling his ass off
No pun intended
Oh, what have we become? Oh, what have you become?
Not allowed to kick the feet up and sleep until it's done
Ground control, ground control to major Tom
We found a hole in your theory and we named it Sean
And when the leaves fall the land looks more human
It's got me questioning the essence of my farm boy blues
Hence I never wore the fashions of the 'know what I'm doing'
But there won't be no alarm, when we sound up the movement
A river runs through it until I'm made out of fluids
My father's name is Art and my name's Pride
And while my destiny reads the recipe for confusion I'm looking for whoever writes 'so empty inside'
As the panelling comes unglued
I'm averaging a Camel, every hour is a substitute for food
Out standing in this field waiting for the storms
Trying to teach the alphabet to the children of the corn
Yo, the music ain't loud enough, I can still hear the voices in your head
The choices they've chosen to choose temporarily impaired me
I'm terribly proud if you don't turn it up louder, I'm breaking out
I face the sun when I talk and I hold his hand as I walk him across the street
Got caught inside of a self taught, it just don't stop
And I'll trade you a parable for every probably
Kick this one for St.Paul and this for Minneapolis
And kick this one here for me and my superhero complex
And when I can I'm gonna build a castle that touches the clouds
Not to get closer to God but to get further from y'all",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-prides-paranoia-lyrics

Why'd you think I stood beside you?
Not concerned with how this might fall
Nature become prowl at nightfall

Dusk, thus the beginning is on until dawn
Trust regardless of the daily
Really nothings wrong
I'm still breathin' and here's another evening
From the fortress
I leave for my course of tonight's achievements
There's no grievance in my pocket
Just a couple of dollars, a pen and hopefully my wallet
Because my man over here has got the hook up at the front door
Long as my ID's right what more could they want for?
Yeah we in there
Like fluoride, off the wall on the left side
A room full of pride, I'm consumed by the tune applied
This fuckin' DJ is tight man
I can already feel the minutes being added to my life span
MC Lyte paper thin drink tickets from the staff
Now it's time to make a friend and see if I can make her laugh
Hey princess, I got a lot of dialog
So I'm gonna line it up for you to get high and try to follow
Light up another false sense of security
Play a game of twenty questions
You can test my purity

And as I go down on her... night prowler",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-nightprowler-lyrics
Speed Queen,Sean Likes Ugly Girls [3],2003,"She listens to quote unquote punk, but loves to fuck to Calypso
Self esteem grew when she upgraded from crack to crystal
Irresistible when the buzz is on and when the buzz is gone
She's always trying to turn the buttons on
In-completed puzzle cause she keeps breaking the pieces
Latched and attached to any cat that treats her halfway decent
I laugh in peace whenever shes around because she likes it
How the fuck did I get twisted tight with this destructive vice grips?
Speaking of grip never could I grip that drug use
The sex was power but the powder cut the slug loose
And now she feels resentment cause all I want is friendship
I masturbate before we hang out, keeps me from feeling tempted
Prevented, instead of searching for solution
Mind bent from time spent no grant for restitution
Time to move then the taste of truth got you potent (potent)
Open, adjust my ignorance quotient

Yeah baby, I was a liar and baby maybe I cheated
But baby that shits minor you received what you needed
Dialogue, ears, fears, tears, thoughts, and a shoulder
And this overwhelming feeling that I ought to scold you
But no I hold you, in fact I held you up
If you were thirsty I held the cup
If you needed it I felt you up
I tell you what, why don't you tell me what the hell is up
I think that it be best if I find my own way to the exit
Lets get it straight, wait do I say that too often
Non the less I appreciate the observation
Now if I'm not mistaken you said that it's the best
When you mixed your crystal meth with copulation
I lost my patience, health-related self-inflated
Never had a clue that we was through till I found somebody new
And now I'm hated for my flaws, said that we'd be cool always
I never indicated how long always was

You know what? I hate it when you tell me about the average
You die to love men that try to rip your heart out
Through your nasal passage
Now how did I manage to be labeled the one that's savage?
I found the package damaged and I tried to apply a bandage
Habits, no money you live at home and moms tripping
You need a gig that makes tips got a job stripping
She goes naked on a pole, you know shes got soul
And she's got holes and she had goals but she got low
Age 20 but seen plenty bodies 40 but the mind state is 16
So save it she ain't listening
I miss being a savior but the behavior is flavor enhanced
Made a name became the favorite on the table dance
Don't you know lifestyles tend to stear
Around ones career you still broke cause of your joke peers
I choke fears for everyone that wears the shoes
Had it up to here with the paranoia and the where were you's
But I'm still there when she's got something real to say
I must care otherwise I would not feel this way
Feel your way through it like I felt I tried to help
But common sense builds when you find the consequence by yourself

Something sinister sits in the corner
Ignore it if you want but remember that we warned ya
There in the basement, behind the furnace
Feeding on flaw of your fear, so I can flourish
Puts the shook in your bones
Making all my noise when your parents ain't home
And if the bulbs burnt out in my underground layer
Guaranteed you're gonna sprint back up them stairs
Step by step by, let me get by
It's all in your mind, you do it every time
The darkness stares, anybody there?
Try to stay strong, pray for help
Or you can bring that fear, I survive on it
I thrive on it, I'm as loud as you allowed
When I climb out of your mind to eat your time
You can redeem your fear now
Now all the white girls sing along

Rhythm of rain (x2)
There goes my brain (x2)

You can hear me growl, you can smell it foul
But as hard as you try, you'll never see me prowl
You can feel my touch, from the heart and spine
Some have all the luck all the time
Fear that I might take your life
Fear that I might fuck your wife
When you hear a gun, you hear my voice
When you hear a crash, you hear my voice
That tingle at the back of your skull
Cut the edge off the sanity
The blade is dull, they gave their all
But I took a little more
Cause I made a promise that I would win this war
Cause I made a promise, I'm fear motherfucker!
Cause I made a promise, I'm hear motherfucker!
The bams, the bulls, the bumps in the night
When it's on, when it's on, all the white girls sing along

Get over it, get over me
You're the one that left me my opening
Forgot to put the lid down, tight to the truth
So I climb down and set myself loose
The only thing is fear itself, I'll kill you!
Love, money, god and health, I'll spill you!
Where do you put your trust? I'll kill you my damn self
Is it within or is it with us? Is it breath or is it death?
What in the name of God do you run from? run for? run to - someone
Done for?
Sit still, and take it like the bitch you are
You can fight and resist, you won't get too far
You made me, all the power you gave me
Cultivate the hatred, and fed it to the babies
Spent lifetimes pretending on a clue
But I'm a product of you, and now all the women sing along",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-rhythm-of-rain-lyrics

So all that fat shit you've got, I ain't trippin that ain't an issue
If you've got vibes, on a cool level we can talk, but if you live lies
Through material-fertilized eyes and fantasize then walk
I use my vocals like chalk to sketch the picture you can see it
See unfold what I thought in my mind when I free it
Did the swallow get caught? Yo, does your throat feel tight?
Do you see what can happen when Atmosphere grabs the mic?
Just a word for you it's funny and I think you caught its fever
All that shit you watch on TV has made you a believer
You don't have to like me, bitch, cause I don't really like you either
I don't care if you're rich, I had your girl, and I'mma leave her
Word, I'm eager, to disrespect the petty thoughts of many reps
As I take steps and climb and leave footprints on your mind
I've designed my own lifestyle words and vowels instead of rifals
And hang out with rhyme pals who tower like the Eiffel...

It's the TC's original b-boy Extreme
So when a nigga calls next you better pick your team

You cats are far from inventive, cool and calm
I destruct an angled emcee before the touch of dawn
My wand be makin niggas go poof with smoke
Nothing left but Adidas, X ain't no joke
I'm not out to get the quote of the month
Fuck a stunt
I'd rather grab the microphone and give you what you want
Opposite of a flaunt cause my shits bang hard
Yeah, you bust, but I'm black jack you pulled the wrong card
There may be one too many I give you plenty like excessive
If you're wack and grab the mic you end up in a state of depressive-
-Ness yes, couldn't pass the test with a calculator
Rhymes like piranha, beat designed by the ANTinator
A hater? Never, I just wait till you're tired
And then I give your ass a ticket cause that last shit's expired
Better yet tired, cause your position's been terminated
Wack niggas bug me like pests and get exterminated

How could it survive when you're chokin it? (Chokin it!)
When I can get a firm grip, I'm holdin it (Holdin it!)
And when I'm broke, I wear my girls deodorant
Wait, did I say my girl? I meant my pimp
Cause she's the one with the money, and she walks with a limp
And honey, if you wanna purr you gotta register with her
Cause she gets ninety-five percent before any events occur
Sir, your self-imploding ego is adorable
Word, but your immature stee-lo is ignorable
I don't know, maybe I'm just getting too old to flow
How much more must I invent before you seek retirement?
Repent and tell God that you feel shitty bout your actions
Bent in the back and I can only blame my passions
Well rounded relapses kept me at a fraction
When the wind died I found myself spread across the Tascam
How much thought did you put into that verse you brought?
What made you think I wasn't gonna mock? Put a fucking tube sock
In that hole because I think it started to leak
Take two dicks and call me in a week

A lot of things change and some things don't
A lot of people fall off and some say they won't

I heave and I ho.)x3
And I heave for them ho's

As we approach another eve
Momentum starts to slow
Finally took the lead
Now it's just me and this road
And my car and my keys
And my thoughts and my woes
Although I'm low on currency
I Got enough to pay the tolls
Never stop to sleep
Afraid of getting towed
Adjust the mirror and the seat
Turn up the am radio
In the egg of the beast, it's the reigns I follow
And paint my journey into center of this yolk...now
Embrace the grief, we both need to go
As I chase the geese, all across the Grassy Knoll
And I gave up the beef it was distracting my flow
And traded my release for a six pack of that Stroh's
Raise the seeds and teach them how to bowl
Keep they brains at ease and the blood pressure low
And the stains on my sleeve, directions I go
Change like the color of the leaf between the sun and the snow

Every woman is a queen, every man is a joke
Some funny, some cheap, some smart enough to cloak
She says she loves speed cause it's twice as cheap as coke
And the high when she peaks makes her fly like a crow
Biography I read, piece-by-piece it unfolds
Its time to cut her free before she helps me explode
From the birds to the bees to the bodies that are sold
The secrets that you keep the tales that you've told
Hit him in the knees by time to reload
Eliminate the needs now im aiming at the goals
The fears that they leak, and the tears that they hold
Will corrupt their inner peace, let the throat of they souls
Tell me can you breathe? unclutter the hole
Do you believe? discover the glow
Necessities you seek and the reasons that you hold
Now every word we speak is translated into code
Tell me, who you callin thief? they stole nothing but the show
Its pullin on my leash tryin to force myself control
I smell it in the breeze when the winter winds blow
Im gonna catch a couple z's, could you please watch the coals?

Bleed Slow (Who Cares),Sean Likes Ugly Girls [4],2003,"I think her pony-tails are a little too tight
Because she's alone walking with me in this moon-light
Tonight she fits in my palm
The storm isn't anywhere close to calm
Look I've gone and captured the mortal
Put my face to hers clutched her by the torso
And when the lips touched I inhaled
Didn't matter that she hadn't been kissed much
It's such a shame some have a name
And everyone becomes the same
Can't help but adore each one he's torn
From the pores of the face of the earth's core
This is ones more difficult than the last one
This one had an open window she could ask him
If someday he'll be the one to come and save her
Take her away before she takes her away
Take her away to where she didn't need to go
Live fast, bleed slow
Will he ever know the power of speak
Wouldn't be what it was if the prey wasn't weak
Take a peak into the way I seek
The water for the creek
The daughter of the speak
Slaughter of the meak
The Godly technique
The monster march's to a different beat
She don't love herself no more
Won't be nobody elses whore
No one like him spoke before
Now he's gonna take her to see the seashore
There you can stare at the waves
Be brave, take your place
Your safe, slowly
He traces her face with an index fingertip full of hate
Love 'em and leave 'em
Love'em or they leave you
Some see the glow but some glow is see through
As life leaves her body he screams me too
All he ever wanted was to teach you to reach you
Death is the cousin of sleep
Just close your eyes count sheep and breathe deep
Think about the sound of relief that surrounds you
You were already gone before I found you

It ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

Eh yo Slug, I used to know this girl named Dawn
Back in the day she had love and everybody was fond
See Dawn was the bomb, her attitude it was calm
Her heart was warm though with the wrong peeps she tagged along
Now she’s gone, long passed away
She kicked it with this kid named Andre who lived life the wrong way

I know that kid, seemed as if he had no insecurities
Acted like he was the mac mixed with Hercules
Disturbingly flow just to hold the title “Fly cool”
The first one to tow the tool freshman year in high school
Now mind you, this was back a decade
We was thinking girls, music, shoes, Andre was thinking get paid
But let’s say my man just had a knack for acting ill
To the level of immaculate as if it was a practiced skill
He’d have to fill your head with tales
Keep a rep from getting stale
Fourteen, said he spent his winter break in jail
As time goes by, the lines that try to differentiate
The fake from truth get loose so what’s the use?
Kid was living on the rails cause he chooses to
Goes to jail, comes back with juice, crews enthused
Who knew the bruise would heal so quick?
Who knew the passion would become fashion
And get you fastened onto his dick?
You might as well have let him penetrate
The situation shook me, looking at rookies that try to emulate
One sets the standard, the weak randomly follow
Space ain’t shit, some kid’ll take your place tomorrow
The cycle never stops cause you can’t recycle styrofoam
I still see Andre nowadays, he fucks with microphones

Man, they lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

They lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid
What you got ain’t nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

They lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

But the sun will come out tomorrow
And you can bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There’ll be someone that’s harder than me and smarter than me
And stronger than me and lasts longer than me
So check my fate, wide awake but feels like I’m sleeping
Trife life can’t catch a wife that’s really worth my keeping
It’s deeper, I peep it, I seem to need to understand
How am I gonna explain to my seed I was the man?

Wirth Park killings, suicide in crystal court buildings
Young villains holding guns without feelings
Dealing crumbs of demons to those fiending
Lost in dreams when the pressure hit
I mean the fan hit the shit but when the shit hit the fan that was it
Flipped out, you tripped out, you couldn’t handle it
Addicted to life dismantlement
? from distortion to brain abortion forcing to perish
Life’s to cherish, the moments too little
The path is brittle for those who chose to walk hard
In regards to those who front, stunts get elderly
Propelling me to disappointment, could’ve been avoided
By egos posing lethal with weapons
Deceptions are ill, revolve around intentions to kill
Gots to chill on that level or end up with the Devil
Digging your grave somewhere in the middle

It’s no riddle, they lied
It ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

They lie, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it
Present it",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-they-lied-lyrics

Trying to Find a Balance,Seven’s Travels,2003,"They love the taste of blood
Now I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
Atmosphere finally made a good record
Yeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt as sick and contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cincy
""Get real"", they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it

Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man
Hello ma'am, would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking, ""Yo where did all the passion go?""
East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes
God bless America, but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants
You can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance
So go pry open that trunk and get those amps

In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance

So now I keep a close eye on my pets
Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents
It's eat, sleep, fuck, and self-defense
So straight you can set your clocks and place bets
Wait, let's prey on the blind, deaf, dumb, dead
Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand
Yeah, I got some last words, fuck all of ya'll
Stop writing raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of dropping these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent, love is the motive, that's why I'm killing 'em
Guilty of setting my fire in all fifty
But I'm innocent, blame it on my equilibrium

In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance

Now all my friends are famous
It's either one thing or another
They all don't know what my name is
Probably know both of my brothers
The one is a hard workin' savior
The other's a hard workin' soldier
I'm just your next-door neighbor
Working hard at tryin' to stay sober
You wait for the car at the corner
Pretend like you know what the plot is
Won't quit till I hit California
And make you my Golden State goddess",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-trying-to-find-a-balance-lyrics
Always Coming Back Home to You,Seven’s Travels,2003,"To all my killers and my hundred dollar billers
To emo kids that got too many feelings
He held the register open while he counted her change
I was next in line which meant I was invisible
From where I stood I could see that the till was full
He didn't look the type to play superhero
So I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes
Crept out the store's front door to chase a little breath
Bangles in my head, shake the song off
Another manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk
A car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass
A woman and a child climbed out and left it running
They went inside of the deli, placed an order
With the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter's picky
When they came out mommy gave me a glance
That said man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance
Already knew the deal, I lit one up and walked
So they got back in they Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off
Thug love on the corner by the Walgreens
Looking at me like I'm just another square Saltine
As I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches
Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots
I walk past with a nod and a reminisce
Swear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis
Respect the life and the fashions of the children
It's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building
All of a sudden I'm in front of some man
No, he's a young'un, but he's got a gun in his hand
He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no, he looks afraid
Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say
""Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise
I found it on my block in between a couple garages
Didn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over
I don't even know how to hold it""
It was a thirty eight, the poor man's machete
Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier than expected
Wedged it behind my belt buckle
Knowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble
The extra strength felt weak
But over there on the corner saw what I needed
And proceeded to cross the street
Put the heat in the mail box to lose it
Figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it
Mosey down the road, thinking about the old
I used to roam this zone through two feet of snow
Right here, this used to be a record shop
I've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that parking lot
I've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades
These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days
Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave
All the way to the grave, south side is my resting place
Took a right on Lyndale I'm getting near
But then the road became empty and the people disappeared
The clouds ran away, opened up the sky
And one by one I watched every constellation die
And there I was frozen, standing in my backyard
Face to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star
I should've known, walked all the way home
To find that she wasn't here, I was still all alone
No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
They can leave me for dead they can take away my true
I'm always coming back home to you
Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew
I'm always coming back home to you
As sure as the life in the garden that you grew
I'm always coming back home to you
No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
If only I had known what you already knew
I'm always coming back home to you
From the heaven I've had to the hell I been through
I'm always coming back home to you
I'm always coming back home to you",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-always-coming-back-home-to-you-lyrics
Reflections,Seven’s Travels,2003,"Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you

What would it take to make a woman like you
View a wolf like me for what I really might be
Listening to lyrics only hears what I allow
You gotta try and make me testify for here and right now
Let's have a confrontation over a cold one
I'll give you conversation just to see if you can hold 'em
I play so dumb
Because I know some of these star-struck small talk art fucks is no fun
I'm the blood type that goes straight for the guns
Like before you even spoke already knew what your love's like
So what you thinking?
Because I'm thinking we should jump into your ocean
Let's go girl, this ship is sinking


Now there's no reason to lie, I've had a lot of lovers
In my reality, it's impossible to avoid it
But there's one reason for life: gotta provide some supper
Gonna build a family just to watch someone destroy it
Do you really think you really wanna get to know me better?
Don't you see the drama?
Don't you feel the pressure?
Don't get me wrong, it would be my pleasure
To sing a song that could remove your shoes and your sweater
Bartender, let me get a shot of Beam
Cause this girl over here is trying to get me out my jeans
And she doesn't seem to believe I'm just another thief
Came to take a piece and make you stutter when you breathe
Now girl you too smart to be a tour mark
Set to play correct from the start with your pure heart
And when you're all alone, I'll sing into your phone
If you don't know the words you can make up your own
The first time she met the devil was at First Avenue
Went backstage with him into the dressing room
Sexy ego trip, taller than expected
About six foot three
Seemed to thrive on his misery
Critical, observant, big words
Sweaty hair, sunken eyes, and thick nerves
She said ""I'll make him smile for the simple fact that he needs it
I'll make him smile just so I can kill it, and eat it""
You look like you were built for me
You talk like you want to steal my drink
You kiss like you already came
And that's a ""Lifter Puller"" line for those without any game
It's like damn baby
You know you can't save me
But you should still tell your people that you're leaving with the band
Maybe you can show me your hustle
Neither one of us would be so lonely
If only you would come over here and hold me
I caught you trying to hide your smile behind your glass
But all of your secrets become a swing set when you laugh
And all of your regrets that you're carrying or burying
Don't mean a damn thing if there's nobody to share them with
We've been following each other all night now
We ought to be all over each other like right now
I don't like crowds, let's take flight now
Cause that face that you make
Reminds me of my life now

""Only trying to find myself inside of you""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-reflections-lyrics
Lifter Puller,Seven’s Travels,2003,"Drunk woman: Do you really feel... honestly, I'm asking you of your heart...
Man: I don't even know you!
Woman: I know! I'm not asking you what you know of yourself, I'm asking...
Man: Oh, yeah. Sup?
Woman: ...what you know of yourself. A-am I the Jezebel? Am I the Jezebel?

And he was a man, or so he thought
Paid attention to the lessons daddy taught
Secondhand-me-down blessing, she was short on patience
Carried mace and hated everyday people, the plight of the pessimist
Habitual living, daily schedule consisted of:
Work, television, and sexual moments
But sometimes it gets so hopeless
When nonsense raises an octave, thoughts blocks all sensual focus
With a firm grasp on the grudge they both clutch in the name of love
Fear of the results had push ever came to shove
Seduced for fun, produce a lot of fight
Two youths on the run, learning some truth about life
And when he stares at the stars, he reflects on the moon
The time, the talks they share walking around Calhoun
And when she watches the look on his face as he sleeps
She recalls every inch as to how it got this deep
Now how am I to know you like the way I laugh?
I can't read the map, no one's ever seen the path
The one you take a bath with is the same one that frees your path
Oh you going out? what time you gon' be back?

Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Let's all take seats, please quiet during the performance
Lift her, pull her from the orchids
Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Trying to read the script, keep getting trapped in the margins
Lift them, pull them from the gardens

Now she was smart, she grew up with this complex
That the people that surrounded her seemed to expect the world
And he was tall, over six, no attempt to predict the fall
Thought he'd seen it all until his all became that girl
She said she loves the drugs, but when she comes down
She speaks about finishing, she's convinced it's the last visit
He doesn't know the difference between come and go
Give him just one to grow and watch him collapse inside of a half pint
She dyed her hair black, maybe now she can relax
Maybe now the regulars will stare half as hard
He wears a old face and beer gut
Existence validation printed on the monthly statements
That come from MasterCard
He thinks she sleeps too much
She thinks he spends too much
He thinks her friends are jokes
She thinks he's out of touch
He thinks she drinks too much
She thinks he thinks too much
It's all another phase turning the page in the book of growing up
She has seen a lot of sex
He tried to hide his resentment, but there wasn't nothing thing left for them to label new
But sometimes the obvious ain't simple to see
Cause even the time that they killed
Was something that she wasn't accustomed to
She never comprehended what to make of it (make of it)
He was never quite prepared to study the reaching
Together they shared the sacred practices of breathing
The weather was fair, however the hovering clouds weren't leaving
Discover the little drama demons that hide deep inside the framework
And live in that congested brain
They had old lovers on the side, old flames
That somehow managed to spark regardless of the pouring rains
And each time they mix up the ingredients
They recheck the recipe to see maybe they're reading it incorrectly
Collect me, consume me, release me, snuggle
Two geniuses putting together the pieces to a blank puzzle

Every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world
Every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world
Every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world
And every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world


Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Let's all take seats, please quiet during the performance
Lift her, pull her from the orchids
Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl

Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know,Seven’s Travels,2003,"Regarde le serpent mignon. Mords-tu, le serpent ? Salut

It's the bird, it must have been the bird
Disgusting critter, it must
We should have known better than to trust
This disease-infested ball of lust and carnage
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Got to tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
What's she thinking
Does she really believe
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodies she play
The music she make
Rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us, it's time to awake
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I'll turn them into screams
My feathered friend's end will justify the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles until she's too dizzy to speak
Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly)
She's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free
I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast

She's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better than me just because she's free

Shoes,Seven’s Travels,2003,"Would you prefer if I remove... MY... A-
Nah they... they're clean...
I mean.. what?
You wanna look at the bottom of... of 'em?

My shoes are clean girl, how about yours?
Here we are sitting on your living room floor
Listening to some records from your collection
Boredom; in between a coma and an erection
Staring at the skin on your shoulder blades
And you don't take your eyes off my poker face
I'm wasted, and you're as sober as Jehovah
Knocking door to door, trying to walk the road
That the Mormons paved
If she was here on your sofa with a beer on a coaster
She'd've told 'ya that my game was way overplayed
Make no mistake, I love the way you taste like yogurt and some clover cigarettes
Girl, show me leg!
So I'mma gonna trade these shoes for rollerskates
And I'mma stay happy just as long as there's a whore to pay
But some of us already spent the rent
So we can't be content until there isn't no more today

Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues

My shoes are muddy girl, how about yours?
Here we are lounging on your bedroom floor
I'm really drunk so I'm looking at your carpet like
""Man, fuck the permit, I know where I'mma park tonight""
It's closing time, the spins are gonna visit me
They're rolling thick like they know they taking victory
But not tonight, right, I'mma make some history
Get up in your system and direct it like a symphony
Let me get to be the man of your mystery
Cause them meddling kids don't understand your sensitivity
Show some sympathy, let me kiss your feet
Let's talk about a pretty bird and a busy bee
If I live to see fifty, I'mma be a tipsy, dirty old man
Still following my kid beliefs
I know it isn't really your responsibility
So we'll be straight once I take a hit of Listerine


I can't find my shoes girl, how about yours?
Here I am naked on your bathroom floor
I got faded, and you fell asleep
And I'm thanking God that this date was hella cheap
Sitting down, trying to keep the liquor down
Light, thoughts, and sounds- everything flickers now
Sick-bound, the whole room twists around
In front of the toilet, assume the position to drown
Here it comes! Whiskey out bounces all over the floor
Now I'm sitting in the bitch's mound
I'm just a clown, and I'm sorry I found it funny
When you tripped over my shoes and hit the ground
Didn't know you would rip your gown
Didn't think you would shout and get so loud, get so wound
Yeah I'm drunk, but I'm more than a little proud
I'm leaving, fuck the shoes, you keep them, I'm getting out

Gotta Lotta Walls,Seven’s Travels,2003,"Dialed up his homie Murs on the telephone
Gotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrong
Brain freezing up, he don't know what to do
But the people that know him know that it ain't nothing new
Catch five rings, then an answering machine
Hang up on the beep, stare up towards the ceiling
Stood up to remember that he slept fully-dressed
So he grabbed his keys and put a hat on his rat's nest
Stepped up to that big outside
Somebody once said ""Today's a good day to die.""
But he never really was a big fan of their work
So he starts up the walk by kicking sand in the dirt
A friend to the strangers, a stranger to friends
He'll take a coffee and a pack of cigarettes when you have a minute
Handle it. Paid up. The change, you keep it
He's a sucker for the morning smile and summer cleavage
If you knew him better he'd ask for some time
Cause he's looking for a reservoir to empty his mind
And there's only so much he can put in a song
Gotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrong

And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you

No shock value to titillate
Far from shallow, so get it straight
Blacktop, sidewalk, and the street
Cause life is priceless and talk is cheap
And as he sits (as he sits) in his four-cornered room
Following the tune, born to consume
Carefully learning and analyzing the lyrics you use
Finally realizing that humility is a bruise
Scared love don't make none
If these walls could speak, they would peep about the fake ones
Watching this man, falling off of this plan-
Underachievin' just so he can understand

""What's up baby how you doing? I hate the sound of my own voice
And I've been invited here to distract myself from the fact
That I wrote all of this garbage""

And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you

So, who did your tattoos? That's nice
And who built your taboos? That's life
If he had a glass pipe, he would smash it and use it to slash his wrists
But someone already beat him to it
He would fingerpaint you a picture with his blood
A self-portrait, dramatic and morbid
But the odds of you finding any appreciation are too slim-
Keeps his outlook grim
Tap his foot to the rhythm of original sin
Throw his balls to the wind trying to knock down these pins
He'll keep swinging from the hair above his chin
Till he finds his soul in the fifty cent bin
The price of the payphone escalates
Fake smile when he takes home one of his dates
He could write another hate-poem for you to break
Or maybe stay calm and wait for that big earthquake
Still surrounded by the fire and the water
Still trying to honor this empire's daughter
Still answering questions you're afraid to ask
Still believing that God's gonna save his ass

And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you

And if you knew him better, he would ask for some time
Cause he's looking for a reservoir to empty his mind
And there's only so much he can put in a song
He's gotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrong

So... anyway, girl was like:
""Motherfucker, you have a lot of walls, and you know, you don't like, show people shit.""
You don't mistake that
You don't mistake that
I just don't like these fuckers
Haven't met too many motherfuckers I like
You one of them
I hope that's enough...",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-gotta-lotta-walls-lyrics

Package the kid's face, put it on display
Look ma!, another national disgrace

The liquor gets hold of the head, liver, soul
Blurry on Sixth Street and Red River Road
Last thing I remember was the Ogden Theatre
Backstage bathroom making out with all three of ya
Kicked out of Topcats... for where I put the vomit at
Finally passed out in a laundromat
Malnourished and topless, slurring and obnoxious
Like, ""Yo, we got this!""
The Zodiac Killer's 'bout to rock this
At the Great American Music Hall, pissin' on the box office
Pick apart the detail, alcohol and females
All around the world, same Sean
Houston and Ludlow,
 Maxfish, Vampire
You pour the beer and I'll bring the satire
No prob, I'll play the part of doorknob and make it look
So good you're gonna wish that it was your job


It's all about the hangovers, and late checkouts
Maid banging on the door like, ""Wake up! Get out!""
But come on mami, y'all probably don't want me comin'
Out like a zombie brushing teeth in the lobby
This is a career, not a hobby
Ain't no reason to fear what you wanna see
Hey paparazzi, don't you wanna watch me quote the
Fonzi and then crash his Maserati?
Sweat pants, t-shirt, mesh hat, blue blockers
Feeding Jack D to a room full of teenie boppers
Howdy neighbor, take a shot for flavor
Let's debate whether or not we should punch the waiter
I'm just kidding, let's love each other
It goes lick, swallow, suck, and order another
Do what you like, don't nobody care
It's a sign of success, only in America


I didn't come to start no trouble or hurt no one
I'm just here to get drunk, party, and have some fun",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-national-disgrace-lyrics
Shhh (Hidden Song),Seven’s Travels,2003,"Such a pleasure to come home
Cause I... I have a very special love for this city

Well all right, well okay (x3)
Well all right(x3)

I wanted to make a song about where I'm from
You know? Big up my home town, my territory, my state
But, I couldn't figure out much to brag about
Prince lives here, we got 10,000 lakes
But wait, the women are beautiful, to me they are
And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars
And it hit me, Minnesota is dope
If only simply for not what we have but what we don't
It's all fair, it ain't out there, it's in there
It's in the mirror, behind the breast, under the hair
""Follow the dream"" doesn't mean ""leave the love""
Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough
I love New York and Cali, but I ain't movin'
Too overpopulated, saturated with humans
And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models
If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago
None of this is to diss no one, nowhere
Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air
Too many mosquitoes and our fair share of egos
But like my man Sabe says, that's where my mommy stays

So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell 'em where you live
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you know this is where you wanna raise your kids
Say shhh, say shhh
If you're from the Midwest, and it doesn't matter where
Say shhh, say shhh
If you can drink tap water and breathe the air
Say shhh, say shhh

Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay
The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space
The women outnumber the men two to one
Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son
The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay
I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day
And the jobs ain't really too hard to find
In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme
This is for everyone around the planet
That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they standin'
Don't take it for granted, instead take a look around
Quit complaining and build something on that ground
Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground
Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around that ground
Make a family, make magic, make a mess
Take the stress, fuel your motivation, and build your nest
It sucks that you think where I'm from is whack
But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back
And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said
""I beg your pardon but this is my secret garden""
All right
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well okay
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well all right
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well okay

If the playground is clear of stems and syringes
Say shhh, say shhh
If there's only one store in your town that sells 12-inches
Say shhh, say shhh
If no one in your crew walks around with a gun
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you ain't gonna leave cause this is where you're from

Cats Van Bags,Seven’s Travels,2003,"I can't scratch, cause I'm drunk
I got bad teeth and my gums are bleeding
Come and fucking get me, motherfucker
Yeah, break, start the song now, fucker

We traveling the missle, weaving through your cornfields
Leaving behind a trail of amateur porn and orange peels
Navagatin' through this basement, that masquerades
As a nation, practising my acetate masturbation
Watching the expressions on the faces
Of them ones designated to be the queens, kings, and aces
How many miles can you put on one sole
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole

Shoot through it as a unit, with the best of my crew
Bumping melodies and memories too, my head's killing me, ooh
Stomach empty, my bladder is full
Two-year-old son on Jaybird's phone cryin', you missing me
And I'm starving, I'll bite your arm off
Sabertooth Tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
In your backyard just to fuck with your guard dog
Throw a brick through your shit and cut the alarm off
Bitch

Fuck yes, I do my best to take advantage in bouts
With one hand over the mouth, still managin' to shout
There's more said within the lines on your forehead
Than they could ever try to fine-print on the inside of that warhead
Cross country, like a little lost junkie
Make them hot and jumpy, trying to get that God money
Steering the van through the blizzards, the fanfare
Pivot when we visit, spit victim if you stand there

Take a map of this picture, throw a dart at it, that's where
We took a room back full of kids and threw our heart at it
Angry like a hostage, kicking like a little bitch in one of Dibbs's mosh pits
Shifting through your city limits trying to find the raw shit
Thread a needle with it, and weave a world of heads together, till we get 'em car sick
Face full of war paint, strapped, ready for action
Battle cracks heading, trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain

Climbed over the side, closed his eyes
Took a dive into his fame, inspiration for staying alive
Swam to the shore, stepped upon land
Walked up to a whore, grabbed her by the hand
And said

Let the wheels spin, let the road shake
Let the speakers blow
Let the line in, let the kids play
Let the people know
Let the roof burn, let the girls love
Let the heat flow
Let the world turn, let the curtains up
Cats Van Bags, Yo

Lock eyes with a thousand people at the same time
They minds believing this
My style of graffiti is
Squeezing just the midwest sweat out of my shirt
And leaving with my life essence embedded in your dirt

We work, move, and hustle with the rest of the gypsies
Spoon-feed these issues to a new school of fishies
Swimming through a hazy shade of passion
Here they come, the Hazleton has-been, and his chaplain

Yeah, that's them, the migrants, seasonal workers
The finest imperial wordsmiths on the circuit
Two million smiles and runnin', stomping, trying to flee the heat
Turn around, shooting at the monster till his knees are weak

They call me Jesus Freak, I came to listen
Then I save you, then I make you my favorite position
Chasin' this pigeon down the street towards the banks
Just in case my traffic receives jeeps and tanks

And we wander through this soul, so let it be known
Mama I don't know if I'mma ever be home
The revolution won't have any distribution
I love my son and my music so I gotta keep it moving

Good Times (Sick Pimpin’),Seven’s Travels,2003,"This next one goes out to all the depressed women in the house
Whether you're taking the Prozac, the Xanax or the Paxil
Whatever the hell they put into that capsule
I want y'all to come up to the front of the stage
Grab me a shot of something along the way
Put a smile on the front of your head

Got a thing for them women that don't love themselves
So either loosen up your hair or tighten up your belt
This time, this time is a good time
Good times

You know why she's sitting by the window: she's waiting for her prince to come
And here I am on the opposite side of the room trying to pretend that I'm not that dumb
It goes older, bold, and full of cold, but did I mention that it's well deserved?
No, let's make a mess
No, let's make a baby
No, let's make some hell on earth
Do you mind if I turn out the lights? If I'm going to be alone I'd rather do it in the dark
So I stare at half of a beer, half wishing that the transmission would stay in park
She keeps the music down, so her neighbors don't complain
Keeps the drama up, so she doesn't forget the pain
I keep my momentum inside the reaction
And hide my pride inside of my laughter
It goes


And I'll never forget the day you woke up
To find a whole different world underneath your socks
Forgot to check your pockets before you the checked the cost
Yes ma'am, I saw the sign. No ma'am, I couldn't stop
Drop off, now look who got water on the lawn
Whatever it takes to calm your tongue
If this living room fills with any more faults
I'm going to cut my finger, I'm going to paint these walls
If anybody watched us, they'd probably call the cops
Because it's obvious that neither one of us can adjust
Discussion becomes disgust
If luck was a lady I doubt she would save me from the bumrush
Enough is enough, but how much is too much?
Why am I still just a sheep to your touch?
Why can't I ever fall asleep at dusk?
Why do I need to see everything crushed?
It's a big map girl, it's yours if you ask
If it don't wash up to the shore you won't discover it
Instead, you can hide it in your head with that other shit
And swallow it to chase and follow the suffering
But I'm still smiling, still up to no great
Still trying to relocate
Somewhere I'mma find some work that matters
'Til then all you get is my smirk and my laughter
It goes",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-good-times-sick-pimpin-lyrics

It's like all of Franklin Avenue now sleeps upon my chest (my chest)
I've used cigarette butts and looseleaf to build my nest (build my nest)
Did I mention I appreciate the way you treat your guests? (guess not)
But I'm not really convinced when you say that you're impressed (hell no)
The line between MC and comedian gets a little thinner (little thinner)
Now it's nothing but roughage for lunch and punchlines for dinner (feed me)
I've tried to open the blinds to let in some sunshine
Wound the watch 'til it broke all in hopes of stopping the time

The key broke off in the ignition
Hopping if I wandered off through my thoughts wishing
Hoping this could be for you, but it is for me
Patiently I stay busy, I wait, I see (X2)
It's the sure shot (X6)
Zih Zih Zih Zih Zih

See it's simple (simple), it's not that I want to make it ripple (ripple)
But I feel I'm only being civil (civil)
When I sit back and giggle like the rest as the rhythm manifests
I'm stressed (stressed), but most of 'em would never guess (never guess)
That I'm closing in upon the crest
Why? Cause I think it'd be best for who? To hide the mess from who?
It's all true (it's all true), not good, but I know it'll do (it'll do)
Still trying to reach the kid in you
So I may continue to find why this child proves so wild
I smile (smile), tired, I walked a thousand miles (miles)
Wired over the thoughts I've dialed (dialed)
Inspired by the monsters, the files of life full of stars and stripes

(Chorus End)

I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I don't know what your deal's been lately, but I called you like 15 times
And you just take and take
And you just fuck everyone over in the end anyways
Okay and number 2, being fucked up
Is not an excuse to piss in the goddamn fish tank

What the fuck you did after you got stupid drunk as usual
I don't ever want you in my fucking house
In my fucking car, anywhere near me
It's fucking over, I don't want to talk to you anymore
I don't want to think about you anymore, I don't ever want to see you again

Fuck me? Fuck you. Rot in fucking hell
Fuck you, go fuck yourself

I can't imagine some of the things that you've seen
City to city with no spot to sleep
I know she will run with opposable thumbs
She's trying to overcome the laws of the land
Coast to coast, who knows the most?
Age before beauty, sleep before scrutiny
Who could it be now? Here she comes
With an eve of her tongue and the games that she runs
Little girl dolls never get lost, pay the cost, embrace the flaws
Let her get tossed in the back of a mid-size
Trying to look at life through those kid's eyes
""Jackpot"", that's in quotes
Sometimes you gotta let go if you wanna get votes
But fuck the votes, I spit towards the clouds

Nothing I said, nothing I said, meant a thing to you

Here I am alone in an airport bar
Why? I guess 'cause I don't own a car
It's Valentine's day, I'm returning home from Berkley
Ain't a damn thing none of y'all can do to hurt me
Unsober, laid over in Denver
The waitress could smell it the minute I entered
There's seven shells losing their souls in here
Sporadically placed amongst scotch and beer
But there's one woman in the back left corner
Who looks like she could really use a supporter
If only I could muster the strength to be a friend
Who knows how this adventure could end
Bend me up, slip me the tongue, shoot me down
Cut me loose, bury me, and piss on the ground
Can't help but wonder, what's over yonder
Don't know if I can get down for too much longer
Everywhere I go I find at least one
And I bet it won't die till the travellin's done
For as long as I run, my heart holds a gun
Up to the side of my head, ride and die for the young

Nothing I said, nothing I said, meant a thing to you

It's the sound of emotion enough
To make me wanna hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed
But when I stop to climb the ladder that's embedded in my heart
I start to question all the emotion in my head

When you want the best, you'll never accept anything less
Elements of purpose, true love from the first kiss
Spread it on the surface, sit back and watch the progress

Planted in the middle and outside of your nation
Take the care to build a familiar foundation
Speak to the youth that keep the truth sacred
Free the, free the good inside your heart
Your neighborhood, it needs you to travel with your art
From New York to Cali, some day they'll all know
Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Chicago
Now I've come a long way from the younger days
When I used to look up curse words in my dictionary
If life's a game, gotta choose a side to play
If I gotta pick a position I'mma pick missionary
I've had a little bit too much to think tonight
But it's cool, I'll be alright, just make sure that I keep travellin'
Your reactions only reinforce the previous thoughts
You'd feel the distance even if the bridge was collapsin'
Well, kudos and props and every hollow desire
That you could conjure in an instant that it takes to breathe
I got my Duplos and blocks and Lincoln Logs for when it's time to build
I wait patiently for them to catch up to speed
And I'll be

Plug in the decks, check the mics, fight the wreckage
Keep the, keep the motive in your movement
Let 'em know where you come from and show them how you do it
Children are the focus, give 'em one to grow with
Learn 'em how to take they minutes, turn 'em into moments
See, nowadays cats think they on some next
And they sacrifice they voice just to go over heads (What)
If I felt as if I had somethin special to tell
Why would I work against myself and hide it under my belt?
I used to try to lace the phrases with magic tricks
Every paragraph needed translation attached to it
They saw the style, respected the craft
But all I did was confuse 'em, would try to get 'em to laugh
Painted pictures in the primer, no one got the pulp
Found the humor, the anger, and the insult
Why should I waste any oxygen
Tryin' to find the in-between-the-lines that they get lost within?
I'm out there for the craft, for the cause
The laughter, the applause, the passion for the flaws
The fact that I'mma draw some heads to what I'm feelin'
Lift 'em all up until they try to touch the ceiling
Come on and reach the, reach the masses won by singular
They hold you and they smile when they feel what you can bring to the
Culture and soul that cultivate the flow with
Breath control and he kept it whole
Because piece by piece the picture turns to puzzle
If you lose a few those that remain change into rubble
Freedom is a word not heard from those that own it
Can't fix the machine if you don't have the components
And I'll be


Cause we're not from this planet, we come from somewhere else
And you can't understand it, cause you don't know yourself
But when the time is right, our path will be unveiled

Maybe catch some relief? Place wagers on the theories, keep your eye on my trap

Of course - every act deserves a response

I wish you'd slit your wrist and kiss an electric fence
So the means can finally justify the ends
I stare at you in contempt, you look at me the same
Won't be content till I forget your fucking name
Here I am once again, high out of my mind
Staring at the mirror screaming ""Die motherfucker die!""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-dmfd-die-motherfucker-die-lyrics
The Abusing of the Rib,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"I wanna follow the footprints across my lover's stomach
I wanna call out her name before I plummet
I wish I had a map of the terrain so I could step around the landmines
Avoid the beasts under the bed that bring they bad times
I wanna find this here so-called treasure
The pleasure, the trinkets, the never-ending weekends
Acknowledgin that I'm still just a piece of the sequence
But seein these different footprints got me needin to show my weakness
The timeline, the time zones, I cross them with my eyes closed
Memorized the landmarks and learned the cycles
The weather patterns, how the seasons affect
The East and the West of each region learned the cycles
Forget about the fact that many trails have been tracked
Maybe it's a plus that there's a path
If this was some uncharted land I'd have to be a smarter man
Willing to travel the farthest to unravel the harvest
And natural resources are unlimited
Exploration only requires some desire and initiative
Take your time and find the right way to climb
It ain't safe to play games with natures mind
If I could show you, you would never leave it
And if I could show you, you would never leave it
If I could show you, you would never leave it
And if I could show you, you would never leave it
If I could show you, you would never leave it
And if I could show you, you would never leave it
If I could show you, you would never leave it
And if I could show you, you would never me
I wanna ride a train up my lover's arm, destination the brain
Then climb out and find out what's going on
Cut through trees and ride through rocks
And synchronize the universal sundial to my watch
I've seen a lot, but not quite as much as her
To top it off, the memory and her imagination blurred
But I know she's been put through hell, I can feel it
And I know she's touched heaven as well, tryin to steal it
It came on, it taught her the song
It strung her along and it caught her when that guard was gone
Now to the break of dawn she wants to feel that fix
And all the family and friends is tryin to seal them lips
I'm not dumb, I can hear that train come from miles away
I'm setting obstacles to stop the arrival
I'm gonna blow up that iron and wood road
From what I understood those be the orifice of her survival
My recital, yet another tantrum
Because she's highly excitable swinging moods at random
No happy endings always off to a bad start
Addictive voyeurism to the trackmarks
And if I could show you, you would never leave it

Molly Cool,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"Hi, this is a message for Sean
I don't know if I'm going to be able to deliver this very well
But, um, here it goes
Can't understand the compatibility between a rat and a monkey
Because eight years changes your whole mentality
And can I ask how many times was it your subconscious mind
That made the decision that resulted in the unwanted confrontations
The parking violations and the boy with the Arab Strap?
Listening to the dead air on the radio
Trying to decide which exit to take on the I-94, feeling kinda lost having misplaced the directions
Say still three circles careful not to lair
One week later I find out I've got the whole rest of my life to live
But nothings for certain I could die tomorrow
And I don't know if you know who this is but I can smell the liquor on your breath
I was just wondering if you might like to sit and talk about
I was just wondering if you might like to sit and talk about the carpet and the ceiling for a while. for a while
Wise men couldn't see it in their dreams
But up rose the poets from the speed queens and the weed fiends
Speakings dissected deciphered by the undernourished purists
No longer is it a get over situation
What are you really saying? (Do you think she's listening?)
What are you really saying? (Do you think she's really listening?)
What are you really saying? (Do you think she's really listening?)
Do you think she's listening?
If it makes you feel better, go head
Make me feel small
I know what you're up to baby, build your wall
You think you've seen it all? And life has no surprises
Until you call out my name and return you get (silence)
She's a high plains drifter, loner baby's a rebel
Cool disposition getcha, shows you new level
Crazy, abrasive, enough to make me wanna taste
To figure out what makes it tick so I can dig it out and break it
Curiosity killed the cat but liquor helped me build back all of the confidence dripped
Intrigued by the fact that she could fuck, shower and bounce out my house like that
Left me sleeping with my doubts
Okay, wait I know her steez, self-inspired detachment
Keeps her cold like a breeze, she needs a heated passion
Good bedroom stabbin' break your back kinda fun
Wild, buck, turn the beats up, I'm loud when I cum
And outta no where, she says, ""Word, I'll go there""
""Should we leave now, or do you want to stay a while?"" she says, ""I don't care""
Instant-ly my jacket is on and I'm erect
Get with me, ""Baby where'd you park, let's jet""
Yo, she's the kind of girl that doesn't want no relationship
But damn I think she's kinda cool but damn just be patient kid
Regular basis for sex for quite a while
Puppy chased his tail carded yo he wants the idol now
Never shoulda brought it like that
Cause now when I think about it and look back
I'll never forget the way she laughed when I asked
If the only way I'll ever get to see her is when she's on her back
B-b-but the first time we fucked was shaken
Wild, Digital Underground style, no lies, no exaggeration
""Glad to make your acquaintance, what's your name again?""
""Molly""
""Good golly Miss, here take my digits please call me""
She was cool like that ""Yo how'd you get like that?
I've never had a date that gave me head like that""
And it was said like that and she replied with a ""thank you""
""Before you leave Molly, let me kiss that tattoo on your ankle""
And she was out, didn't see her again for the week no call
And when she see me, no attempt to speak
So like a good bitch I make the example ""Baby, how you been?""
Half an hour later we're in a park, fucking like old friends
Turn on a dome light to get my pants on right
""Travel safe, see your ass around, have a good night"" (bye)
That's it, no conversation, game playin' over some coffee
She's out, moments after she pulled that body off me
I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm so confused
She doesn't seem like the type that's that loose
So maybe she does, realistically I don't know her that well
But if you let me, I'd follow that sexy ass to Hell and back
Tell her that (tell her that)
Yo, you think she's really listening? (x4)
If it makes you feel better, go head
And make me feel small
I know what you're up to
Baby, build your wall
You think you've seen it all?
And life has no surprises

I'd actually lend a little credibility to your statements
But honestly, your penmanship's fucked
The way I see it, someone should at least slap you for even holding a marker
I hope the kid who wrote my name in the entry bathroom
Has the nuts and time for us to sit and chat soon
So I can ask 'em ""Why the fuck am I on your mind bitch?""
You could've signed it, but stayed silent cause you're spineless
If you was a man, you'd come at me on the mic level
But you're light yellow just like the walls on which you write fellow
When I first viewed it, I'll admit it had me quite pissed
But now I've accepted it, in fact I kind of like this
I really wish I knew your identity
Probably not even an emcee, just another who pretends to be
Or maybe the jealousy of one who's baby-baby has eyes for me
It's nineteen-ninety-sev', nothing surprises me
Envy can make a motherfucker immature
So can boredom, a buzz or the curse of being insecure
C'mon now, some little trick with a marker and a chip
On his shoulder don't mean shit, I want the world in my grip
I bet your girl's on my dick, she digs the skills
She's a bigger head than you, so give me head and head for the hills
Little bitch, donkey dick sucking ass-fuck
Glue sniffing, half a testicle base head selling plasma
Publicity, good or bad, the same to an emcee
I think I found your limits to fame over on Seventh Street
I dedicate my name to those who view me as an enemy
And I'mma mark the planet for every mark in the entry
Entry, enter me
What's funny about the whole shit
Is that like two, maybe three years from now
You little cockroaches that talk shit about me and my crew
Are gonna be thanking us for kicking down the door
And putting this shit on the globe
Britches, y'all wanna burn bridges?
Just remember in the back of your bitch mind that I'm partially responsible
For anyone tryna hear your wack ass to begin with
And to that child who writes about me in the Seventh Street bathroom
Thanks for buying our tapes, you can size me up
And I hope your first born never learns how to read

Just seven days
Seven summers old lovely Lyca told

I know a lot of people but not many that I trust
And outta those I trust not many I would touch
They say I talk in circles but I write it line by line
And if I don't really know you I'ma lie and say I'm fine
I spit rhymes hoping that someone who thinks like me
Relates to the emotions interlocked within the psyche
Spit rhymes to catch chicks and catch hope
And catch the ear of that kid who says 'damn that shit is dope' (damn that shit is dope)
Not to mention I love the attention
Went from hidin' in the boxcars to drivin' the engine
And I sit in the same chair under the same light
Around the same time of night when I write
Probably will for life
Twenty-five and I ain't gettin' any younger
Living to survive can you spare a penny brother?
Now in the name of all world wide Rhymesayers
I'ma drive past King park and spray the soccer players

How many licks does it take to get to the center of your universe?

Let thy moon arise while I close my eyes

Finally finalize the line by line of tryin' to climb in between your minds thighs
Self esteem, watch it grow like mold
Watch the loads it holds, as the soul unfolds
Track my faith as I wade through a pack a day
Have to wait call me back next Saturday
Pass the steak I'ma about to stick this vampire
Touch the heart and lay the carcass on the campfire
Burn baby burn and take your cents with ya
If the shoe don't fit ya remove it to lose the business
Get the car started warm it up for the journey
Wake up abuse, and shake of the blues
And make stops to fill the tank, stops to urinate
Stops to meditate and let the thoughts resonate
Stops to celebrate, stops just for heavens sake
Stops in an attempt to take the bent shit and get it straight
The asthma regulates the breath control
So thanks for buyin' the tapes and eat your vegetables
Eh yo I write it for me, and if you like it that's love
And if you don't that's life, 'cause life don't like Slug

Let thy moon arise while I close my eyes

Its the super unleaded, embedded within my head trips
Kept it in check with the skeptics and the essence
When it festers, infection fills with fluid
Apply the pressure it bursts to satisfy the thirst
20/20 sight so I got no excuse
My soul is broken loose, from over use
Tell me who can hold the noose, while I make certain it fits me
Judgement first impression naturally shifty
Each one tried to teach one when it begun
Struggling for freedom, tryin' to build a kingdom
Now your sippin' Seagrams tryin' to fix a threesome
Between you your girl and that freak with the Nissan
Wheels keep spinnin', accelerator sticks
So sugar up the coffee, and celophane your dick
And lace the spliff, but make sure that dosage is right

Fucks and sluts
Bitches scams
Tits and butts

Bitches be creamin for this eight inch demon
And when you hear me screamin, I'm about to free the seamen
Wipe myself off on your couch cover
If she talks any trash I'll flash my box cutters
Cause I'm rougher than any pimp you've had in your life ho
I talk soft, walk tall, carry a rifle
Kill that bullshit cause if baby gets trifled
I'm lacing the liquor with some piss and some Lysol
Roll in a shit-brown Lincoln, eatin' a sticky bun
Spot-check the block, big one is gonna gimme some
Cause I'm a freak, I like the girls with tattoos
I once got busy in a Burger King drive-thru
I take 'em two at a time, make 'em both say my name
Ain't never had three, but best believe that I'm game
And that's the key game, girl I fit words like scrabble
The inner-city cowboy with the thick herds of cattle
Cruisin' lake street, gene pool ridin' shotgun
Got the flyest tricky's from the Mississippi to Boston
I've got a house full of porn to keep the vibe warm
The doors always open honey, come out of the storm
Yo I got daddy's little girls, ones that always stay true
I've got an uptown girl she dyes her pubic hair blue
And I've got a bitch that lives in Kenwood, rich townhouse flavour
She travels on business I'm gettin' down with the neighbors
I got a freak that drives the bus, shows me love with free rides
One hundred hoes in St. Paul but only one from east side
Got a Bloomington bitch with a pool in her apartment
Rug burns all over from fucking her on the carpet
Got the mega-mall hoes, make them all work the food court
Yo hit me up with a chicken soft taco and a couple of Newports
Got a stripper bitch with body jewels and fake titties
And a ho that lives in Fargo for when I escape the city

But my favorite one, out of all of 'em, is YOUR girl
I sway the tongue never once have I been forceful
She lays it on like its a job that she loves
Who's lips is these? the response is always slugs

The Richfield bitches freak the lip gloss and hairspray
Downtown women that like to fuck on the staircase
North side chicks, south side chicks, suburban chicks
Love to open married women up to the pervertedness
Disturbing your relationship, excuse my morals
I'm working with the way I trick 'em out, silly mortals
The words I kick, the sport I play
Now what to say when I'm sittin at this buffet with these tasty morsels


Crusin down the street in my babies mom's caprice
February got the windows cracked, wearin a fleece
Hit the bus depot, yo boo you kinda cute
Gimme nine and a half weeks and I'll have that freak sniffin' too
Distributing cum across the rotten fruited plain
I know its hard being young girl, let me soothe the pain
I understand you baby, straight up I understand
Now lift up your ass so I can pull these fuckin' pants down
The only ones I don't do is those under eighteen
Or at least I keep that shit a secret if you know what I mean
I got sluts that love to give head, and I like to watch
The way they move their tongue up and down my...

Motherfucker! I can't believe your sittin down here
Recordin' some bullshit like this
(Hey man it's just a song, it's just a song, it's like a joke)
Oh, you wanna be a pimp eh? you better take your ass over
To that neglected girl you got there
(Why you always trippin' on me in front....)

With my eyes and ears closed sealed with a clear code
I'm at loss for words, but I know a lot of words for loss
Got a whole lot of excuses to curse and stomp
Fuck you very much and kiss me goodbye
Because I'm leaving on the next high
(all copulatory systems are down) ain't no sex allowed
Now all crowd around me and show me what you found
He got the truth, and she got the groove, and they rape them youth, and he's got the proof
Now, nobody move nobody gets nowhere progress halt
It's all my fault and I don't care
Here I am behold this pale whore
Kinda sore throat blown contours to the core of hell following the course
Endorsed by the force and honey I just wanna hug your curves like a porsche
Go ahead throw them Source back issues on the fire
To fuel the flame get me high lose the blame, let me smile
Tonight's the night crack me a Lowenbrow
And touch my swollen crown when I hold it down
Well on the level of actually she found me flaccid
Skipped class to be fashionably absent
Got me thinking coffee-drinking toss my anger cross the loose-leaf life
Watch me sink into the mind-state, while I'm awake to find fate
Let the pupils dilate fly high like the crime rate
Mosquito bait baby keep me up to date who you love today
Gimme a pound and I'm on my way

""Get out my life woman; you don't love me no more""
""Shake a leg baby girl it's the jackpot""
""Get out my life woman; you don't love me no more""
""Shake a leg baby girl it's the jackpot""
""you don't love me no more"" ""it's the jackpot""

And now I'm mad at that imaginary line that's on the floor
What do you mean we should stay in touch what for?
Not exactly sure but I agree with your motive, the poison took hold
Because the dose was sugarcoated
The world is full of people who want nothing short of perfect
Yet they settle for less, blinded by their quest for purpose
First hit I knew it was for me it made me think here I sink now
And I don't remember why I drink
I gotta pay the phone bill, scrape off the roadkill, hold still
Here's another girl acting like king of the mole hill
Yo step with stride I got this pet named pride
And I'ma-hide him in my pocket til the day that I die
And I've got this pet peeve that I only let out to eat
Poked hole on the top of the jar so he can breath
And when he's old enough I will set him free and let him breed
Teach his kids how to build bombs and shoot speed
True indeed I'm all about the lines around the block
The good times hiphop and writing rhymes about my cock
So fuck the world fuck love fuck man and you
I hope you drown face down in your dandruff shampoo


Thank you for making me creating me sedating me taking me appreciating me
Embrasing me abrasively tasting me and waiting patiently
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free
I wanna thank you for hating me
Frustrating me escaping me sticking that stake in me and blatantly
Breaking me erasing me defacing me and replacing me
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free
She ain't happy when I'm around, she's mad when I'm gone
So I'mma drink this pint of whiskey and go pass out on the lawn
And when she leaves to go to work she'll find me in my stupor
Start my day off with an angel, wreck her morning with a loser
I'm true to the game, don't know the rules to the game
Ruin my shoes stompin through puddles and pools in my brain
I can remove my heart to shave my legs
But no matter how soft I walk I still manage to break them eggs
I wanna thank you for making me creating me sedating me taking me
Appreciating me and embrasing me abrasively tasting me and waiting patiently
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free
I wanna thank you for hating me frustrating me escaping me
Sticking that stake in me and blatantly breaking me erasing me defacing me replacing me
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free

The following program contains explicit lyrics
And we the producers stand defiantly behind the views expressed in the following program

All right, all you players and player haters
Once again it's time for the ""Sep Sev"" game show
Recorded live right here in lovely snowy Minnesota
This is the game where we make the average player a star
Now, if you'll join me, let's give it up for the host of the ""Sep Sev"" game show. That's right, here he is, Mr. Sep Sev...

Alright now, it's time
Beyond, I want you and Ant to hold down the front and main Entrances. Keep your eyes on them security guards
Eyedea, you stay out here and keep the truck going
Yo me and Gene Poole, we're gonna hit up all these sicked up fucks
Everybody get ready, drop your masks and turn the safeties off
Here we go, you ready?
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, fuck the money, everyone on the floor drop
I want all the food in the bag, and I ain't tryin' to hear that sore talk
Stole the dinner and freaked it to the freeway
Flipped the screenplay, and made every love scene a three-way
Sound track recorded here in Minnesnowda
Tastes like ambrosia and disinfects pen holders
Yo, let's hold our breath and show your chest, if you're proud of it
And wake me back to safety if you see me falling out a bit
Under a full moon, the color my jism
You can see you're in the distance, the images riveting
Given the way the clouds moved, it fucked with the lighting
Grabbed me by the thoughts and pulled me tight like a kite string
All right, let's hear it for contestant number one
What's your name sir?
Yo, MC famous, the killer
Okay Mr. Anus Driller, you want to play the next round for a new Lexus with matching socks?
Or a harem of horny Miami based video whores?
Or do you just want to take the phony looking
Fifty dollar bills and run with the money?
Yo, I want the sex man, just give chicks man
Just, just let me touch 'em man!

Now what If I spent, my whole take home percent
On getting bent, and now I can't afford my rent
Do I grab a crowbar to your back door (Back door)
Or hit up Super America for the cash drawer? (Fast forward)
I should be honest, cause even my outer conscience
Knows the odds of blowing up are equal to people
Waking up from sleeping
Keeping me from retrieving kingdoms and bed time stories
Used to bore me with, positioned in the orbit of my imagination
Small portion if even that much, flustered by the drug
Fell in lust with the rush
Hush, maybe somewhere in it I became a cynic
But your sexy grin gets less attractive by the minute
The planets in my head now rotate around the mind
The substance, the bug shit, all in my circumference
And I function like I don't give a fuck if you grasp it
Resent the bitch that don't and cast 'em to the masses;
I asked, ""Is that right?"" I answered, ""Does it matter?""
I was glancing at how you fancy the passion, bastard
How fast you scale the ladder to jump
I'd rather just flunk than gather your junk
(Yo dog, you should blast that punk)
Alright, this next round our contestant is gonna have to slam
A whole bottle of expensive firewater
Chase it with a forty of malt liquor
Smoke a blunt, load a gun and
Sell records to 14 year olds all over the country
And the first one of you genocidal
Fashion fantasy fucks to go platinum wins
Wins what!?
Mr. Announcer, tell them what they'll win!
Well, they'll win respect, lot's and lot's of props!

Pissed on the Asti Spumonte, sippin' Kamikaze
Shoulda called mommy when you saw me pull up in an Omni
The rest of you're life's a flashback when I jump out that hatchback
Here's your tape, give me my cash back
For them wack tracks, and that's that, in fact that's all you need
Either take some kind of lead, or fall to your knees and bleed
How's your scene?
And how's that rental running?
And how's the weed selling?
And how's the demo coming?
Yo, yo, yo, me and my participants
Be the reason why you and your crew bit your lips
Stick this in your mouth to cleanse it
The fuckin' props is too expensive
Make's me want to end it (Repent kid)

My advice is from here on out you purchase yellow boxers
That way when your bitch does your laundry
She won't tell her moms about the stains created
When I skated across that flat service you refer to as lyrical endowment
That content, that conscience
Run down on that trial, woof, woof

When speakin lashes to the tongues of father's demons semen
Somehow catered to the whims of later stood
Check the youth, shoot like stormtroopers theorizing Darth Vader hood
Gave a good thumbs up type of scream
To symbolize the arrival
Cause we've arised from the dream
With a red beam that fastens to my chest
Wearin' a string of beads of sweat
Decorating this helmet that shelters and protects my laptop
The brain contains the game
And the fast talk
More traffic than the average vagrant's favorite crack spot
Last stop
To catch a breath for twenty miles
Cause this field is filled with more snakes
Than MC's that fake their freestyles
Your optimism, is far from natural
Caught the label of asshole
Cause I'm twice as tight as the rest, this rappin's vaginal
Stand clear, cause when my shit comes, the big fun
Pushin' up in and out of your bitch system like a piston
Glistening, in the twilight, hill top, with his ability, stablility
And shoot my spunk on your soliloquy
The children see right through the smoke screen
The mist around your own soul provoking, your own choking

Era '97 the haters smash the tribe of Set
New ward, what are the most important things in life?
To crush enemies? To see them driven before you?
And to hold the head of opponent MC's, in your bare hands
Haha

I'm a co-founder
And one that likes to lounge on
Overcrowded spots so I can find someone to clown on
A hound dog, sniffin' out the unwanted
I said I'd let you live, but I never could keep a promise
With a lot of shit in my cottage
Come to my store, tryin to fight
Get fucked like Marcellus Wallace
The BE calls it, anybody wanna, wander, on to the stage and try ta Cha Cha
Blah blah, that's all I'm hearin
From the opposition. Just a buncha cocky dissin, ya kiddin
Wanna battle, huh?
Last two times
Mc's were found dead
In a fast food line
Mash you, I'mma mash you (who them?)
Yeah that crew
Separate the bitches like a capsule cause they fragile
Knock em off the saddle
Make em flip to the leaves
And they'll wake up paralyzed like, Christopher Reeves
Take a breath, here quick
Take one more
Before you finally realize that ya layin' in the morgue
This is the core, of the underground
Listen cause I'm sayin' somethin' now
The BE, only one allowed

Steel is not strong...flesh is strong
You understand me boy?
Watch, watch this, you you, come here, come here
Come to me, come to me, witness this

I'm kind of conservative when it comes to this rap shit
Cause when I glance across the surface all the words is written backwards
And actions speak much louder than your heavy rotation
I'll rock a crowd that's never heard of us, on any occasion
No longer patient
You got my cranium Achin
Prepare my awareness
And start to measure up these square pegs
To figure out which crescent wrench it's gonna take
To beat this stake into my skull
To numb, and dull this headache
Fiberglass rappers leave with cracked brains
Shattered names line the hallways of all the ways I came
Contained under lids, locks and a two headed dog, with a sawed off
Is where Ant makes the breaks to get your rocks off
Molotov tossed into the ring of lost causes
Formerly known as MC's (southside lost provisions)
Cause it's more cost-efficient to kill the bad apple and save the core
Then to let nature run it's course, of course
You cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet
(Cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet)
Cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet

I never had the skills that it took to sell weed
I was too generous, too understanding of your needs
As far as school, I lacked the motivation for the occupation Preparation
Guess I'll never catch that bacon
I need to find a duty doing sales or some shit
Cause I was always good at talking people into dumb shit
Fuck it, just program some drums
I'll be honest to myself and take the wealth if it comes
Run baby, run baby
Because its metro its destined to ruin
Let go of that echo, baby what are you pursuing?
Priorities are twisted and heads not on straight
I think I'm gonna pop if I don't stop and take a long break
And find time to reflect, I need to take a second
Quit breaking my neck to get this fat paycheck
Because money is the root of all people
Ayo most people are evil so I'm on a roof shooting at bald eagles
Adrenaline, mescaline, ephedrine and apple sauce
Ain't no way to hang a platinum records on these padded walls
Every man's a faggot and all women are sluts

Somewhat exotic how a lotta these cats went about it
And when they got crowded let the boundaries clouded
I doubt that if they only knew how I was coming through
Probably be the oasis they was running to
Fashion, the lifestyle, around the fashions and lifestyles
Of entities you don't know much less trust judgment
Judgmental, the soldier with the common pencil
So say what's up when you see me on the bus
Ayo, the worst is yet to come, in fact its on its way
You better go and get you some before there ain't no more today
And hey I'll be just fine, trying to bust rhymes
Got my eye on my son and my hand on my nine o' clock
The clock stops, for everybody that you know that got shot
And eight o' clock the seconds get hesitant for every cat that went in an accident
And seven o' clock time stands still for everyman killed by the planet's build
Consumed by the elements, water, earth, wind, fire
When I die I wanna go like that, fuck the devil's development

Funny Colors In My Mushroom Trails,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"Oh my God..
What's going on?
Oh no...

Oh why, did I try, to take that whole quarter-pound of philablue psilocybin?
Now, I've been trippin' for about ninety-six hours
I devoured the whole bag
And I feel I'm about to gag
Into to the porcelain goddess
Honestly, my eyes are swollen red
I took four gallons of OJ to the head
Now I'm more than half dead
More like ho dead, undead walkin zombie banshee
Antsy from all these vital ticks and twitches
Wishes of new visuals
An individual light streams to stop they crews
And all these creams and blues
And mabs, guavas, lime greens
I've seen less strange things in a scream kaleidoscope
I've tried to cope with the trips, but it just makes it worse
Cause if ya try to concentrate you envision yourself up in a hearse
Or even worse, insects crawling in swarms it's a riot
The ceilings melting at the Hyatt
Why don't you try it...
Why don't you try it...

I took the advice gobbled heads and stems
Swallowed vitamin-C enriched grapefruit liquid just to cleanse
My phlegm it's been half an hour since I ate 'em
I still can't lose the aftertaste from the bloomers
Tell me why did I take 'em
My man told me I would dig 'em
Asked me to roll with em I did 'em
Now I'm a victim
Stomachs getting sick from the tightness
It's like a vice grips, aaaahhh, why do you like this?
Somebody turn on the lightswitch, aaaahhh
How'd you talk slug into fucking with this drug
Shit's stuck between my teeth
And I'm breakin nuts anticipating the buzz
And then the hot flash hit like the sun
Honestly, I wanted to be done
My man promised me it would be fun
Did I eat too many? Did I jump in too fast?
How long's this shit last?
Everyone take off ya mask, I lost my grasp
I don't mean to eat and run on the 16th pound
But fuck that, I'm outta here
Barefoot, January, Lake street, eastbound
...Why don't you try it?
Using our 20th century, uh, concepts
We would say he'd either was demented or schizophrenic
Uh, he has clearly the symptoms of a delirious state
There's a great disturbance of affects including fear and rage
He has intimate periods of being incoherent and irrational and he hallucinates, uh
He has lucid intervals
...He misidentifies people around him
He even has moments of being uncertain about himself
As is characteristic of a delirium, uh..
It's associated with fever
He lapses, then, into a deep sleep which he recovers with a
Apparent return of irrational faculties

Heart,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"""You see, what you mistake for madness is just over acuteness of the senses
And now it came to my ears a low, dull sound
Such as a watch makes when wrapped in cotton
I knew that sound too. It was the beating of the old man's heart.""
Man, I'm telling you some motherfuckers just have no kind of heart man
Serious man, motherfuckers man, these motherfuckers have no self respect and shit man
I don't wanna pay no dues, just wanna drop like a fucking LP tomorrow..
And then to top it off, these motherfuckers, they don't have no heart to their music, you know what I mean?
Sound like little girls and shit..

If you respect yourself
If you respect yourself
If you respect yourself
If you respect yourself

Do you--
Now, it started off rather basic
Just some small scale dabblin' confined to the basement
Never knew I'd grow into this full time user
Never figured that I was a winner or a loser only did the due to
Have fun and only got with a crew
Because it seemed natural to have one
Capture the life in the form of the grip around the mic hold it
Right like a love hold it tight with plight fortifies my
Existence reinforces my position in this course that I'm sticking to my path now
I can see it all laid out in my past while trying to catch what it's about in my last breath
Pull the toxins in, and I bet death's about to box me in, but before this bitch comes to get some
I'mma do my job on this m-i-c, and feed you a thick one

You can have all the heart in the world, doesn't mean I'm gonna respect ya
I'm getting older and I'm knowing better
You can have all the heart in the world, doesn't mean I'm gonna respect ya
I'm getting older and I'm knowing better

Let a, pissed rapper step to this captain and get up off your
Head kid, 
I'll bitch smack Hugh Hefners

Now, I'm about to put a slug in
Show business and if everything goes right, I'm leaving no witness
I hold this inside the chest, so big it hardly fits it trips between a true fan of party
Shits quick to lace the track with substance for all the young guns that's really listening
At the functions so you can love it or leave it, fuck it or keep it, either way
I'll be here trudging through the deep shit
I've done well over one hundred cuts and gotten the feed back of love
From some of the ones I've touched and thus, I'm not quitting never stop rippin' you gotta be kiddin' shit
He's on a mission is it possible the mics got my soul?
I'll make them all say ""Ho!"" and Rhymesayers
Rock the show let 'em know that it's more than a career goal
Cut that zero and let the hero in your ear hole, yo!


Emcees please excuse the ""Q's"" and ""P's"" but I grew up on 
BDP
, 
EPMD
, 
Run-DMCs
I don't believe you should hold a mic and rolled up with a bus full of friends that think alike
I'm having a hard time trying to keep it simple just for the fuckers that don't seem to read between the ripples
It's all nipples and clits in this rap shit, catch a licking if you lay back passive bastard
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all, art imitates life and most of it is wack y'all

Choking on the Wishbone,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"This one goes out to all of those that want success
Wait, not just the ones that want it
This goes to those that feel they deserve it
And this one goes to all of those that make the moves
And those that have paid the dues
To all of those that walk the fine line on the edge
To all the heads about to break it loose
And you don't want to come close to feeling it
Initial reaction like ""Yo, I don't give a shh...""
After a minute within it, they start to think
""Why the hell they didn't get it, did they not hear what he speaks?""
They don't know me, it's best that way
Let 'em look for tomorrow in yesterday
And let me strain my lungs for the love of popping amps
Let me spike the ball because I don't like to dance
Let me paint a picture on the surface of your mind
I got a job at the circus and I quit writing rhymes
Now I travel from city to city, life of a gypsy
Gravel, grass, concrete, folklore and mystery
Yo, looking at my Gucci, it's about that time
For me to pawn this piece of junk and try to pay some of these fines
Fly angel fly, don't ever look back
You better scoop that dead rat off the track, go home and cook that
Maybe you should trade that Mustang for a Jeep
So when you get too drunk to drive, you'll have a dry place to sleep
Don't forget what chocolate milk does to the hangover
Come on, who you think cut the tires on your Land Rover?
Twist the nobs and chew the fat off the shish kebab
Ditch the lard that cut my hair and made me quit my job
And if I pass before they get a chance to hear me
Tell 'em ""Kiss my ass"" and teach 'em all about my theory

Choking on a wishbone,
 position blown out the frame
Pissed on the remains to mark the spot and spark the flame

It never settles, the constant grinding of metal
Against complicated timing, developing my threshold
Touching the 
gestalt
 with a little reverb and some echo
To add extra flavor like pesto
Yo, the cards are dealt and now I'm staring at my hand
Looking for something to toss, tryna find a spot to stand
The anger felt as I look across the land
It doesn't equal to the eagerness and hunger to expand
Move past, the barrier is set, the previous sets
Carry me through the meaninglessness
Here I am with the word extracting nerves
Running toward the stage (here we go) to watch the crash occur


Put your head on the pillow and shut your eyes
Take your mind out the ghetto and touch the sky
Then come ease down that much feared trail of blood, sweat and love
Instead of flame, crying tears in the rain
The thunder came, and it drowned out the hunger pains
Numbed the brain and played life like a numbers game
Poppa needs a new pair of nuts, cause he lost touch
With the last ones fastened to the bottom of his guts
Yo, they don't know me, it's best that way
Let 'em look for tomorrow in yesterday
This child is your fate so let 'em play
I bet I know your age and I can guess your weight
Wait, wait, how can it be so simple and straight?
And why the hell ain't you tripping to make some ripples in the lake?
I can't figure it out, for God's sake arguing a lost case
As it irritates my prostate, and when I sit home alone
I kick over the telephone and catch my zone inside the dial tone

Aight, its a stick up

You, put cha fuckin hands up
Put cha hands up (repeats)

Please refrain from screamin' this evenin'
Even though it might ease the pain your receivin'
When I squeeze that brain
Mayday mayday
They say its the quiet ones you gotta look out for
Dont cha kno
Pushin big words through a little hole with leave your mouth tore
'till the kids learn
Turnin' around and puttin' their head down
And saving um from burnin' in my circles eternally
Infernal, purple clouds pour acid rain and it drowns your perception of a classic
That's the same classic that has 300 parts and there all on MTV
When I see that video and all those different versions
I'm turnin' off the TV when it starts
I feel nauseous cuz its awful rotten old coast
Blah flow, dumb sound somehow got him dope

How is it you feel as if you can afford to ignore the visit
Come and catch a glimpse of persistence
The momentum builds and the allied forces get stronger
The breathing lasts longer beyond the patterns of you
The team designated to replace the jaded emotions of all these here player haters
Brainwashed in this ocean
The new devotion is the same as the old one
Lyrical bliss
Lyricist
Tryin' to get up in every city like twist
Wait, wait, wait
Break me down to a science
Bitch, save your energy
One part stress, one part Jacob
One part destiny
And Im here, and those that knew me
Knew I would be
Overcast was a buzz, big ups to those that took me
Now look me in the eye and tell me y'all ain't high
Cuz I believe there needs to be some fists in the sky

You too, put your hand up bitch",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-stick-up-lyrics

Warm beer, cold women
I just don't fit in

It goes 1, it goes 2, it goes
3-2 red dog in the hoodie
Too much ""person"" in your ""ality"", the friction could be
Should we continue with dialogue as I study these new faces
I would fix my shoe laces, but the room place was
Shoes cut loose at the front door
Got dirty socks, I'm on the floor
And thoughts is what I hunt for
Driftin in and out of conversations I know nothing about
Fuck your topics, I didn't come to see you
But yo I'm here, might as well make the worst of this warm shitty beer
And I'm nursin it, and cursin it
I'm sick of it, but still grippin it and sippin it
Hopin it'll dull the pain of the sight of your lips flippin' shit
So here I sit, inside my atmosphere
I don't know a single motherfucker here
But maybe that's my fear
Pull out my notebook and let go

Not so pleased to meet you
And I hate techno

Catch one in the left lung I hope the Cherokee parks by itself tracksmart
Act like you part of this you'll find yourself victim of the rhyme bombardment
Weak shit, I have no tolerance
I write the best rhymes in my sleep
Dreamland beats and freelance techniques fuckin' up the sheets
Ink spots, puss spot niggas tryin to stop this
Think not get ? and listen for your bank knock
We do a lot of this activity in my city
Get a job in my world, join a futuristic commitee
We consist of three, had to be persistently equal
In order for it to work out in a balance
Which comes down to a question of natural talents
Can't keep those gifts isolated in tablets
It's not about rap ballads, or who can flow the best
What kind of dressing you gonna have with your life salad? (Hmmm...)
French...yes..thank you very much..On to the next

Yo, you rappers elude me but that's nothing new
I still stick to my duty, to kick something true
Still if you wanna boo me we can do this in a circle of peers
Tell your bitch to kick a beat so I can work you to tears
I've made a room full of strangers throw hands in the air (Man)
I know you sense danger, I can see it in your stare (Man)
Don't provoke anger when the mic's in my hand
Cause if I get that spark I'm quick to rip apart your plans
Yo Ant, let's keep this one accessible
Take the fruits that wanna test these bros and make 'em vegetables
Just to let 'em know that the core stays pure
Pissed off all the local rappers so it's time to go on tour
I'm sure, so I never break a sweat when a fake steps
Instead I break that snake's neck and take his rep
Half the time half of 'em don't catch the rhymes
They need they friends wit to show 'em how we wax behinds
Please fool, hella stupid I'm assuming probably
Couldn't even rock your own family reunion and I'm through with the politicking
Rhymesayers on a mission
, watch the following thinking, motherfucker!

I stick two fingers through his nostrils and a thumb through his mouth
And swing em' like a bowling ball make 'em strike the fuck out
Take a hook and stab it through his back and curve it around his spine and throw em out
By the lili pads and wait for a hit on my line (Damn!)
Cause this rap shit makes me wanna catch niggas like catfish
Chop 'em up into steaks and sop 'em up off the plate with biscuits and rice
I put the hand of the one that likes to hold mics in a vice
Make sure he never writes in his life
When it's time for me to display (Stay the FUCK out the way)
And when its time for you to DJ you going play what I say
The word for the day is ""Fette"" cash lessons
Get ready to mash when I give the word don't ask questions
Pack yo shit, dont smack yo bitch
Leave peaceably cause these'll be vital elements of livin' feasibly
? the urban ? mocha latte, Saint Paul nigga rocking the uptown partay like coca angel vatte
I provide that mental rush and that physical feeling like yo' whole worlds being dusted
Be hushed when you see me in deep thought
Hand clutched interrupt and you just might be caught then crushed

Yo, yo, I quit fronting, really-really
I know wrong and right, wrote my songs, shed light to promote a longer life
When I reflect at night, I seek light in the confusion
I stick to the music and skip the baggage of delusion
Managed to come through and I'm in the minimalism, yo
The damage is due it's time to climb to catch a vision
Yo, I've had it with you, and the terms which I work cause it matter to you
The flight's cursed, I might burst challenging who?
Balance the mood, yo Stress, let's gather the crew
Commence to wreck shit then exit, I'd rather that you
Throw your hands in the air
And if that's too demanding you can stand there and stare",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-tracksmart-lyrics

The tapes will grow so we can buy posters and staples
I bet that kid Slug will bust flows, if you ask nice
It's Friday night, point me to the party wanna grab mics
Used to get queezy when it was time to rock that Peavey
But nowadays I'm just trying to get Musab away from the TV
Cause I can't fuck with the Zenith, I rather criticize Tuesdays releases
With the elitists at the fetus
Yet, another factory film is what we present
Surrounding, bitch needed a ballpoint, no grievance
Let's all point our fingers towards the path we venture
Minneapolis natives taken the rap of winter bad contender
Let me catch a lukewarm triple mocha to reach the speed
Of the graff writer thats crashed on my sofa
And in the green room is emcees and in the kitchen is dirty dishes
And my position: blurry vision
And I'm livin' in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powdered sniffin' kids is posin' talkin' shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the main room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living, but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the role of Jesus, got the part of ""Jerk""
Armed with a walkman and a fake grin and a basement mindstate when I--

Simply took a left at Nicollet
Sucking on a cigarette did some binge hits before I left
And now the nicotine is liftin' it
Choke at the last drag and flick remains at the gutter
Flip up the hood just to keep the brains covered
I'm trying to grow a mountain out of a foothill
I see people rockin' my t-shirt, and I'm still shopping at Goodwill
In a struggle, in a warzone, grew some extra personality
Now I won't have to flee or fight alone
The microphone: that's my weapon and I'm on a quest for Heaven
Or rent me some comprehension
It's busy as fuck, just gimme a three hour lead (Hour lead)
So I can reflect maybe rent a flick and re-learn how to read
The weed turn out the sleeves and found a bunch of tricks
And used a cleaver to relieve all these unnecessary limbs
Misplaced the gems and jewels I meant to give you
To lift you, and lost my mind inside the issue
And now I live it in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powdered sniffin' kids is posin' talkin' shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the name room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living, but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the roll of Jesus, got the part of ""Jerk""
Armed with a walkman and a fake grin and a basement mindstate when I think--

Now, I got spies positioned at various Cheapo's around the city
Lots of people that's down with me cause the evils out to get me
It's easy to decipher who can taste me
A lot of locals used to hate me, but now I think the tolerate me
You can only hear what I feel when my eyes are shut
Mistakes are piling up, excuses: they lining up
I'm trying to fuck reality, but I'm impotent I can't get it up
Cause she's a duck and her personality sucks just my luck
I caught the wrong bus guess I'll get off at the crossroads
And take a long lunch
Next month when I got my head right I'mma grab a lead pipe
And beat some life into this dead mic
So let the tape roll and extract all the juices
Read the hate mail in the bathroom and place wages on the losers
In the beginning, you can't help but wanna be innovative
But eventually the opposition leaves you jaded
Like hell no (Hell no), I don't wish I was a baller
I'm six foot three, there ain't no need for me to be any taller
I just wish those cats over there at Fobia would hit me off with some free gear or somethin'

Join me, sit down, sit down
I wanna tell you 'bout something, I got a story or something

I knew this girl named Roulette-lette-lette
The coolest woman I ever met, met, met
I never tried to hook it up, up
But I used to fantasize about the guts
Fuck, bust nuts, rush
Grab the gold and carry it in your mouth
But I'm a try to hold the microphone and turn the party out
And if it's the type of crowd that doesn't like to shout, fuck it
I'll give 'em something to chew on, something to talk about

Adjacent to that vacant lot, next to the weed spot
Sits a headshop, beneath a tree watching peace talks
So let me catch a round of applause
So maybe I can persuade some lady out of her bra (come on baby)
Ladies and gentlemen...
We now ask that you give a warm Minnesota nice welcome to MC
I've gotta be your man on the mic, you know...
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
Put your hands together, put your hands...

Cause if we can't do it together
We'll do it apart
Ain't no way we'll ever make it how it was at the start
But that's a given
Now within the distance of your vision measure the persistence
How are you living?

I'll smack the whack and sell 'em crack
While I'm laying down my mack
(I'm trying to tell you homeboy)
I'll get sick on a trick, talking shit firm grip on my dick
(Ayo bitch I got what you need bitch, yo, yo)
I make moves and get loose wearing a camouflage goose
(And that's juice, like what, what, what, what)
Yes, yes, I never stress
Make a mess on the mic sipping a Becks, wearing a vest
Cause well, you know
It's that Rhymesayer with a razor, truck jewelry, Chuck Taylors
(Yo man, pass that blunt kid, yo kid, kid)
Tall sharp and handgun,
 paid a ransom for these pants dun
So step off kid you're playing me too close

If we can't do it together
We'll do it apart
Ain't no way we'll ever make it how it was at the start

Killed all the thoughts about killing all the cops
No longer get as pissed off when I have to jerk my dick off
I just want a mic and a crowd and if that's asking for too much
Fine, lemme just have that mic and I'll be alright (I'll be alright)
Stuck, between a rock and the sky
With an option to buy and I got lost in a lie
Tossed them fakes out the door, I ain't your whore
I make music, can you feel it?
Cool, then I'm a make some more
Yes, yes ya'll you are now rocking with the best of the mess hall
En route to the basement, while Ant drives the vessel
All apologies to those insulted
By the repulsive vultures that fly loose when I'm seduced by the impulses

Defense mech in effect, protect the rep
From all forms of public infliction
But listen I love the ripping, so fuck the friction it takes focus off what's the mission
(Yo tell 'em what's the mission)
To be the man on the mic, to be the man on your mind
To be the man that made you push rewind
To be that mother fucker over there on that mic
You know what that means?
That means I can show you what I need you to see, see, see
(See here, what you need to do is follow, follow us baby
Before you can... what you need to do is see, see, see, see, see)

If we can't do it together
We'll do it apart
Ain't no way we'll ever make it how it was at the start

I never would have introduced you to booze and skipping school
Cause right now I feel responsible to find an answer
Yo, yo, back in junior high when you and I started getting high
Life was just a joke, we was too young to know the punch-line
And you would sooner die then realize you're running out of time
Who's to decide there's no more recess after lunch-time
Bam, here you am, intoxicated again
Yo, how you doin' man?
Yeah it's good to see you
Bam, here you am, intoxicated again
He used to be my man, understand?
I believe you've slightly exceeded (slight exceeded)
How many of them drinks that you think you need when
You're trying to boost the bonus points and reinforce your voice
But I'm not trying to walk within your obnoxiousness (hell naw)
We used to be friends back in the day when you had direction
But that was before your brain felt that infection
And I ain't claiming innocence
I was right there with you then
I'm just sayin'
While we was waiting to move up, some of us grew up
We all knew what the difference between wrong and right was
Sometimes the line blurred, when we was influenced by a light buzz
But from what I see, you've established the persona
Basis, built from foundation, for emulating the genre, drama
Without taking a moment to ponder, the trail of karma that you've weaved
Through the field that you've wandered
No longer am I shocked by the things you do
I'm just confused as to why it's gotta be me to confront you
I guess nobody else gives a damn
So I gotta go for self, cause I'm a man
Understand?
And you can take it as concern
Or you can see it as your ego getting burned
Either way, tonight yo, one of us is gonna learn
And I guess nobody else gives a damn
But see I do
Because you used to be my man, understand?
And even if it means you beat me down to the cement
It's all love, I need to see you stick around until the end
Bam, intoxicated again (right?)
Bam, intoxicated again (cause I'm a man, understand?)",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-a-tall-seven-and-seven-lyrics
Write Now (Multiples #4),Headshots: Se7en,2005,"Went from the papermate to the spray paint
And all the way back to the Papermate
Run through the fate, excuse me
Went from the papermate to the spray paint
And brought it all the way back to the papermate
Thanks for buying the tape
Excuse me my- excuse me, my friend
Is that your pen?
Is it cool if I use it to duel with my skeletons?
Is it proper for me to use it to prosecute these people?
Is it wrong for me to caress it against my ego?
Eh yo, can I use a ball point just to make my small point?
Are these mechanical joints anything like hollow points?
Old fashioned number two and I need that shit quick and steady
But that's assuming I ain't chewed off the eraser tip already
If I touch a felt tip, believe I'm 'bout to make hell flip
Computer friendly only cause that deadly bitch helps me spell shit
Scribble, for the you, the me, the she and the politicians
Aerosol to the wall, write it tall for all Division
Yo, he wrote it in jail, she wrote it in braile
I wrote that shit, named it, recorded it
Eh yo, I got one for sale
And if I truly feel I got something to show ya
I pull out a blank sheet of loose leaf and draw it out in crayola
I've grown to keep an extra utensil in my sock
And I've been known to mark it on the sidewalk with chalk
Most times I write with a pen, sometimes I write with a buzz
And if I ever go gold, I must have wrote that shit in blood
And if I ever go gold, I must have wrote that shit with blood
And if I ever go gold, I must have wrote that shit with blood
And if I ever go gold, I must have wrote that shit with blood

Advanced Communications,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"The candles flicker, you handle your liquor
The nerves quiver, wish my band had some stickers
That I could give ya
Blistered, from a, endless list of complaints
Tainted, consumed, fainted in a room full of paint fumes
Fell naked, but tell me how far can I take it
Ingrained in my brain, hold the pain like it's sacred
Snow fall covers all, that's immobile
I try to bring the plow, but it tends to come out boastful
Kill the sayer-hatin', and kill the flavor-fakin'
Partake in that forsaken game, FUCK YOU and your neighbor Satan
Now waken
The early bird apprehends the serpent
Gotta catch the train, ma, gonna join the circus

Call it love, call it skill, call it what you will
I don't give a fuck just call us up so we can build

Yo, I got your interest, pessimistic, guinea swined
Over exerted emotion to he point of feeling fine
Inner mind travel: when I awoke, the feet hurt
Scared to drive, scared to fly
I wrote the speaker wired
When the rival is desired
I'm smiling at the fire
That's contrived in and inspired in the eyes of desire
When it cries, ""Take me higher!""
I look across the globe and fantasize of what's dope and drop my low
Set baby, with the head gravy
Better get lazy, cause if you step, you get wrecked baby
Yet maybe I should feed'em line like trout
Put my rhymes in they mouth, that's what I'm about
Truth be told not from the new or the old
I'm from the now watch me while I make your whole crew explode
Super nova style, hold your pin to the mat
From the grin to the chin to the limbs to the back
In a fist full of steel I express how I feel
Blinded by work searching for the best kind of deal
Gotta find the angle in a circle of hopeful
Apply a choke hold and set the locals running in ovals


Sluggo!
Yeah, this is Aaron
Umm, newel, I mean, I mean, yeah
I mean, like uhh, I don't have anything in the mail yet, man
And I'm like, eager to do my verse again and stuff because
Because I've been taking testosterone pills
Umm...so like, hi
Where is it? Give me a call
And, uhh, if you caught me last weekend on your phone from my cell, umm, yeah
I was kinda, piss loaded drunk and stuff, and I can't even remember what I said
But my girlfriend had to remind me I called you

The Jackpot/Swept Away,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"Starin over that strech
Into the horizon
With my eyes and ears closed
Sealed with a clear coat
I'm at a loss for words
But i know a lot of words for loss
I got a whole lotta excuses
To curse and stomp
F**k you very much and kiss me goodbye
Because i'm leaving on the next high
Ain't no sex allowed
Now all crowd around ma
And show me what you found
He got the truth
And she got the groove
And they raped the youth
And he's got the proof
Now, nobody move
Nobody gets nowhere
Progress halt and its all my fault
And i dont care
Here i am
Behold this pale whore
Kinda sore throat bloke on tour
Thru the core repell
Followin the chorus
Indorced by the force
And honey i just wanna hug ur curves like a porsche
Go ahead throw them sore issues back on the fire
To feel the flame
Get me high
Lose the blame
Let me slide
Tonight's the night
And crack me a low and brown
And touch my swollen crown
While i hold it down
Yo, on the level of actually she found me flacid
Skiped class to be fashionally absent
Got me thinking
Caught me drinkin
Tossed my ink across the loos leaf like
Watch me sink into the mind state
Of how imma wait to find fate
Let the pupils dialate
Fly high like the crime rate
Mosiquito bate, baby keep me up to date
Who you love today
Give me a pound and im on my way
Now im at it that imaginary line thats on the floor
What do you mean we should stay in touch, what for?
Not exactly sure
But i agree with your motive
The posion took over
'cause the dose was sugar coated
The world is full of people
Who want nothing short of perfect
And yet they settle for less
Blinded by their quest for purpose
First hit
I knew it was for me
It made me think
Her i sink now
Now i dont remember why i drink
I gotta pay the phone bills
Scrape off the road kill
Hold still
Here's another girl acting like king of the mole hill
Yo, step with stride
I got this friend named PRIDE
And imma hide him in my pocket
Till the day that i die
And i got this pet peeve
That i only let out to eat
Poked holes in the top of the jar so he can breath
And when he's old enough
Imma set him free and let him breed
Teach his kids how to build bombs and shoot speed
True indeed
Im all about the lines around the block
Good times
Hip hop
And making rhymes about my cock
So f**k the work
F**k love
F**k man and you
I hope you drown
Face down
In your dandruff shampoo
Thank you for making me
Creating me
Sedating me
Taking me
Appreciating me
Embracing me
Abrasivley tasting me
And waiting patiently
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free
I wanna thank you for hatin me
Frustratin me
Escaping me
Stickin that stake in me
And blatenley breaking me
Erasing me
Defacing me
And replacing me
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free
She ain't happy when i am around
She's mad when im gone
So imma drink this pint of whiskey and go pass out on her lawn
And when she leaves to go to work
She'll find me in my superstar
My day off with an angel
Wreck her morning with a loser
I'm true to the game
Don't know the rules to the game
Ruin my shoes
Stomp into all the puddles and pools in my brain
I could remove my heart
Shave my legs
But no matter how soft i walk
I still manage to break the eggs
I wanna thank you for making me
Creating me
Sedating me
Taking me
Appreciating me
And embracing me
Abrasivley tasting me
And waiting patiently
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free
Yo, i wanna thank you for hatin me
Frustratin me
Escaping me
Stickin that stake in me
And blatenley breaking me
Erasing me
Defacing me
Replacing me
I promise to pay you back on the day we're free
Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmas feel the beat
Umm drooop
Boom
Its the way she moves that broom that's got me consumed
And it ain't got nothing to do with the sleeping
It's the look on her face thats got me displaced
Plus the fact that she's prolly got no clue that im peepin
She's deep into routine
Cleanin off the sidewalk infront of the shop she works
1:15 am
Me,parked in the car in the street
Maybe 30 feet from the spot she sweeps
Emotion taken, who is this human
And why she chewin' my attention
The action, unaware, innocent, purely accident
And whom I askin this?
I'm alone, in the passenger seat of this this part is bleeped out
Awaitin' my companion, but damn man, she's got me distracted
And it's not just the fact that she's attractive
It's the whole kit-n-kabootle
From the look on her face, to her taste in shoes, to the way she moves
It inspires me to sit and doodle, so
While I write
She wipes down the tagged up picnic tables outside of the bleeped out
It's missin not a spot
And here I sit again, with a pen
And a desire to be entirely lost in a world of them ..

To the Break of Sean,Headshots: Se7en,2005,"You rap for a living but you wish you could sing

Ayo Ma
People are starting to support the music
Self-esteem getting a little boosted
Me and Derek, we made a record, a lot of our friends bought it
RSE, we built a label and heads caught it
Yo Mom, I'm grinning
But most the time it's fake
Too much on my head, it makes the thoughts ache
For God's sake Sean, take a capsule, painkiller, Advil
Tame your bad self, quit being an asshole
Hey Moms, I could use, just a few more hours of sleep, I think I need to push snooze
There's no way I can lose, cause it's not a game
I'm confident; no matter where I land it's all the same
It's all insane
And I'm beginning to adapt
Stepping around the potholes, time-bombs, and mousetraps
And when I fall flat I'll smile
I gotta go, I'll call you back
I'm teaching Jacob how to freestyle

Tell everyone I'm doing alright Mom
It goes ""To the Break of Sean""

Beyond and Slug got the shit you love
So go to your tape store and pick up the dub
It's the barge baby (you can touch it if you want)
It's the barge baby (yo, yo, you can touch it if you want)
 + (Slug)
Yo, check it out
After I lacerate, what you think you coming back to take?
You aggravate tryna bite me, but I don't feel it
My philosophy is to keep all the lock and keys
Everything I got, conceal it, so they don't steal it
I'm stuck in poverty, but I keeps my head banging
So my kind of life keeps me aware of the trifling
(Bitch, you bitch) Is that the only thing you pay attention to?
And if it wasn't then I probably wouldn't mention you
It's like that, listen (money) now to flock in
But I told you (use your brains) my SoundScan's dropping
There's only two options, huh, die while grovelling
Or be a man and stand to these bitches and coward men
Now and then it's gonna happen, you can believe me
So retreat before the barge comes to street sweep
Slug and Beyond, thus dawn of the end
Snatch your family, your friends before the monsters descend
We've been planning to take the world for a long time now
(It's time now) so all opposition lie down
I'm dying to plague the world and every city and angel
Let's cum in this pretty girl's face, and then jet

First to beat the uncertainty
Working the verses free for the purpose provided by props
Personally, I never gave a fuck
For the mucky murky mass that you're walking through (to get some pudding)
Been standing here for eternity, for a damn long time, forever
Somehow my patience grew muscular
Must be a side effect to the mental exorcism
Maintain, warm up this torn up brain
Strain, struggle; painkilling guzzle
End in poison, just to push the progress of the puzzle
And I'm looking for a quarter-piece, got the corner pieces perfect
Forcing me to see there's more than meets the surface
Mercy me, check the level of the mercury
Must begot the fever man, my helmet really hurting me
Circuitry twisted by a bitch named greed
Now all proceeds is going to smoking more weed
Please, you need to force-feed your head
And set your sights straight ahead and hit warp speed instead
Of the foreseeable hate that you've got aimed at my crew
Pull your notebook out and get your shit together, boo

In a day or two, hopefully I'll be away from you

Blow away the ashes, throw away the trash kid
Everlasting to be the ones forever blasting

Here we are sitting on your living room floor

Boredom; in between a coma and an erection
Staring at the skin on your shoulder blades
And you don't take your eyes off my poker face
I'm wasted, and your as sober as Jehovah

And I'ma stay happy just as long as there is a whore to pay

So we can't be content until there isn't no more today

It's closing time, the spins are gonna visit me

Oh you like my poetry? word?
Im writing a book you should pick that shit up
Guess what its about? yeah right that's exactly what its about
(Verse 1)
They want me to be a spoken wordist but the stage still makes me nervous
Perched from the top self help hip hop and the sign says not serving
Its clear that we don't care we steer from here to there
The fear I bet keeps me upset inadequate he had to quit
The last to know Im glad you grow out of battle mode so gradual
My catapult went bad and broke the antidote was to grab my throat
Time to meet your maker myself didn't mean to take it so far
Deep into the lake of my hell
Don't even know where the fuck you are
Pick up your compass and your map
Bag up the lunches and the crack
Quick hide the crutches in the back cause they don't need to know where fuck my heads really at
This drink ain't my problem its my solution
These woman ain't nuts Im not abusive
Bare foot i walk across the bridge of music
With a short shirt sleeve full of illusion

Right here with a gat over here with a plan up here looking down on man (down on man)

But how far you gonna fly star?
Whats it gonna take for you to wear that (cake?)?
Who you gonna fight? who you gonna save?
Forget about the rappers Im fed up with people
I scrapped the script and I wrote the sequel
Now I laugh at each and every tragic chapter and I still look for that laughter
And from now on you can refer to me as MercyMe
I can't believe we let this fool out of obscurity
Here let me play with your dreams for a minute
To show you what I mean they already did it
The blast the blast the mega blast and this goes to those doing shows and chasing ass
If I wasn't so old I would steal your date but Im content trying to talk her into buying my tape
Its later than it was the last time you saw me oddly enough me and (?)
They can beat my body they can feed me dog meat but your probably gonna have to kill me to stop me

I believe that you're on something faulty
But I don't believe the words you called me
Everbody's salty, mad at they shadow
Now you think socializing is a hassle
You grapple, with animalistic savagery
Uncivilized hipocrisy, thats all that you can offer me
Everybody has head trips myself included
Police dog got me down
The teddy bear lost his path
He's somewhere in an alley with the trash and the rats
As he walks with the vermin he questions everything he's learned
Why does every song he sings have to burn
I can name that tune with no notes
I move my arm to the beat when I'm in my row boat
Kids grab your fame early, No stage
Handgun got me down
My best friend don't take mess
In fact my best friend doesn't exist
This goes to those that ain't got a job
I heard it was lonely up there at the top
(Get get, get get, get get, get down, it goes)
Lost inside of a pattern made of plaid and
For a new low cost you too can go mad man
Jus sit still stare at each other, think
Alarm clock got me down
Suck in your chest, stick out your gut
Wear a tighter leash, peel off the luck?
Seven kind of nuts mixed nuts how that joke go
Fuck it Ima keep sharpening the whip and get postal
Non-refundable application fee
Speak your peace but watch what you say to me
Under paid but wait, I can slam dunk
Late fee got me down
This bar ain't the dive that it used to be
I guess its all about the sight that you choose to see
Ring my finger, cut off my breath
City full of land mines, watch your step
Everywhere I go they don't know my face
Sleeps awake so I can keep my pace
Once upon a time there was the end
Television got me down
(Get get, get get, get get, get down, it goes)
Read about my friends the fanzines
I'd rip off my limbs keep my hands clean
The answers are printed in the back of the book
Ask me why, my head jus shook, and shook
Lips keep moving, I ain't saying nothing
Hack of a writer, less of a husband
Its hard to believe that you came alone
Barfly got me down
Must of missed the bus, the corner is empty
Pick me up, attempt to bench me
Everything is what it is, and can be so
I walked away because she looked too friendly
I'll take one of whatever they're having
Its not that deep its just and acronym
Back then it was cool to be ignorant
Awareness got me down, Awareness got me down
Awareness got me down, Awareness got me down
Awareness
(Get get, get get, get get, get down, it goes)
For years now I've been speaking the same
Scratching at the glue trying to weaken the frame
My bones feel but my jones is strong
A tyranny of women for the sake of song
Until the break of dawn, the crumble of dusk
Stay humble quit trusting the driver of the shuttle bus

Whassup man? Why you look all upset all the time?
Ohhh, it's like that huh
To be honest I kinda respect
The way that you be walkin around all stupid like that
And with a Sean Daly type of obsession for women
He starts off to the sunset on his sins
And he looks to the sky past the blue in the clouds
And says, ""Damn God tell me you ain't proud""
Everybody's talkin 'bout the end of the world
Like everybody wanna make friends with my girl
I guess y'all got bored with the good old days
Like there ever really was any anyways
Don't ever close your eyes unless you're tryin to sleep
But you never fall asleep unless you count some sheep
And them sheep don't baa unless you fuck them raw
So shut your mouth and pretend that you're deep deep
How deep? Deeper than her panties
Deeper than the power-steering fluid in the antifreeze
And I'll be damned if she survives the trip
Second guessin each breath that rides her lips
I'm tryin to drive the shit, only alive
To fit inside of her hips, it's time for a sip
Fibers of the mind rip into fine strips
Of life and love while I was tryin to get a grip

Get a grip and, let it live man
Life is a bitch and love is a pimp

Unfocused this, broken chips
Swollen tits, solo trips
Vocal glitch, I know it's so sick
But you're still caught up in that loco bitch
Crippin, on that other level mentioned
Flippin, become the center of attention
Sniffin, now let's begin the intervention
Skip it - kill myself and be a legend
In my own brain head stains red like the flame spread
All for the jealousy sleepin in the same bed
Off with the head, cops came with the aim said
Off with the led, clouds came and the rain bled
""Shut the fuck up!"" Why you wanna lie to a believer?
Stop the voices inside of my receiver
Get a grip on that bottle of fever
And quit actin like you live in a theater; bitch


Love is a lot like a buzz
When the buzz gets strong it can spawn hallucinations
It can roll into a permanent vacation
Or it can crash just to land your ass on the pavement
Love is a lot like an ego
When it's up it can let people down
And when it's lost they wanna see it found
But when it grows everybody wanna toss it around
Love is a lot like death
It can change the way that you see
To shine in lu-cids of findin pu-ssy
To sign a new lease to life is too cheap
So hide the money, you never knew me
So spike the honey, I wish that you'd leave
I'm dyin to breathe, the fight is too sweet
I'd like to go free, I'll cry you to sleep - get a grip!


Muscles twitch, faucet drips
The engine quits, transmission slips
The fate eclipse, the record skips
Don't slit your wrists, peace to Mr. Dibbs",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-love-is-a-pimp-lyrics
Little Man,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"Dear Jacob
I won't take up too much of you time
I know you're trying to get your video game-grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and
I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand
Why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get
I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend, thanks for listening

Dear Craig, what up bones? How it goes?
Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah, I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now
But your little man just wants you to listen now
I'm over 30, can't maintain relations
All these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust them, and they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride, fists, and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man

Dear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say
Just checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes, messing up your voice
Too many arguments, trying to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation in any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted
Stop it, everybody knows that you've lost it
Singing for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone
Fighting with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone
Your son says, ""Hi dad"", your dad says, ""What's up?""
And me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, ""Good luck.""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-little-man-lyrics
Smart Went Crazy,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"Smart went crazy, 
truth went trendy
The story got lazy so I rewrote the ending
Manipulated the entry, more user-friendly
Now a city full of pain pills and tattoos defend me
I waver from the dead to the half-dead
Grey space between the fan base and the crackhead
Sunset, sailboat set course for hell
A cross and a hammer, but you'll have to get some nails
Take credit, for anything embedded in the edit
As long as you meant it when you said it
And all of the kids laugh, when you admit that
It mighta been witchcraft that made my noose fit bad
Well I'mma act like I don't give a make love
Take what I got to teach everyone to break stuff
I'mma act like there's poison in the pancakes
And amputate the one that wasn't loyal with the handshake
Proud to know ya, 
Minnesota missile
Never sold coke and I never had to hold a pistol
Civil and simple, but set the freak show loose on the nipple
Watch her whole fuckin' titty ripple
It's why we battle, it's why we travel
It's why the mascot thinks that I'm an asshole
We made the team without puttin' on a uniform
Smart went nuts and rode a unicorn through the storm

Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, where did you go now?

Smart went crazy, kissed Miss Daisy
Loved you when everyday was Christmas, baby
Maybe, we can take it back to the way we was
Still on some ""What have you done for me lately?""
No gravy if the bass is porkface
Tour dates ate my big little brother's court case
Poor taste got passed off as gourmet
This beer is foreplay
We'll meet up at your place
I sting like a first divorce, or them first Newports
Whatever hurts you more
""You're headed for self destruction"" been there, did that
Kicked back with the wrong angel to fuck with
Carved my charm into your arms
Fuck around, unravel this tall ball of yarn
Snuck round back to disarm the alarm
From the plantation to the reservation to the farms
And nobody knows where you'll end up
Only guarantee in life is death or a headfuck
Yeah, you thought it was a set up, well guess what
Now you can catch up with the rest of my ""Best Of""
I got a few blocks left before I reach my destination
And retrieve my breath
And God blessed every step I stole
Just to let me know, she wouldn't ever let me go
 (2X)
 (4X)
Smart went crazy, the rubber band went snap
This goes to those that hold it down 'til I get back
Hold on to me, grow along with me
I don't know where I'm goin' but I'll end up in your arms",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-smart-went-crazy-lyrics
Pour Me Another,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"Nah, nah, nah, I lost my ID
I don't have it
Come on man, I come here everyday, man
You know me man
Come on man, you know me man

All she wanted was a little bit of solid
Feels like love, it doesn't matter what you call it
Heal those cuts or hide em underneath the polish
Break another promise and take me as a hostage (take me)
Hold your job down and let the zombies crowd around
Thankin' mommy's god that it's a cop's town
Keep it safe for me while I chase a fantasy
Swervin' through the galaxy, searchin' for a family
Happily surrounded by planets and stars
She was stuck uptown, you was landin' on mars
It's all fucked up now, caught your hand in the jar
Another small step back for that man at the bar (hey bartender)
Spill a little bit of blood on the street
For love that goes to those who know they drink too much
And hold your own glass up to the heavens
Take a little time and try to count the seconds

It goes, pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you now
Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you

Drink it all away, numb it down to none
Stay awake tonight and wait for the sun
You say you hate your life, you ain't the only one
Let your frustration out the gate and watch the pony run
One double, for the hunger and the struggle
Two for the fool tryin' to pull apart the puzzle
Three now I smile while I wait for your rebuttal
By the fourth shot, I'm just another child in a bubble
Tryin' to play with the passion and the placement
Just to see what these people let him get away with
Still tryin' to climb a mountain for you
Hammer in my hand, still poundin' on a screw
She don't listen so he don't speak no more
Nobody's winning cause neither is keeping score
Don't wanna think no more, just let me drink some more
Pour me another, cause I can still see the floor

Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you now
Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you

Live life tipsy, Stiff if it don't fit right with me
Kiss my whiskey, lift my lips, press to my angel
Swallow it and leave her empty bottle on the table
Let the past fall, making faces at that clock on the back wall
Countdown to the last call
Ask all these people that make sounds
""How long does it take for the pace to break down?""
Another lonely little trophy
If only I could walk a straight line, I'd make it home free
And everybody in this bar thinks they know me
And my story like ""poor me"" (""Yeah, pour me another, homie!"")
I can count the days till you come back
Or I can follow them sun-rays down to the train tracks
I can stumble drunk over hope and love
Or I could just keep drinkin' until I sober up (hey waitress)

Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you now
Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you

Bottles and pints, and shots and cans
Couches and floors, and drunk best friends
Models and whores, and tattooed hands
Cities and secrets and 
cats and vans
Good times, laughter, bad decisions
Strippers and actors, and average musicians
Mornings after and walks of shame
The bartender knows me by my real name
Sing it",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-pour-me-another-lyrics
Angelface (Multiples 5 vs Travel 4),You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"I love this fucking country
And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into traffic
Ran away from the backyard to drift some more
Woke up in Texas next to a liquor store
With a woman who don't even drink alcohol
Big letters IRONY tagged on the wall
She was named for another flat land
We had it strong back then
In common we had a bond
That would never see the break of dawn
To damn afraid of the queen trying to take the pawn
Threw that away
Yes, yes headed out west
And got undressed
With the nurture that she gave me made me drip and get obsessed
There was a lady in Los Angeles
That handled this the way the manual suggest (the way the manual suggest)
She turned me on to music that I never heard before
She told me stories from a cup I haven't learned to pour
And I don't know what hurt it more
Professional journals or perpetual burn holes
Scarring up the dirty floor
Peace! Found a hollow hole in the Colorado snow
It's like I follow anywhere El Diablo go
Took a stroll with a feline
And sat silent while the snowflakes fell into the design
Can't let her dance up on the top floor
Been there done that what do you think it's locked for?
I've lost more to my traveling soul
Then I care to talk about so I'll be out, I'll be on the road
Down, down, down in Gainesville
No stranger to shame, Coltrane, and pain pills
Sometimes the ceiling's too easy to stare at
But it keeps me from a forest full of snare taps and bear traps
And it can't come clean without the sun beams
And it ain't complete without the drum beats
I can tell she don't want me
As is time to climb back into the van and make the back stiff
I had to add one more story to the infinite
Already interwoven through a New York cigarette
Ex lover and a best friend, best lover and an ex friend’ll bend
For alcoholic sentimentalism and the rhythm of
Religion on the PA
Make the people here say
God bless the DJ
She stays to wait for a replay
While I wonder if I'll be able to hear it from the freeway
Chicago inside of an empty bottle
There's a thin line between gossip and gospel
There's a house over there near Wicker Park
Where I found out Smart was afraid of the dark
Had to break a heart just to help me heal up
Tie a knot in the stomach just to help me seal up
And make sure them demons stay beneath the core
Pray for you and yours and whomever you believe in more
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Sitting in the rain at some sidewalk cafe
Half of her wet cigarette in the ash tray
Trying to find a lost soul to save
And I'm a lost soul trying to find a road that's paved
Keep faith in my suitcase packed my beliefs
Angels exist, I've even seen some sleep
I love this fucking country
And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into traffic",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-angelface-multiples-5-vs-travel-4-lyrics
Say Hey There,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"Watcha gonna do? Slam Doors? Break a glass?
Maybe pass out on the kitchen floor with your naked ass?
She still makes time to hate me, But basically
I'm overbooked no emotional vacancy
Complacency seems so simple
Like fuck it let me be the one you fight and call mister right
It's an addiction bound to stick around
Cause a junky won't bounce 'till he hits the ground (get down)
And these drugs ain't as good as we wish they were (get up)
And this buzz doesn't keep us from missin' her (get over)
And that love that built all of this emphasis
Spilled enough guilt to kill Electra and Oedipus (get out)
It's easier to leave it there, each time I see your tears
Makes me need a beer to relieve the fear
I wanna keep a clear sky and fly away like a meteor
Outta here maybe next year I'll reappear

I say hey there, we don't play fair
Can't stay here, I hope you take care
I say hey there, we don't play fair
Can't stay here, I hope you take care
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)

Sometimes you make me feel like such a prick
That even I'm convinced that I'm the one that's sick
You can fuss and bitch, you can cut your wrist
Or you can choke on that blood from the tongue you've bit
And when you acted up, best believe I blessed you back
I've got a fucking fan base that can attest to that
I'm returning this bleeding hearts club membership card
Cause I want no motherfuckin' part of it
We're just two dogs on all fours
It's a tug of war for who loves you more
Blame it on tours or locked bathroom doors
Or maybe it's cause my voice was louder than yours (what? You jealous?)
And I'll be damned if I do this for forever
Everybody lookin' at me like I don't know better
Instead I gotta run if I'm ever gonna forget her
Cause I've always been a go-getter (so whatever)

I say hey there, we don't play fair
Can't stay here, I hope you take care
I say hey there, we don't play fair
Can't stay here, I hope you take care
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)

And now I got a head full of better off dead
I followed down them steps and slept in the wrong bed
If I had a breath of self-respect left
I'd set fire to the boxspring to help it catch wreck
Let these ashes represent the mattress
Director left the set but nobody told the actress
So she's still acting as if we scheduled a practice
And my soundtrack is compromising her theatrics
You remind me of me, it's not a compliment
Get your song on
Who you tryin' to be?
I've got no tolerance left for drama
You would like to go free, jump off the fence let your claws out
You remind me of me, run from all of them 'til they all gone
There, here we go again, with my threats to leave
Like I've ever left a she who wouldn't let me breathe
Instead I kept it deep enough to get you to believe
That I'm incapable of escaping and setting you free
Well I'mma open up that map and see the nation
Call it vocation
Call it a vacation
You can find me at the airport waiting
Or maybe I'll be chain-smoking down at the train station
With the pros of a Mac and my clothes in a sack
Gotta go and I don't know when I'll be back
Get my last paycheck, smash and make steps
Gone, on the run with Kool G. Rap in the tape deck (peace)

I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)

That Night,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"Don't even know if I can write this song
Caught on a beam between right and wrong
Gotta keep forward, keep straight
For the sake of why we stay awake all night long
It's not up for interpret
Paranoid of exploiting the verdict
But in the same breath
I got thoughts that I wanna express and let surface
This ain't for props or the pop culture
It's about a balloon that got punctured
The sunshine's fun till it burns someone
And we all got burnt that summer
She was sixteen
Another young angel with clipped wings
She came to the shows, but I never met her
Don't even know if she was listening
That night, we lost a supporter
That night, somebody lost a daughter
He raped and killed her at the venue
Can't comprehend what her friends must have went through
That night, the sun went dark
Now watch everyone on the tour bus fall apart
That night, Lord have mercy
The music died that night in Albuquerque

Stop, it can't be true, right?
This type of real doesn't happen to you, right?
Cresent, Murs, Dibbs, Jaybird
I wanna go home now and start a new life
Wish I could protect the kids
I guess safety is hit or miss
With a prior convicted sex offense against
A four year old, why we let you live?
Don't know what I'm trying to write
But there's a part of me that keeps dying that night
And when I think about her mother
I become another number that wants you to suffer
You're locked up for now
You have no more chances to steal the children's laughs
And if you ever find God
Better pray to her and ask that we never cross paths",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-that-night-lyrics
Get Fly,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"They want us to fight, but we just want to get high
Work all day, all night, trying to get fly
When I get some money I'mma buy me some time
I can't fight your war until I'm finished with mine

I used to be mad at the government
Redirected some of my anger towards the mothership
Trying to guess which shell living hell sleeps under
When the grand scheme plan keeps all these people wonderin
Why we still runnin in place frustrated?
Pride is mistaken for hate, it's upgraded
I got a little breath left, let's suffocate it
Point at the epiphanies and call 'em all drug related
The time I spent with my life on bent
Trying to find the friends inside my head
Must have disengaged every phase and stage
Of of my I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming of age
My unofficial autobio
Will be accompanied with tips on how to smile
Cause I've found that when they don't see you frown
They never know that you're a threat
And they don't sweat you when you came around
So who's going to be my next door savior?
Step up to your neighbor, and do me a favour
Take off the mask, let it all collapse
Empty the pack and watch your wings grow back


Society becomes jealousy, intimacy becomes intensity
Say it with a smile like it's meant to be
And all of a sudden, ""boom"", American family
And I can tell when your mad at your past
Because you tend to take the turns just a little too fast
And I can tell how you push your foot on the gas
That you already knew that you was gunna finish last
Slow it down and take a little time
To look up at them clouds with the fake silver lining
Up in a tree knowing damn well you never reach the top
But you don't stop, you keep climbing
Well okay, it's settled
No more nights in this weed and thorn infested meadow
Uh-uh, from this day forth, only forward I pedal
Get the memo I'm cutting the strings Gepetto
Shuffle the cards and let's argue
Rooted in between the computer games and cartoons
Stop and watch us all get lost
Between God and a shot of scotch, let's get fly

Uh huh gon work all day work all night
Uh huh won't fight your war until Im finished with mine
Uh huh gonna forward move, gonna buy me some time
Uh huh Im cutting your strings and keeping my smile

The Arrival,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"I'm not really supposed to talk about this.....but

(They've arrived) with the excitement of a newborn
Came to join the main event and fight against the luke warm
(They've arrived) with nothing but their word and they history
Take a can of paint and try to decorate their dignity
(They've arrived) it's not what they anticipated
Fuck, it doesn't matter put your fists up and instigate it
(They've arrived) and they can't save the planet
Or the children, or the pandas, or themselves goddamn it
I'm just a man that loved rap
So much in fact I put every piece of myself inside these fucking tracks
What is that, you whisper something from the back
You think your personal attacks make up for what you lack
I'm just a cat searching for a clean lap to crash
In a world hurting, waiting for their turn to take a nap
Sorting through the bills, fan mail, and life threats
Wondering why the postman ain't delivered my wife yet
(They've arrived) they call me Sean, this is Anthony
No need to act hard cause we got extended family
So I smile while I try to use my words wise
Say what I meant, just in case this is your first time
(They've arrived) ooh child are the wings tired
Smilin' like a couple of fools that the Queen hired
(They've arrived) can't wait for the vibrate to thicken
So we can watch the world's hips gyrate
(They've arrived) even the dead's getting live
It's a little deeper, you can float, c'mon baby, dive
(They've arrived) to fall in love with this bitch
From the petals on her flower to the pimples on her tits
Fuck the insults and fuck the compliments
Just wanna see the mommy free the honesty and common sense
Stop followin' the wind that you swallow
Cause it's too simple to aim for a target sittin' on a fence
(They've arrived) we do it for the candle in the sky
Here's a toast goes out to those who can't handle their high
You and I, we can swim into the tide
And watch these other children lose they mind
(I'm doing fine)
(They've arrived) and they landed safe and sound
Better try to take em out before they make your saviors proud
(They've arrived) so fix the beef, quit actin' like a sheep
Either spit your speak or sit there and grit your teeth
(They've arrived) to spread the info to the kin folk
Fuckin with the climate on the inside of the windows
(They've arrived) they're here, the baby farmer
Gonna take it farther, make a mark and break apart your fake martyrs
Planted firm, let the planet burn
Understand the terms, you don't wanna open up this can of worms
I'm tryin' to keep my prize on the eyeball
But people wanna see you fly, all to watch the sky fall
Who's to blame for your lack of conviction
I wasn't drafted, I asked for the mission
Put your name on the list at the bottom on an empty line
And hold in plain sight whatever gave you the right to question mine
The night prowler, gonna crawl past all the rap politics
You can put that on your last dollar
Wake up, it's bigger than a pay stub
There's the door, get your money, go wash off your make-up

(They've arrived) and they don't need your lovin'
If you don't wanna give it, keep it
Doesn't really mean nothin'
(They've arrived) gonna beat it til it stops breathin'
No need to even try to even reason with, they're not leavin'",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-arrival-lyrics
Hockey Hair,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"You can't imagine how much fun we're having

Stop it there without a care to what you've got to fear
Keep it all between your beer and your hockey hair
A lot of weird people traits and ticks
From the strangers to these dangerous faces you kiss
You know this town ain't cool as it used to be
When the lion, tigers and bears'd stare at your jewelry
Thruthfully I'm content with how the day moves
Stepped up the game, oops, still rock the same shoes
And one-time with them flashin things, they still
There to turn the drama into action scenes
I'm renting me a vehicle to roll me to the finish line
Follow if you wanna, we'll return around dinner time
Back hurts a little bit more with every cigarette
My mack learned to never ignore the petty gibberish
I walk the clay cocky like Mr. Know-It-Also
Patiently waiting to pop, shake up the soda bottle
Horizontal like a mail-order male whore
That came forth just to show you his pale horse
Of course the ones that love him hate him most
Heart broken ain't nothin man, she look like she ate a ghost
Make a toast to the butterknife, fuck it right
Wonder when my butterfly is gonna kep her flutter tight
I get way lonely when I'm on the j-o-b
And every pretty face actin like they know me
Same story, take photos and blow me
Like suckin on my pony is some type of a fuckin trophy
Don't know what to say homie, I understand under
The notion that mine is at home under another man
Don't even give it two minutes of business
Rotate the shoulderblades and keep them chipless
Built a prison out of conjugal visits
Now I rock a fake grimace on my face to catch the kisses
A bag of pot luck, a pint of gut rot
Emcee's is mockduck tofu tough-talk
What the blood clot, jumpshot, fadeaway
Watch these white kids eat it up like it was mayonaisse
Then he's on to the next city followin the destiny
Fell asleep droolin on your left titty
Indeed I play my part and call it high art
Keepin my eye on a piece of that pie chart
Smarter than solutions to the rubix cube
Took it apart and then pulled out a tube of superglue
Electric boogaloo, instead of tryin to look at you
I should stay in my house, sit on the couch and read a book or two
Maybe then this space alien can uncover ways to coexist
With other homosapiens
Until that time comes people know my bum steelo
Incognito with mosquitos and dung beetles
It's like that, never the wack in actual fact
It's like this St Paul, Minneapolis jack
It's like that, take your head out of the vaginal crack
Like what the fuck did you expect

Musical Chairs,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"Do you wanna play?
Well you don't have a choice
Stand up alive
Cause the music hasn't died yet

Suzy was a psycho, but she looked good
Little ball of fire, light it up and cook wood
She knew the power of what she had to offer
Pieces of a puzzle, personality, and posture
When it's properly done, it seems fun
As long as you're not the one the bee stung
Bar fly looking for a fall guy
Taking on all types
From big baller to the small fry
Get what you want out of life
But every night now the same thought arrives (you got a light?)
Still as lonely as the number one
Cause you only love someone
So you have someone to run from
Run, run, put your back into it Sue
Always wondered what it would be like to try to rap to you
We gotta show Suzy love
Ain't no way anyone's gonna stop before the music does


Bobby was a genius, and he would prove it
His favorite move is to make you look stupid
He knows the answer, nobody puts their hands up
When he starts talking everybody (shut up)
Bobby didn't have friends, not real ones
Just a bunch of light minded self righteous pilgrims
And they all treated Bob like the big cheese
Knowing damn well they all thought he was a ""bitch please""
Blows his own horn, slaps his own bass
While everybody waits for him to fall on his face
And while he's down, someone will take his place
If the suit isn't trump even seven beats an ace
Look at Bobby, he doesn't even know
You're supposed to set a new one after you achieve a goal
Accomplishments are just excuses to talk and spit
When you music stops, who will have a spot to sit?


Bring me the head of whoever said ""play fair""
I want to sit in my chair and wear a blank stare
Fuck being king of the hill
When the music dies you'll be the first one the villagers kill
Walk in circles, dizzy up the movement
Talk in circles, the underground's polluted
Lots of circles, you wonderin' where you fit
Stop the circles!
(Over beat boxing)
Oh Oh Oh yea, Oh Oh Oh yea
Well you don't have a choice
Oh Oh Oh yea
Stand up alive
Oh Oh Oh yea
Well you don't have a choice
Stand up...",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-musical-chairs-lyrics
Panic Attack (The P.A.),You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"See, they could try to trick you, couldn't they?
Here's something for you, make you really feel good

Little momma got a little pill to swallow
A little water to follow it down the tunnel
Gotta lotta walls but the house is hollow
Got a lot of holes, never found the shovel
Panic attack, so what's the plan of attack?
You had to be had. You cut in half. You had to react
You battle with your shadow from front to back
Stack up the stats. Handle the math, and that'll be that
Hold your head up. I know you're fed up
But don't let it get up to the top of them steps love
Instead of playin' with the pieces that got messed up
Get dressed up, we goin' out to catch the best buzz
Self-medicated, spirit on elevated
Help take the self-made self-hate and celebrate it
And I could tell you hated it when you felt naked
But the poison tastes great, wanna know how the hell they made it?
And if the dizzy don't kill you, the city will
Simply for the thrill of wiping up a sticky spill
Little tricky get busy off a fifty bill
So take the little pill straight to your pretty grill

Here it comes, there it goes again. Panic attack. (x8)
So what you drinking? So what you popping?
So what you eating? So what you dropping?
So what you smoking? So what you sniffing?
So how you coping? So what's the difference?

Contagious, it runs like the paint does
Sedate the sober and over anxious
The pages of pain that make the songs on the playlist
The renegade rain that jumped just to flood the basements
Look honey everybody needs a helper buddy
Nobody's drug-free, the streets would be hella bloody
Do you call yourself a patient or a junkie?
The only thing that separates is who takes your money
I'll smile like we're gonna go buck wild
Order up a shot, prescription filled up now
Pop another (what?) distracted by the rush while
We fight all night about what to name the love child
I'm on that go nuts life that got that gold touch
Fresh Fly Wild, Bold what like the Cold Crush
No luck, don't hold much, just an old flush
Made up of hearts Queen high off the faux-blush
Freak outs, leak out, and bleed out, and speak out
And reroute and seek out the weak crowd
And we doubt, but when I see it keep out
The beast I'll believe for now, it's all ""peace, I gotta be out.""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-panic-attack-the-pa-lyrics
Watch Out,You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having,2005,"One little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpack, watch 'em all...
It goes watch out!
Jack the Ripper, Jack Jack the Ripper
Peace to Jack Tripper and those Wellstone bumper stickers
My name is Sean and I never had dreadlocks
Instead I got an army full of women screaming Headshots!
I guess that explains it, don't it
She started to make a mark but it came apart
That's what you get for tryin' to make your little sister eat the kitty litter
Let's watch a rapper get bitter like the city winter
What the fuck you thinkin'!?
You frustrated or something? Did you have a bad week?
Man, you got issues, I feel sorry for you
Yo, shitting on me is so 2002 (Bitch!)
Turn your mic off, and turn the lights off
Whoever put your record out must have needed write-offs
Who they play when the game's in a tight spot?
Slug, you can find me in the A's of your iPod

Watch out!
When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out!
When you open up your mouth
I can smell that you don't know what you're talking about
(It goes) Watch out!
We all love a clown
But we don't wanna se you climb up out the underground
Watch out!
If you don't like the sound
Fuck you! I'm just tryin' to put it down for my home town
Cars drive by with the booming system
I must be getting old cause the bass sounds ridiculous
And nowadays, every body's biting 2Pac
So fuck it, I'mma stand over here and do the moonwalk
Besides police, I've got no beef
Just me, my beliefs and my bad teeth
A cargo van and some Ant beats
Enough rap to slap you to last week
Caught between the vice and the advice
Drunk, walking out in traffic just to fly kites
Time out, the free-style rhyme out, my last rights
Fuck a classic album, give my life 5 mics
And when the smoke clears, you won't be able to suck dick
Like you did as a teenage slut trick
And with a mat on his grill, he asks ""Who the fuck are you?""
Don't worry man, someday I'ma be nobody too

Look, I understand your hate
When I was younger, I wanted to be LL Cool J
Then he started making records for the girls and shit
So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away
I stole moves from KRS-One
A little Big Daddy Kane and some DJ Run
And then we took our life and made it a song
And look, nowadays Rhymesayers is on
It's the B-I-G D-A double D-Y S-E-A-N
He hasn't hit the rooftop to jump, guess he waitin'?
For what? I don't know, but who wanna come with me?
I got at least one more tool with me
So criticize me, or idolize me
Study from a distance or stand right beside me
It don't matter, just act like I know
And watch your back on the beat
Or get sacked at the free throw",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-watch-out-lyrics

Asinine amount of women in the ticketline
Hidden from behind the picket sign
Switch the design and reposition the shine
Subdue what they knew thrown askew
Cut through with the focus of a ""fuck you""
Frozen moments. Grown up, made work
Open up the doorway, sewn up, pay dirt
Everybody wants to party
Full belly; still suckin on the parsley
Star sleeps between the hard sheets
You only parked on the street to hear the cars beep
Pan left, pan right, damn right the econoline
Weaves through the landmines
Continues until I leave mankind
Can't find control of the wheels on the van like BAM!!

Cause the head on my shoulders won't fuck itself
And homeboy, I need you as well
Cause I gotta live And I got a little bridge to sell
Gonna build a home out of syllables
Gonna be alone when the whistle blows

Turn it up, let the drummer go BAM!!

Quiet hybrid of peace of violence
I just might just cease the silence with a BAM!
We land on your head like rain drops
With a chainsaw laced in napalm
Weight loss, pill pop, chaos
Thank god the best plays are made when the game stops BAM!!
And if I gotta die, I got faith the decision was made
That I was outta line BAM!!

Pretty Broad,UnKnown,2005,"If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky...nipples!

Step off the front porch, let the day come forth
Unsure of how much, but you know you want more
And what you've been gettin' isn't really fittin'
With the images and visions that used to tease the kitten
Fast forward to the present
Waitin' tables in some restaurant for the rent
But the check can't stretch past next week's breadth
It's a prison with invisible walls and cheap cigarettes
God bless the populace, take the untaxed tips
Trade for the firewater, slip through the wax lips
Retreat into a pattern of defeat
With the wake, work, eat, sleep, die, and repeat
This, must, be the other half
Of what was discussed in one of them missed classes
Point it out, circle it, and hit it raw
So it's not misinterpreted
Let's try to keep it pretty broad

Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I gotta keep it pretty broad
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I need to keep it pretty broad

Step out the front yard, always on guard
Thinkin' 'bout what year it was when it got hard
Take it back before the bar fights and cop cars
Take it back before the cocaine and rock stars
When the track fades, you cascade back to the mass grave
Of the overflowing ashtray
You fight love with a light buzz in a nightclub
Like you tryna figure out why your life sucks
Every day feels just like today does
Makeup to cover up the breakups and pay stubs
Your local pub has a happy hour special
Where your daddy power issues can be studied by professionals
It's difficult to listen
When poor decision making dictates your situation's position
Grow a backbone if you chose the path
And go hold your glass up and act like you know the half

Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I gotta keep it pretty broad
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I need to keep it pretty broad

Stepped into traffic, it's the princess with the mask
The last aggressive pacifist
Wavin' a flag that she kept hidden 'cause the nametag is blank if it doesn't say ""Victim""
Somebody save the martyr from her self-made spark to take apart her breaking heart
Either show it to the kids or get it away
Throw it off a bridge, let it live on a riverbank
And when it's found, I'ma make her my wife
Everything that I write somehow relates to her life
Every time she's around, my gut says to run
'Cause I can't shake my mind off the butt of her gun
And when she pulls out to aim
It makes me wish that the flower wasn't full-out insane
Dear God, don't let me get started on
Another pretty broad song about another pretty broad

Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I gotta keep it pretty broad
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I need to keep it pretty broad

My girl goes crazy 'cause she knows how it hurts
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Ask her to save me but go save yourself first
(I gotta keep it pretty broad)
Be so amazing if the chemical's works
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Shows all the ladies that I found me a nurse
(I need to keep it pretty broad)
That girl goes crazy 'cause she knows how it burns
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Ask her to save me but it made myself worse
(I gotta keep it pretty broad)
Be so amazing to abandon the search
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Show all the babies how the world really turns

Not Another Day,Fifth Element Presents: Atmosphere Storybook Vol. 1,2007,"Caught the bus at 5:06
That's in the AM for all you little trust fund kids
And it's a forty-five minute trip
If she ain't in by six, she'll catch another pink slip
And that's three and that means fired
The coffee thermos in the purse to help her keep wired
The day-care where she drops the baby off
Thank god it's on the same block as the bus stop
By 5:30, she's halfway there
And her back already hurts from the bus' plastic chair
Live to work to live to work to live
Gotta feed the kid and give it all she's got to give
Plus she tryna catch a little overtime
If she stays till four she could be home by five
Shuts her eyes for the rest of the route
And keeps her headphones loud to drown everything out
But the same old song...

""Whoa... whoa, not another day!""
Not another day of the same old song
""Whoa... whoa, not another day!""
Not another day of the same old song

Seemed like nobody even knew his name, huh
If he disappeared would they even see the blank spot?
The only kids who might notice are the ones who
Push him up and down the hallways and in the lunchrooms
Sometimes he looks at his bruises and wants to come to school with
A gun like them kids on the news did
But nah man they don't deserve to die
He's the type that couldn't even murder a fly
I guess you get used to the life
Maybe that's why he refuses to cry
Takes it on the chin, takes it in stride
What doesn't break you just makes you stronger right?
So he sits by himself on the school bus
Hoping that today he wouldn't have to put his dupes up
But just like any other, here they come
To fuck with his comfort, can't wait for summer
It's the same old song...


C'mon, woke up at the taste of dawn
When the city's bloodline starts to push it along
The generators on those public buses
Is enough to bust you out of any dream that you stuck in
I guess that's the chance you taking
When you camp out in front of that transfer station
And this town got no answers to chase
That's why he always sleeps near the transportation
Panhandle it, transient freedom
Transplant, he ain't from this region
And when the wind starts to whisper its lips
He knows enough to pack it up and dip out before the winter hits
Childhood dreams washed down the gutter
Both parents gone, no sisters, no brothers
Weak memories, strong paranoia
While the same song repeats in his head
Over and over and over and over it goes...

RFTC,Fifth Element Presents: Atmosphere Storybook Vol. 1,2007,"You got a bag full of paint, a head full of brain
No snow, no rain, ain't got no complaint
Like you high on that Krylon running through your veins
You look like a war vet starin at them trains
It's like you zen the fuck out
Sittin in the bushes, letting all the bugs out
One smoke one beer, when the coast is clear
You disappear into your zone stoned on the fear
Lookin at scarred box cars
Focusing and notice one of the ones most fit
Its like that one there, has got your name all over it
So that one there, is getting your name all over it
Pull a can of sky blue for the outline
Sky for the limits, blue for the down time
Nerves at blast, disturbin the masses of rats with these thin tips and fat caps
Thinking bout your little brother, cause he been tryin hit the yard with you all summer
It's a good thing that you didn't bring him along
Cause that's when you saw the flashlights singing this song like

Run, run, run these yards
Run, run, don't get caught
Run, run, every piece understood
Run, run, run these yards
Run, run, don't get caught
Run, run, every piece understood

It wasn't fast enough, a simple catch
Cornered in the parking lot hidin in the trash
You heard the footsteps, heart beatin hard
Are you gonna have to fight with a trainyard guard?
You stepped out on some, yup let's start this
Puffin out your chest like you wasn't in the garbage
And that's when the universe stopped for you
Now your looking straight at a uniformed officer
What you think, should you run, run
And take a chance at getting some from his stun gun
That ain't one on one, plus he look kinda young
The type that might beat your ass just for fun, huh
So tell me what the fuck are you supposed to do
Already thinking about the cuffs holdin you
Already got a few cases over you
But then the police man says, no it's cool
What, where's the punch line, can't call it
Too many paint fumes
, musta lost it
He handed you your bag and said here, I think you dropped this
Cause this cop grew up on hip hop

Run, run, run these yards
Run, run, don't get caught
Run, run, every piece understood
Run, run, run these yards
Run, run, don't get caught
Run, run, every piece understood

Good Daddy,Fifth Element Presents: Atmosphere Storybook Vol. 1,2007,"He gave his baby boy a bath
Tub full of bubbles and toys for him to splash
Look at daddy, soapsuds moustache
Funny faces and voices, it makes the baby belly laugh
Dry him off, now you squeaky clean
And watch the water spiral down that drain
Wrap him in a towel so he doesn't get the shivers
Brush his hair, it seems to help it dry it quicker
Laid him on mommy and daddy's bed now that he's dry
And put a diaper on him, gave him his pacifier
Superman pyjamas, so tough
Innocent face full of unconditional love
Daddy picked him up and rocked him slow
Never takes long for little guy's eyes to close
Dad's technique is different than your mother's
Never learned any lullabies, he sings Stevie Wonder's
There it is, steady breathing, sleep rhythm
Daddy sits and holds him just to listen for a minute
Daddy's hands are the meaning of security
And baby's hands are the evidence of purity
Thinking back to the day baby came
And how it changed the whole game, things ain't the same
Daddy had to stop running it crazy
Keep his ass in the home with the son and his lady
He was there for the birth and the first breath
Not gonna miss the first words or the first steps
Gonna keep the boy healthy and safe
And do his best to try to keep those tears off his face
Gave him a kiss, laid him in his crib
Turned out the lights, goodnight my little prince
That's how good daddy takes care of him
And then that good daddy goes downstairs to package heroin",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-good-daddy-lyrics
Less One,Fifth Element Presents: Atmosphere Storybook Vol. 1,2007," {X2}
Less one, just might lose breath
Read me, my right's my left
Less one, just might lose breath

A routine stop, that's what he called it
Registration, glovebox, license, wallet
There's blood on the drivers face and neck
So his police senses suspects it's a domestic
The girl looked like she took one to the eye
With his hand on the gun he says 'drop the keys outside'
Naturally the gentlemen asked them 'Why?'
Now the gun's coming out the holster, that's his reply
Passenger seat starts to scream
Like she ain't ever seen the same thing on the TV screen
'Mam - shut your motherfucking mouth
And sir - may I suggest that you unbuckle and get out'
Door opens, left leg touched down
Within a split second upper torso was on the ground
Like god damn, you could've snapped his spine
Pigs knee to the back, hog-tied by the swine
Girlfriend's tryna hold back tears
And the driver's on the concrete yelling and swearing
Officer got a little bit lost in the zone
It all took him back to childhood, home sweet home
 {X2}

Doesn't understand the reasoning for being lenient
And won't give you the chance for anything but obediance
He got that from his drunk old man
Heavy-fisted bag of piss used to throw those hands
That's why he never goes easy on kids
He's got his own kids now, he knows exactly how it is
Now last week he caught his son smoking speed
So if you meet you might catch a couple broken teeth
Sometimes it can get so intense
Profiling the type that likes to put dick up in his princess
It used to be hippy's, then it was black dudes
Now she only fools around with loosers, with tattoos
Well fuck em all, get on the ground dirt ball
And sing hymns for the sins that protect and serve ya'll
Peace disturbed, eat that curb
Or you're looking down the barrel of steel made of nerves
Puts his life into his work and work back into life
So wife thinks he's a jerk
Ain't no tellin what them boots might do
If she leaves him for someone that looks like you",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-less-one-lyrics
By Your Side,Fifth Element Presents: Atmosphere Storybook Vol. 1,2007,"Oh, shit...
I like this one, yeah
Shit reminds me of some old Ice-T or somethin'
Makes me want to tell a story

Y'all know I used to own a bar, right?
It was in El Paso, I called it The Hard Life
If you step outside on a dark night
Check it out, Juarez, look like starlight
You're gonna think that it sounds conscribed
But it's just like how I described
July in 2005, when the devil walked in my small little dive
She came inside and sat down
Whatever, we see all types in that town
She kind of blended into background
The waitress went over like, ""What'll you have now?""
She asked for a whiskey-coke
The waitress stood there looking like a ghost
And then the devil cleared her throat
Lowered her voice and this is the quote she spoke...

I love you, you make me high
If you love me back, I'll never say goodbye
I love you, ain't no lie
If you love me back, we can paint the sky
But we ain't got to get into it tonight
Walk away if you're afraid to try
But tell me what you want to do with your life
Cause on the day you die, I'll be by your side

Okay, I guess so
Apparently my waitress is afraid of the devil
And I could tell that she felt unsettled
Go take a cigarette break, get mellow
The whole bar got quiet, seemed like
Everything went plush, dream-like
I didn't know what to think
But I kept my cool while I prepared that drink
Then I delivered her beverage
""That'll be two dollars, 50 cents, miss""
She didn't even pretend to flinch
She just grabbed her glass, took it straight to her lips
But I wasn't convinced
It don't matter who you are, I'm running a business
Fuck you, pay me, not including the tip
She was looking into the distance and said this...

I love you, you make me high
If you love me back, I'll never say goodbye
I love you, ain't no lie
If you love me back, we can paint the sky
We ain't got to get into it tonight
Walk away if you're afraid to try
But tell me what you want to do with your life
Cause on the day you die, I'll be by your side

I know they call her lady-luck
But she's still got to pay me up
She's trying to front over a couple of bucks
She can suck the straw that broke the camel's hump
I bust my ass trying to touch some cash
Now I gotta come and put up with this trash?
For what, so I can eat these table scraps?
Get old and hope I ain't gotta pay more tax
I started making observations
Looking around the room, watching faces
Complaints that replace my patience
I hate my life, but I'm so complacent
This time gonna make some changes
Made my mind up to turn these pages
I pulled out the key to the place
And gave the bar to the devil, then I married the waitress

I love you, you make me high
If you love me back, I'll never say goodbye
I love you, ain't no lie
If you love me back, we can paint the sky
We ain't got to get into it tonight
Walk away if you're afraid to try
But tell me what you want to do with your life
Until the day I die, I'll be by your side",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-by-your-side-lyrics
Guns and Cigarettes,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2007,"(What's your name fool?)
Rappers stepping to me, they wanna get some
But most of them should go and try to boost their monthly income
Speaking over beats is the only time I feel complete
I don't hear the weak and I don't fear defeat
So what you got?
Connect the dots, I'll raise the pot
Remove the blood clot from the brain of hip hop
The name remains in tip-top shape
I'm still the wack rapper, scapegoat, in the aim of their hate
I came in late, took a chair in the rear
But my classmates were unaware how long I'd really been there
My peers have been held back for years, holding back the tears
Everybody knows our name like we was the cast from ""Cheers""
So here's to the good times, tonight is mighty special
So fasten your seatbelts, cause I'm gonna launch this vessel
Ain't gonna land until I'm bigger than Espo
And bigger than ecstasy and bigger than techno
:
I wanna bigger than Jesus and bigger than wrestling
Bigger than the Beatles and bigger than breast implants
I'm gonna be the biggest thing to hit these little kids
Bigger than guns, bigger than cigarettes
A few years ago an ex-girl of mine
Asked me to keep her name out of my rhymes
So I said this rhyme that I'm about to say
It came from the heart and it went this way:
Go to hell girl, you make me sick!
I hope your new boyfriend gets cancer in his dick
What the fuck makes you think I'd put your name on my record?
Yeah, now I feel a lot better
You know what?
I ain't drank a forty since I became old enough to drink
Not caught up in what the fuck these people think
Cause when I die they're gonna find the missing link
But tonight I'm gonna vomit in the kitchen sink
I'm suprised more of y'all don't get hit by cars
Missing your surroundings, staring at the stars
I'm lonely without a woman that wants to spar
That's why I spent so much time in these bars
Drunk poolside, screaming, ""Do or die!""
Looking at the water asking, ""Who am I?""
Saw my reflection, Yes! I'm super fly!
And as you can guess again, I'm too damn high

(What'd they say to you?)
But they said, ""Drop dead.""
I can't, I got a lot left
More than just another arrogant, asshole pot-head
In the top ten, who you love to hear on tracks
Smiling for the camera while I surf upon your ear wax
This beers flat and she kisses like a stripper
I'm coming to terms with my status as a drifter
Girl, I'm only in this town for one night
And these neon lights are keeping me distracted from my plight
I feel like a legend on a leash
Making an effort to break every piece that I can reach
Yeah, I got something to say, and even more to teach
But first let me scrape these feces from my cleats
Standing on the roof, complaining to the moon
The only time I tell the truth is when I'm naked in my bedroom
Soon I'm gonna reap the harvest of my struggles
But from now on, y'all can call me Sluggo

Bigger than Jesus
Bigger than wrestling
Bigger than the Beatles
Bigger than breast implants

What would that do? Enable you to deal
Without schooling you on how to touch what's real
And if I was a smart man, I'd tell you everything that I knew
And give it to you every time you need a talking to
But what would that do? Teach you my guidelines
So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines
And if I was a driver, I'd keep my headlights on
To see the difference between right and wrong
I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park
Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts
And if I was a better cook, I'd hook up a feast
Set a table full of food for the children to eat
I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe
With the knowledge that we got something accomplished

And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
So you can take my hand and I can take the lead
And if I was an honest man
I would stop writing songs
I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast
Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music
It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess)
And if I was you, I wouldn't hear a word I said
Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head
I'd make a conscious effort to live instead
Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed
And if I was a hurt man
I'd find a way to put my faith
Into a woman that could take me from today, maybe
I need somebody that could save me
From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy
And if I was a wise man
I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak
To think about strength versus weakness
I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head
And figure out how I could try to help you reach it
(Ho ho ho)
And if I did have a choice
I'd never want to live forever
Just let me have a voice so I can make my points
I can't imagine running a race with no finish line
Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time
I love giving but I'm bad at receiving
The truth is, I'd prefer to be the one bleeding
But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work
Cautious and aware, cause I'm afraid of being hurt
Which brings me to the issue
And that would be this:
How often must I ask myself why I exist?
I feel like a freak, this world is a circus
Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose

And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
And you can take my hand and I can take the lead
I got nothing but gifts
Keep it up in my wits
Got me drunk on the fifth
And now we're stuck in a ditch
And as dumb as it gets
I'mma run you some fibs
I wanna touch your lips
I wanna rub your hips
Put a glove on the fist
For the love that exists
We'll keep bumping the hits
To get my bucket of chips
From the Bloods and the Crips
To the skateboarding chicks
Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist
Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist

Free or Dead,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2007,"So here I am, trying to be the man, right
Using my gun to see at night, sleeping with my flash light
In the afterlife I hope the AC works
So while I wait well I'mma pass out and taste this curb
And she attacked with flirts, smacked my nerves
Wearin' that black skirt
Got my nature so hard it made my back hurt
I cracked a smirk cause I was dumb and drunk
She gave wink and a smile and dropped a quarter in my cup
Man, people are kind of odd so I keep my eyebrow raised
I only hear the words for what they mean, know what I mean?
And I do believe in God cause I keep comin' across all these fine women
With low self esteem, you know what I mean?
I got attention deficit, I've got the bedroom eyes
I've the storms in my head, I've got my telephone voice
I've got to make a decision of whether I live or die
I'd rather just run cause either way it's one hell of a choice

My car is like my own personal universe
She's my drug and it only takes twelve bucks to fill 'er up
But in my galaxy there ain't no room for Earth
So I'm leavin' it cause I can feel the oil pressure building up
Turning over the ignition of my solar system
Check the gauges, push in the tape, put my foot on the brake
Shift existence, light my cigarette
And take it state to state until I crash into my fate
Now I'm giving back everything they gave me (not a damn thing!)
It'll take me more than a good DJ to save me (and I'm not dancing!)
I can't seem to make up my bed, much less my mind
So I'm a take another puff to my head, and press rewind
I wish this car had cruise control, so I could rest my legs
I've got this itch to prove my soul, and test my fate
Doing hunny in a sixty five, got stopped by a copper
Caught, spotted, and radared by a chopper
Wisconsin-style, over the limit by forty miles
Watch me smile, cause I ain't been around here for a long while
Grabbed my paper, gave her thanks, have a nice day
Yo, word of advice, trade the doughnuts in and gets some rice cakes
Back to my travels, running from my shadows
Some hitchhikers and bikers honkin' the horn, harrasin' the cattle
Hair back sticking to the seat, sweat drippin' from the heat
Diggin' through a cooler of brew, I'm looking for something to eat
Yo, there's a Hardee's at the next stop
Don't wanna, but I need ta'
Cuz I'm craving something to chase the taste of this tequila
(Uhh, yeah, you guys got value meals? can you put some barbecue
Sauce... I wanna honey bun. change that shit. I want chicken pebbles
No, onion bun, onion bun. onion rings. extra pork. word up. can you
Supersize that? yo girl, you got kind of a pretty voice. yo girl, what
Time you get off work?)
90 east towards Chicago, on my way to Cincinnati
I won't ever let 'em catch me, and I won't ever make 'em happy
Hide your wives and your daughters when I'm passin' through the
Hometown, casting lines into the water, catching goldfish out your bowl now
And I'm as cool as the cat that came to school just for lunch
I'm the rebel pissin' in the public pool, just for fun
I speed in the sun, everyone is speakin' in tongues
Find the talk radio station, yo, turn it up so it bumps
Don't cry, girl, I'm out and I'm a make my way east
Cause everyone in my world is takin' my peace
I need release, and I don't think I'm a find it in between your legs
Yo, I'm just joking, only going to the corner to get some eggs
So when she starts makin' the coffee I toss my bags in the back seat
And I can remember it all like it must have happened last week
Sometimes I stop to think, for all the money I've spent
How I'd rather live in a tent than bust my ass and pay the rent
But I'm eager to pay my dues, and I'd be glad to pay the tollbooth
And I've agreed to sing the blues ever since the day I broke loose
Just like a blindfolded child walking through the toy store
Voice, not even aware that the world is my oyster",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-free-or-dead-lyrics
Aspiring Sociopath,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2007,"7:30 AM, alerted to life by a song on the radio
The evening is over
Another morning, another opportunity
To do something progressive, to prove that he's worthy
Up and out the door by 9 O'clock
The sun is shining up and down the block
This children in the corner, waiting for a bus
That will take them to school and exploit their trust
He starts the car, sparks with one crank
It's those good ol' fashioned American mechanics
And even though he'd rather own a new import
It's dependable and more important, it's all he can afford
Stops by the coffee shop to pick up some smokes, and a cup of Joe
(No, wait make it a tea, a good green tea)
Back into the Ford with the windows rolled up
So when the radio rocks, he can sing along freely
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
At the top of his lungs, the words burst through shameless
Pushing that dream, trying to beat the time
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
Nothing else matters when you're knifing through traffic
Wishing it was a stick shift, it's an automatic
Listening to the road, voice of the nomad
How he'd love to leave, drive away never go back
Wheels keep on turning, turning, turning and turning
Alone is when he finally feels like a person
Light another Nat Sherman
Crack the window, feel the wind blow
Serenity tenfold
God bless whoever invented sunglasses
And while you're at save the saints that work the fast food drive-thrus
Objects are closer than they appear
Cause when you're by yourself there ain't one else to lie to
Talk radio gets a lot of play in his vehicle
It teaches him topics to discuss with real people
So, when he stops to get gas or hit that coffee shop
His neurotic ass can act like he knows a whole lot
Pour some sugar on me, my counterfeit personality
He's a loner Dottie, he's a rebel
He's gonna drive the escort to the middle of that meadow
Thinking about how he could leave this city
Fill the tank and towards the water, he'll flee
Maybe he should just go get a pitcher at the CC
Find a stool at the bar where he can stare at the TV
Either way, tomorrow will be just like today
And that's all it takes to make the change
He loves to drive more than he loves being alive
And this town doesn't even know his real name
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie...",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-aspiring-sociopath-lyrics
Peyote,Sad Clown Bad Fall 10,2007,"She goes by the nickname Peyote, her real name is Iris
Appearance doesn't matter so I'm not gonna describe it
She was a dancer down at edit this portion
I can't name the spot, they don't merit the promotion
But I been there look like any strip club
Everybody slicked up trying to get they dick sucked
Smoke and mirrors, you know fake magic tricks
Like these people didn't come here just for ass and tits
But this one in particular was popular with midlife ballers
And white collar out of towners
Plus it attracted athletic individuals that came here to play against
The twins and the timber wolves
Safe to say she made the rent good
Twenty years of age a spot up in Kentwood
She had the car, the dog, and the kitchen sink
She had a drug-free body didn't even drink
She had a sister who wouldn't stop giving her shit
For dropping out of art school to be a stripper
Iris was sick and tired of the questions
But big sis didn't understand the perspective
She knows her little sister isn't a slut
But she objectifies herself and contributes to the gluttony
Now here's Iris stealin' from the devil to buy some time
To make life something special

Where did you go? When did you fall?
That little one, you all grown up
Oh how they've grown, those days are done
Under the gun, now you are dealt
Where did you go? When did you fall?
That little one, you all grown up
Oh how they've grown, those days are done
Look at us, who you to judge?

Her oldest sisters name was Jocelyn
Awfully slim, on a diet of bottled water and oxygen
She lives on Hiawatha by the Target
And she dates a photographer, that's how she started modeling
She ain't no supermodel, this is Minneap for that you'd have to move to Chicago
Or maybe LA or NY
Now she does what she does here and she gets by
And her boyfriend gets a little currency
Taking photos for advertising agencies
Now he's gonna steal from the devil
Stick it to the man, revolutionary rebel
One afternoon after work he went to the strip club
Just to loosen up that shirt
He and a couple job associates are gonna sink them drinks
Like they about to be extinct
Never met his girlfriends little sister
But she recognized him from cell phone pictures
Any other circumstances she'd have hollered
But topless in heels is a little bit awkward
Eventually his friends leave
And when he gets up, she grabs him by the coat sleeve
Too drunk to catch what she says
But he did offer her three hundred on some head, like

When you do wrong it makes me want to do right
It also cancels out the guilt that makes the load feel light
It also gives some leverage to the morally impaired
So make mistakes for us to hold over your hair",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-peyote-lyrics
The Rooster,Sad Clown Bad Fall 10,2007,"Blue collar Eddy and his better half Dolores
Used to be mantelpieces down at the Black Forest
And I don't know if that bar still exists
But when it did, so did they, a couple bleeding heart kids
Everything volatile, every night Vodka style
Hop a stool, be discrete and just watch a while
But do your best to keep the level observational
Drama is attractive so push it when it takes a pull
And each night's a random, when you've paid a ransom
For the right to sing along with them drinking anthems
And these fools paid so many dues
That everybody stops to salute
But one night after another fight
A couple from an opposite table offered an invite
Dolores didn't want to join 'em, wasn't feeling social
But Eddy was so aggravated that he had to poke holes
He walked over, sat in the dialogue
And called at Dolores like some kind of dog
She can't believe it, she's done, she's had it
But she doesn't want to make another scene in this establishment
She got up and moseyed over
And put her arm up around Eddy's shoulder
Nobody's sober, the song is the same
Sometimes you stick out your chin to catch the rain
 {X2}
You could be a winner, you could be a loser
Gotta wake up when you hear the rooster
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong
Gotta do right for you when the time comes

The clock keeps drinking, they keep ticking
There's two more people who get to play positions
Samantha and Chuck, not a couple, just roommates
Out having too many shots on a Tuesday
Who knew they'd be tools for the duo?
Put a little bit of fire on the fuel
It's a kind of blue, intentions ain't cruel
But everybody's so ready to bend up the rules
Now there's Chuck staring at Dolores
Eddy is distracted by Samantha so he doesn't notice
And everybody's too fucked up
To even assess the mess, much less care enough
More whiskey, a picture, a premium
Eddy's getting tipsy, he didn't see it coming
On his way back from a visit with that urinal
Tryna straighten out his thoughts and the vertigo
Weaves through, stops when he seen 'em
Picture perfect, it looked just like freedom
Dolores on Chuck's lap kissing him hard
Eddy dipped into the winter, left 'em all at the bar
Sometimes you got to follow what's felt inside
Between the power struggles and selfish pride
No one's allowed to cry unfair
Because now they're both good to drink alone somewhere

Don't mean we gon' do right tonight
We could try to change to make a new life
Don't mean we gon' do right tonight

Hey mother, don't let them know you
They hunger to hold you down and control you
Hey lover, don't let 'em love you
They'll lay on top of you to stay above you

We all need something we can stake the blame on
It can't be your dance that made this rain storm
It must be the alcohol, and you hate this place cause the town's too small
And everybody there's so fake
Be a brand new day if they was half awake
Smile'n your face like 'yes sir'
Waitin til ya turn your back so they can whisper
And you ain't tryin' to love none of 'em
Na, ya know better right? Ya learned something
But even If The first few burst through
They only pursue cause they wanna hurt you
It comes with a smokers cough
Gonna turn it on until it's broken off
Cos suffering didn't crush his 'just not enough'
They wanna hold you down until they lock you up

Make the Sun Come Out,Sad Clown Bad Fall 10,2007,"About noonish, I woke up to the music
Blaring outta the clock I inherited from pops
After snooze is hit twice or trice
I climb off of this mattress to go find my life
Where's my wifey at? Wait, that's right
She slept at her sister's, cause we had a fight last night
Looks like one of her cat's got sick
That's either vomit or shit, right next to the fridge
There's no coffee left, just tea, green
Did my best to try to make believe that it was caffeine
After a minute, I had a cold shower
And oh, I was pissed off at no hot water
Hello landlord as I get dressed
Expressed my stress in the message that I left
So when you get a chance, please call me
Gotta go, just found cat shit in the clean laundry
And yesterday's pants is the option
There's already money in the front pocket
No snow yet, but it's still freezing
So I throw on a coat with a hoodie underneath it
Ignore all the bills on the table
Cause I don't love 'em - fuck 'em, who told them I was faithful
Shoes, keys, wallet and my temper
Out the front door into a cold November
Now wait a minute, look who got a parking ticket
I live here, why I need a fucking permit?
I guess underground rap has its perks
Cause all of the sudden the speakers don't wanna work
Stereo is dead, no lights, no features
And hold up, the heater ain't on either
It must be a fuse, at least it starts
I dip to the shop that sells the car parts
And the cashier is like, man I don't know shit
But you ain't gonna treat me like I don't know shit
Bob, that's your job Bob, do your job Bob
Sell me a fuse and point me to the door knob
Installed the fuse and let the heater blow
Music comes on, thermometer is three below
Son's mom calls, I answer it on speaker phone
At same damn time, someone backs into my vehicle
Turn the auto-pilot on man
I just wanted to go to the studio to write a song man
Meltdown now, might as well blank out
Sean'll come back once we pull up to Ant's house
That's the place I bury, all of the weight I carry
Southside basement, that's like my sanctuary

Party Over Here,Sad Clown Bad Fall 10,2007,"Party over here, fuck you over there 

And there she blows, slip into the bathroom
Lock the door, sniffing like a vacuum
And I know that it ain't nobodies business
But last time she was in there for twenty minutes
Her roommate Ruth sitting at that booth
Sucking on that wine like she's gonna find the truth
Just wait 'till her lips turn blood red
She'll fall in love with whoever, 'nuff said
And that's Johnson
He's always on some agro frat bro gangsta stompin'
Acts like he's the only white boy from Compton
If real G's show up, the attitude is gone
Jill forgot that they agreed no coke
Cause Jacks on the couch passed out with his mouth open
Led Zepplin, Stairway To Heaven
Stay in step cause anyone can have a weapon
Just like Chad, real white trash
Short fuse quick to put his foot up your ass
Heads up, that's his wife Rebecca
And I advise you to try not to smile at her
And lets all have deep conversation
Alcohol and dialogue, perfect combination
Throw in a cokehead or a pothead
Just can't stop them thought provoking topics
Look somebody puked in the fridge
Ain't that great, it's where the beer lives
The music's too loud to hear the fire alarm
And I'mma set a fire if you don't change the song
C'mon

Nothing but love
Yeah there was a party, many people came through
Standing on the wall, cause that's what I do
Small-talk shot dialogue push snooze
Defense mechon cause I got a lotta shoes (issues)
The moment got stolen by a lady in red
With a campaign slogan about the straight edge
But her sentence is broken
Her focus a fraction
The ash on her Camels at an inch and a half
And her voice starts to crack
And her head starts to twitch
And Ant looks at me like, ""What's up with this bitch?""
I can tell by the stains and the way she complains
That pills ain't to blame and it ain't cocaine
Shes had too, too, too much coffee

Nate must have drank a lot of Black Label
Tryin' to play the Rottwieler under the table
Now light another cigarette off of the stove
Both ya'll drunk, which one of ya'll drove?
These people need to stay off the sauce
I'm shocked that the neighbors ain't called the cops
The music, the drunk, the fights out front
And half of these kids ain't even near twenty one
Who's party is this, who's home is this?
How'd I get here man, I do grownup shit
Let me know when your games are all done
Cause I can't fuck with these games you call fun

Sunshine,Sad Clown Bad Summer 9,2007,"Ain't no way to explain or say
How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet, hands and knees
Trying to breathe in between the dry heaves
My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me
Couple of advil, relax and chill
At a standstill with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh air
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye
Like it's mad that I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass, right into that patch of grass like that's life
All of a sudden, I realize something
The weather is amazing, even the birds are bumpin
Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I think something's telling me to ride that 10 speed
The brakes are broken, it's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight
Hopped on and felt the summertime
It reminds me of one of them Musab lines like

Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine

If I could I would keep this feeling in a plastic jar
Bust it out whenever someone's actin hard
Settle down, barbeque in the backyard
The kids get treats and old folks get classic cars
Every day that gets to pass is a success
And every woman looks better in a sun dress
The sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops, get juice
Show improve their moves and let loose
I hear voices, I see smiles to match em
Good times and you can feel it in the fashion
Even though the heat cooks up the action
The streets still got butterflies
Enough kids to catch 'em
Ridin my bike around these lakes man
Feelin like I finally figured out my escape plan
Take it all and the day started off all wrong
Somehow now that hangover is all gone
Ain't nothing like the sound of the leaves
When the breeze penetrates these southside trees
Leanin' up against one, watchin the vibe
Forgettin' all about the stress, thanking god I'm alive
It's so simple, I had to keep the song simple
When I get home I'm gonna open all the windows
Feelin' all right, stopped at a stop sign
A car pulled up, bumpin Fresh Prince's Summertime
Summer summers fine
Feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-sunshine-lyrics
Don’t Forget,Sad Clown Bad Summer 9,2007,"It was still dark when Mark arrived
Maybe 6:45 in the morning time
In the tenth grade, we was tight friends
But neither of us had a driver's license
His aunt was a flight attendant
And she'd leave town with a Cadillac unattended
So we used to get tempted
That intense tendency to tend to what we wasn't meant to
We would skip out on class and shit
To go visit other schools, just tryin to act cool
And looking back I have to laugh at it
Cause all we did was burn up gas and flunk math fool
But still it was super ill
I mean two teenagers in a new Seville
With 1987 in the tapedeck
That was a part of my life that I'll never forget
It went...

The soundtrack still runs through my head
I gotta keep every single step
As old as we get, we don't forget
We won't forget
We don't forget
The soundtrack still runs through my head
I gotta keep every single step
As old as we get, we don't forget
We won't forget
We don't forget

And you can't tell me nothing about frontin
We wasn't even sixteen yet, come on jump in
Cruise control until we lose control
Max the low end out to let it bruise my soul
And god knows I should have been studying
So maybe I could grow up and be somebody
But I loved the looks that the girls shot at me from the bus stop
When we pulled up in that caddy
Good thing back then I had bad game
Otherwise there probably be a few with my last name
Better that my true love was rap
Now let it auto reverse, until the bad dub snaps
Felt so right, forgot we was wrong
Sittin at a stop light, singin along
When I look in my rearview now, what would I see
If I didn't have the music in my history, now give it to me

The soundtrack still runs through my head
I gotta keep every single step
As old as we get, we don't forget
We won't forget
We don't forget
The soundtrack still runs through my head
I gotta keep every single step
As old as we get, we don't forget
We won't forget
We don't forget

And we was just a couple of kids
It was right around the same time that nobody was beatin the biz
Had that, and I know you got soul
On a tape that I made, recorded em off a Travitron show (here we go)
I was addicted to the radio
Make my request, and wait for it
Holdin my finger on the pause button, like ""now go""
I guess that was the original download
Rap videos and girls digits
A fifteen pack of blank cassettes for Christmas
Used to steal mom's change if it's easy to
We used to make up names for our graffiti crew
Used to talk about makin it big
And if we ever got rich, the way we would live
Hey Mark, we ain't there yet but
If you can hear my voice then turn your stereo up, like what...

The soundtrack still runs through my head
I gotta keep every single step
As old as we get, we don't forget
We won't forget
We don't forget
The soundtrack still runs through my head
I gotta keep every single step
As old as we get, we don't forget
We won't forget
We don't forget",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-dont-forget-lyrics

You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one

Her name was Stephanie something
She lived out in Richville, right off of Portland
I'm talking bout back in the ninth grade
Still had a pony tail, couldn't grow a high fade
Used to take the 5 way out to the suburbs
Waitin at the bus stop, there was my lovebird
She would get on, sit down, scoot me over
And smile with a jheri curl restin on my shoulder
And we would hit the mall together
Maybe hold each other's hand or share a Dr. Pepper
And all we ever did was kiss, no sex
But in our defense, there was never any stress

You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one

On the phone late at night when I'm supposed to be in bed
Mama doesn't know I'm talking to Lynette
I had a lot of sweet nothing to say
You could say not a whole lot of nothing has changed to this day
We was fourteen, but she had breasts
Although we was both too young for anything sexual
Just wanted her to know that she was special
She used to write me notes, do you like me, yes no?
And I don't know if it was practice for later
But both of us would break up back to spend time together
I don't ever remember trying to make her feel bad
Back then we didn't see things like that

You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one

There used to be a spot called the Boulevard theatre
And as a kid when a movie came out I would see it there
Sneakin in to the R-rated feature
I think I was fifteen, that's how I met Lisa
She showed up with a group of fly girls
So me and my crew was in superfly world
After the flick we all went outside
Paired off, took a walk into that night
I can't imagine that happening now
The innocence is gone and all the magic ran out
I wonder if my son will get to understand the fun
That comes from the summer with the one you call the one

You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one

There used to a be a fear and a nervousness
But back then it wasn't cause of domestic disturbances
It used to just hurt your heart
But now it's not enough until it rips the universe apart
Got to see a lot of love when I was a kid
Heartbreak made me wanna die but I never did
So this is for my own babysitter
Wanted to sneak out and fall asleep by the lake with ya
Smells like candy, felt like family
For every girl that ever held me in the back seat
Used to vision being love struck with em
Till I got blindsided by these grown-up women

You're number one

You're number one

Mattress,Sad Clown Bad Summer 9,2007,"All your secrets stay safe
All your liars will lay
All your stories are stains
On that mattress
All your secrets stay safe
All your liars will lay
All your stories are stains
On that mattress

Ain't no way to ignore yourself
A lot to say, no one to tell
We all think that you're so cool cause nobody knows that nobody knows you
Paint brush color up them flaws
Break up send them broken laws
You can't share all the facts with a home made crosshair on your back
Everybody wanna tell the tale
Like the chips might fall but they never fail
You still don't realize, take a look around
Do we seem surprised
So we don't even need to know
About the poor decisions that feed your growth
Nah, we just wanna see the now what
Can you keep a secret, can you keep your mouth shut

All your secrets stay safe
All your liars will lay
All your stories are stains
On that mattress
All your secrets stay safe
All your liars will lay
All your stories are stains
On that mattress

You can't even tell your mirror
Anyone can seem so sincere
Watch whatever you volunteer
Voices argue all over here
She was pointing at a hand
When she said let's move this ball to the bed
First time on the field hit a homerun
Wash your hands, don't tell no one
Better check yourself
Cause the best part of you the part kept to self
Will never forget how it felt
Look at how well you dealt with the guilt now

All your secrets stay safe
All your liars will lay
All your stories are stains
On that mattress
All your secrets stay safe
All your liars will lay
All your stories are stains
On that mattress

You gotta secret but everybody does
And the whole damn courtroom wanna be the judge
You don't wanna be distracted
And take our minds off our own malpractice
Everybody talk about their past
Like today's mistake is gonna be the last
We wanna see behind your mask
Like we ain't got our backyard to trash
Well this one drink and drive
And that one there, cheats on his wife
Broken promises, deadbeat dads
Overdoses, and one night stands
Let's all make a mess
And try to project some kind of perfection
And let me sing you a song
Cause I ain't the first thing you ever did wrong",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-mattress-lyrics
"Ha, This One Is About Alcohol Too",Sad Clown Bad Winter 11,2007,"OK, I'mma have to see some I.D. from everybody here, except you huh
So what's it gonna be?
You all look like whiskey people to me

Never sick of listening to your problems
Your boss threatened that you're gonna lose your job then
You fought with your neighbour and he called the cops man
Your wife left you and she took the dog, damn!
Looks like you came to the right place
Take a shot just to wash away the taste
We don't know your name but everybody knows your mad face
Save that seat for anyone that caught a bad case
Every day is overcast, pains in the lower back
Bones that you didn't even know you had
Not sure but you think your best friend stole your lawn mower
...That would explain why he stopped coming over
You ain't seen the doctor in a while
Even longer for the dentist, I can tell by your smile
Still making payments on a car
That's sitting on a spare flat in your backyard
Stacks of bills on a messy kitchen counter
Ring around the blue-collar cause the hot water heater's down
Here, put a couple of these down
And sing the blues like they supposed to sound

Here comes a beer, catch all your tears
Drink the remedy, forget about your problems
Here comes a shot, lose all your thoughts
Drink the remedy, forget about your problem
This one's on me, fix you for free
Drink the remedy, forget about everythang
This one's on me, got what you need
And take your medicine, you'll feel better friend
{And then she said, ""Did you put, did you put it in?}
Wha-What?
{Did you put it in yet?""}
You know what?
{And I was like, I was like...}
You know, I'mma turn the TV on
I'mma turn the TV on, I don't want to hear about this

Used to be you just get in the car and steer
All alone, just you and them stars up there
Find a highway outside of the gen-pop
Turn up the music, go till the engine stops
And that's life but with these gas prices
It's cheaper to just drink yourself to sleep, huh
Dependency can be your best friend once you know
That drugs and alcohol is all you've got that's dependable
It's enough to make you wanna huff on paint again
And lock yourself in the bathroom with the Jameson
Nah man, come down here and make a friend
If you do right, won't remember tonight
We still open so have another cold one
Until you don't recognise where you woke up
And don't throw up, nah hold your liquor
My tattoo'd gorilla be quick to eighty-six ya
Now get lost in the river of smoke
As it floats towards the ceiling that measures your growth
Life is better with a poor memory
But don't forget to leave a tip on the bar for the remedy

Ay buddy wake up, wake up
Wake up, there's no sleeping at the bar man, get up
It's time to settle out your tab
You've had, you've had enough
You've got, you've got to go home, wake up

66th Street,Sad Clown Bad Winter 11,2007,"Hi, can I help you?

I think it was a Sunday, sometime in January
I could be wrong and I guess it isn't necessary
But I remember that the ground was made of snow
And if you went outside, you better take your coat
I must have been nineteen years old
I had a cashier job at a convenience store
Working the counter making minimum doe
Selling discount smokes to the neighbourhood folk
I didn't pay much thought to his ski mask
It's Minnesota man, your face will freeze fast
But I bet that I looked sorta dumb
When I first caught sight of his bright orange gun
There I am, adrenaline high and
Tryin to decide how I feel about his right hand
Is that a goddamn? Wait a minute
It is a flare gun and guess where he's aiming it
""You probably ain't here to win the lottery"" (""nope"")
""So you obviously gotta be robbin me""
He nodded his head so opened up the till
And grabbed a paper bag for the money cause I know the drill
I handed him the cash and the food stamps
He just stood there looking all confused and
I'm thinking ""Yo, why the fuck ain't he movin?""
C'mon crazy white boy, don't do somethin stupid
That bag is worth maybe two-thirty
Not enough for you to pull the trigger back and burn me
By now you should be down the street
Ain't you never seen the way they do this shit on TV?
Yeah it was fun but it's done, now get out
""Ah, do you want me lay down on the ground and start countin crops?""
Before the ski way even started noddin
I was already on that, one one-thousand, two one-thousand
The front door beeped, I heard him leave
So I called my boss and the Richfield police
Gotta close the shop and lock the doors
Cause some trailer trash just robbed the store
{*Phone call between Slug and police officers*}

Everybody acted so suspicious
I guess the flare gun story seemed fictitious
Are you accusing me of petty embezzlement?
Don't you see my left over adrenaline?
Bosses and cops can't be my friend
Never felt loyalty to either again
And to keep it real, the irony didn't set
Until a year later when I got fired for stealing cigarettes",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-66th-street-lyrics
Beautiful,Sad Clown Bad Winter 11,2007,"Beautiful is how we know you though
Rebel, rebel, for all your people
Until the talons of the bald eagle
Reach
Out and rip the back of your head off leaving your skull peaceful
Beautiful is how we know you though
We were all taught to root for the underdogs
One nation under God complex
No wonder we all wanna watch 'em undercover cops
Beautiful is how we know you though
So beautiful, so upset
Came from a place that bred success
So shame on the grass on that side of the fence
Beautiful is how we know you though
Guess daddy didn't hold you enough
I ain't saying that you never had to struggle for a buck
Or some luck or some love, motherfucker join the club
Beautiful is how we know you though
Give the kid a paintbrush and a subject
Self-portrait caricature of the undead
Skeleton staring at a picture of the sunset
Beautiful is how we know you though
Misunderstood is not a birthright
The monster lost control after the first bite
Master your high life,
 bitch get your swerve right
Beautiful is how we know you though
It ain't new to you, ain't that unusual
And we knew you fully meant it when you drew
Your little line in the sand and chose to stand with the beautiful
Beautiful is how we know you though
I hope you live to tell the war tale yourself
I wish you well on escape from your hell
But 'til then stay the fuck off my doorbell",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-beautiful-lyrics
Don’t Stop,Sad Clown Bad Winter 11,2007,"All right, see I ain't really all that famous, yet
But I'm not a nobody neither
Just doing our thing
Sometimes we do it right, sometimes we do it wrong
Doesn't matter, either way it gets done
It gets done our way

Can't really pinpoint when I made the big choice
God never spoke to me about my thin voice
It ain't like I was handed a mission
I won't front, I'm just another man of tradition
I guess its best to check inside of the music
Rap groups back in my youth got me boosted
Couldn't stop the usage, call me opportunist
The turntables plugged in? Fuck it, gotta do it
Beats back then broke the button on my rewind
Opened up my mind to notes, drums and time
Started memorising everybody's rhymes
Spitting your shit like I was going for mine
Introduced me to funk, rock and jazz
So amazed as to how the DJs chopped the samples
Some nod their heads, some pop they ass
So it was only natural for me to cop a handful

Between what it is and what can be
I'm here just to keep you company
You ain't got to be in love with me
Just don't stop beating them drums for me
Between what it is and what can be
I'm here just to keep you company
You ain't got to be in love with me
Strange how far you mark for me

So put the jam on and move forwards
Roll up the windows and sing a chorus
And give it more until the life drops
Nef turn off the speakers, boom box or the iPod
No stopping me, you can't possibly
What you thought I'd do, Ant's got a lot of beats
Shake your ass in celebratory fashion
It's not the spot for you to come relax mam
Ain't nothin like Hip Hop music
The shoe fits, gotta show and prove it
Ask god how much is too much
He wrote a note in the clouds, said ""Keep fucking them up""
I used to live in those headphones
All alone stuck in my zone
But today I got a king and I'll follow the dream
Just to see what tomorrow can bring, ding, ding


Oh, they don't like my crew
Because we don't sound nothin like they think we sposed to
That's cool, I guess it ain't for you
But I'm still comin through with what I came to do
Been in love with it since I was a kid
It protected me, watched over what I did
I was a junkie, I couldn't get enough of it
Probably should've predicted that I'd be up in it (Fuck with it)
Your gonna have to kill me to stop me
I'm a grown ass man, this ain't no goddamn hobby
The bread's all soggy and them kisses are sloppy
But I still love rap from the soul to the body
Give it everything that you know
Because the people in the crowd is trynna let it go
She might need a little something for them nerves
Make her way up front to mouth along with the words
She say...",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-dont-stop-lyrics
They All Get Mad at You,Sad Clown Bad Winter 11,2007,"Once upon a time there was a concept
Someday we can all escape the nonsense
Work hard, let the rewards connect and
Maybe we can sweep up all the trash off them front steps
Silly man, he believed in that ethic
Seeds planted, the needle to the record
It's in the plans that he set out to perfect
But every few steps was a feast with a message
Boost these up for them have-nots
Let's separate the players and the mascots
Little bit of success is a backdrop
And you kind of look like a jackpot
Give me what you got or get got
Ain't no getting off at the next stop
Don't get caught with a wet top
I thought the best shop was the best spot
I guess not
 {X2}
They all get mad at you, so see-through
Not much they had to do but read through
Turn off that attitude, they need you
No time to act a fool, just be cool

Now keep your defence up right
No choice but to be tense, uptight
Not one type and the other just might
Throw shots at your body, character even love life
But why they got to turn your meals in?
Try and not to hurt them feelings
But burnt pride or burn that ceiling
In between the search and the curse of the dreams man
Girl, look at how they stare at ya
Pass judgement, together they're chapters
Come back a year after, they're happily ever after
And I wonder what the world will look like from their ladder
And now you had it up to right there
Hey mama, put the kid back in the high chair
Act like you care that life ain't fair
Nah, let 'em finish up their nightmare
 {X2}

Open up them cracks, you can't overreact
It don't stop but you seem so relaxed
You know they gonna cross over them tracks
But it thoughts like that that keep holding you back
Is that really how it works now?
Is they hurt style ever worthwhile?
Return it with a smirk or a smile
Cause you took yourself off the dirt pile when you had your first child
It's too easy to call it envy
Everybody want to be all they can be
New graffiti make 'em feel so heavy
But they all get friendly when your walls are empty
It's always the same approach
They just want a little thing to hold
You can't save they soul so just chase your goals
Let 'em hate far away or let 'em hate up close, now

Last week right ha ha you know that
It's not like it's all that rare
So put it here and let me cherish the embarrassment
I realize I've been a dick head yes
And I respect how you question your investments
I take the blame but it ain't to be impressive
It feels like a cop out to label it lessons
I've been though the rain but I've put other people
Through a hurricane just to work the game
Some time I swim through so much shame
I think my little man's blessed that he didn't get my last name
And here you are right in front of me
Offering it all like tell me what you want from me
I wanna love you today and forever
Let me clear my throat and rub my wings together

My hands are dirty and I'm this that and this
You've been searching for this that and this
Let's break the surface and make a little happy mess

Whoo girl, you're the most beautiful thing I've seen
Enticing, exciting
Even the sound of your voice gotta nice ring
Ya seem like the type that might help me tighten up my pipe dreams
We can keep digging through this dirt
Team up, you and I against the universe
Think about it, What cha say to yourself
You can wear my cape and I can play with your belt
The truth is there now
Stand with me, look into that mirror now
And tell me you don't see the same image
Gonna be a brand name babe once the rain is finished
x2

I can't believe she got me on a ball and chain
It's not a complaint, I appreciate it
For all the dumb mistakes I make
I'm surprised baby girl ain't threw me away
I never meant to hurt no one
I just want to stay productive till the work is done
I dance to a certain drum
But when I fell off beat you didn't turn and run, no
You see me at my lowest moments
You gave me sight when I had broken focus
With a smile that opens up like a rose does
Even when it all seemed so fucking hopeless
And here you are, right in front of me
Offering it all like 'tell me what you want from me'
I want to thank you today and forever
Let's make a little happy mess together

Let's go up the stairs... Right Now!... Let's go!

Got to change my style""

He remembers little bit of his childhood
Sometimes bad, sometimes good
But he never was one to blame today's grey sky on last week's rain
So he see's everything face value
Looks grim, it tastes bad too
There's nothing to do except dupe, push down the wall to get through
I swear to god it's too stretched
Too easy to slip or lose steps
And the taller you are, the harder you fall
That's why a lot of us crawl
Momma, please don't look now
I've gotta walk over people I've took down
It ain't as pretty as you probably think
It's gonna take more than soap and a sink
Tomorrow he'll drink to the guilt of
Every cheap wooden bridge that he's built
Bury those skeletons in his head
Til you pick him up and carry him to bed


Swimming through alcohol and women
Gets some gold spray paint for that lemon
Everything he's got is not a given
Rock bottom on the flip-side of top billing
Not a victim, fuck the sympathy
Figure it out, and kill the bitch in me
Poor a little liquor out and call it a victory
They said the sky was limit free
No, don't trust none of these people
Won't give him enough to love me for me
So even when they welcome me into their kingdom
Can't bring self to believe them
It goes, faux pas tryna act like no flaw
Turn it up til it burns that stove top
Mr. Know It All, bad boy showoffs
Red lights, no stops
Momma, this can't be the boy you raised me to be
The drama, depression
Afraid that it must be the Daley in me that's crazy
Carry me home - take care of your baby

Don't wanna live like that, no",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-carry-me-home-lyrics
The Things That Hate Us,Strictly Leakage,2008,"See I come from a time when
They didn't put rear view mirrors on the passenger sides of vehicles

And this is for those that still drink malt liquor
Put the poison in your body just to pass out quicker
When death calls best believe it's gonna get all
Emotional cause I ain't goin to hell without my menthols
Damn cable TV got me trapped in
Girls acting dumb and cops beating black men
Overfill, overkill, tryin to deal
Call the toll free and order my some diet pills, aight?
Got me looking at the sugar in the Kool-Aid that you made
You need to chase it down with some toothpaste
Still stuck to the simple things
Yep, the struggle in between a couple of Krispy Kremes
I have to ask if you could pass that half in half
To get my coffee back on track
Big ups to all the carbonated hiccups
The energy drinks and the suicide big gulps
Gonna find happiness in the fast food
Supersize, a triple bypass heart attack too
Distract you with these colorful tattoos
To cover up the fact that we feel like bad news

Uh, we love the things that hate us
Push snooze again girl, I don't want to wake up
America the beautiful, that's how she played us
Wasn't that cute, it must have been her make up
Tryin to grab everything that she gave us
Just take it back in the math on that pay stub
Lookin at the neighbours like wait up (wait up)
Uh, we love the things that hate us

Pain killers help find some feeling
Crack the Vic in half just to break the time seal and
Take it by yourself on the living room carpet
Do a little bump just to clean your apartment, huh
I seen your wife, she's not the truth
I understand why you like to pay them prostitutes, yes
Strip clubs, gun shops, oh Jesus
Right next to the liquor store for your convenience
Everybody say ""Ho"" for the Cuervo
You can drive if you promise to be careful
Turn the radio up and light a doobie
And keep actin' like life is like a movie
This is for the needles you shared
Cause them after school TV specials is too square
Cook the coke for your own consumption
On some JoJo dancin old school, what's your function?
As American as herpes and hot dogs
Got lost between the mustard and the hot sauce

So I smashed through the windows and dashed with it all

No money, pull honeys at the park jam
So give it up this is Sean and Ant's stage
Yours is on the floor with your permanent mad face
You hit last place like you didn't know you would
And caught a bad case like you never over stood
Damn shame just a waste of track tape

You kittens gotta be kiddin'
All that hyperbole your spittin' is probably bitten
Look at the teeth marks, check the dental records
Go take a second to locate them exits, bitch
Believe it's time for you to be leaving
Clean out your desk and turn the keys in
It's termination day for these half wits
Flappin' them lips from the cradle to the casket
You mundane like Sunday traffic
About as much threat as a wet book of matches
They show me where the mic was, I grabbed it
Took the stage and made the fans feel fantastic
Atmos follow with the fear
Don't be talking off my ear while I'm swallowing my beer
Get the fuck outta here with your act
Same type of cat that likes to talk shit behind your back
Stab it, in your face like what's happening
The brighter the lights the bugs come, it attracts em'
Nowadays I keep to self so tell your girlfriend to take her eyes off of my belt buckle
So fuckin' hungry the tummy rumble
Gotta be more then just another monkey's uncle
So I'mma get dumb this album
And do it like I don't give a damn about the outcome
Slide past the trash that's hatin'
Slit the tree in half and crack the pavement
Wrote graffiti on the mainstream application
Was validated enough - we had the ladies masturbatin'
After Satan laughs his ass off
We'll all love hip hop, we'll all have bad jobs
And even there on that assembly line
I'll remember to remind you bout your empty rhymes
On lunch break I'll battle you for those cupcakes
Do it for the love or just to prove you're a fuckin' fake
And after I catch a kiss from the receptionist I'm gonna pose like this
I don't quit, I never have
If you step in the act you better be better then that
You can talk your shit like whatever, dag
But excuse me miss we need to check your bag huh
You're stealin' now give me back my style
How does it feel tryin' to piggyback my crowd
Say it loud, break it down, take em' out
Like ""give me this, I'm young, gifted and mixed""

And pretend to be your friend and put one your belly
And you can keep on yelling, the cops won't come
You want beef, we got burgers and then some
We from the era when we learned on our own
Runnin wild in the streets with both parents at home
Kind of hard to find a young un alone - caused we was crewed up
Taggin on the walls taught wars and getting chewed up

Now I don't know about y'all, but I'm bout to make a small fortune
By taking small things and blowing em out of proportion
Using sarcasm as my second language
Look mom I'm famous, I mean I'm flagrant

I say I write my best rhymes cause I'm fly
This is why I'm cold, I'm Minnesota nice

All I'm trynna do is get a piece of the pie
And turn these bricks into a legit business
Now run along and go home to your wives
And leave me and Slug here to play with these bitches
You know I spit the sickest sickness since syphilis
Mixed with malaria, fuck it, the more the merrier
B-Boy, D-Boy, yep I'm in your area
Muja Messiah uh huh, hello America

Yo, yo, y'all wack, yo what the fuck is new?
I'm back wit Atmos and the crew
To do this you need style, I thought you knew
It's not a diss, yo it's just my point of view
Maybe if I turn sideways, y'all *niggas* will
Throw lyrics my way instead of the highway
Now getting ran over by cars and Land Rovers
We starred, you sub par, maybe send your man over
Pardon, you gon' step to this
Spit phat, not anorexic shit
Come stacked boy, it ain't no need to go there
I knock rappers out, y'all scratch and pull hair

I hustle hard for the love of god
My life has been the biggest struggle for the bloody start
I knuckle up and throw the hands of my thug at heart
So when the shit hit the fan I don't come apart, I breathe and shrug it off
Atmosphere - the Big Brother's big brothers
Catch is here to turn king to wrist cutters
Just trust it ain't no regular shit
That's a polite asshole and a sensitive pimp
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
Church mosque, have a knack
Dr. Dre Training Day rappers don't know how to act
Remove em all from my sight like a cataract
Poof! It's a magic act

Walk over beats like DMC, three stripes
Thievery be three strikes, visa need three swipes
DVDs, jeans clean, cuts brush dandruff
Mobile phones, student loan, quarter blown pampers
Chilling at the party in B-Boy stance
And they looking at me funny, why? Cause they can't dance
So I'm cutting up and strutting up, on buttercup but just enough
To lean on top of this metropolis with binoculars
Walk like a pimp, think like a Macintosh
Battle scars, yah'll still trying to figure out your avatars
Leave the cameras on, told ya partner that he can't perform
Brought a torch to burn the building, he think I'mma hand it to him

Yeah, yeah, I solemnly swear
To fight the good fight as long as I'm here
But sometimes the good fight don't seem fair
Cause all the best soldiers we had ain't here
They gone now, we all on our own now
And most of those left ain't got no style
You give em an inch they try to take a whole mile
Too overconfident to keep a low profile
Pump your brakes, stay in your lane
A bunch of fakes chasing fame
I'll punch your face and take your chain
Sit your 5 dollar ass down before I make change

Break these chips down, count your business
Ain't nothing free, it's a James Brown Christmas
So god bless the underground now and give it
To the sound of the drums while none of us outlive it
I treat Hip Hop like a sport
Stay on my game, put my time on the court
While you complain and get high some more
Might explain why your team can't find support
Now catch me in the back wit a whisky
Chattin up a missy like I'm attractive and witty
I have to dip to do my raps and get busy
Why don't you come see me when I'm back in your city?",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-crewed-up-lyrics
You Played Yourself,Strictly Leakage,2008,"What's up? My name is Sean, nice to meet ya
So what brings you backstage in this theatre?
Oh you're in the crew that plays first
I shoulda noticed all four of y'all of wore the same shirts
I bet you got a demo of your work right
{That's what's up} Can you leave it with my merch guy?
Well word up, good luck tonight
And don't forget to drink water, and don't cup that mic, huh
Do me a favour and stay away from Ant's beer
No you can't bring your fans back here
Nah I'm straight, you can keep your drugs in fact
Keep em in the alley out back behind the club
And drop the attitude
Why you acting like that little sticky pass is some kinda right of passage dude
Keep rapping till you get discovered
But better believe it's last time we ever see each other
 (Every second line spoken)
Cause you played yourself
Uh yeah, of course I remember you man, uh, how you been man? How you doin man?
You played yourself
They told me that you tried to pick a fight with your own DJ
You played yourself
Nah I didn't see your set man, I was, I was sleeping on the bus
You played yourself
Uh yeah, go talk to that guy, him, he'll give you some drink tickets, word

New York, at the Bowery getting down
With Grayskul, P.O.S. and Fillmore Brown
My first time touring with a live band
Trynna hide all the fear behind the mic stand
I just want to move around and keep it versatile
But tonight some kid took it personal
I stopped my set, yo what you yellin bout?
With your middle up calling me sell out
Then security rushed him like a gang fight
Wait, don't kick him out, man it ain't right
But they wasn't listening to Slug
I'm just an artist on the stage, they don't really give a fuck
So I finished up my set then
Ran out the front door to see if I could catch him
And there he was, mad and drunk
So I gave him his money and sent him off with a hug
 (Every second line spoken)
Man you played yourself
Man you can barely stand up, you trynna call me names, punk
You played yourself
I understand, I understand dude, I was just like you when I was 15 years old
You played yourself
Talking about, you ain't The Roots, you ain't The Roots, why you got a band man?
You played yourself
Do me a favour, throw away my CDs, I don't want you stupid fans

Girl please, don't treat me like you treat a toy
You wouldn't look twice if I was the pizza boy (nope)
You ain't got to flash me your ass and tits
I'd rather fantasise that you're a rap advocate
Look around, you see all these women?
They came for the music, you came for the scenesterism
The validating game is degrading
Got me cornered at the bar to boost your ratings
I'm getting too old for the trap
Go wiggle that cleavage at the opening act, huh
Plus you smell like a bucket of vodka
I would never put my meat sauce up in that pasta
The shows over, so why you waiting by the bus
Like I'm supposed to be impressed with the basics
You don't believe that I don't want to see you naked
But I'm not hanging out, take care and stay safe kid
 (Every second line spoken)
You played yourself
Yeah actually I have heard somebody say that to me before
You played yourself
You realise I can clearly see your clitoris through your jeans
You played yourself
Look you are closer to my son's age than, than you are to mine

Look at 'em, look at 'em man
Little suburban fucks
What the fuck you doin at your shows homie?
Don't listen to 'em Math You, do your thing

Little Math You, fifteen, suburban
And it ain't shit if it ain't the cursin version
With the sticker on the front to piss off his dad
Just tell that bitch to get off the rag, huh
Little Math You from the burbs gotta hear it
It's like the only thing that puts the nerve in his spirit
Go ahead and make some ruckus for the hell of it
And yell it on the streets of that monotonous development
Your telling me that this ain't for him right
How many y'all motherfuckers get an invite?
Give him access and let Math You here ya
Wait a half a year and he'll be rapping in that mirror
And when he does, check him on his loyalty
Was peace when he just played the piece of the royalties
Love is love if that's what you give
I couldn't give a fuck about where you grew up or where you live
It goes...
Oh you a star now huh
You large now, your too large to talk
Don't forget I used to give you free refills motherfucker

Forget snitchin motherfucker, stop bitchin
If you afraid of rats get the fuck out the kitchen
They only come when you cookin up a mess
And I'm supposed to be impressed by your bulletproof vest?
That come back, gun packin tough act
Thug chapter bout entertaining as a bug zapper
Fuck that, add up all the stories in your raps
And subtract each one that isn't really from your past
Take the remainder and multiply
With how many times in your life you thought that you was gonna die
Divide that sum with the outcome
Of how many kids you had before you dropped an album
Low ceiling for the masses of dope rappers
Most of dope dealers that I know got broke ladders
Try to juggle both factors, shit I can't imagine that math
I'm just a high school grad
But I know what matters is that I gave it everything that I have
Cause I'm a son and a dad
Trynna learn mathematics for the growth
I'm out, I got to hit the gym so we can film a video
Aiyyo Sky {What up?}
I was wonderin if you got the time
If you can go online and look up and see if you can find me a gym {Yep}
That'll let me smoke up in there {No problem}",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-little-math-you-lyrics

Yo she pushed her cart right into that Escalade
Hahaha

Women at the bar want to be a star
Stop her on the street, she thinks you a freak
It's illegal to flirt when we at work
So nowadays I score at the grocery store

You are what you eat, no pretending to be
So I push my cart like an extension of me
Bump, bump, nope I can't front
I'm the one that's probably gonna hit your cart more than once
Like ""Excuse me, sorry, I didn't see you there""
Yeah, I didn't see you there, with your pretty hair
In the condom aisle, with your awesome smile
Tomorrow we should watch Lost, hang out a while
She's got cheese, can't tell if it's cheddar
But you did see the way she held them bell peppers
Clean enough to put soymilk in the potbelly
Skank enough to buy sushi from the hot deli
It's ok though, butter and mangos
Down at the co-op, organic tomatoes
Even the chain stores attract angels
Whole Foods, Safeway, Trader Joe's, Rainbow
Nipples erect in the ice-cream section
Steam up the glass and steal my breath
And you know damn well I'mma bring the dip
Call me the Kool-Aid man and sing my shit (oh yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Actually I would like a few samples
Alright?
Thank you


Yeah, yeah, we've all heard the old phrase
Felt like the start of a mid-eighties porn tape
Both of us reach for the last box of corn flakes
Headphones kickin, she was listening to Ghostface
Nah baby, go ahead and cop them shits
I'll just settle for a box of Kix
Turned off the iPod to talk
I don't know what she said, I was watching her lips
Recipe interrupted by the culprit
She had no idea that I was shopping with a full clip
So many bullets, she should have been insulted
But she didn't, that's all that matters isn't it? No bullshit
Flow and swerve through my chosen words
Miss pumpkin pie, gonna open hers
Yeah, I'll be chilling by the frozen deserts
And if this don't work, I'm going to church

Nah, nah, nah, paper, paper
Nah for real put it in the paper bag
With handles, handles!

So nowadays I score at the gro-gro-gro

Full Moon,Strictly Leakage,2008,"The moon is full, you can't fake that light
No room to move, nah the space got tight
Don't need no knife here, we break up fights
Put your good shoes on, get your make-up right
And the ladies in the pla-pla-place so fly
Make you want to go home and wake up your wife
And I like it right, could never hate my life
In fact I'm quite excited, I get to play tonight

Mr. Soundman, turn up the bass
I want to feel the beats disturb my heart rate
We came in the door cause we wanted to escape
And forget about the world burning in front of our faces
We all paid dues, we all working hard
Some fools even had to pay a service charge
We sit at a thirsty bar
Now give more 808, and turn up the guitars
Tell the security guards to relax
Cause these people came to get away from all that
Them bouncers can't go bounce, they own balls flat
But we came to have a good time - now fall back
""Rhymesayers"" You know that's my team
Ask around, we kind of nice with the rap things
We came to stick up the rhythm
So poor, made 'em want to put my kids in prison
Spotlights, I'm a social moth
I'm here to mark the tree then I'm rolling, gone
Next shop gets broken off
Now open up your top and don't quote me wrong
I said this one here is what we call a good crowd
Roof caught fire, whole block got took out
Whoever's on after me better keep a look out
The sun goin down, I'm about to let the wolf out


Hit the stage like a war vet
Hoping that the band members remember the set
Knowing damn well that I'm the one that forgets
""Hey man, I thought we specifically asked for a cordless""
Tangle up all the microphone cords
Till I'm tripping on 'em like I've done a hundred times before
Even if I fall off stage and hit the floor
Becomes part of the show, keep giving 'em more
I like it when you dance and move your shell and it's
Too soon to tell if you smooth and swell with it
Felt good to see you do it for the hell of it
""That's why I nominated A-N-T for president""
...Ch-ch-ch-check out Penelope
Right next Stephanie, Wendy, Bev and Steve
Rapping with my songs and repping me
Thanks to all y'all for being part of this little legacy
Got busy and it won't stop
So let the bid he's hot, and try to ditch the cops
We don't need another 50 or another Iggy Pop
Just raise the roof now, show me what your city got
We found a lot of pounds out of town
Was deep underground but it seems so loud now

Jewelry,Strictly Leakage,2008,"I never really understood a man's jewelery
You sooner see me on some Karaoke super freak
With a peace sign sweater and some Hammer pants
Windows up, smoking weed in the ambulance
Hopped out, 1988 battle stance
Neighborhood started to dance and made it avalanche
Nobody got hurt, just lots of dirt
Did the Michael Jackson kick and took off my shirt
Broken wings coming out of my shoulder blades
Poker face, hitting switches on my roller-skates
Making soup out of Couscous and Froot Loops
Moon walking down the block rocking some moon boots
They don't know my name, I'm not that guy
But they point and smile because I'm that fly
Any day I get to stay way from bloodshed
Becomes another night I get to ride into the sunset
Traded in a horse for a bike
So wave if you happen to see me on the South Side
With a boom box strapped to my handle bars
Zoom homie, take a bath in some caviar
Getting drunk in the woods smoking a ci-gar
Sitting on the hood of your car playing the gui-tar
Face painted up to look like a circus clown
Lookin around like everything's perfect now
Match strike and light them candles
Hold onto it, grab tight, a hand full
You might be right, we might be assholes, shit
We from the land of the ice-cream castles
I never could fake respect
What's it gonna take to make all them dots connect
I must be old cause you look like a fool to me

Nah man no, he's trynna, he's trynna get me to do a verse on his shit
Yeah same dude that used to talk all that shit back in the day
It's total, total lack of self-respect on his part man

Surrounded by all these little piggies
Round a pool table, holding on a glass full of empty
When them rappers came out of nowhere to hit the spotlight
Oinking at the crowd about who cares and not quite
Pretty sure there was more on stage
Than there was in attendance in the rest of the place
I tried to give a listen, it was impossible
The main dude sounded like his motherfucking mouth was full
Understand what that train wreck looks like
You've seen it before, bad rapper with a good mic
Screaming like he means it like it's a classic verse
Couldn't even make out a fraction of them words
Minnesota, too nice for its own good
Half of y'all should still have a cold foot
Order me a refill, try to block it out
And act like these little pigs didn't come from this brick house

Never meant to be a part of you or you
I just want to be a part of one two, the one two

Get off the stage, smack your crew
Real friends wouldn't let you act like a fool
Your beats go ""fa, fa, foof""
And your girlfriend pretends that she don't even know you
In your late twenties, ain't making any money
Like an overweight ballerina, sad and funny
We all think you so damn wild
The way y'all still rock that talent show style
No one's impressed with your extended set
Except your idiot friends that you scribbled on the guest list
Just to be clear, Atmosphere in here
If you spitting a cappella I'mma spit in your beer


Ten minutes later and they still up they yapping shit
Turn the sound down and let us read the captions kid
You did a song that was so damn passionate
I almost had to piss my pants when I was laughing at it
You look so goddamn dramatic man
Everybody pulled out their phones to call an ambulance
Your CD-R needs a little CPR
You makin faces like you should of played the lead guitar
You ain't an MC, you an MC's wardrobe
Freak of culture like a white girl with cornrows
Go ahead and do you, don't front
If rap is just another excuse to smoke blunts, huh
It's alright man, get yourself a hype man
And come take up a couple more minutes of our life span
Twin cities, tighten up and get busy
Got all these little piggies trynna suck on these big titties

Of one two, the one two
Of one two, the one two
One two, the one two
The one two, the one two",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-thats-not-beef-thats-pork-lyrics

Playboy ain't got his own place
His mom and his sister are both his roommates
Where you gonna bring a lady friend?
You gonna get her pregnant in your basement?
You wanna explore her body
But mommy might come down and do the laundry
Can't put your girl on all fours
When your sister's room is one floor above yours
You not in school, you not employed
Fulltime, full grown momma's boy
You ain't making no choice
When you ain't even worth your own weight in coins
Then she gon laugh her ass off
And this time it ain't cause you took your pants off
No struggle, still like snapshot
Low hustle waiting on jackpot
Do the grind like you do the time
Nice shoes on her mind and whips so fine and
Y'all won't find no losers climbing
Up in her, up in her

We don't work, we don't need ta
We don't work, we don't need ta get it to get her!
Get it to get her {*X4*}

A man is only as good as the woman
Now take a look at the one's you know then
Think about who you wish was wifey
And what you doin to make the fish bite
You better have a pay check
It's like another kind of safe sex
The ethics connected to your favourite toy
Don't nobody wanna mate with a lazy boy
Motivation to keep it live
If you want a real queen bee for that hive
And even if you got cash, it doesn't mean you get a pass
Cause trash attracts trash
I don't know what they told you, what show they showed you
But things are tough all over
Debts, bill collectors, threats, whatever
Check, check, still better than ever
Home is home even when its bill grown
Now quit rappin and go get a real job

The seventh of September was my date of birth
I got to the clinic and I did the nurse
Picked at the scabs until I made it worse
But I still spit your girlfriend's favorite verse
At least now I know somebody notices
The loud guy from Southside of Minne-hopelessness
I try to celebrate life when I can
Most times I do it with a mic in my hand
Sean Daley and Anthony Davis
Twin Cities, they act like we famous
Still nameless in places like Vegas
So order up a round and over tip the waitress
Got the ladies in the place going ape-shit
Making faces at the radio stations
A love-hate relationship
As if we're waiting for the preacher to sit down and let the choir take it
And I'm trying to have the time of my life
Work for my stripes and climb a few flights
Try to keep the demons out of mind, out of sight
But some I'm to weak to fight, you got a light?
I stand beside every line that I write
Wrote most my rhymes just to find me a wife
And now that my better half got me hemmed up
I'm out here rapping about whatever the fuck
It don't matter just as long as I mean everything set free from between these wings
I could write a new joint and drop my view point
Maybe cook up a hook and get a few coins
A little real estate, to make us feel ok
I need to keep faith and eat a decent meal today
Hey, and even if these raps don't pay me
I'mma find a way to make the right hand pass the gravy
So special, nice to have met you
By this time tomorrow I'll probably already forget you
Now gimme fifteen for the shirt
And go tell your friends on your swim team I'm a jerk
Set it off, it never stopped
The only difference is now I'm eating better slop
Look at your boy mother, employed by brothers
Trying to make sure we all avoid the buzzards
Every scar I wear I've earned
Even the ones that I like to pretend I don't deserve
But I don't question, cause God has vision
I'm no savior, I'm just the recognants mission
Taught ya'll how to bank off tour

Road to the Riches,Strictly Leakage,2008,"When I was five years old I used to hear funk and soul
Being played out my pop's hi-fi stereo
Looking at the photos, buggin on the names
With the fold out covers and the crazy illustrations
I got older and bought my own records
By thirteen I had three crates collected, huh
And that's my pride, no time for bike rides
Kept on the grind and I stayed inside
I was sort of a poser how I had my friends over
Cutting up till we wrecked that direct drive loader
Mom's turntable went through hell
A whole lot of wicky-wicky trynna teach myself
The records got stuffed cause the parties was rough
But I still showed up to try to rock some cuts, what
And I was young but the bigger kids reached out
Give me five minutes on decks to freak out
The type to get it right, maybe one night
I be rapping bout my life on the cordless mic
No matter how it look, always kept one foot
Between records and books, and the suckers got shook
Dreamed about it two decades straight
Way before Rhymesayers first wax got made
The music is my love and it is my business
My name is Big Slug, I'm on the road to the...

I used to stand on the block selling four track tapes
Trynna make enough papes to buy more blanks
There was all kinds of hits, backpacks and drips
Sweatshirts running network and guess and cred
The word was spread with speed, the name grew like weeds
Wasn't long till we took the lead
Twin cities was little and the winter was bitter
Getting bigger and bigger, they started taking my picture
For the shit I spit, some rappers I knew quit
Got jobs and a family, they just couldn't handle it
Lice and rhyming, living like a roach
Underground and broke, holding onto the Hulk
In a small town scene we stole like a thief
No time to sleep with politics and beef, huh
They all pussies, dicks and assholes
Collecting stripes from little freestyle battles
Many mics we gripped, any stage we'd rip
Even with no chips we'd take them road trips
Loyal members of the crew had my back to death
Gene Poole, Musab, myself and Stress
All we had was rhymes, coming offa the mind
For the first time in my life everything felt fine
The turntables turn while the DJ's mix it
I didn't know I was on the road to the...

The pop that rocks for props, he eventually stops
And maybe hops on some desktop guest spots
The gangster's muscle, are up in the puzzle
But if their raps are wack they go back to the hustle
I was the one on the opposite side of smoking a gun
Taught me how to rhyme and how to run
Make or break it, the hater's can't say shit
Stayed awake late night in Ant's basement
Take notes, spray painted the paved road
The tapes sold, got lucky with ""Scapegoat"", huh
That means work, in other words sewer van
Peace to J-Bird, the man with the core plan
Seeds get planted, hands get handshakes
Damn straight, gonna keep goin till the man breaks
And MC's who wanna make ends meet out on my route
But never ever keep friendly
Stack the blocks, catch that fox
Rhymesayers locked on the Mid-West crops
Troopers, soldiers, shoulder to shoulder
Sold out the shows and give the groupies to my chauffer
New tour dates, take the money, put out more tapes
And call it foreplay, ready for the war games
Sew it up and then FUCK with the stitches

Fools think I'm rich now, I'm always on the road and
I no longer play this as much, think I lost touch
What's the buy in? I'm bout to choke up
When it comes to getting in a tournament
I play safe cause I'm still kind of learning it
Looking for a little help from the cards that are dealt, uh
Pocket nine on the felt, well...
Which of y'all want to call the big blind?
Short stack to the left, all in, fine
One more stayed in trynna re-raise
But I played requests like DJ
Fool you can splash chips, act big
Swig that beer but don't forget me over here, yeah
Keep my chips stacked up like a high rise
Drinking water cause I gotta keep my mind dry
I know you got face cards, so I'mma play hard
And avoid the late charge
Nine double Jack at the flop
C'mon, Jake needs brand new games for his Xbox
Fool, you can't even fuck with me
You're the first to bet in that the turn becomes a queen
And I seen that excitement scene
When the bitch laid down, yep, you got a king ten
Now I'm feeling like a winner
Flocks of birds don't even need to see the river
You want to go all in too?

But I didn't stop, ‘cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?

I'm shook, I know I pushed when I should have pulled
Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of…

Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?

And when you left, I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept
You disappeared, but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official
I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you, ‘cause you passed away, Dad

Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-yesterday-lyrics
Guarantees,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"These warehouse wages
Kill the ends introduction
Man I should have schooled it up
When I was younger should have stuck to plan
Always had the dreams of bein' more self assertive
And my kids a teenager now he needs the health insurance
So break my body
Break break my soul down
Just another zombie walkin' blindly through your ghost town
Pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
Ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
But I don't want to go home yet
So I'm gonna talk to my cigarette
And that television set
It doesn't matter what brand or station
Anything to take away from the current situation

No overtime pay, no holiday
Months behind on everything but the lottery
Winter around the corner guaranteein' that my car dies
Wifey havin' trouble tryin' to juggle both the part times
My cup ain't close to filled up
We tryin' to build up so we can have enough
And when I finally get the color
There won't be nothing left to paint on
A friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song

My better half is mad at making magic out of canned goods
My tax bracket status her questionin' my manhood
My shorty got caught smoking weed at a concert
And if I smack em everybody treats me like a monster
My neighbors ain't doin' much better
And we making competition instead of stickin' together
Can't save no nest egg, in fact this nest is rented
In fact that rent is late, wait
The money ain't here the raise ain't comin'
Just me and my son and that crazy woman
And those bartenders this whole fuckin' country
Got everybody swallowin' that lunch meat
Maybe we can speed up the process
Kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
Put me in the dirt and then change the topic
Some time it seems like the only way to stop it
Contemplate my departure date
Doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
Take a shot at me that's all I'm obligated for
Apparently my only guarantee is a walk away
The only guarantee in life is a life worth dyin' for
Cause death don't wait for no one
Sittin' on your front door
The only guarantee in life is a life worth dyin' for
Cause death don't wait for no one

Puppets,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"I know a guy with a rock star life
But he still don't fly, so he's mad at the sky
He sits me down, he kicks his wisdom
He's been around, I give him a listen
Seems like he's got a lot of complaints
About how nowadays things ain't the same
Used to place some faith in the basement
A toast for this guy and those kids that he came with
Cause they all on the same shit
Based on cut down placement
Uptown stay strong
Don't ever do a dance with the devil now
That smile is a sign that you're sellin' out
Judgement, gossip, ethics
Let's just exploit all this excess
Then you can feel how he feels
To walk around town lookin' down from them tall heels
And who needs fame or fortune
When you get the same love that the famous snortin'?
A future so afraid of yours
That you strayed from the course
And you came up short
Believe he would have more credibility
If he wasn't just another drunk pill junky
It's obvious to me that he's still hungry
For the superstars a little bad lucky
Go ahead and get mad at God
Point your fingers at your dad and at Santa Claus
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Wouldn't look so bad with the bandage off

It goes one for the bar tab, two for the shine
Let's go to your car, do another line
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success
One for the bass, two for the drums
Last call gonna take whatever comes
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success

I think it's great how you used to be great
I can't hate on how you choose to relate
But I know that you had the potential
I understand why you wanted to let go
A lot of pressure in the middle of those shoulders
And we ain't getting nothin' but older
Ain't nothin' changed but the day we run from
But nobody knows that better than you, huh?

One for the bar tab, two for the shine

The Waitress,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"A city full of people and my favorite is that waitress
And she treats me like some type of common vagrant
I see her every day, but there's nothing to say
Unless I decide to step inside of that cafe
I only get to sit if I buy something to eat
Otherwise it's best to keep my feet moving down that street
And god damn she's a hard bitch
Talks at me like I'm the bad dog that got into the garbage
Yeah I know that the toilet is for customers
You ain't got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work
It doesn't have to be a game of patty cake
But it ain't like you don't know I sleep in that alleyway
And by the way, I can see it in your eyes
You're angry with your life, not a stranger to the fight
I bet you hate every man that you date
And you're probably addicted to all types of escape
You take it out on me that you're all alone
When you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones
Watch the tone when you speak to old folks
I'm grown, just trying to get out of this Minnesota cold

Look lady, I'm homeless, I'm crazy
I'm so hopeless I'm suicidal daily
If you and I can't co-exist, let's fake it
'Cause I ain't got the energy it takes for this relationship

I'm waiting for a city bus to flatten me
And transport me to the ever after happily
Maybe reincarnated with luck
Come back to Earth as a cockroach in your tip cup
She said she's had it up to here
She's gonna call authorities if I don't disappear
I love her threats, it rejuvenates my breath
I give her stress for the reaction that it gets
I got a pocket full of panhandled money
On a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun
In front of everyone she calls me bum
But she notices my absence on them afternoons I don't come
So here I am, thorn in her hip
Holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips
Ignoring the insults and evil eyes
I feed off of 'em, I wonder when she'll realize
That she's the only reason I visit
The only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence
And if my ship ever comes, I'll miss it
Because I'm getting old and I ain't got much left to give it
So there it is and I have to live with it
I had the chance to make a difference, but I didn't
In the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water
Thinking: ""Damn, I should've been a better father to my daughter""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-waitress-lyrics

Another night feel like the worst one
You didn't even count your tips yet
But you can tell it ain't no big step
I don't see why you're so nice
The customers are all fucks and lowlifes
But don't fight you just keep the lip stiff
And get that money it's the weekend shift
But why they all gotta be freaks?
Wish they would just eat and leave
And keep they eyes to them self
Already insecure don't need any help
And you can blame the pride
That makes you hold your anger inside
But deep down you wanna curse 'em all
Fuck off asshole jerkoff dirt ball

Tryin' to pay them student loans
And the lights and the phone and
The food and the home
And you ain't quite broke
But you couldn't afford
That place on your own
Got a roommate to split the rent with
And now you never feel independant
And everything seem so hollow
Cause after work where that smile go
Better bring it back tomorrow
Now pick up the pace
And you might make bar close
Perfect last call then some
Flirtin' sexual tension
Surfin' though them men
Cause they all searchin' for that bent one
Or just one to bend
And you look like you could be my friend
With a smile like that I gotta flirt

Shoulda Known,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"Naked in the bathtub, sitting on the porcelain
Waiting for that little hurricane to pull your torso
And the water don't run; just drips like rain
Still drips like a painkiller drips to the veins
Fill it up with a bag of that happy stuff
Cause the way she runs out you can tell she ain't had enough
Good times goddess, my goodness
Goth fingernail polish autopilot footprints
With a smile that's stitched to the fabric
Of bedtime tales that keep them kids out of the attic
The mouth of madness, loud and manic
The motive of the word, hold it south on the atlas
Picture a hole, put your hero in
Envision the goal, now zero in
Been watching your night train track for the last few stops
With no desire to hop in
How did we end up in your apartment?
Pocket full of gossip says this ain't smart
When it's all said and done can't hit restart
But I'll be damned if I don't wanna kiss you...hard

Shoulda known better not to fuck with you
Ain't got nothing but too much to lose
Lost in the rush, don't know what to do
That drug got you like I want you
Shoulda known better not to fuck with you
Ain't got nothing but too much to lose
Lost in the rush, don't know what to do
That drug got you like I want you

I've got a restraining order against Satan's daughter
And I keep it at the bottom of this Jameson & water
And when we get there, we can sit there and stare
From behind your mascara and your thick hair
I'm aware of that pain you harbor
The same that give game to the names you martyr
Apart from the details of substance and what not
I fucks wit that hunger of love pistol gut rot
Bloodshot, gimme one shot, my shot
Propped up on enough talk to make the time stop
The lines of chalk that that Benjamin might cop
Killed the illustrations on the neighborhood sidewalks
Then all of a sudden she got silent
Pupils like marbles hide behind the eyelids
Getaway sticks,
 go limp and hold place
That fucked up smile sucked up most her face
Truly beauty, seemed serene, each criticism becomes redeemed
Swallow my words no more judgement is through
'Cause you look like what I feel like when I'm with you

Me,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"Yeah, the child in the mirror was homely
So he learned early on how to switch into low key
Little person, observant and accurate
Grew the skills to argue
And the passion to back it with
Kick over the blocks just to rebuild em
Mom and pop used to pop, sound familiar?
Daddy had to leave, but Mama kept hurtin'
So he stepped up to help be an anchor and a burden
And right around the same time
Started noticin' girls, but they wouldn't pay him any mind
And if they ever did, he got nervous
You should have seen him practice on his hand for his first kiss
Even though he was too young to hunt and gather
Hungry puppy had to learn how to front and swagger
It didn't matter, it was all self-esteem
At sixteen, you only needed one on your team
And mom and dad was never getting back together
So he was on some baby, ""We gonna make it last forever""
Basically married right out of high school
Five years of gettin' high and fightin' at a drive-thru
When he hit twenty-one, they made a son
But on his twenty-second birthday, the relationship was done
Now he's got a best friend instead of a wife
But he feels like he stole the best years of her life
After that, it was one codependent to the next
A lotta love, a lotta hate and a little bit of great sex
Self-learning in between the self-loathing
Strangled in a cycle, can't feel yourself choking
Some of them would overlap, some of them would double-back
None of 'em deserved to be exposed to all the trouble that he posed
Strike one? Not even out of fear
He don't even do rough sex, you bite him and he's out of here
Make no mistake he puts the man in manipulate
And he's attracted to the women that reciprocate
Y'all can kick karma 'til it's gettin' late
Until Mama's little drama is the topic of the big debate
And now a days the confidence is off the page
Cause women are attracted to that clown on the stage
He's only in town for a handful of hours
But Rapunzel wanna come down
And dance in the flowers
Wanna make her smile? Wanna make her laugh?
Wanna make up for the mistakes in the past?
Wanna act like he doesn't know better
If payback's a bitch he'll be in debt forever
Insecure, impatient
Temporary gratification, self-validation
That's what its made of it's all true
And it's the only reason that he's even talkin' to you
Who?

You can try to fix my broken wings
You can know all the words to the songs I sing
But you don't need to know what's wrong with me
Unless you think you gonna come home with me
You can try to fix my broken wings
You can know all the words to the songs I sing
But you don't need to know what's wrong with me
Unless you think you gonna come home with me

You can try to fix my broken wings
You can know all the words to the songs I sing

Your Glass House,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"Woke up to that familiar feeling
Staring at a unfamiliar ceiling
Still got your jeans on but you're topless
Headache and the stomach feels nauseous
Grab your shirt off the bedroom floor
And try to recollect the night before
How'd you get from the bar to this mattress?
And when you got here then what happened?
And where's the who that lives here
In this house wanna figure out how'd you get here
But the thought got cut by nature
Find the bathroom, the gut got anger
Here it comes can't avoid it
Ain't the first time throwing up in this strange toilet
Anyone else would leave
But you you crawled back to the bed and fell back asleep

All we need is because
Come and party with us
Take care of you when you're passed out
Right there with you in your glass house

Woke up all alone with no friends
But you had to throw up again
Choke up the tears and the spit
Grab some tissue to wipe off your lips
And everything still spins
And then the chills begin
And then the ""God please kill me right now"" hits
And you still don't know whose house this is
In between left over dry-heaves
You're trying to check out your time piece
And you should call your job
But first got to turn this hangover off
You dream that it's just a dream
Until the phone in your pocket starts to scream
Shut it down, don't wanna hear a sound
Heavy as the head that wears that crown
, now


Hangover ain't a strong enough word
It don't describe what just occurred
Looking at a phone full of missed calls
Probably all the people that you pissed off
Everything seems so sour
So you forced yourself into the shower
Standing up brings out the stars
And the whole bathroom smells just like a dive bar
Can't do it, better sit
And let the tub be the catcher's mitt
Lay down, face down
Thank god whoever lives here ain't around
Now what you need is silence
And you don't want no one to see you like this
Maybe you don't recognize it
But this is your home, this is where your life lives",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-your-glass-house-lyrics
Painting,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
The pictures on the wall will all remain
And even though he's home now, sound and safe
Surrounded by the faces that he place his faith
The images visit from the past he witnessed
Can't stay away from the memories
Sticks with each detail, embedded in stone
Like he chiseled those convictions into his bones
The progress stops and pauses, spits and sputters
Like the basement faucet
And it's obvious he's lost in his regrets
You can smell it on his breath

Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
But now the alcohol is gonna mother the pain
Tuck it away, no complaints
Just laying on his back, in his backyard under the rain
Take tomorrow but doesn't no how though
For every swallow there's another to follow
He weaves his way throughout the story
Looking for a new missing piece or a door key
Spirits used to be for celebration
But now they just take him away from the hell that's waiting
Re-up until it's three sheets up
And pick a place for the skeletons to meet up

Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
But if the oxygen escapes it'll smother the flames
No introduction, doesn't speak his own name
Gonna beat them demons at they own game
The sunset rides to the end slow
Same song echoing outside of the window
You can't grow if the skin don't fit you
Sometimes you gotta get low just to get through
No inspiration left to do your best when
Nobody hates you more than your reflection
Suffer the shame until it stuffs the drain
He's got two hands and a bucket of paint
Come on",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-painting-lyrics
Wild Wild Horses,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"He knew he wasn't perfect
But he always did his best to try to get under the surface
Not a saint, not a serpent
He just wanted everyone to be impressed with him as a person
So when she came along with the sunbeam
Self-esteem stopped making nothing out of somethings
Leaving the scene was unseen, I mean
It was the first time he ever felt the need to keep the gun clean
Do the math, he knew he had to choose a path
Got to get that girl, got to make her laugh
Got to shake the past and move forwards
Got to make this last, it feels gorgeous
But she had a lover in the mid-west
Never figured out how to get him off her thick chest
Just like that, everything is gone
He didn't want to but he had to learn the words so he could sing along (Sing)

Everything is all I have to give you
And I'm afraid it ain't enough
And you're not so young that you believe me
Just because I say it's love
And even if they come to steal you tomorrow
I'll know my smile was yours
Go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom
Run, run wild wild horses
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses, no
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses

Sometimes it can be so nice, right?
Sometimes she feel herself turn into the wife type
And when it's dark, sometimes sees the nightlife
But most of the time she doesn't even feel lifelike
She got a man but he thinks he's a star
And it feels like she has to compete with the bar
She keeps up her guard but it seems so hard
Momma never told her she would see those scars
Every night he's out doing who knows whom
While she cries along like a new show tune
Last call past, is he coming home soon?
Or is he going to run away with the dish and the spoon?
She'll realize she don't want that clown
Leave those shoes at the lost and found
He won't catch on until she's not around
After somebody else already locked that down
(We sing)

Everything is all I have to give you
And I'm afraid it ain't enough
And you're not so young that you believe me
Just because I say it's love
And even if they come to steal you tomorrow
I'll know my smile was yours
Go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom
Run, run wild wild horses
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses, no
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses

He didn't want her to see him leave
And he couldn't keep sitting there watching her sleep
'Cause he knows if he hangs out for a few hours
He'll dig another hole trying to plant some new flowers
But the sun don't shine under the table
He's trying to hold his life together with staples
No investment 'cause he's incapable
And he's on the outro of being labeled available
The word on the street is his girl's coming back home
No more alone, no more sad poems
No after-bar calls to the cell phone
It's time to walk a new path and grow a backbone
Shoved into the big book of just friends
Wondering how he would look as a husband
And everyone of them he ever allowed to love him
Now watching from the crowd trying to be proud of him
(They sing)

Everything is all I have to give you
And I'm afraid it ain't enough
And you're not so young that you believe me
Just because I say it's love
And even if they come to steal you tomorrow
I'll know my smile was yours

Like the Rest of Us,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"See I've been here for thirty-some years
Lookin' at myself in the same dirty mirror
So it ain't like I don't comprehend
Open that bottle, swallow that friend
No crime to take a little too much
Got time to drink away a few months
Got a little cocaine habit
But he says he only does it if somebody else has it
Go do that shit, do that shit, lady
She went vegetarian for the baby
Third trimester, I see the kid kick
She showed me outside when she gave me a cigarette
Shit, there's no way to measure it
Not every pony grows up to be a pegasus
Ya gotta let people be hypocrites

Must be drinkin' that name brand scotch
All of us cut from the same damn clothe
Some of us never cut the price tags off
She ended up on the pole
With her heels pointin' at her Jesus she used to know
Stripped her down to her naked body
We made her drown in a lake full of patriarchy
In between the pride and the misery
With the infinite supply of sympathy
Are these invisible walls that hold me
Like this goldfish bowl is the whole sea

Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust

In Her Music Box,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"She had a bad dream in the backseat
The same one as yesterday
The same one as last week
Surrounded by her favorite favorites
Elmo, Barbie, her purple baby blanket
And that little matchbox that looks like just like dad's car
It's fast on the leather, pretends its Nascar
It jumps over Elmo cause it can fly that far
With Daddy in the front seat frontin like a rap star
Hey girl oh girl Daddy's the greatest
He knows the words to everything on the radio playlist
He fakes the accent, even makes all the faces
And when he raises his voice
It makes her feel like he's famous
Yea Poppa got his lean on
A mean one
Weavin down Lake street-tryin to get his scene on
Stoppin the whip to say somethin out the window
Bobbin his head to the beat on the radio
Good daddy won't smoke no weed
Until the Bass cradles her back to sleep
Then he can steak his Mack while she takes a nap
To the sweet pretty sounds of the gansta rap
The high hat to angels voices
They keep her distracted from the stranger's voices
Escape is a paradox, because a childhood is locked in that music box

Daddies drive around, Mommies work night shift
Sweet dreams, sleep little precious
Lay down in that music box
Escape in the sound of that music box
Daddies drive around, Mommies work night shift
Sweet dreams, sleep little precious
Lay down in that music box
Escape in the sound of that music box

Yea daddy knows people, he's important
The guy with the suit and tie they see at the court
And it seems like he ain't tryin to talk to police
But at the car wash they treat him like the star that she sees
They like poppa's big wheels
And the lollipop she gets makes her feel like a big deal
Not allowed to have it yet, gotta sit still
Like the toy that she knows is gonna come with the kids meal
She loves drive through food
Health conscious dad, he buys her the juice
A little sip of soda, builds the pride
Go ahead baby girl, don't spill those fries
Nuh uh poppa can't roll a messy office
Compulsive in the way she lay them napkins all across the seat
Never puts her feet up on the upholstery
Just kicks em side to side to the beat on the radio
She sings along like dad does
She knows all the words, but she leave out the bad ones
Except bitch-she always sings the word bitch
Cause it makes her daddy laugh, it's her magic trick
And when daddy picks mommy up, they fight
They fight about money, they fight about life
So she concentrates so so hard on the music
And loses herself inside of the bass and the movement

Daddies drive around, Mommies work night shift
Sweet dreams, sleep little precious
Lay down in that music box
Escape in the sound of that music box
Daddies drive around, Mommies work night shift
Sweet dreams, sleep little precious
Lay down in that music box
Escape in the sound of that music box

Well known on the scene, jail bait queen
Had the first baby, barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came, the dad was unseen
It don't matter, he ain't got a job
So she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
Second shift till the neck is stiff
But she worked to build her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's dad slash lazy bum with no cash
He want to come over and crash
He want to play his part
So she let him move into that garden level apartment
She knew better, she did it anyways
Explain better when you trynna see some better days
The suns up, catch those rays
Butterflies now, who's got chase?

But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it could seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope
But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it could seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope

Two years later, two months pregnant
Same daddy, same broke ass situation
This time the doc said her heart might break
Praise God that the job got her health benefits straight
She believes in the right to choice
But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
Makes more now a days on the day shift
Balanced that with night classes, take some
Time and space and make it all fit
The apartment they now live in is overcrowded
Raised her voice and made her point
Told that boy, go get employed
He put on his best shirt
Said he wasn't comin back till he gets work
She knew what that part meant
So she swept every piece out that apartment
Peace out, keep out, take the scenic route
Rather only have to feed three mouths
She adapts to everything now
And nobody asks what she dreams about


A little girl was her first reason to breathe
And a little man was the first man she believed in
She gotta live right and do right by self
She do for self, she don't want your help
Afraid of bein alone, but fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone
Gonna make that home her home, with or without a man that she could call her own
Big boss at work is anxious, continues to hand her the wrong advances
She passes the test, she knew the answers
Quit the job to go take her chance with life
This is life, we all strain
While we pray for dollars and we work for change
It's all the same, we all struggle
Sometimes you gotta say fuck you!
When you smile and she doesn't return it
Give her room, man, don't disturb it
If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
Go ahead and hate the world, girl, you earned the right",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-dreamer-lyrics
The Skinny,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"This is for all those tricks and hoes
From the five-star rooms down to skid row
Whether you answer phones or dance on poles
Big money escort or broke on a strole
He don't care about your stats or background
He ain't picky once he puts his mac down
Make you suck it all the way to the ass now
Cause all of y'all heiffers are cash cows
And at first it was just a little game
Had no idea that he was fucking with your brains
When he was around you seemed mature
He helped you calm down and feel secure (sure)
He'd go get them when they still just kids
Give them some gifts, get on they lips
Before they even get a chance to get hips
Candy pimp turned it down to a trick real quick

Fly trick
Light it
Going pay all day
But won't ever get away
From skinny white pimp
I know it feel like you can't live without him
And you're still too embarrassed to tell your parents about him
It's kinda crazy how he's on your mouth
Every time you need a little bit of ""help you out""
Ain't no kitten gonna play that sharp
Shake you down, make his mark
Take you down, 
break your heart
And don't give a damn for anything that came apart
Some try anything to leave him
Seen some even put themselves in treatment
Some get away but still gotta keep looking over they shoulder forever
That ain't freedom
Take his tax makes you love it
Same old trap, but ain't you above it?
He'll beat your ass in public
Now suck that skinny white pimp dick, suck it

First thing you wake up to: your pimp
Don't forget to pay up to: your pimp
Get that money, give it here
He'll keep a bitch in that stable for 50 years
He ain't scared of the law or the cops
Got them paid off, some kind of trade off
Gonna stay in the pocket
As long as the money stays long and the hands stay strong
It's like you don't know a kid
He's right there in your clothes and hair
You never gonna let him in your home
I can smell his breath on this microphone
Your lips taste like his dick
I can always tell when he's been in your whip
You just one of a million, trick
Now take your ass outside and go talk to your pimp

Hey baby I need to change
On top of that I need to keep the change
Mother fuckers put a filter on my brain
All the cigarettes of the world get together and sing...",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-skinny-lyrics
Can’t Break,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"He wanted to make a difference, be understood right?
Wanted to go the distance, wanted to live that good life
Put some work on that wood, jumped and took flight
Left his hand writing in that book, what that look like?
Happy mess is the reach, touch and manifest it
Caught between respect your momma and them battle weapons
Lost your adolescence at them intersections
Spread them wings and you're gonna need some landing lessons
The sun is going to burn them feathers
Lost track of time trying to ride the bender
Used to have an agenda but really why remember?
Doesn't matter when your head's in a bottle somewhere in Tribeca
Or maybe you sedated up in Silver Lake
Cheating fate, first rate, feeling great
Trying to turn a first date into a friendly game of kill the snake
Can't wait to get her face against a pillow case

Progress that came with a cost
Rejoice for the rain that will wash
Multiple choice, you can stay on that cross
Or grab it by the arms and break them off

The wheels are stopped, done, so let me off
Deal the cards but already lost
Kill me now just to get applause
Steal the shot, run, and set it off
I feel and I fear and I want and I can't break away
I feel and I fear and I want and I can't break away
If they buy it for you, how you not going to drink it?
If they fry it for you, how you not going to eat it?
If they throw it to you, how you not going to hold it?
Touch it taste it love it and fuck with it a moment?
Every city's the same scene, gangrene
Vampire's looking at your veins, fangs craving
Interchangeable hair, similar name jeans
Faux-made take charge and late start playthings
It ain't harder to tell
They rebel to celebrate the day their martyr had fell
Now meet him at the bar cause it's part of the sell
Felt at peace, leaving pieces of his heart at hotels

Stepped in with his next new best friend
On the bed's edge loading up on the weapon
Trying to win big all bets in
Now pull the bedspread back and pop that essence",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-cant-break-lyrics
Vanity Sick,"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",2008,"So vanity sick
You're so, so vanity sick
So vanity sick, you're so..
So, she's a stone cold player
Whatever old school cliche you want to label the flavor
And when they see her at the festivities
Best believe, yes indeed, she gets the lead
No surprise it threw you off
From the hairdo down to the boots and socks
And it's okay that she blew you off
Because a pony like that's got too much hop
Soft smile, but sips a stiff one
Way ahead of the competition
No opposition, are you kiddin, stop the wishin'
These other flops ain't got a pot to piss in
Not tonight, this is all you
All these Neanderthals wanna ball you
Half of 'em would die just to call you
'Cause they're confined behind the wall, too
Let's toast to the beautiful people
The ones that made you afraid to be you
The ones that trained you to hate your shell
The ones that sold you your favorite self
I don't judge what she's made of
I never met the woman underneath that make up
Too insecure to let you in that door
What you see is what you get, gotta protect the core
So difficult not to invest
Just my type over ripe and intense
So concerned with covering the flaws
I'm surprised that she doesn't expect applause
And each drink tastes so bittersweet
When that jukebox just seems to hit repeat
It's best to keep the interest discrete
With a handshake, maybe let her kiss the cheek
We think she could get a little thicker
She keeps shrinking to get a little figure
That smile is a warning sticker
I'm unavailable to play with your vanity sister
So vanity sick
You're so, so vanity sick
So vanity sick, you're so
So, so..
So vanity sick

Yeah, he saw a lot of shit and talked a lot of shit
He tried to stay on top of it but did the opposite
And when it started comin' apart
The poor man thought he did the obvious
And hopped inside a tour van
He was a roadie for your favorite indie-what band
Big enough to make the cool kids say: ""Fuck them""
He was a sucker sellin' merch for the summer
Thought it sounded fun and it made a little bread 'n butter
""I love ya,"" the last words heard as the bus pulls away from the curb (From the curb)
As it pulled on the 94 he forgot about the line and the crime and the times before
Already missed her, bitch-made, lift her, switchblade, pull her, ribcage, quivers
Leave a message, chokin' on the vocals
Callus on the finger he uses to dial the mobile
A week into it he was a freak, he knew it
A nervous wreck, couldn't sleep, couldn't do shit
He hadn't heard from her in a couple days
""What? You too busy? C'mon, give me a fuckin' break""
You want an explanation
'Cause right now you feelin' just a little exploitation
Phone call found home in a sound
Calm down now, don't let the walls all fall down now

You are teaching yourself to play the keyboard?
What kind of bullshit is that? Oh, are you for real?
That's why you didn't call me back?""

Well alright
Just try to make it through the tour alive
Soon enough you get to drive up 35
Gotta survive a little more time on the road
Before you get to go home to your life
And when the shit looks familiar, you know it didn't kill ya
Just more dirt in the filter
When you get up in the house
You can sit her on the couch
And show her what it's really all about now

And maybe she will serenade you (Play me something)
With a song that she wrote for you (Yeah, yeah, show me- play me somethin')
Because she missed you (Play me somethin!)
And she loves you, right?

Honey, I'm home! But your shit's all gone
And you're gone too, yo, this shit's all wrong
She packed up and moved out
Bagged up and flew out the nest
Like that, she had to track up a new route
What? She took the keyboard
It's for the best
She'll need something to do when she gets depressed
And when you get upset
You can spend your breath
Lookin' out the window waitin' for her footsteps
And not a single dream goes by
Without the pretty little fingers making notes fly
Middle of the night, tryin' to sleep
But you hear her at the front door fuckin' with her keys

Now she thinks of you when she plays those keys
She knows which notes she ain't write on her own
There's no way to make her wait and stay lonely
But maybe someday your baby might have a home
Now she thinks of you when she plays those keys
She knows which notes she ain't write on her own
There's no way to make her wait and stay lonely
But maybe someday your baby might have a home
Now she thinks of you when she plays those keys
She knows which notes she ain't write on her own
There's no way to make her wait and stay lonely
But maybe someday your baby might have a home

When I hear her songs, it makes the sun shut down
It doesn't come back 'til she goes away
I wait until the day she don't come around
And I listen to the sound of no more to say

""I got nothing to say to you. For real
I'm gonna get off the phone now. Yeah. Have a good night"" (Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night)",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-keyboard-lyrics
The Ropes,Leak at Will,2009,"Hey man, you remember Stephanie's little cousin?
Yeah, a little feminine motherfucker
Used to be scared of the football, yeah man
Nah, nah I saw him the other night down town
Wilin' out, man, it was crazy
Running around Hennepin
Waving a gun at frat boys and shit
Hey dog, I heard you got those trees
Wait dog, you can't possibly be
Even thirteen, what you doing open this late?
Ain't got no older brothers to hold you in place?
Yeah I know, you gotta get your hustle on
And life does go on and fronts like nothing's wrong
State law says you're too young to work
But a couple of bucks will put a gun up under your shirt
Coke, weed, junk and speed
Teach me another type of hide and seek
Chemistry, economics, math and business
Already a pimp before high school's finished
Even the rich kids get in the mix
Only difference is them bitches did it for kicks
And we quick to say it's just a game that's dealt
That gave you that rope so you can hang yourself
It goes
So big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so
The movies and the music taught me how to do it
And how to build a crew, and how to get it moving
Supply and demand came and held my hand
Should've seen me back then, didn't even have a plan
Only had a pistol 'cause they had a pistol
Cocked that hammer and blowed them missiles
I only had a handful of minutes
So if we gon' talk then we only talk business
Now tell me what you want from me
I got a few females, you need some company
Because y'all don't be where those junkies be
But hold up now, you gon' pull your guns on me?
Nah man, I'm a big kid with big dreams
You gon' treat me like you know that I'm only sixteen
Huh, well fuck it right? Shut my eyesight
Only squeezed out a couple and I only got double life
Big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so
Hey there girly, you got your worm early
Jumped off the branch, fly little birdy
Look around, but don't look down
'Cause you see no need to touch foot to the ground
Sex, drugs, rock and rolled up
Them older boys got you thinking that you growed up
Spent the whole day getting high
Putting work on them little thighs
And I ain't tryna criticize
You gotta live your life, you gotta get your stripes
Take aim and kiss the sky
Don't be another one wishing that you did it right
Nah, do your best, it's all we can expect
Try to see the game while it deals the death
Gotta keep keeping on, move it along
'Cause there's a whole lot left when today's all gone, now
Big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes

Mother’s Day,Leak at Will,2009,"She lost one to pneumonia, gave the other to prison
And now she spends mother's day sitting in her kitchen
Looking at the pictures of her past felt surreal
She had a couple of people, some friends that helped her heal
But days like today, she doesn't want to be a bother
And as far as she's concerned, them boys didn't have a father
Nuh uh, she had to teach 'em the ways
Teach 'em how to behave, be brave and even how to shave
Some days it makes her feel like a soldier
And other times it makes her feel like a failure
Why did the stronger one die from a cold, huh?
Why did the smarter one end up in jail? Nah
She gave them boys everything that she could
Two full-time jobs to keep 'em in a good neighborhood
They understood how to love and how to live
Now she doesn't understand how it comes down to this
Maybe she should go work in her yard
And take her mind off the past and try to let the days start
But she's waiting on one of those annual calls
While she's looking at the photos on her hallway walls
His big sibling died and mom's by herself
And now he spends every day inside of that cell
Looking at the photos of his past makes him crash
So he never takes 'em out that folder under his mattress
Days like today he doesn't think about what happened, no
Still gotta call mommy, wish her a happy one
Uh huh, mom, if only she'd had been around
Maybe big brother would still be living now
Some days it makes him feel like a traitor
And other times it makes him feel like a martyr
Seems like some displacement of anger
Seems like he blames her more than his father
She was gone all the time at work
Never around to play the part of the police or the nurse
She understood how things fall apart
So why'd she let the nest hit the ground this hard?
Well, maybe he should go walk in the yard
And take his mind off the past and try to let the days start
'Cause it's so difficult to admit it's his fault
When he's looking at the faces in his hallway walls",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-mothers-day-lyrics
Feel Good Hit of the Summer Part 2,Leak at Will,2009,"This, this is your...
 day
Little Pat, the fuck was that?
I won't lie little homie, they opened up doors for me
Still hoping there's a moral to that story
I think about all the time dedicated to getting inebriated
We did it just for the sake of it
Your family physician is a dope man
That new prescription got you open
Came a long way from visions of spirits
Now we getting lifted off the cough syrups
I saw up close how fucked up coke was
So I was always too neurotic for the powder narcotics
Huh, but I'm a pot head, functional alcoholic
I don't binge though, I understand the logic
I like hash but that shit's always hidden
And I've never seen peyote here in my jurisdiction
Never used a needle but I know 'bout the sweats
'Cause I'm addicted to coffee, cigarettes, probably sex
Ecstasy is too damn strong for me
And the intensity lasts too long for me
Plus I figure I don't need any buzz
To make me any more needy than I already was
Huh, and to be real I don't trust them pills
Somebody's mobile home laboratory up in the hills
Or maybe bikers in a basement, dirty and nervous
Tryna measure out the right amount of laundry detergent
Hallucinogenics, who's tempted
To bend your perception for a few seconds?
Actually it's like a half-day gave away
A deal that you made to do nothing but play and pray
Please dear God, don't want to vomit again
I promise from now on I'll stick to marijuana plants
Mushrooms and me will not be friends
Until the next time that Nate shows up with tops and stems
Gobble 'em, yum, no, tastes like shit
But you'll forget about that once they kick
And for me acid was the same trip
Until the part came where you wonder what it's made with
Think about it, you're so high sitting there
Thinking about thinking about it, so high sitting there
Strychnine sick, vision impaired
Found the meaning of existing on the floor in your kitchen, yeah
I ain't gonna tell you that you better not do it
But master your high, try not to abuse it
Stay away from me if your life's getting stupid
And please stop pretending that it makes better music",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-feel-good-hit-of-the-summer-part-2-lyrics
Millie Fell Off the Fire Escape,Leak at Will,2009,"She dropped the gun and started running down the corridor
She found the exit to get out that department store
She reached full sprint when she hit the parking lot
She didn't see police, not even any rent-a-cops
She ran across the street and went behind the Applebee's
From there she could see those abandoned factories
Figured there's a good place for her to hide away
Knowing she could climb inside through the fire escape
At this point, still felt like a dream
In her head she could still hear the little kid's screams
Leaning up against the dumpster to find some breath
She could hear the sirens, now it's time to step
Running through the alleyway, now relentless
Bobbing in between houses, hopping fences
Only two more blocks 'till the overpass
The adrenaline is rendering a panic attack
Maybe she should go back and explain it all
Maybe the best thing to do now is take that fall
Ain't no way that they won't understand
Daddy's little girl is never gonna hurt again
She can't believe that she's having this dilemma
Tryna find a reason that she shouldn't go surrender
She's a kid and a first time offender
Plus he had it coming, hell is colder in December
Decided she would make it to the vacant warehouse
From there she could try to get her head to clear out
She needs a minute to sit and think
Some time to reflect on these events and let 'em sink
There's the building, it's empty she hopes to God
The fire escape is on the back near the loading dock
The next chapter to the happy ever after
Wrapped her little fingers 'round the cold metal ladder
Started climbing, that's when she heard the officer

They Always Know,Leak at Will,2009,"They always know
They always know
They always know
They always know
She left that town
Because nobody there really cared whether or not she kept around
All they care about is which people slept around
They pay no mind to who really held it down
It's like high school for grown ups
It's no wonder everyone you know is so nuts
Ex-boyfriendships with benefits
Whiskey binges and stimulated sedatives
Sky-high on the floor of your closet
Thinking 'bout life and how it tastes like garbage
It's time to get gone away from this town
Seems still wants to blame her surroundings
Got a grudge and a pocket of neurotic love
Played a perfect game but forgot what the object was
Where's the book that the answers are sketched in?
Life lessons, all types of questions
Sick of being misled and lied to

He's tryna hit a home run in your mom's garage
He loved graffiti, it opened him
Creeped down an alley with a can of Rust-Oleum
Canvas, that flat surface
He learned quick to control the nervousness
If it ain't building, he burnt the bridge
And no, he don't give a damn what the curfew is
Chased away all the saving grace
While them old folks bitch about the way he's raised

Get you running from the cops just for practice here
Well, what do you know? He got older
Trying to apply what childhood showed him
Everybody left out in that cold
And try to learn how to manage all the weight on his shoulders

Stay original, be individual
Push the pedal and never settle for the typical
Feed your children, look out for your people
Live and let live, and each one teach those

Getting fat, fucking up fellow have-nots?
Hey preacher, politician
Is that the house that you live in? How's the kitchen?

Bunch of reality shows full of assholes
All the popular situation comedy
Caught up in the oxymoronic hypocrisy
On the couch with remote on search
Seen better acting on them shopping networks
I'd like put my foot through the glass
But without it I would have to shoot smack to relax
Every A.M. starts to a cartoon
Watch it in the afternoon and see the people argue
Prime time television is worse though
Surf the shit, I'd rather watch the commercials
Program a nation of clones
Subliminal seeds, watch 'em grow

The Woman with the Tattooed Hands,Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP’s,2009,"I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful
Tattoos on the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man
It's not that she wasn't attractive;
She was beautiful, but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
Would've intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch it
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed too hunger (sweet flower)
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
But if I've learned anything in my years (my years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise (in surprise)
But what happened next damn near stole my tears
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'd never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of em I've hurt
And every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About woman taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
For that woman with the tattooed hands

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-woman-with-the-tattooed-hands-lyrics
The Best Day,"To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EPs",2010,"I had a rough day, but that's life, it happens
Woke up on a dark side of my mattress
I guess I forgot to set my clock
Overslept, almost lost the job
Then to top it off, I'm kinda hungry
But can't eat till I find my money
It's in my wallet but my wallet ain't in my pocket
Can't remember the last time I saw it
And they don't want me in a bad mood
Afraid that it'll spread and everyone will catch an attitude
They got 'em all singing the same tune
Thinking I should go and start a fire in the break room
Co-workers make me sick
And the manager really ain't shit
But I can't quit, so I'm hiding in the basement
Holding onto to my face like fuck this place

Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play
Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play

Hell naw, I ain't going to school
The teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids mess with each other always all day
Class warfare up and down the hallways
And if you ain't popular
Nobody talks to ya, unless they mocking ya
Not even bus driver or the hall monitor
I might as well climb inside my locker huh
It's a bad day, bad week and a bad month
Don't nobody want to trade with my bag lunch
Someday I'mma be so cool
But for now I got cheap shoes, so I keep losing
Girls give no love to a poor man
It's a prison, the clock is warden
Man it won't get no better when I get home
So I listen to the voice in my headphones

Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play
Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play

Can't dance with an upset stomach
The overdraft notices just kept coming
Somebody broke into the porch and stole a chair
Top of your head stopped growing hair
Broken glass, computer crashed
The car won't start and the tires went flat
Dog got loose, brought back a dead cat
Daughter found it and had a panic attack
Plus you ain't had sex in how long?
Afraid to admit that the fire's all gone
The better half is talking about separate
You wish you could take it back to yesterday
You not alone, it's hard as hell
But don't waste no time feeling sorry for self
We'll be right here with you through your war
Cause you're the one that we make this music for
Now turn it up

Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play
Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-best-day-lyrics
The Loser Wins,"To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EPs",2010,"You know you fucked up, right?
Bye bye, wish you luck with life
But I'd be damned if, I let you manage
To bless that blade and keep taking advantage
Look man, yeah, you shook my hand
But that was back then, we're not good, fam
I'm the fool 'cause I started to be cool with him
But I got schooled in the art of opportunism
I ain't the only one that walked away
Look around, everybody gone today
You all alone with your empty chest
So bury the bones with any regrets
And keep those skeletons piled in stacks
Just drink your medicine, don't bite your glass
I tried to make a difference
But the only thing that changed was I gave you distance

I won't trust you again
Getting better at choosing friends
This time, the loser wins
'Cause I learned how to cut off the looser ends
I won't trust you again
Getting better at choosing friends
This time, the loser wins
'Cause I learned how to cut off the looser ends

I'm not tripping, this just an excuse
For me to dig down a little bit of the truth
We killing time and time's killing us
So I won't waste mine tryna grip a grudge
But don't twist it into what it isn't
Don't call, don't write, don't visit
I put you on ignore, you're not the homie anymore
The only thing that you could show me is the door
Game over, yeah, who's winning?
Save your gas, I refuse to listen
If you doing math, we doing division
Don't even ask how I've been, there's no you in existence
Go your way, I'll go my way
And you keep going until there's no one to violate
And I'mma remember your last impression
Thanks for that lesson

I won't trust you again
Getting better at choosing friends
This time, the loser wins
'Cause I learned how to cut off the looser ends
I won't trust you again
Getting better at choosing friends
This time, the loser wins
'Cause I learned how to cut off the looser ends

To All My Friends,"To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EPs",2010,"Yeah, I saw the sign in the window, for the job
Yeah I got a high school education, but that's all
Skills? You wanna know if I got some skills?
Yeah I got some skills
This goes out to all my friends

What you gonna be when you grown up?
I'm all grown up and still don't know what
I mop throw-up, I rock a tow-truck
Long as it means that I can get old and post up
I used to be a typical winner
Living off the gratuity from delivering your dinner
Cause as a kid, I didn't consider
That I would get the opportunity to be a full-time spitter
I love this occupation
I got bosses across the nation
Validation is an understatement
And I don't really know how to take a vacation
My kind don't have any free time
I'm so distracted, but everything's fine
I speak shine and I read signs
Appreciate your opinion but this dream's mine
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell a cowboy what to do
I was the ugly kid that didn't listen
Little big man full of ambition
Based on imagination, just like you
Daydreaming, thinking bout the things I might do
I used to paint, draw and illustrate
Mom would facilitate and it would feel okay
Seems like yesterday still plays a part
When I grow up, I wanted a job making art
Picture that, how many years old?
Young enough to mix up love with career goals
But I was just this tall when they told me
That the world was mine, but the papers weren't signed
There's no deed, so proceed to go seed
Up the whole piece like it owes me groceries
Don't breathe until you formally know me
Won't leave? Better call authorities
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell an astronaut what to do
The turntables stole my heart
Burnt the paintbrush, broke it apart
I miss it, I might revisit
But I wasn't that good, I admit it, maybe you can't tell
But as a kid, I wanted to be Melle Mel
And later as a teenager I wanted to be LL
Then I discovered weed and I wanted to be Del
But thank God eventually I found myself
It's funny when I bump into fools
I used to go to school with, and they ask what I'm doing
Half of the time I want to crack a lie
But fuck it, I'm still a wannabe rapper guy
Hahaha, yeah I guess that it seems that way
I get to see the world, and it's decent pay
As long as somebody want to see us play
I wake up every morning and I seize the day
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell the president what to do

It's like that y'all, it's like this y'all
I don't get to call in sick y'all",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-to-all-my-friends-lyrics
The Number None,"To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EPs",2010,"Alright
Baby listen, they playing our song
You want to slow dance with me? C'mon
You can just say no
You ain't gotta be a douche about it

I was just a kid, she was just a kid
Lost in the mix, it didn't matter what we did
She used to baby me, I was her baby doll
I used to chase her around, she was my basketball
I guess it had to fall, I should've known
No model to follow, we were both from broken homes
But we used to laugh about acting grown up
And I could hear her mom in the back yelling hang the phone up
A teenage love, a teenage love
Keep up the crush on what it means to us
It's okay girl, we don't even need to fuck
I was the first one to show her what a penis was
We used to sit on the park bench and hold hands
Staying out past dark to feel the romance
Summer time I was waking up early
Bounce out the flat little worm, get the birdy
Walk to her house and watch a couple movies
Kissing on her nipples, playing with the coochy, whoo!
That's as far as it ever got, pet the spot
Get her all wet and hot, and then it stopped
Frustration, soon after that
She broke up with me like boom it's a wrap
She said that we were moving too fast
No seducing the ass, she needed room to relax
But hold up now, I don't understand
All I really wanted was to be your lover man
We can wait, no pressure, I'll be patient
She said stop calling me, I'm taking a vacation
So there it was decorated with the wordplay
I'm at school and I'm tryna hide my hurt face
She started seeing others but it got worse, wait
She let my homeboy hit it on the first date

Oooh!
Sorry dude
Makes me wanna sing, I wanna sing, c'mon
{Hook: x3}
I don't miss you, but I remember you
You taught a lesson and for that I give you gratitude
I'm such a mess with love and sex

Freefallin’,"To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EPs",2010,"Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

Nobody want to struggle at home
Bass in his voice, trouble in her tone
What kind of couple makes a puzzle out of stone?
Chopping and popping all of the bubbles that are blown
Nobody want to be wrong
And once the line gets drawn across what we disagree upon
It could be the time bomb that we sleep on
It's just a little one, back and forth like a ping pong
Nobody wants an argument
You try to bargain as a friend
But it's hard to with a star offence against a smart defence
And the history you share is full of scars and dents
Nobody likes breaking up
When you hate the situation but you crave the touch
You might stay in the relationship for the simple sake of it
Because you know it's based in love

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

Nobody want to go to work
For some older jerk that doesn't know the dirt
That's embedded in the hearts of those that hurt
Monday through Friday, and Saturdays for bonus perks
Nobody befriends beast
Just to make ends meet and try to pay rent and eat
Spread sheets by the end of the week
He'd rather spread them sheets than try to get some sleep
Nobody want to lift a crate
That ain't living great, you want a kid and play
You should dip, escape, no two week notification
Show up late and quit today
Nobody wants an awful boss
That got you popping out the top of your mouth as if it's common talk
You ought to wait until you off the clock
And appreciate that fact that you've got a job

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

But somebody want that life you got
They think your boyfriend's nice or your wife is hot
They on your block looking at that home you bought
They'd move in today if that door wasn't locked
Nowadays you ought to watch your spot
Even with all the flaws of that boss you mock
You could still close your eyes and toss a rock
I bet you'd hit someone that'd love to cop your job
That's what I thought, of course you don't stop
You won't take the shot, you can't afford the loss
If you don't want to taste the sauce
Then put the plate down and take a walk
Drop, or move away from the pot
Cause every time you talk you complain a lot
Don't forget to count the balls y'all caught
Enjoy what you got before it all falls off

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path

Scalp,"To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EPs",2010,"I sat down and put a fifty on the bar
A whisky and a beer, let's forget where we are
And keep 'em coming till I drink that whole grant up
Filling up that cup till I can't stand up
Look around, see what the room's got
Well there's Sonny by the jukebox
Grab my drinks, headed over to say peace
But had to think, do I owe him any late fees?
Wait up nah, I'm all paid up huh
Yeah I made it square last time I came up town
What up Sonny? {What up?} How's business?
{How you doing Sean? I ain't seen you in a couple of minutes}
Man I just been working and jerking
Tryna get the rent right and be perfect, how bout you?
{Oh you know how the same old game go
Hustle through the wind, rain, snow or tornado}
Yea bro, spent time catching up
The bartender kept the drinks fresh enough
Good conversation, no pretension
I drank up my whole fifty bucks and then some
It was getting close to last call
So I grabbed my coat and stood up like that's all
But Sonny say {Hold up Sean, it's your day
I need a favor, let me throw some money your way}
I sat back down in the booth
I said, I know your deal Sonny, what I gotta do?
He said {I'll give you three-five piece of the pie
If you pick up a package for me on the eastside tomorrow}
Three and a half for an hour and a half
Saint Paul and back's only ten dollars gas
Yeah I can handle, give me all the info
Only one thing though, I won't bring a pistol
{Hahahah} He laughed and said {It ain't like that
It's simple, grab the package and come right back
It's a tattoo shop, it's called...} Shhh don't snitch
{They some nice cats} Nice cats? {Cool as an icepack}
Well alright jack {Discretion is a must
Keep a hush, other than that I don't give a fuck}
Cool, I got this, it's done like dinner
And then I stepped out into the winter

I got behind the wheel of my vehicle
Streetlights shining on my face, you can see it glow
The rearview reflection got clearer
I starting talking to the image in the mirror
I said, you should go back in and decline
Sonny will understand, everything will be fine
Sean calm down, get a grip, you're tripping
I took a deep breath and put the key in the ignition
Stop being a bitch now, man up
Rolling down twenty-six with thoughts of handcuffs
Pulled out on Lyndale, killed by a couple of drunks
Broad-sided my pickup truck",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-scalp-lyrics

Perfect in every way you could crave of
I hope all your brats behave
And that you had a good shower, shat and shave
I hope your lady cooperates, plays nice
I hope you already got laid today twice
I hope that your teeth don't hurt
And it's the first morning of a whole week off work
I hope that your back feels fine and your car starts first try
Search a blue sky and watch the birds fly
Hope its everything you could ask for, plus more
Maybe even catch a little nap on the front porch
I hope you got the world under foot
And you're on page one of your new favorite book
I hope you took a little time to reflect
Hope you get to look, see the signs that connect
I hope there's no depression or panic attacks when
You finally decide to get a life and quit rapping

I'm only serious, I hope you're hearing this
In land at the end of the line, just like period!

Tommy doesn't got no money for the doctor
But Tommy got sick, Tommy needs a shot or
Maybe Tommy got shot and needs a lot more
Thank mommy Tommy's problem is not yours
Tommy went to county medical service
It's where you go when you don't have insurance
Budget cuts and they overwork the nurses
You can find more lying than at a circus
Tommy sitting in a hospital waiting room
Pray to God that the doctor will take him soon
Blood pressure on burn cause they stress him out
It's your turn, some intern will check you now
Wait, first got to fill out the paperwork
I know you're hurt but the bill's gonna make it worse
Healthcare costs more than a small plane
Good thing Paul had the brain to use a false name

God bless the nation, obligation
Altercation, interest of conflict
Population, lost your patience
Confirmation, symptoms of a hostage

Katy went and got a baby in her stomach
She didn't mean to, she was only fucking
It ain't like she isn't old enough to cut it as a mother
Doesn't matter though, it's not in the budget
Now she got to make a visit to the clinic
She can't remember ever feeling this timid
She gonna front and act like it isn't hard
Vacuum, boom, put it on her debit card
Sitting in the waiting room, it's a full house
A lot of a presidents that didn't pull their troops out
If you're gonna special op with the bad boys
Going in unprotected is a bad choice
It's your decision to correct a poor decision
Alert the stork to stop, abort the mission
Forced in a more horrible position
When the doc got shot on the way into the building

God bless the nation, obligation
Altercation, interest of conflict
Population, lost your patience
Confirmation, symptoms of a hostage

Stop the bus, I'm hopping off here
Get down, snuck and got near
Just to watch you drown in them crocodile tears
Dressed up all black with a clown mask
Shred the system, sound clash
Fall back when my feet touch ground

A lot of work for a little bit of dough
Wipe the dirt out the window of the soul
Fish with my pole from the middle of the snow
Still running, bound to build something

Lost on a rook move, shoot

Get paranoid and collect protection
Get destroyed by the boy just stepped in

Clap, clap, clap your hands to what he's doing

And that's ordinary normal business
And you trying to ignore the visit
But your girl's online bout to score some tickets
I was born a crumb, I'm a poor decision
I'll die a crumb, I'm sure it's written
But first I'mma smash over ornaments
And then bounce 'fore they announce the court's opinion
We all rapper rappers
We all wanna capture stature like any of it matters
Ass backwards and a lack of words
Only thing that you're killing me with is laughter
They used to cap and call me a backpacker
But they was mad I had my mack mastered
Went up the ladder and I seen the ants

I might arrive on the plane, train, bus or bike
You can fuss and fight, but it's just despite
Cause it functions right when I cup this mic
No feedback, ease back, let the beat crack
But Uncle Sam said he wanna see tax
Make the beeswax, no relax
Run around the map and leave tracks

Rip the beef into child size pieces
You talk cheap, now you need to get your teeth fixed
I don't recognise you or your toy crew

Didn't need a gun to put a +Slug+ in your guts

You got casted as an extra, fantastic
But why don't you tone it down to bout half as dramatic
Can't dance past without a glance at the glass
Still won't admit that you practised that accent
Your personalities are canvas
You wanna impress me? Go fix a decent sandwich
Come on chuckles, grab a cluster of struggles
Muster up the guts to tattoo 'em on your knuckles
Broken models causing troubles
Frozen nostrils, solve that puzzle
How many photo albums full of self-indulgence?
Cellphones, so portraits can be helmed
On your favorite internet social network rebellion
Got me wondering what the fuck you selling

Everybody, everybody want to be somebody
Go gotta be, there's no probably
You can talk to me after the party
It's just monotony, human commodities",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-commodities-lyrics
Bar Food,Fifth Element Presents: Atmosphere Storybook Vol. 1,2011,"Do you guys have veggie burgers ?
Yeah, can I get one of those ?
Can you put bacon on it for me ?

Once upon a time, one night next week
I hit the five-eight to get a bite to eat
I went inside, nobody here
But a couple guys at the bar holding beers
I sat down in the booth
I'll take a glass of grapefruit juice
Checking the selections
But I didn't get further than the mushroom Swiss burger
They said meat is murder, but I eat it
If it wasn't illegal, I'd eat people
As long as he used to walk
I'll take him with a side of the tater tots
I don't dine out a lot
I don't spend time out in general pop
And if I wasn't all alone at the spot
I'd probably order it to go in a styrofoam box
She brought me my sandwich
It came in a plastic basket
It's poison for my health
So you know I'm enjoying myself
But all of a sudden
The bar filled up with a herd of suburban bumpkins
No more personal space
Wish that they would all burst into flames
That's when I decided to get my revenge
I quietly got up, locked the doors
Went into the kitchen and popped the drawers
Grabbed any knife in sight
Tonight everybody getting sacrificed, aight?
The whole south side heard them scream
Sent them to hell, felt like a dream
It was a gruesome bloodbath
Stabbed everyone, including the pub staff
Then I sparked a grill and went to town
Fried 'em all up and chowed 'em all down
After the feast, peace
Went home and fell asleep
Now I feel guilty, so in front of all of you
I'm ready to admit that I'm addicted to bar food

Mhmm, this is a tasty burger",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-bar-food-lyrics
Summer song,Satan Hates Beauty (Atmosphere),2011,"Slug: 
She came back to visit, she says
Cause in some ways, Minneapolis is more real than L.A
But I won't go to the triple-rock on a tuesday
Too many people pop out of they pimples and play
And at night, we can watch these people in these bars
They're all insane, they all know my name
Who won the game? no one's in pain
But either way girl, I'm glad you came
And if the elements and irrelevance I strain
Hair's wet, who cares if it's sweat or rain
As long as it doesn't leave a permanent stain
It's all in vain if there's nothing left to gain
And somethin's in the way she looks at her prey
There's no way she'll allow you to live
Swallow the fight, inhale the night
There's not much else left for you to give
Who's leaving? (there she goes)
Who's leaving?
Who's breathing as opposed to who's bleeding
Carress the rooftop and stare at the space
For the flesh that you gave just to get a taste
It goes... nothing comes close
Scream of the smile and choke boy choke
Passion come death, and death bring power
At the top of the hour we sing for the monster
And here she goes, with that look in her eyes
The souls of those that got took by surprise
Crooked little smile that clings to her lips
On a night like this I sing for the bitch
(Chorus)
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dying
I was smiling hard
But I was lying

So what's the time? it's almost time for her to go to work
The sun is shining but I'm in the shadow of my smirk
I keep my breathin under my breath
Tucked within the untrimmed bushes next to her front steps
And when she leaves to make treck towards the bus stop
My love erupts (POPS) a thousand tiny blood clots
Damn I wish that she was mine but time and time over the discretion
On my right shoulder whispers to my ear
Advising me to admire from way over here, play the rear
And struggle for the view to clear
It's been 2 years and quite a few beers
Too many loose tears and a few souveniers
And if she only knew, how long I've waited for her
How her smiles enough to make my winter warmer
If she knew the way she walks could take away my storm
She'd probably call the cops and get a restraining order
As much as I hate myself, I hate you more
But I still smile when you come through that door
And as much as I hate my life, I hate yours too
Just can't seem to teach myself to ignore you
This is for the ladies, not every lady
Just the ones that drive me crazy, the ones that scream SAVE ME
I wanna thank y'all for everything you gave me
Now lean in and taste me (kiss)
(Chorus 2x)
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dyinng
I was smiling hard
But I was lying
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dyinng
I was smiling hard
But I was lying
Right up to your face and kiss you!",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-summer-song-lyrics
Became,The Family Sign,2011,"It's no surprise I overslept
Put my boots on and climbed out my tent
I didn't see you, assumed you were sleeping
Immediately start a fire cause it's freezing
I can't believe we went camping in the cold
I'm in the wilderness standing in some snow
A late start, but we can still catch up
You need to wake up, we should eat and then pack up

That's when I noticed your foot prints
The snow's fresh and those have been put since
What, you're already up making the rounds?
So where you at now, you laid back down?
The breeze came and it stalled out the flame
While I went to your tent and called out your name
You didn't answer, so I opened up the flap
It's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack

I'm looking at your tracks and You took a couple laps
Around the campground and hoofed down the path
I figure you'll return, no concern
I'mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn
The wind is blowing strong, minutes rolling on
It's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone

It ain't right, start the paranoia
I left the camp site to go and search for ya
I read the trail your feet made
Each step was deliberately placed
It looks like you know where it leads
But I see nothing but leafless frozen trees
About a quarter mile into the course
Another set of tracks appeared next to yours
From the north it came out of the thick woods
And those footprints belong to a big wolf

Trying to find service on my cellphone
I felt aight with my knife on my belt, though
I hope the wolf is intimidated by you
I wondered if you even knew what was behind you
Stalking ya, maybe watching ya
Waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya
Salivating', wanna take ya to the stomach
In the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick

And it gets about as bad it goes
Cause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow
I understood, it doesn't look good
Your fan club doubled, now you've got another wolf
And the odds are in favor of the home team
Why'd you walk off all alone, where you going?
It ain't the right time to complain, but
It feels like I'm trying to find your remains

Your foot prints grew further apart
I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart
It means you started to run, so I did the same
Now my breaths looking like a steam engine train
Suddenly your tracks dip off of the path
And so did theirs, so my knife I grabbed
Into the forest, expect the worst
Adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves

50 yards into the woods and brush
It got so thick that it looked like dusk
The air stood serene, sober
It seemed like a good 15 degrees colder
And I'll admit: Hell yeah, I felt fear
The sound of my heart beat was all I could hear
Looking at the snow it was plain and clear
There was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared

I can't process, I don't follow
It would be easier to believe that you were swallowed
With no sign of death, no sign of struggle
No signs of blood, no signs of trouble
And the wolves never stopped
The tracks kept going and I took off
So I don't know how your story ends
But I know I'll never go into those woods again

It's not that tragic, it's not a shame
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-became-lyrics
The Last to Say,The Family Sign,2011,"As far back as he cares to remember
He used to see his old man lose the temper
And mama's pretty face would catch it all
On a regular basis the nest would fall
But he was always safe from dad's rage
Cause mama sacrificed in his place
Two-dozen years of the blood, sweat, tears
Avoid the mirror, losing her hair from the fear
She never left him, she stayed inside
He beat her ass up until the day that he died
In fact, the biggest beating was the day that he died
Cause now it's too late for her to make a new life
She gets to mourn for the touch of a punch
Won't ever admit that she ain't clutchin it much
Someday she'll die, it still won't be done
The anger lives on through their son
Cause he saw, he caught it all
A childhood of watching ma and pa get raw
It's too bad for him, nah, that's half the truth
Cause you back with him now and he's smackin you
What happened to you? You don't have a clue
Did your mama used to suffer accidents too?
I never knew that you would stand for abuse
I guess I just assumed that you would pack up and move
Think about when you left him last time
Said out loud that you would never forgive past crimes
Sunglasses, so dark, scarf around the neck to cover the choke marks
And since you gotta justify returnin'
You convinced yourself that he's just a hurt person
You wanna blame that cross he bears
But his pop's not there when he tosses you down stairs

Let me be the last to say
Please don't stay
Let me be the last to say
You won't be okay

Please put your shoes on and step into that warm weather
Go get yourself a more better forever
Gotta put it down, you gotta leave it
And don't ever come back again, you gotta mean it
Just tear it all apart and build new
Cause if you don't kill him, he's gonna kill you
You can't hold hands when they make fists
And I ain't the first to say this

But let me be the last to say
Please don't stay
Let me be the last to say
You won't be okay
Let me be the last to say
Please don't stay",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-the-last-to-say-lyrics
She’s Enough,The Family Sign,2011,"If she want it
I'm gonna give it up
If she running low
I'm gonna fill her cup
If it spill, chill, I'mma clean it up
I'll be right here cause she's enough
If she needed the money
I would stick you up
If she's getting bored
I do some different stuff
Don't need anything just keep it up
I'll be right here cause she's enough

She wanna do the damn thing and I'm on her side
She opened up the wings and she gonna fly
She got no time for the fuss and fight
She does it right, she loves her life
She the one to put the kick in the drums
She the hot stove top when the winter comes
She hits the run, she can lift a ton
She gon stick to the job and get it done
She hop out and push if the motors dead
She gotta keep it moving with no regret
She's up in my head, but never oversteps
She let me know when it's time for us to go to bed
She's my lady case closed
She want a baby so I gave her one of those
Belly getting big, look at the kid grow
She want a song so I wrote one and it goes


She the one that you wanna grow old with
She gotta touch it
She want to hold it
She gets focused
She's got the dopest kiss
She don't need you to tell her already knows it is
She makes me laugh till I'm on that floor
She don't ask why I adore
She like to travel so we explore
Shes seen everything want to see some more
She the opposite of selfish
She love house pets, she wants to help kids
She pulled me out my shell
Fit tight like a belt now the suckers get jealous
Believe it don't get sweeter
She gonna make me sweat like fever
She wanna eat so we went to domingis
She want a ring, got me measuring her fingers


Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you now
Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you
Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you now
Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-shes-enough-lyrics
If You Can Save Me Now,The Family Sign,2011,"If you can save me now
Let's go someplace safe and sound
I'll try not to weigh you down
But I don't know if I can wait around
If you can save me now
Let's go someplace safe and sound...

It happened fast, like a camera flash
The accident then the aftermath
Not even sure what caused the crash
If I had the strength, I would probably laugh
I'm so relaxed. Warm like blood
Layin' on my back in the sun dried mud
There's no point in even trying to get up
I got my eyes glued to the blue sky above
And it's been a beautiful summer
It reminds me of when I was younger
Used to count down to the sound of thunder
I smell fresh cut grass mixed with the burnt rubber
And I don't need to take a glance to know
Cause' I can hear the traffic as it passes slow
They' on the other side of the window
Checkin' out the damage, lookin' at the show
I can hear the sirens get near
Mama used to tell us to plug our ears
It get's so loud and clear
Until every other noise disappears...
And right now I'm tryin' to block it out
By imagining the sounds that come out your mouth
I saw two birds fly south
And I thought about the day we bought that house
Memories seem so real just like everything that I feel
Tried to coast on all five wheels
I wanna cry, I keep the tears concealed
I hear voices; footsteps
A cops radio off to the left
The noise made me reflect
Somewhere along the way I must've caught my breath
Drifting, dreaming and then I heard somebody screaming
But I don't even want to know the reason
So I kept my focus on the view I'm seeing
Started thinkin' about the ones that's gone
Everybody from the past that passed on
You played your cards, had to stand strong
But it ain't that hard to sing a sad song
We all got scars and broken parts
But most of the marks stay close to my heart
Waitin' for the downpour to start
The rain clouds over my head got dark
And then I saw my angel cut through the storm
She was in a firefighter uniform
I close my eyes so I can see some more
And for the first ever I remember bein' born

I say...

I say...
But I don't know if I can wait around, I say...
I'll try not to weigh you down, but I don't know if I can wait around, I say...
If you can save me now",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-if-you-can-save-me-now-lyrics
Millennium Dodo,The Family Sign,2011,"I only act like an asshole
Why don't ya'll stand back
Let the man grow
I can't tell what town this is
But I know that bill was counterfeit
Hey bartender, bump a top jar
Gotta think about where to dump this cop's car
I'm too slick, so fuck your bullshit
I'm coolin in the corner with my custom pool stick
My granddad must've played the jazz
When I bleed you can hear my heartbeat snap
All around the world, it's the same bar
Wishin that the jukebox had some Gangstarr
State to state, I chase fate
But my stereo ate all my favorite tapes
So babydoll, you better straighten up the attitude
Or you ain't gonna make it with me
All the way to Baton Rouge
Call her mama, she make the milk pour
A 94', too high to read the billboard
Got a room at the Best Western
The guy at the front desk looks like Les Nessman
Hush now, not a sound
Shut the door, and lay your towel down
Ya'll run around and figure out what it's all about
While I try to find a cure for this cottonmouth
I keep track of the miles I run
But read the flask, say Southside, son
Took a sip through the hole of my ski mask
Roll till we get to the Burbs for the cheap gas
Speed pass, Millenium Dodo
I got my own lane, I don't wait for the popo
So order up another plate of oysters
You talk so much, you making my voice hurt
Dental floss inside of the glove box
Radio locked on the classic rock
With the mirrorball, Escape From New York style
Double parked outside of the court house
The windchill got a big ol' butt
My breath fog all the windows up
Take a break from the rotten grapevines
Fill the tank and then spank the state lines
Never make this mountain move, naw you're bound to lose
But I knew that I could count on you
Next rounds on you (Is that true?)
Wash my sins off in the rain
Caught this fish now, light that flame
I only claim what's in my veins
That's my crown and that's my name
Gotta wait till they slash the price
Before you catch a life
But we can spend half the night with the dashboard light
(Is that right?)
I'm just sayin' if it's all a game, you can hang your pain
In the hall of fame
Don't make me explain, that's my crown and that's my name
The pick pockets call me Ali Baba
I'm here to sell you some magic water
You might know me as Jacob and Malcom's father
Rest in peace Eyedea and Sally Slaughter

Bad Bad Daddy,The Family Sign,2011,"You can find me over there at the bar
You ain't even gotta ask I don't know where they are

And I'm nasty
And I still ain't callin it quits
But Sean, what the fucks wrong with all of your kids
I'm a bad bad daddy I'm a bad bad daddy

Sittin at the bar just minding my biz
I came down with all nine of my kids
And they all got an attitude
Mad cause I said we can't go to the zoo
It's not a lie but daddys too high If I drive
I will probably catch a DUI
Here, play with this pitcher of beer
Sit in their chairs, and don't disappear
Everybody on your best behavior
Tip the waitress, respect your neighbors
I'll be watchin you know what not to do
Don't make me walk over here just to talk to you
I gave em all some money so they could play pinball
And put grub in they tummies
Now I'mma go get bombed
And you better not tell your mom
And like clockwork, soon as I stepped away
You know they got worse, they didn't hesitate
Of course they start with the horseplay
And then it escalates, then you get a court case
Little Sluggos, thugs and cutthroats, big trouble
Cigarettes, puff those, smash bottles on the floor
And writing graffiti, fighting with the door man
Playin with switchblades and matches
Pick pocketin the cash and the plastic
Gettin high out back by the trashcans
Tryin to get the waitress to give a lapdance

Weaving through the concrete cracks that we cling to

I smelled rain and brought the flash flood
With a river of permanent tear drops and rap hugs
Bad luck played with the effortless
So I backed away from quick benefits
Shed skin of those that spit venomous
Yeah, that's him. He's the one that tips generous
Still tryin' to define my description
A life with a little spare time for livin'
But even if I wanna hold the position
I gotta go like, ""Daddy don't know any different""
I saw the noon sky, look at the snow melt
I left most my baggage up in a hotel
As long as I can hit my notes
I'mma travel down that gravel road
I heard a bird cry; It was pathetic
Man, if you can fly spread feathers like a message
As long as I can hit my notes
I'mma stand on top this box a soap
I felt the track slip but didn't pull brakes

To lend my voice to something so beautiful

Late night, awake with the stars
Stage fright, you came so far
No more wait it's time to depart
See it on my face, feel it in my heart
Suitcase packed, put it in the car
Took one last look at the yard
Snow's gone, it's never growing back
Rolled on with the windows cracked
No sounds just the breath of the draft
Slow down, don't wreck don't crash
On a road vacant, no one to pass
But I'm so anxious, won't relax
Clear the path these tears I have
Are cause I can't wait to hear you laugh

To lend my voice to something so beautiful

We only get to live one time
But twice my life stood in some sunshine
I could lose eyesight, I could end up blind
But I drew my design inside the bloodline
Years go by, memories combined
But yall the only reason I would even rewind
Thank you for the branch you grew on this tree
Your first breath wasn't easy to find
So you signified the mountain you climbed
By letting out a warrior's cry
And it sounded like mine
Now everybody hold up the family sign

Uh huh, I want no place in your experiment
But if I walk away you'll blame it on my arrogance
Let's make this clear, I'm not your therapist
There is no interest in hearing about your carelessness
I'd rather disappear like a spirit
Just lift into the air, carry me away from where this is
I'm not hearing it


Looking around for a cause to get lost to
The drop off's too deep to try to cross through
There's no crown for the fisherman that caught you
So this the sound of me whistling the wrong tune
It's gotta be obvious I'm not who you should talk to

We made some messes too
Trying to do our best to push all of the blessings through

Tryin to claim innocent while I assemble my appeal

Rejoice, make noise like you had the choice
It goes.. over flow how much more can you hold
And still put faith first at the fork in the road
Search for the universal remote control
While the words spill out of the hole in your soul
Now close your eyes and crack a smile if you know me
While I spit into the sky cause I miss the little homie
Guess that it means if my people hurt
Somebody, please disturb my peaceful smirk
Take everything that I bring with me
Make who I be now
Hear my family now",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-my-key-lyrics
Who I’ll Never Be,The Family Sign,2011,"She locked herself in that room with a, full view of a, full moon
And this where she come to fly, when she wanna disappear from what's outside
I try not to make it obvious, she doesn't know there's an audience
These walls are ribbon thin so it ain't my fault that I'm listenin'
And I can make out every word cause she, sing loud like a, trapped bird
She looks out at the stars when she, write songs on that guitar

And every song you write without me, just another sad song to me
And every song you write without me, sound like who I'll never be

She picked up her instrument and I, don't know where I went I just
Close my eyes and flow like I'm in there with her tryna hold all the note she hits
Motionless, my secret solo show she gives. Sometimes she'll search for a line and I
Wish I could give her one of mine, but it would all unravel if she, found out I was in the shadow so I
Suppress what I, obssess, but your biggest fan wanna sing a duet


Familiar with the voice of the lonely, lost in the noise of the wind blowing
Go ahead girl tell your story but, the siren don't wail for holy
Play your heart by strings with the parts you sing, can't wait to hear what tomorrow brings
And if you ever get to smile I'll be, right here tryna reconcile my, desire to admire your sadness
You gon rise from the fire in ashes. And if it's all the same to you, you ought ta let me be the one that helped change your tune",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-who-ill-never-be-lyrics
I Don’t Need Brighter Days,The Family Sign,2011,"I don't need brighter days
I just need some faith
You got me walkin' away now
You got me walkin' away
You got me walkin' away now
You got me walkin' away
It was the year of the witch
Nobody steered clear of the ditch
They say brave when you don't flinch
But we never saw the blade, never had the chance to cringe
Don't ever forget to put misery on the guest list
Sippin' on a memory for breakfast
Middle of the party, all alone
You wanna dig up bones but your claws ain't grown
Put your half empty glass on a coaster, step backwards slow
Got a sky full of bats circlin' over the crowd
Your eyes go black when you open your mouth
I'm like, walkin on a frozen rain, wanna claim a block that's got no complaints
But I'm dyin in a city called look at me now
Little piggy wanna cook up the cow
I'm like, might as well knock down them walls
When the earthquakes follow you for all of your faults
Let the facade fall dead in the fog
While the voices that are inside of your head applaud
I'm like, everyone got a course to fly
Run towards a rise and aim for the sky
So high, sleepin' under the stars
You outgrew the sum of your parts
I used to run wild like a child of thieves
Now I, breathe quiet in a pile of leaves
With a space heater on the back of my porch
For when I take a break from attacking your fort
You said you want it
But you can't see the center of the web because you standing on it
Don't wait to escape from the ways you escape
Just throw your hands up and say
You got me walkin' away now
You got me walkin' away
You got me walkin' away now
You got me walkin' away
I don't need brighter days
I just need some faith",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-i-dont-need-brighter-days-lyrics
Millennium Dodo 2,The Family Sign,2011,"Never run of the mill when I shoot the pill
I'm a son of a spill, I've got boots to fill
Showed up with a deuce-deuce of swill
And a guardian angel on my Coupe de Ville
Shark in the lake, heart strike the drum
Mark landscape with a dart-like tongue
Spit my blood from deep in the gut
Smoking cigarette butts with my finger-less gloves
Pull over at the welcome sign and raise a toast to those that fell behind
Everybody else got a crippled spine
From tryna' take it back to a simple time
Keep a little pine tree, hang from my rear-view
Beats turned up just enough not to hear you
Gonna swim till the fins get torn
I shall return, keep the engine warm

Millennium Dodo
Pull out your telephone and take you a photo
You didn't know? Better read the logo
You don't wanna play around and get ocho
Recline like I don't care
The world is mine and I ain't gon' share
Now everybody blow smoke in the air
I keep my eyes on the road, but I know that you stare

Now I was at the party sleeping on the couch
When I decided to grab a bottle of something and bounce
I'd rather be by myself
Than have to navigate another fake cry for help
On the beaten path with a bandaged fist
To represent the last half of the damn I give
Play me in slow-mo', fly like a blimp
Millennium Dodo, drive with a limp
Windows down, heater blasting
Got my coffee but I need some aspirin
Watch me merge into speeding traffic
With the truck-stop plastic, cheap sunglasses
Show respect
You broke down on the side of the road, wanna choke my neck
I've got a glove-box full of stolen checks
And I drink moonshine that the chrome reflects


Flannel, look like a farmer
Underneath camo, look like a hunter
With that ski mask, look like a robber
Sleeping in the barn with the doctor's daughter
Got stories to wax, pour me a glass
I run with the ghosts of warriors past
South side, call it pop life
Y'all catch frostbite waiting at a stoplight
All over the map we get festive
It's a matter of class
You can tell by my lack of attractive skeptics
You just mad at my mustache
Hey girl, we'll always have Memphis
But right now, I want breakfast
With the pedal to the metal 'til we hit West Texas
Then cross to Mexico to see my dentist",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-millennium-dodo-2-lyrics
Cut You Down,The Family Sign,2011,"My old lady say I'm paranoid
She thinks that I'm not on point
'cuz I pace around with no purpose
Observant, peek out the curtains
I don't recognize that car
So why's it parked right infront of my yard?
It's been there for the last few minutes
It seems too suspicious
It's gon' be another long night
So set the alarm and the motion lights
Protect my house....
That fence ain't enough to keep the riff-raff out
Somebody gon' test,
....I'm breaking out in a sweat
It make the hair on my arms stand up tall
If it's a private number I don't answer the call
I'm simple, I want some peace
From all the criminals, thugs and thieves
But I ain't tryin to involve police
'cuz I don't trust any government employees
I believe everybody's a threat
You better take it down to the next doorstep
But if you want doubt and pop some
I'm sleeping on the couch with a loaded shotgun

And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck around

(Shh) I hear a helicopter
I swear it's out there
Calm down, don't make the wrong move
'cuz I don't know who that van belongs to
I'm checking over both my shoulders
I bet they got my name in they folders
I'm trying to stay inside
It's the only way to hide from satellites in the sky
Get off my property
Why you stalking me?
Those guys from across the street
Better keep their eyes off my wife piece
None of y'all watching birds
So who's in the alley with binoculars?
Got more detour to steer through
For the sedan in my rearview
I crouch on the floor
'cuz knocking on my door is an act of war
And if the guy from the bank
Wanna come see me, he better drive a tank
I ain't nuts yet, I'm just upset
'cuz y'all treat me like a suspect
I'm innocent, give me personal space
Before I flip the switch and turn up the bass

And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck around",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-cut-you-down-lyrics
You Make Me Wanna,The Fun EP (Sad Clown Bad Dub Eight),2011,"*Coughs* Rock the house
""
You make me wanna die
""
He said it like he meant it
Story over no more
Hopin to prevent it but
""You make me wanna live""
She said that with a straight face
And she placed keep sakes
Inside her suitcase
""Everything you say is a lie""
He said that with a smirk
Fully aware that it'll hurt
When it hits the nerve
""You've never heard a word I've said""
She responded
But he heard that
And remembered it forever like a promise
Now here we are, wearing hatred on our masks
Let's carry on, put all your eggs inside that basket
Swing it round, until that wooden handle snaps
Sort 'em all out and only keep the ones that cracked
""You make me wanna die""
That's why I trust you
That's so I can look you in the eye and say I love you

(Background voice chanting)
Set us free

I want to live
I want to die
I've never seen a sun decide to set so abrupt
As it does when the gun inside of you wakes up
Almost as if it's trying to hide from your tantrums
Head full of hurt, pride,
 
a closet full of phantoms
Never seen the sun shine quite so loud
As it does when that little girl makes herself proud
Almost as if it wants to come play a part
In those moments when your heart ain't afraid of the dark
But sometimes I swear you make the sun confused
It wants to rise but it over-analyzes what to do
It cries more than you, when the storms come knockin
Tries to hide it's face, just avoid watchin
I would drive by and wave, but there ain't no parade
So I'mma stay and wait for the day the sun goes away

(Background voice chanting)
Set us free

I want to live
I want to die
What is it about women that brings out my venom
Thought it was a peach, it tasted like a lemon
I ate it anyway, can't help it's my natural
From one extreme to another, no room for practica
l
Just act casual maybe they won't notice
Or fall off the planet so you can escape the focus
Break the dirt; bury me down when I'm broken
Or let the under-current carry me out to the ocean
Can't swim as good as I could as a child
But as a kid, I never swam just stood there and smiled
Even though the idea of drownin in you
Seems kinda like it might be the wrong thing to do
You gotta take a look at you and I, the clown and the fool
Love can make suicide sound so cool

(Background voice chanting)
Set us free

I want to live
I want to die
(backgroubd voice chanting)
Dying must be, dying must be, dying must be heaven
Cus living is hell
Let's watch the sun disappear into the water
Let's watch these people, and point at the imposters
Let's lay it on the line, let's travel across it
Let's live forever no matter what it costs us
Claustrophobic, lots of down talk
Toss clothes in and turn it off
Easily lost in moments
Forgot the motives, sun almost exploded
Lookin for proof, who would've knew, toy gun was loaded
Go ahead and throw it out into the waves
Say goodbye to yesterday and try to fly the stress away
Took it from the sky and looked it square in the eye
Silence, trying to read between the snore and the sigh
There's a reason that they say that they can't take it with 'em
If you're leavin cuz of love, it really isn't livin
I want to live I want to
Die motherfucker die",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-you-make-me-wanna-lyrics
They Call It,The Fun EP (Sad Clown Bad Dub Eight),2011,"Don't you love it madly when it sleeps in your basement
On some gladly-pay-you-Tuesday-for-a-hamburger-today shit?
And don't you love the way you can relate
To everything your favourite rapper has to say about your hatred?
Get a hobby, now why they wanna watch me
In some hotel lobby getting sloppy with this pillow built mommy?
Probably never be global like 2Pac
But the local boys will beat my shit hard in their jukebox
Sitting here pretending I'm not tipsy
Watching over sensitive hippies use my records for they dog Frisbees
Be a good little fishy
And book me a ticket to your city so your girlfriend will kiss me
I'm the bee that came to pollinate the flower
Make a meal, borrow a towel and take a shower
It's called love, in return they make bread
Pay dollars, make beds, catch buzz, give head

They call it love and I get plenty of it
The rich kids burn it, my broke people dub it
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
The snakes always wanna put your name where their tongue splits
They call it love and I get plenty of it
Give hugs to the public, put plugs in the budget
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
But they know who to call when they want the party jumping

We bust into your system, search through the evidence
Opening hoping to find why you love your residence
Puts your fists up or put your chips up
Advocate, act adult or get your fabric ripped up
They said like what? Like they didn't know me
Six foot three, ugly mug and a simple flow
Like that? Like that! And a bottle of Jimmy Beam
Peace, my name is Slug and I'm down with the winning team
They wanna kill my steam, I didn't care
Just lead me to the Phoebe with the pretty hair
Jumping up and down with the passion of a battle
Jester of the kingdom, see me mack 'em at the castle
Sean is such an asshole! Nah I'm a dickhead
Stealing cigarettes from the rest of the mislead
Enjoy me, avoid me, do what you must do
But man up and understand why they don't love you


Looking through your pinhole, who you gonna insult?
Atmosphere get up in here, yeah, where'd your grin go?
Got a sock full of nickels and quarters
For unsupportive cock smokers that wanna ripple these waters
You hate to love it, keep changing up the subject
Still ain't saying nothing, we knew that you would jump ship
Get back inside your magic pumpkin you puppet
Cause all you got left in your life is a big 'What if?'
No names, this pertains to a flock of you
The fuck you gonna do when no one's watching you?
Sweep up the fuck-ups, tighten up the lug nuts
Let your world turn with no concern for what Slug does
I'm not number one, I'm just my mother's son
No regrets, show respect, what's done is done
I understand why you're so discouraged
Now show your love like it was when you was this moment

""We may not do this recording again, and maybe not give it to fellas again
So we hope you enjoyed listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, cause we had a ball""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-they-call-it-lyrics
Spaghetti Strapped,The Fun EP (Sad Clown Bad Dub Eight),2011,"Hey Girl
What you lookin' like?
I have seen you get up, and go to that bathroom
Like five or six times in the last twenty minutes
What the hell's going on?

Under the great wide gray sky
Still the same guy watching the paint dry
With bloodshot snake eyes
My lady still hates me like you know she should
Because the simple things in life don't get overlooked
But now I'm here with a glass full of beer
Positioned in my chair to watch your ass from a mirror
Hungover and horny, dirty old man
Weed junky drunk leaving tips for the dope man
I'll impress her with my jukebox selections
Spit a couple words in exchange for affection
And if those legs work as good as they look girl
You can walk up and down the page in my book
Can you spell secret?
Come get your feet wet
Let me make up pet names for all your little regrets
(Here let me buy you a drink as a token of my erection)
Hoping that you'll open up and put down your weapons

Up, up, girl let your strap down, put your strap down
Up, up, girl put your strap down

Spaghetti strapped, another lap around the track
I had to suffer punching onto somebody's back
What's up with that?
Where's the independence?
Find the dotted line between acquainted with and friendship
But damn got head rushed, can't stop
What's the big fuss it was just a little hand job
So what if her friend took off her bra and socks and drawers
It was like a massage-a-trois
Why the witnesses always positioned up in your business
Like they're invested in your best interests
Who I be with, and who I leave with
Affects this vicarious life that the weak live
Guess now the pressure's on me to charm you
Relieve you of your weapon, disarm you
See if I can get you off this barstool
We all wanna know if I can get you out your clothes girl


From the star-fuckers to the hard lovers
Passing judgment on none
Everyone's got scars mother
Some of them will never heal
Sometimes you gotta step aside; you wanna see how the weather feels
You can't avoid them or fill a void with 'em
If you're nuts you'll enjoy trying to make him your boyfriend
I'm like a pile of paper and ribbons the day after Christmas
(Naw, naw for real I will take my clothes off right here girl)
Who wants to help me, I'm looking for a muse
This time around I'm trying to cook up the blues
Let's make a little love, a little hate
A little give and take and give it to the kids that can relate
And we don't even have a choice
It's the balance, the bits between your ears and my voice
So praise God that the rain ain't stopped
Let's head to my spot and take that wet tank-top off now",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-spaghetti-strapped-lyrics
Horny Ponycorn Horns,The Fun EP (Sad Clown Bad Dub Eight),2011,"I seen it all from the best to the worst, a pulse and nurse
You're just a tall Smurf (Ha!)
Picture on the wall and they calling me the perp (Who?)
Cause Sean was never the one to swallow his verse
Fools want to step, man, put your health first
Only thing you gonna wreck is your self-worth
You might as well of pulled up the self-serve
That ain't beef, that's just hamburger helper
Tell her, that the circus is coming better purchase your tickets cause
I heard a little something and whoa, child!
It's SO WILD they got OLD STYLES and GOLD SMILES
And we happy as fuck, not Daddy Warbucks, just Daffy Ducking it
Ant's caddy like WHAT
Sleep through sleep knocking ?demon? and some BMW backseats
Sleeping through my dreams of fucking you
So here goes everything at once
Turn thirty-something still haven't learned how to roll a blunt
But I show how you to smoke out of a soda can
I'll hold it over your head 'till you overstand.. up!
Pull your pants up, you don't love me, you only let me fuck cause your man sucks
Beers gettin' warm, but I'm here to perform
To anyone who's horny we're going to give them the horns, go...

They call me Slug, I resemble my brother
The lumberjack in the back eating pancakes with peanut butter
Can't wait until we be discovered (Uh-huh!)
I want a fanbase full of jealous husbands and ex-lovers
They make war, make up, make love, listening to my neurosis and Anthony's drum kit
Having fun like it's a passing trend
Take a Hilton to the Radisson and suck on my sacrament
Start the engine move the piston
I'm just a magician dressed as a musician
Tried to free the world and feed your girl
And eat this gyro and please don't hurl
These Raggedy Andy rappers caught that fancy fever, now they're softer
And sweeter than cotton candy
Rocking candies beneath that sweatsuit
Stop the fantasy, here comes the guest, who?
Yup, that's right, came and check that mic
Let the rest go fight, cause your dress is so tight
If it's fresh they bite, but if it's dope they swallow
And I'll be DAMNED if I don't give you a mouthful
She thinks I'm fly I think she's warm (Uh-huh)
And you know the norm any port in the storm
So I told her I was from that band called Korn
Took her to the roof and put her hand on my horn like...

Mr. Dibbs, he plays his horn (Alright)
Brother Ali, he plays his horn
I Self Divine (Yeah), he plays a horn
Dillinger Four, they play that horn (Uh-huh)
Murs and Blueprint, they play their horn (Yeah)
Crescent Moon, he plays his horn (Right)
""Lift Her Pull Her"", they played the horn
Eyedea and Abilities, they play their horn (What?)
Los Nativos, they play the horn (Uh-huh)
Luckyiam, he plays his horn (Alright)
P.O.S., he plays his horn (Yeah!)
Gladys Knight & the Pips, they play the horn (Yeah!)
MF Doom, he plays his horn (Alright)
Psalm One, she plays the horn (Alright!)
To my man Musab, he plays the horn (Alright!)
Rhyyyyyyyyymesaaaaayers!!! (Come on, come on, everybody sing along!)
...One, two, three, we outta here! Peanuts for sale! Come get your peanuts!

Secret,The Fun EP (Sad Clown Bad Dub Eight),2011,"If fact I remember you
You rap too? Oh that's right
Yeah you used to come to my shows
Whenever I was in your city
I guess I should apologize for giving you the credit
Of being more intelligent than you looked
I guess it's a good thing that God loves ugly
Yo, remember when you asked me for some advice?

Come one, it's easy, all you gotta do
Is nod to the beat, talk about what's wrong with you
I did it, a couple others did too
And you can follow in these footprints if shoes fit you
From all regions now, they're trying to steal the style
Look they bit me, and I'm tryin to hide my smile
Cause I tell you, ain't much as flattering
As a grasshopper tryin to smash a teacher with a battle ram
I ain't made, always been a fan of flashbacks
Go ahead, wear your heart on your backpack
But don't forget my name when you start to talk shit
Up in the atmosphere with God in the cockpit
Self-deprecate my way to a better fate
Meditate through the hate, let 'em speculate
Elevate the heat, burn 'em up like hot cakes
Cops came late, tried to fix it all with scotch tape
Pain, the brand new escape, from the brain
And strange days that came with the mistakes
Mis-tastes a little bit to dangerous
I see where they hittin makes me wonder what they aimin with
That's gotta hurt man, put it in the chorus
See if I can get your girlfriend to sing it for us
She like it, it helps her understand you
And you like it, it helps you understand too
And I should walk away, it's getting hard to keep control
When I'm checking all these stalkers, and my records aren't even gold
Breathe in slow, conserve the temper
Show these mother fuckers what this microphone is meant for
Try not to curse, it hurts the verse
It proves that you have a strong lack of better words
But sometimes nothing can replace a cut
Just turn up the bass and come face the front
They ain't trying to listen if you've got a lot to say
And some nothing, still catch a lot of pay
Man, I wanna play, but I'm not gonna walk my way
Back to Coney Island just to catch a couple props today
I nominate myself as the governor
Faced in front of the judge, like I wasn't fuckin her
Yes ma'am, no ma'am, get with the program
Already had you bent over the desk singin slow jams
Peace to the Molemen, Murs, Sage Francis
Anyone else done the work, can take chances
First and the last months rent takes precedent
Other than that, god bless the Fifth Element
Don't give a fuck what ya'll think of Slug
Take your fangs out if you ain't drinkin blood
And blame it on that life you don't live
But shit talking says more about you than we kid

And now we gotta a little secret (don't we) *repeated in background as well
And every time I see you man, I'm gonna remember
You are not who you wish you were
You are not what you wish you were right?
Do me a favor man, you hate me?
Just walk past me man, don't even acknowledge me
Just pretend I don't exist man, don't even look at me man
Ba-bam ba-bam-BAM (repeated)
(altered lyrics from song ""BAM"")
We land on your plate like a housefly
Just another face from the southside
The fall guy, all eyes on the tall small fry
While I try not to make your doll cry
What you call ""fly""? What you call ""fresh""

The Way You Do Me,Demosexual,2013,"Hey girl, you sounding real good tonight
I sang along with every song
And that one song - you know which one ? -
When you did that one you got me
You know what ?
I think you wrote that song about me
Nah I'm cool, but thank you
I think I better go
I just wanted to say, yeah, good show

The way you do me
I can tell that you mean well
The way you do me
But I don't need help
The way you do me 
You're so agreeable

My guts say to make an escape
Don't wait til it breaks
Get the prey that you chase and hit the side door
If you gonna stay to the wake
Don't play it so safe
You'll never raise up the stakes or hit the high score
My brain say to measure the steps
It's no different than chess
Progress and protect, get the queen
Now I gotta
Push the set for the check
Connect the pressure direct until it bleed out
My heart said to ask my veins
If they have the strain
To handle the rain and still sustain
I'm tryna catch the train until my glass is drained
I'm just another passenger, I can't complain
Because..

The way you do me
I can tell that you mean well

There ain't no other slugs
Unless I'm standin' in front of a judge
You know I'm only buzzing like a bug
You shittin' blood because you do too many drugs
That was a joke, love
Don't be so touched
I'm just an old fuck
That drives an old truck
I wanna live forever but hold up
I quit the cigarettes and now I'm addicted to donuts
And y'all all know me by the trail of flaws
Kickstarter page to raise what the bail'll cost
What you saw I been runnin' from the law
Ever since mama and papa got raw
She call me baby but I'm not the new year
From Minnesota but I don't shoot deer
I just, let it go in the back corner
You never know I put the mack on ya

It's bullshit
Feeling like summer could last forever
But it's safe as my dreamin' of a mission statement
Feelin' so overrated
Feelin' moderately positively jolly wolly wild n' out
And I'm smilin' out
Tears of a clown like Smokey Robinson
I'm modelin' be a teenage fuckin' idol
Who's spiteful
Aim my rifle at disciples
Who carry rotten apples
Takin' caps will make your mind thrill
And take time to fill
Whatever is missin' I hear a present
Everybody got a question but nobody got suggestions
Feel like all I do is fuck up
Whatever was beautiful confused
While I'm starin' at my shoes
And I walked off the set
And jet, pay my respects
And get my check
And be like 'I could get used to it'
Break away from what you're bound to
Take a moment
Appreciate all the heaven that is around you, Lord

And if you say I rock a pessimist dress code
Then heaven knows you must've never stepped through my hellhole
Cause if you
Had you woulda knew that I'm a nudist
Not tryna be a dick
I'm just at my best when I do this
New to the brutals who do that good and evil speak
Used to be convicted but these days I do it leisurely
Freeze a fig leaf in the storm
Blowing clear to the prior icon
It's time to be normal
Mortal in the deathrows
Lovin' every millisecond
Pedal when I let go
Nothin' else is sillhouetted
Except for my index in the glowing ranks of the internet
??? yes no yes no yes yes until my neck is broke
Good thing that I'm paid to be a spectacle, sort of
Head is full of cinder blocks and mortar
Lot of talk on the page, these days
I'm talkin' sex, pot, centerfolds, and crocodile poulet

Used to try to balance on the snowboard
Slide down the hill until I slammed into the floorboards
Gorgeous ain't the origins, look
Way before my big brother set the touring dates
I had the orange snow suit
It was hard for me to urinate
Back then I wasn't even thinkin' that I might perform
Me and the ??? almost drowned upon and icy pond
Small town kid with big ideas
Became a big city man who made his dreams his career
Now its me and Garrison Keiller on the four wheeler
Sippin' tequila, catching a misdemeanor from Ms. Demeanor
You know I gotta get my business straight
And you should never count me out
I'm not a poker game at Mystic Lake
I caught the north side five up to Brookdale
Hit the timer on the fries, couldn't cook well
All I ever wanted to do
Was what I'm doing for a living
Like being Toki Wright, its kinda cool

It's so hot it's cold
It's outta control
So put your hands up like you're part of the show
Sing along with the song like you already know
We on your front lawn puttin' color in the snow

It's so hot it's cold
It's outta control
So put your hands up like you're part of the show
Sing along with the song like you already know
We on your front lawn puttin' color in the snow

It's so hot it's cold
It's outta control
So put your hands up like you're part of the show
Sing along with the song like you already know
We on your front lawn puttin' color in the snow",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-color-in-the-snow-lyrics
It Ain’t The Prettiest,UnKnown,2013,"It ain’t the prettiest state of mind I’m in
I stay busy, I don’t wait in line to live
And I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about
But if I’m not in the ground, then I'll be rockin’ the crowd
It ain’t the prettiest state of mind i’m in
I stay busy, I don’t wait in line to live
And we don’t allow standin’ around
Put your life in your hands, put your hands in the clouds

Now – I spy that you’re tryin’ to get by
But that’s the wrong kind of fly, you the wrong kind of high
That’s the wrong kind of right, probably out of left
Followin’ your breath – solemn in your step
I stand tall like a midwest obelisk
Welcome to the future, pre-apocalypse
Where a ratchet ain’t nothin’ but a socket wrench
And it takes all we got to stay positive
I don’t always make the best choices
But life’s too short to stay disappointed
I make music my granddad would probably call noise
I made two baby boys and I gave ‘em a voice
Now, 
I don’t pop recreational shots
, but
You tryna clock like the face of a watch
Stop – already got my name on a rock
I created some jobs, still afraid of the cops

Mind state ain’t the prettiest, mine is straight hideous
When I make a statement it’s the kind you take serious
Describe the life and times of a divine white lyricist
Writin’ the type of rhymes that are provided by experience
Represent for the bottom-dwellers
Made my escape through the trap door though i’m not a seller
Gears in my noggin stay winding like I got propellers
Given a shot and I can rock more spots than a leopard
Since 2000 i’ve dealt with a lot of death
Cuffed so many times that I can’t count the arrests
Lifelong beef that hasn’t allowed me to rest
Gang of sacrifice while paying my pound of flesh
What war to reap by those that carry the load?
Keep your guard up and know how to parry the blows
Yo, I got no complaints, man, i’m sharin’ the road
With three of the illest
Emcees from my
 area code
It goes…


This world mirrors hell, givin’ more than subtle hints
That’s why I said if you ask for the real, you might not like what you get
Pretty is not for me, my ugly met with fame
Godly and dodger-proof, i’m the truth, respect the name
Mind you, i’m stompin’ you hard, rockin’ you, never sayin’
In hot pursuit, posse a lot of fools, weapons and
Pull up in your buzzards, solomon waters or somethin’
Destruction comin’, rough and rugged, not lovin’, it’s nothin’
Shake the spot, 
I wait and watch for gas rates to drop
While you debate if Kim Kardashian’s booty is fake or not
And claim who’s illuminati, and that Kanye dude seen Jay nude
While I’m hopin’ some maniac doesn’t shoot up my daughter’s grade school
But I play cool…
Early to spot disaster
Challenging the notion that most rappers are not good actors
Conspiracy theory leery, but you won’t see the sweat
And don’t call me crazy ‘cause I drink freon soda and walk my chia pet

Yep, yep, we’re so polite – Minnesota nights
Warm smile but the overbite cold as ice
Black bodies dangle off the light pole at night
Listen close, you might overhear the poltergeist
Builders of the Occupy Home prototype
You got a goal in sight you either gotta fold or fight
Seedy pages cover what the poets write
But call a dead black baby the n-word overnight
Progressive black congressman
But we also got Michelle Bachmann
Why you think i’m in a cell, my man?
Wrists scarred from the zip-tie that held my hands
I don’t sell out, and
I’m from the late great Paul Wellstone’s land
Where the aim first made their stand, and
I can never be made at the lakes
,
But Minnesota’s got a lot of bad habits to break
You betcha…",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-it-aint-the-prettiest-lyrics

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

She said she want somebody she could take care of
And right then is when we paired up
Pull a chair up and make a space for yourself
You should taste what I felt
It's probable that those on the bottom gonna hold you accountable
It's lonely at the top and it's also hostile
Everyone got their own course full of obstacles
Don't let your heart grow cold like a popsicle
She said she want someone to treat her as an equal
And right then we started speeding towards Reno
Burning rubber in a burgundy Regal
Fly like the dove then dive like an eagle
I'm a 70 deuce, that year was a classic
Buzz got loose and we're here trying to catch it
She said that she was unimpressed
That's when I stood up and did the Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

She said she needed a place to feel free
And right then we started building a team
Trying to make a better perfect, a little purpose
The only thing for certain is the sleep disturbance
But ever since people started measuring time
We've been looking for an easy way to settle our mind
Take a load off or take your clothes off
Or shut your eyes and roll straight for the roadblock
She said she needed something that she could blame
And right then is when I offered my name
It's the only thing I've got that'll always remain
So I'mma share it with you, so you can complain too
She said she want to find a cure for death
I know she meant that in the purest sense
But when I finally die, put on your Sunday best
Then throw your hands in the sky like Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

You need to prove nothing to me
The time got a price, but the trouble is free
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably
And live life like I love to breathe
You need to prove nothing to me
The time got a price, but the trouble is free
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably
And live life like I love to breathe

Oh yeah, oh yeah",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-kanye-west-lyrics
Camera Thief,Southsiders,2014,"[
Verse 1
]
Camera thief
Take pictures
Run like the parallel stitches
Attach my feet to the path I beat
Teach myself to keep the answers brief
Gnash my teeth like the last to feast
Imagine me on that abandoned beach
Sand and sea as if the jazz was free
I’m Ice cream mixed with gasoline
Direct attention to the craftsmanship
Neglect to mention that the past will stick
Like initials carved in the concrete
Like the tattoo that hides on your mommy
I still kick it with angels
The difference is instead of the bar, I’m at my kitchen table
The starlight shines through the glass
But you feel safe underneath that mask

Ferris Wheel, give rides
The scars healed in time to get high
Lock the doors and hide the keys
Let's go describe how to climb a tree
Don’t sign the lease just cop a corner
For you to curl up and try to sleep
Those cheap police won't find my wings
I keep my dreams inside my dreams
And If I had a time machine
I’d probably use it like a vacuum and try to clean
It kind a seems, quite more than a handful of these regrets have been circumstantial
Now give me all the cash out the drawer
Touch that mustache down on the floor
And I’ll be in court holding a pitchfork
'Fore I let the contest outlast the sport

Pocket watch, impatient
Find a mate then make the migration
Break the rules, but first break the rulers
And keep it moving like a rumor
I don’t need to defend my defensiveness
I keep to myself, my family, and friendships
I’ve got enough people I could disappoint
If you disagree I think you missed the point
Now go ahead and grab a chair
Let me tell you about the last few years
Pulled out a sack full of Samson’s hair
And put it on the dash like a dancin’ bear
I wrote you a horoscope
It won't fit on this post-it note
But if I had to sum it up into a shorter quote
It goes fuck it, you might as well row that boat",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-camera-thief-lyrics
Flicker,Southsiders,2014,"One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark

Yeah I been drinkin’, You already know
Do I smell like escape? Probably so
I found your tape in my old collection
Put it in pushed play then I poured a fresh one
I look back with a hesitant laugh
But in reality it’s dark down memory ave
All the trials and suffering we shared with each other
A lot of people thought that we were actually brothers
You know me, you know I’m a control freak
Who told you, you could die before me?
Gone, another dog lost to the wild
I feel like a snot-nosed child
And when I hear your Smile
Its outlined in sadness
You poked holes in the magic
You taught jokes to the clowns
That never learned how
To appreciate the lights
Before the bulbs burned out
Flicker

One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark

Yeah, I been thinking, You already know
Do I sound frustrated? Probably so
Sometimes I feel guilty, I was out on the road
If I’da seen where it was going I’da stopped the whole show
I realize it ain’t realistic
I keep tryna make the pieces fit with
The info presented
I felt resentment
I held this against myself
I wanna help my friend
It stays in my head
That I was on a stage when you were laying in bed
Body was discovered by your own mother
It penetrates my chest, I still taste the regret
That I slept through a late night call from your homie
But then I spoke with Siddiq the next morning
And then I smoked one million cigarettes
Go figure, maybe I was tryna catch up with ya
Flicker

Can erase the dark
One little flicker of light

Yeah I been sinkin’, you already know
Do I look exhausted? Probably so
I don’t get much sleep
I’m not sick, I’m fine
I’m just tryna make the most of this limited time
And I’m missing you but I ain’t gonna lie
The distance grew between Eye and I
And at the end, even though we didn’t speak enough
You were easily one of the best people I’ve loved
Now I’m tryna write a song for a dead songwriter
That wrote they own songs about life and death
And every breath is full of self-awareness
Don’t ever be afraid to be embarrassed
So I wrote these words to describe what I cry about
But I’m certain if you were here right now
You’d ridicule these lyrics, you’d hate this chorus
You’d probably tell me that the concept is too straight forward

Arthur’s Song,Southsiders,2014,"38th street station

Sippin’ on that brown stuff
Got you feeling like you found love
Or maybe it was just luck
But honestly it’s probably none of the above
Train tracks underneath the faceless moon
The paybacks gonna want a statement soon
Been a few years since the last cigarette
But if you put your finger inside the flask, still wet
Stick with the fool like shit to the wool
Gotta get some tools to try to fix these jewels
Cause we don’t need to hear you sing
Of how you spent your time as king
Being mad at everything, huh
And even when we haven’t seen the sun for days
I keep squint like it’s shining right up in my face
Everyones a critic of the minutes I waste
Got me waiting in a line, got me running in place
I don’t really know what to tell ya
Say I spent too much time in the cellar
I’ve experienced a life full of accidents
Tryna write it all down before it vanishes
Wanna remember every adventure
But a percentage of ‘em only exist in the abyss
Spinnin' around like the popular record
My head feels lighter than the fuzz on a feather
I try to put the shapes in order
But in case I get cornered
I'mma sharpen up the darts
I truly hold sorrow in my heart
For every heart that never got carved into the bark
I wish that everyone could leave a mark
But every part wasn’t meant to be a piece of art
You either carpe diem or fade away into the dark
While everybody else watches waiting for the stop to start
With all due respect to my liver
We tryna get as high as the little dipper
Got love for my people that survive the blizzard
But it’s a flood of liquor
 on 
my side of the river
We face pain with pain
Everybody's the same
Waiting caught in the rain
I guess that’s why I write about it
It help me wrap my head around it
No matter what the worlds tryna take from you
No matter what the world’s tryna make you prove
No matter what the world’s tryna say to you
You gotta write your way through
You gotta write your way through
You gotta write your way through
You gotta write your way through",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-arthurs-song-lyrics
Bitter,Southsiders,2014,"Everything used to be so good then
Now it seems like you're mad at my footprints
I'm only trying to scribble in the book, man
It's not my fault that y'all couldn't
You must have a lot of free time
Otherwise why are you trying to see mine
Strain your neck, let the blame project
But don't give yourself the same respect
So independent but undependable
We're all getting old, now take a mental note
And stop being so covetous
The crime is the punishment
Now run and get a sliver of dignity
You ain't gotta be a figure of misery
You don't want to be a victim to victory
Listening to a bitter sweet symphony

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

We used to get up in Uptown
Then we hit the highway to run around
Came home everybody wanna judge now
Don't let them see you celebrate your touchdown
Keep clutching those grudges
Don't budge if no budget
The old puppets show love in public
But behind the back can't trust it
Disgusted, repugnant
Insulted, repulsive
Discouraged, rejection
No protection from your own reflection
Chip on your shoulder big as a boulder
Insecurities a slippery slope
Got ya looking around for the sympathy vote
Anything to give a little glimmer of hope


Treat love like a limited resource
Fight for it like there's never gonna be more
On the rooftop talk to the spaceships
Like you've got 2Pac locked in the basement
Get the bag, make the get away exit
You get mad like your middle name desperate
No net, better not get left back
Yeah, you should probably protect that
I'm trying to keep it simple, teeth to the nipple
Beat my chisel, leave my initials
Fly so far when you follow the signals
Sky full of stars and all of them wishful
Not only are we bitter but we're brittle
The world's getting small, and everybody's little
Go roll your eyeballs, toot your own whistle
Don't ever stop waiting for the window",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-bitter-lyrics
Fortunate,Southsiders,2014,"I highly doubt that y'all think about sex
Anywhere near as often as I think about death
Go ahead and shout at the top of your lungs
But don't wake the baby up, we got a lot to get done
That little light indicates a connection
And if it's all the same I'd like to make a suggestion
See, if everybody on this comet agreed
We could set the clock to whenever we want it to be
I just might just modify the mileage
I don't know much, but I'm confident the fight's fixed
So high that I feel like a pilot
Falling out the sky full of brilliant brightness
Hurry up, stir me up
You gotta learn the words before the whole Earth burning, but
We wouldn't even need to recognize your birthday
If you were the center of the universe in the first place
If I had feathers I would fly away
If I felt fresher in fur I would hibernate
If I ever figured out how to communicate
Maybe then we could accumulate
For now face the wall, I ain't the same as y'all
A real friend wouldn't make you take the fall
Sometimes life'll try to break your balls
With the long list of missed wakeup calls

You know I wanna feel special
Walk around the festival carrying a big stuffed animal
I try not to make a mess though
Gotta stay sensible, ain't nobody coming with the antidote
I wanna watch you grow
And I wanna leave the planet better off than it was handed to me
And I don't know, there's possibility
So I settle for selling my soul to the slaves of the land of the free
I don't wanna leave my family tree behind
I don't want no one to miss me like I miss you
But I don't wanna take up too much time
I'm not trying to run away from the line we drew
The sunshine seems to feel so seamless
The soldier is a dreamer and a realist
And history sealed this
Taught me that a hero ain't nothing but a field trip
Nah, I know you're down to do something profound
Put a stick in the ground to prove you was around
No amount of time will ever be considered enough
I'm trying to tether it up and live forever through love
We're not lucky, but we're fortunate
I'm pretty sure of it
And all the life we wasted trying to make some bread
Might've been better spent trying to raise the dead",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-fortunate-lyrics

It ain't no misbehaving if I tell you that you're the taste that I'm cravin'
You can't imagine all the time and dedication
Trying to find a way to obtain your validation
And sometimes we stayed up untill the sunrise
Talking about nothing but that love jive
And if we're gonna keep it legit
I got a little secret that I need to admit

I've had a hard time interpreting the opposite sex

The fact is I don't know what you're talking about
And I'm distracted by the gymnastics up in your mouth
Truthfully it's not you, it's me
Cause you're the moon that moves the sea
See, I guess there's a limit to my listening
And then I get dissmissive and treat it as if it's gibberish
And I don't mean to be blunt

Life's too short to be afraid of the dark
And we don't stop after making the mark
Separate your chest from your heart
To help everybody wag your tail with a lot less bark
Put the costume angst away
I was born on the year of the razorblade
I'm in the back corner of a one way train
This storm ain't nothing but Sunday rain
Let's go

Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath

Earthbound, aim for the soft spot
So much purpose I walk like a molotov
Shot glass, rock hard, penetrate nonstop
Cop cars on the way with the bomb squad
Now let it be known
We're trying to get ahead before we get a headstone
But a rich man still face death alone
That's why we turn up the touch and connect the tone

Let me know that you know what you want now

Dashboard ain't clean as it was
Back before I first took the last seat on this bus
But the children dance when we beat the drums
And they still understand why we speak in tongues
All city, American built
A pocket full of cash take care of the guilt
The crabs all crash in a barrell of milk
But when they clear the snow I'mma steer the Seville
It goes, look for the sign, wait for the right time
A lifetime to outlive the night time
And when the paint chips fall
Gonna find my name on the wall with the crown in the skyline
I keep bad on the back of my mind
I'm an average guy, I just happen to fly
Supernatural high and I'm laughing inside
One nation with a capital I

So let it flow, so fresh it grow

Thank you for making me a part of the puzzle
I imagine it was quite the struggle
But you still found time and taught yourself to juggle
Girl, would you give me a kiss for a fist full of flowers?
This could be ours
Girl, could you get rid of that other dude?
Cut him loose and kick him to the multitude
I can't picture why you would split your time
Between I and an additional guy
Seems like more wear then it's worth when
You're the one that's gotta bear this burden
I give you love and respect
But that other stud got nothing to give but stress
Life as a wifey shouldn't be so hard
But everybody gotta be who they think they are, listen

My lady got two men
One's a stranger and the other's a friend
She keeps us both cause she needs us
Zig-zag back and forth in between us
My lady got two lovers
One for the funk and the other for the comfort
I'm trying to understand
But I gotta figure out which one I am

It's obvious that I'm better than him
If you got any sense you won't settle for him
We all sacrifice pride for passion
I'm not sure what you're waiting for to happen
But I feel like a doctor, I got a lot of patience
I co-operated with the operation
Complications, observation
Parked in your lot, can I get some validation?
I'm just saying, gotta escape from the frustration
Wanna express yourself, make a statement
But I don't expect you to change the arrangement
And the truth is I try to support
But I can't thrive when I'm ignored
And I can see that you don't wanna cut the cord
But it's gotta be something more than this tug of war
Girl, you're the shine on the crown
So why you try and let that clown come around?
From now and 'til the universe swallows the Earth
I won't pretend that I can follow how it works
Ever since this began I've been a different man
And then a different man and then a different man
I wonder who I'm gonna be tonight
Just take our hand and it'll be alright, come here

One's a stranger and the other's a friend

Don't know how to describe how much you suck
And it's not just you, but everyone of you plus
Follow each other around like a bunch of ducks
Just turn the music up and get dumb
Stretch your skin around the biggest drum
Born from a neighborhood of click and run
And 
already gave away my last stick of gum
Just find a torch and light the ceiling
Life's too short to fight the feeling
I get a little paranoid for no reason
When the jukebox plays Don't Stop Believin'
My level drives like a rebel
But it's alright, it's a rental
Your consent is so incidental
We want what we want, we ain't trying to settle
We last forever through the echo

Went to hell just to threaten the devil
And separate the horns like bass and treble

And if it's all the same
I'm a flood that thin little train that you call a lane
Knocked down any walls that remain
I'll bring the balls and y'all bring the chains
When I'm dead you can flip the mattress
Put me in a jar and kiss my ashes
Or put my body in the middle of traffic
Buttnaked in a glass casket, what?
Minneapolis, got love for the advocates
Y'all the baddest bitch, so passionate
Let me hear you say fuck the establishment
Say it, show me a player that's mad at this
And I'mma show you a hater and a masochist
Y'all think that I got a damn to give
Do I look like I drive a fucking ambulance?

I Love You Like A Brother,Southsiders,2014,"She might cry herself to sleep tonight
You might act like everything feels alright
I might bite my lip, like the silent type
You might make a fist, like you trying to fight
Got ghosts that haunt that home
And if you didn't want that known then don't put it on a throne
You separate the foe from the friend by the showmanship
And the bones that don't bend
So now I'm studying your moves like
You the only one that knew how to do right
Present it with a sleeve of success
Like we all benefit if you achieve and progress
Maybe you're right maybe I'm just left but
Unless you walk a flight in my steps but
Unless you slept a night in my nest
You shouldn't waste your breath to criticize my mess

I love you like a brother
Even though I'm not your brother
We all got a few flaws
But let's try not to get too lost in the applause
I love you like a sister
Even though you're not my sister
We all got a few flaws
But let's try not to get too lost

Used to be rock, but now it's roll
Looking at the clock and the remote control
The circle contracts till you all alone
I put that on the people you've outgrown
And maybe it was all for show
But it was so convincing that the ground got cold
I guess anything's possible, under a spotlight we all got a note to hold
It goes
Don't throw no stones if you're living in a fish bowl
Blow a kiss though
Where the aim is based on which way the wind floats
And pride is a bottle on a fence post
I keep the shoes laced up
In case the people I love come to shoot the place up
I know we ain't cut from the same cloth
But a lot of those fights were just to say we fought
The mother turns, life is fragile
The struggle burns from inside of the candle
It doesn't matter how far you run from it, you're still gonna find it
You come from it
And even though we all equivalent
We gotta, hold on to the differences
We gotta, stand up for what we won't fall for
Let's give a round of applause for
All of all of y'all",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-i-love-you-like-a-brother-lyrics
January on Lake Street,Southsiders,2014,"The door's open
My left foot sitting on the driveway
You lookin' at me sideways
You tryin' to predict what I might say
But my mind ain’t here now, I'm thinking ‘bout the highway
Gone with the gust
Sing songs for the bombs that fall in the dusk
We all want a little too much
Tryna clutch anything close enough to touch
And if I had the means
I would never be the mascot of y’all team
Y’all judging trials
I’m shoveling miles
Wanna go home and try to grow a couple of smiles
So I shift to the capital N
It happened before, and it’ll happen again
Roll backwards into the street
Now talk amongst yourselves but try to keep it on beat
I got at least ten minutes to live
You’re not a thief, just simulative
There’s no need to be a difficult finish
You can see you ain’t the only one considering getting it in
Claim that you ain’t afraid to die
Then why are you afraid to fly?
You better face the heights
Get your bravery stripes or get your name denied
‘Cause you was waiting for a safer ride
God bless, I set up the bricks
Stepped through the mess, didn't wreck the kicks
Dreamt that I lept off the edge of the cliff
Came back said the bodies up in heaven were thick
Changing lanes and re-arranging life
I ain’t tryna chase a trail of tail-lights
Manage pain to get the placement right
Stand up straight when you say goodnight


And each broken glass shows a different view
I deal the truth - y’all pick and choose
This ain’t a game for you to win or lose
But I, never been in your shoes
But I, never make supper with suckers
It ain’t nothing if it ain’t about hunger
You think you cuttin’ the lumber
And I would love to be a fly on the cupboard
When that bubble ruptures
And even when we save the day
We never do it believing that we don’t make mistakes
You don’t need to recognize my face
I’m trying to fly through time and space
Too late to erase me
With the windows down, January on Lake Street
Poppa got a brand new can of paint
Now put your hands in the air like you work at the bank",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-january-on-lake-street-lyrics
Star Shaped Heart,Southsiders,2014,"Dusty trails
Jezabels singing about heads and tails
Breast pocket full of useless words
I made a promise I would prove my worth
I gotta work, gotta work 'til I sweat poison
You gaining on it like you tryin' ta exploit him
I gave a fuck when I was a lot younger
But Lady Luck got a box cutter
She laughs at her suiters, consumers
Tune her in the letter, blast out the woofers
The usual is the new normal
Beautiful lurks in the background vocals
I don't shit in the sandbox
I'm not winning the dance off

And I ain't trying to sound scummy
But if you lick my wounds it taste like money

Tattoo say ''love life''
Attitude like a sunrise
And when the tongue come untied
You keep it on a quick draw like a gunfight
If it's done right strangers will sing along
The truth is I only came here to read your palms
The freaks keep it moving 'til the beat is gone
We're trying to grow a greener lawn
It goes ''oh my goodness''
We got too much love, now there's nowhere to put it
Time flew like it's designed to do
And all we left behind were clues
The handprints are bloody
Because the puppy outran the bunny

And I ain't trying to sound hungry
But if you lick my wounds it taste like money

Do you like to make party?
Yeah, you and who's army?
Man, we're on a random mission
With a van full of vandalism
Study my mannerisms
These are not the hands of a handsome prince
But I feel like a supernova
Don't lose control of the booze or the mota
I got a star shaped heart
You got a house made out of face cards
This graveyard used to be a K-Mart
But before that it was a graveyard
You can't be a rich man
If your soul is a swimming pool of quicksand

And I ain't trying to sound funny
But if you lick my wounds it taste like money",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-star-shaped-heart-lyrics
Hell,Southsiders,2014,"And I remember it like it was just last night
Yeah right, remember might be a little too much word
Everything was blurred, word?
When you can't see more than a few feet past your face
Tryna navigate, two feet through the avenues and alleyways
From Minneapolis to the North Cali Bay
We seen a whole lot of scene
Snakes move like water in a stream
The re-write got the green light
Still seem like nobody wanna intervene
Every minute that passes is permanent
But you made it this far, you deserve to live
I've had the time of my life and hurt worse than this
Tighten up that tourniquet

Hell yeah I had a good time
But I ain't tryna go no more
Hell yeah I had a good time
But I ain't tryna go no more

Hell's not under the ground, Hell's all around
So either you didn't know or you just don't care
But I was in hell when you told me to go there
Let's make a mess, celebrate the flesh
If you tryna come up, you gotta place your bets
If you're tryna recover, you gotta take some steps
Wanna get in front of the crash
There's no more space to stash anything up under the dash
Can't relax, but need to detach
Turn the beats up to max and lean the seat back
Everybody's got an affliction
Everyone's got a condition
Some of us built our own position
Some of us still got no opinions
Oh, bored to death by the score they kept
Don't break character force your breath
And I don't mean any disrespect
But I'm looking forward to when I get to forget

Hell yeah I had a good time
But I ain't tryna go no more
Hell yeah I had a good time
But I ain't tryna go no more",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-hell-lyrics
We Ain’t Gonna Die Today,Southsiders,2014,"Hands stay clean till the well go dry
The clutch kinda sticks right
Aim for the sky
And let a few fly
In due time, gonna get right
There’s no loose ties
I’m not the new guy
I’m just one hand at twelve’o’clock
The other one stirs your melting pot
And if I had a third hand
I’d use it to turn up the music
Louder
You like to complain, huh
You gonna hide ‘till the rain comes?
Feel my shine, I’m the same son
No matter what I’ve done
I remember where I came from
The flood made the neighborhood messy
But you’ve got the keys to the Chevy
Have to drive, until the afterlife
So we can steal the feast
Out of the Beast’s belly

We ain't gonna die today
Right now I’m wide awake
Tell her that the devil got a price to pay
Letter by letter all I’m trying to say
That we ain’t gonna die today
Right now I’m wide awake
Rock solid, head held high
Hands stay clean ‘till the well go dry
Right now I’m wide awake
Right now I’m wide awake
Right now I’m wide awake
Hands stay clean ‘till the well go dry

One wheel for the clock that we live within
I feel like your father, discipline
It’s unconvincing when I tell them that hell
Ain’t nothing but a place in Michigan
Two wheels in the gutter, engine reving
I feel like your mother, listen, suggestion
Don’t test if you’re really not a threat
If my crew get fresh, take you all the way to heaven
Honesty stinks a little
It’s cause it comes from deep inside you
It’s covered in blood and bile
And it tastes so self-entitled
And you can keep a wood stake in the trunk
On the off chance that the fairy tales ain’t bunk
And I’mm save a bottle of that funk
To get motel parking lot balcony crunk
A true fiend would hit the screen
Halfway there tryna live the dream
Cops with lights shining in my face
Cause my names not attached to these license plates
Freedom is a paperweight
But you can’t explain that to an inmate
So I’mma keep rolling past these mile markers
And deliver this flame to the fire starters

We ain't gonna die today
Right now I’m wide awake
Tell her that the devil got a price to pay
Letter by letter all I’m trying to say
That we ain’t gonna die today
Right now I’m wide awake
Rock solid, head held high
Hands stay clean ‘till the well go dry
Right now I’m wide awake
Right now I’m wide awake
Right now I’m wide awake
Hands stay clean ‘till the well go dry",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-we-aint-gonna-die-today-lyrics

I'm as subtle as an alien abduction in public
Somebody call the cops
Suck it, blow the trumpet until the bubble pops
And butter up another batch of those muffin tops
I'm just trying to find a balance
Wound up with a wife and a gang of kids
Her kiss tastes like black licorice
And now I'm riding in the back of her ambulance
Knock knock knockin' on heavens door
Let me in yo I got a laminate
I guess Its my job to let y'all know
That those my nuts y'all tampered with

She Don’t Know Why She Love It,Southsiders,2014,"Liar, you don't live nothing like your photo
Soft like a marshmallow, heart pumps cocoa
I put my hood up to look like a cobra
Minnesota make moves like a poker
No joker, shake up the snow globe
Blow me on a roller coaster at Como
I'm at the grocery store in my bathrobe
Bad bad daddy and I still ain't plateaued
Southsider, pied piper
Settin' traps for the rats in the choir
Big Slug got love for hire
With the turntables up on the drum riser
Now let your momma admire this rhyme writer
While I catch last dance at the Lamplighter
Don't ever fight the desire to kill a spider
If it bit the hand of a vampire

I'm on top of the world
Watch the waves

Everything looks blurry to us
We not certain what we workin' to touch
Might remind you of an ordinary person but
I'm the shit, I get followed by a courtesy flush
Compel, the clientele
To get in line and smell what I'm tryna to sell
And if I cry it's not a cry for help
I live my life like I'm alive and well
So what if I, could justify the jump just to fly
What if we don't get another try? Skydive to survive
Hands up high we about to go live
The first to hate it is just the last to taste it
I'm tryna see past your makeshift
Face mask made of cheap masking tape
Sedate and then we amputate

Peter was my peeps who used to sell weed
Even though he didn't need to
He says he did it for the free smoke
But honestly he would've rather had a speed boat
Or a snowmobile or whatever
See the point is he didn't move enough to make a treasure
Never could have guessed that Pete would make a little impression
On a middle aged detective named Hamm
No irony, yeah Hamm
He didn't come to put the cuffs on your hands
He landed with a duffle and a plan but
Pete couldn't eat all of Hamm's demands
It was an awkward spot, officer thought
That Peter would be sittin' on a lot more crop
He did such a bad job at bein' a bad cop
That its obvious to me that the reason that he robbed him was Sidney
Sid was a sick kid that needed a kidney
The grandson, son of Hamm's son
You do what you gotta do for your fam son
Doesn't take a rocket scientist but I am one
The situation showed the pig for who he truly is
And gave the dealer an excuse to quit
And since Sid's Physician is Peter's father
You should mind your business, don't be a bother
Okay

I don't need no fancy shit
I'm only askin' ya: ""Can I live?""

Prelude To Hell,Southsiders,2014,"Somethin' at this party don't feel right
The vibe reminds me of an overnight drive
But I won't complain because it's not my place
And everybody got their own way to celebrate
It's all the same, it's all the difference
It's all about the aim mixed with the distance
It's all the pain and sickness
And everybody in this bitch is over privileged
Its like I'm in a bad movie called ""Worst Party Ever""
A cameo from Snoop Dogg couldn't make it better
I'm lookin' for the line for the bathroom
But I'm too distracted by your awful tattoos
Its not meant to offend
If I neglect to pretend
To be impressed with the way you're dressed
And shut your mouth your breath smells like death
I'm convinced this whole house is possessed
A bunch of demons, all of y'all are demons
I think the dog tried to warn me and I didn't believe him
But I can feel them all scheming on my feelings
Now I'm about to climb out this window towards freedom
Get off your chair and put your drink in the sky
Anybody could be gone in the blink of an eye
Spent my whole life reppin' my whole city
So when I die, I'ma take y'all with me

Hell yeah I had a good time
But I ain't tryin' to go no more
Hell yeah I had a good time

Bob Seger,The Lake Nokomis Maxi Single ,2014,"My father's to the left of me
Move like the knight
My mama's to the right
Move the knight
Like everyone else, they're pointing
But nowhere feels quite right

I pour a little more whiskey on them ice cubes
I’m tryna to get tipsy as a tugboat
Most of us gettin' lost in the night moves
The rest of us wanna watch from the front row
Come and look into the eyes of a landslide
Let me know if your recognize blood shot red
Not above passin' out in the cab ride
Wake me up when its time to unfuck my head
Whatchu know about a party
Y'all still tryna have some fun
Throw your hands up like it’s 2001
You wanna taste the teat, you want a place to sleep
But you need somebody else to come change the sheets
I hold composure, the snow will melt
The hope stays low cause I know myself
But I treat it like a test to keep me at my best
Rest in peace to Nekst


I ain’t as cool as I used to be, leave me alone
I’m kinda blurry from the journey, man, my speakers are blown
Truthfully, I'd rather keep it in a zone
I could maneuver easily from the comfort of my home, but
Don’t ever let the headlights die
Stars only fall out of the dead night sky
The more I travel, the farther I see
The more it seems as if my shadow ain’t following me
Now everyone’s impressed with impressions
All of y'all dressed up in the finest flesh
I’m not tryin' to imply I’m on a different page
Similar traits, familiar face
I remember the days when I felt like fightin' it
Lost in the ways of my own self-righteousness
Feels like I’m still tryna find my fix
Before this lightning hits


You might know it takes a lot more help to guard yourself
When you got nothing else but the cards you dealt
I learned about sippin' on a full bottle of Ripple
Simultaneously sittin' on a whole lot of little
You can assume we wanna brighten the room
Like the light of the moon trying to find you
Now open the curtain, allow the shine through
We wanna know how the night moves",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-bob-seger-lyrics
This Lonely Rose,Frida Kahlo Vs Ezra Pound,2015,"I parked on a vacant road
To get away from people and watch the planes approach
Turn the music down, put the windows low
Turn the headlights off, but let the dashboard glow
I try not to reminisce
'Cause many of these memories ain't got no kind of benefits
It's the same old lick, you can paint the bricks
But your face is just a way to decorate your shit
I'm the motherfuckin' man when I'm standing in it
'Cause I don't know how to swim, but I project the image
That I'mma go all in, got it under control
Until I grow my fins I'm still plugging my nose
No surprise, stolen by the tide
You can close your eyes but the hopes stay alive
And the crow gonna fly
And the dope gets sold, other than that
There's really not much to know
Don't cut this rose

This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold
This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold

Quick to tell you that she don't need a man
From what I've seen I completely understand
Can't stand a cat that try to make demands
Plus her man said he sick of bringing beach to the sand
Quickly sinking in the holiest boat
Figured he might as well drink just to keep it afloat
Nope, when small things end up being gigantic
Relationships go the way of the Titanic
Why panic? Have some fun while it last
Be happy that you even had a spot on the cast
She hard to keep 'cause she know what men about
It just took you too long before you figured it out, huh
Moving fast don't mean it won't end quick
Why put your toes in when you can skinny dip?
Remember when you're with the prettiest chick
There's another man that's sick of putting up with her shit

This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold
This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold

There is a temperamental magic in the key of love and war
It go ""Nothing up his sleeve, not even a fucking arm""
Body ain’t a temple if it’s disassembled parts
Allocated into separate level warps and divorced
Tell tents severing up pell-mell dash melting
Squeegee in his post to a cheesecloth silk screen evenly
East coast tilt kings raised by servals
Pacing up the grape vine nervous
Poke jarred brain matter adequately curious
Pick a perfect patsy, herd ‘em back into the turnip truck
Where a high arch pose as the nobles
Fine yeti fur with a dire prognosis
He prefer to mire with the openly grotesque
Opening a cold discotheque coat check
Oh my low-tech bolt neck, go time, no myth
I'm a slow death goldmine

This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold
This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold

Too hard to hold
Too hard to hold

My Best Half,Frida Kahlo Vs Ezra Pound,2015,"The first time I met my wife was on a Wednesday night
Making party in a German bar
Murs was there, the rap-off at the Gasthof
Check it out, true story

I got something on my mind, can I leave it with you?
I'm still feeling you and all the things that you do
Remember Wednesday nights in that basement bar
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far (sorry)
Hellbound we must have drowned in a bottle of some rusty brown
Running town to town, like shut 'em down
Shut 'em, shut 'em, what?
When the buzz wore off you still stuck around
And when I think of all the lines we stepped
And the tolerance required to forgive and forget
When I reflect on the boundaries and limits we set
I recognize neither one of us is innocent
Look I'm just a song writer, I'm not a wrong righter
But I'm alive and I'm proof, survival ain't exclusive to the strong
We all tryna keep it calm
So this goes to anyone who sings along

Come on, I never said I'm the best
I can't watch my step when I'm watching you step
But baby, I'mma do my best
You got me under your spell like I was under arrest
And I ain't never said I'm the best
No special effects, I wanna touch your flesh
But baby I'mma do my best
Love connection, nuff respect
I never said I'm the best
You can check for better, but don't hold your breath
But baby I'mma do my best
We were both impressed, it felt so correct
And I ain't never said I'm the best
Sometimes I forget but I know I'm blessed
But baby, I'mma do my
From the first time that we met, you're my best
She made me wait a couple months for some sex
Murs wasn't there
Echo, echo, echo, echo
Delay, delay, delay, delay

She made love to a switchblade
Then stayed over night for a whole decade
That safety net doesn't mean that your nest is safe
Well played, but still called a checkmate
He made love to a rosebush
Drew a crowd, all of y'all can look but don't push
It's a thin line between crime and justice
First you gotta find us, then you can judge us
Outlaws, we far from flawless
We guilty of whatever the accomplice accomplished
And if the cops drop all of the charges
We'll be out all the mall with identical outfits
Like a couple of fly motherfuckers
We married so we don't testify against each other
Till they name a holiday after Marvin Gaye
That's all I got to say, you can stop the tape

We know what it's about
Or maybe we're still tryna figure it out
Or maybe it doesn't matter, we couldn't care a lesser amount
We know what it's about
Or maybe we're still tryna figure it out
Or maybe it doesn't matter, we couldn't care a lesser amount",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-my-best-half-lyrics
Finer Things,Frida Kahlo Vs Ezra Pound,2015,"I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh
I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh

I'm laughing at me, not with me
One hand to keep the other hand clean
The full moon looked like a tangerine
Fell out of the sky to land into the sea
But when I drifted up on that beach
Previous presidents got impeached
Then she put me on the longest leash
I feel like a new drug on these streets
And ain’t nobody in denial
I’ll eat your dinner off the kitchen tile
Never been afraid to go the extra mile
Just wanna see you flex your sexy smile
Woke up on the bottom of a fox nest
Top heavy like a cop's vest
But I gotta put it in the context
She's not an object, she's a bomb threat

I never felt the world explode
Until it was too late, oh
You had me when you lost me then
I found I couldn't stay, oh
Sometimes you were around the hours
I wish you were away, oh
The things we want ignite in flames
Sit back and watch the parade, oh

It's just her and me and some cheap balloons
Turn the key and sing the tunes
The full moon looked like a macaroon
I feel invisible till the afternoon
But everybody wanna catch a star
To try to recharge that electric spark
Crash a car and set it in park
But she’ll smash his ceramic heart like a dead guitar
No spotlight not the type that needs 
vacancy to occupy
Gotta put that rabbit back into the magic act
Astronauts but they’ll launch your Cadillac
No stop light, no stop sign, no basis to apologize
Fight for that right to love, that’s what life is of
Look up high, you can see us fly above

I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh
I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-finer-things-lyrics
Won’t Look Back,Fishing Blues,2016,"Any way that the cold wind blows
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home
Be leaving and I won't look back
Follow my life, I can't save my past
Any way that the cold wind blows
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home
Be leaving and I won't look back
Follow my life, I can't save my past

First love, who was your first love?
And I ain't talking about your first crush
I'm referring to the first one that make you wanna curl up
Or get you worked up enough to try to burn the world up
And I don't care about your regrets
You can keep those secrets to death
I don't need to know what you speak underneath each breath
But we learning how to read what's in between the text
And when you feel like enough was felt
If you ain't tryin' to eat another helping of hell
That's when you tell farewell to that well you fell down
Fall out the frame, take care of yourself now
It's no thang, come out of the cold rain
Make giant steps, gotta catch the cold train
Everybody wishin' on some better days
Don't let the storm door hit ya, and don't ever change

Any way that the cold wind blows

Any way that the cold wind blows

Second guess your own instinct
Probably best to just listen and think
And don't expect anything less than the kitchen sink
It feel like you're still trying to lead a horse to drink
And I don't dig dramatic
But it was signal static when the thunder struck
It doesn't matter how much clean the vulture up
It never look like a dove, you still gave it your blood
And that's love,
 I never hated your guts
I never even understood where that phrase was from
But why would you believe that I could trust your touch
If you would never make me wanna sleep in my truck?
It's more than a drug
It's more than any liquor you could pour from a jug
Trying to find a little bit of normal on the bus with the windows cracked
It's why we don't look back, it's like we won't be back, right?

Any way that the cold wind blows
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home
Be leaving and I won't look back
Follow my life, I can't save my past
Any way that the cold wind blows
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home
Be leaving and I won't look back
Follow my life, I can't save my past

Third time's a charm, you've heard that before
Display the scar, you've earned that at war
Turnt on alarm, a guard at the door
But ripped out the heart, was par for the course
But if the furnace doesn't burn at the core
Maybe your purpose ain't to learn anymore
Dinosaur can't soar if he trying to snore
And ain't nobody leaving with a perfect score on the board
But we never got bored of the wind
The memory of how it tore through the skin
By the end of the week it's gonna weaken
Pinned in between depend and discipline
Can't nobody judge but we can pretend
We got it all figured out, no questions left
When the truth is we never even move one step
Just do it all over again and again and again

Any way that the cold wind blows
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home
Be leaving and I won't look back
Follow my life, I can't save my past
Any way that the cold wind blows
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home
Be leaving and I won't look back

Oh no, no, no
I don't believe you, I don't believe you
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
This is pure evil, this is pure evil

When I woke up this morning my only intention was
To look in my reflection with mutual respect, yeah
I know I'm more than just a badge and a weapon, but
When you see me comin' you recognize my profession
You should believe that I'ma leave an impression
Even if it means I gotta put my knee on your neck, man
Was never meant for you to pass this test
The last question on the quiz is, 'What the fuck'd you expect, man?'
A little money made him want some protection
Because the many with no money made the money feel threatened
And we accept there's gonna be some exceptions
But it's built on a connection of ownership and possessions
Baby boy, you pay attention to them lessons
If you flexin' any teeth, I'ma send you to the dentist
It all depends on how you fit into my spectrum
From lectures, to handcuffs, to beat downs, to death wish
I was told to tell a one-sided story
And that's why I had to eliminate your perspective
I was afraid for my death
I had to make an assessment
Ain't my day to be checked, I felt the weight on my chest
I was told to tell a one-sided story
So say a prayer cause this one's gone to Heaven
Innocence is a submissive position
It's a one-sided story, read it to your children

The Shit That We’ve Been Through,Fishing Blues,2016,"Seven in the morning, locked the door
Put the keys in my bag, next to my passport
Feels like I'm headed towards war
Trying to pretend that I remember what we're fighting for
You're upstairs, passed out asleep
While I'm on the front step staring at the street
Patiently wait for my taxi
Come save me and take me away from reality
The car pulled up at dawn, I put the seat belt on
Everything felt wrong
Stubborn ain't the same as strong
But try to tell that to the queen that the king rides on
Took a look before I hit the road
Your silhouette didn't show up in the window
Well all right then
It's all right then, but something's missing

Girl, I miss you
But I wish you
Could, would
Look, all of this becomes the shit that we've been through
Girl, I miss you
But I wish you
Could, would
Look, all of this becomes the shit that we've been through

When it goes straight to voicemail
You might as well tell me go straight to hell
Ain't nothing new, just suffering through
And that's something that I've become accustomed to
But I'm in love with you, passion born
Like a resource torn from a planet's core
Stole my crown just to examine the thorns
Scatter 'em around on the bathroom floor
A little ink, with a kiss and a wink
But the bigger the stink, the stiffer the drink
And I think this fight started in a past life
Got you sitting on the dark side of the gaslight
Pick up your phone before my plane departs
I'm trying to make a mark in the shape of a heart
Well all right then, we all right then
But something's missing

Girl, I miss you
But I wish you
Could, would
Look all of this becomes the shit that we've been through

Besos,Fishing Blues,2016,"One up, never still if the sun up
It's all love until the GOV see you come up
It's like a jungle never know what's gonna run up
We just wanna live forever with the thumbs up
Barcelona, no stops got the bump up
Smart phone in case cops pull the gun up
Artichoke, heart's soft, mock duck tough
Garçon, bring a cup of that young drunk
I ain't ya boy baby, you got me fucked up
Wait, let me state it plainly, shut the fuck up
Trust don't occupy space with dumb luck
Hush, fuzz got the tour bus bugged up
Shhh
Dirty like the wheels on a dump truck
Birds snuck through the security with nun chucks
Adrenaline rush, the whole party jump up
I flood nut on her sponge butt

It goes, people people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People
From everywhere gather around, uh uh

Now, too playa, too clean for spoons
Got a, routine 'cause I fiend for structure
But cha, shooting at the ring and the moon
Screaming, fuck the world, 'cause that girl don't love ya
There's a few dreams to choose
But if they let you keep your shoe strings
They don't want you to suffer
And if you're blessed you can haunt each other
In a city of ghosts where the vultures flutter
Now, mood swings a convenient excuse
Seems that there's gotta be something in the butter
Smother the fire before it gets discovered
One foot in the grave, the other foot in the gutter, uh
Boosting any loose thing, if it ain't screwed down
It becomes prey to my hunger
I take it back to my underground bunker
Stay cool everybody, have an awesome summer

It goes, people people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People from everywhere gather around

Bonus, me and my cojónes
Hoping that you never treat me like I'm homeless
Unless it mean you about to see me with some donuts
Or dominate the nomination where your zone is
What you thinking, it's the reason we in show biz
Work like a clown with the squirt guns loaded
Only thing worse than being lonely is coke dick
Word got around and now we call you blow fish
You was pissing in your own bowl of porridge
When I rode across the ocean on the back of a tortoise
Never see me try to act like I'm gorgeous
Greasy mufucker make it party with the Socs
Tweet a picture of my penis to the POTUS
Roll my weed in the papers of some old eviction notices
The police came like a swarm of locusts

Perfect,Fishing Blues,2016,"Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die
I'm not perfect, I try
I'm tryna free my hands, grab the day by the throat
Gotta get a grip but I'm at the end of my rope
I'm not perfect, I know, I know

And if I had a spare moment
I'd probably loan it to somebody who needed to hold it
Life's indecisive, might slice you open
Or show compassion and throw you back into the ocean
I'm tryna keep my faith on the path
But the landscape's full of danger flags
You can change your name and still live in the past
Daddy was the face on a package of Zig-Zags

Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die
I'm not perfect, I try
I try
You might fade away, you might burst in flames
Ain't no reason you should even try to search my name
I'm not perfect, okay?

I'm a father and a son of a Southsider
Mouth full of hot dish, pop-lifer
And this little piggy squealed like a cop's tire
When I set the AUX on fire like it's a box of spiders
You the opposite of truth, you over-produced
You gotta grow more toes, you wanna fill these shoes
You gotta make love like there's nothin' to lose
You wanna wake up the world but there's a button for snooze

Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die
I'm not perfect, I try
I try, I try
We gotta work it out 'cause I ain't turning around
The same person that I was when the curtains were down
I'm not perfect, what now?
Huh, what now?

Some say that I pass, none say that I'm passive
White trash with a fraction of Blackness
My mathematics got Native blood too
But no matter where I stand, either way it's fuck you
I've never been a victim of police harassment
And I knew what they seen when I turned job absent
Irish name, Scandinavian frame
I'm a Rubik's cube, I'm the American dream
Check it out
I'm a feminist, I'm also a misogynist
Spit like an arsonist, dick like an obelisk
And I promise if you ever hear me contradict myself
It's not a sign of the apocalypse
I've been an asshole before it was fashionable
And when it's out of style, I'll be the last to know
And if Illuminati listenin', I don't wanna plateau
Who I have to blow to play the halftime show, huh?

Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die
I'm not perfect, I try
Lord knows I try
On the day of death, may you deserve respect

Fishing Blues,Fishing Blues,2016,"I realize that we ain't the same
But you might appreciate it if I try to explain
While I'm sitting in the middle of a lake
Gotta find a fish to come and nibble on the bait
I'mma set the stage for the challenge
I'mma meditate just for practice
I'mma concentrate on my balance
I'mma contemplate on this canvas
I'm a bandit running with a stolen moment
The careful arrow, narrow focus
Gotta roll with both eyes open
Quality of life feels like I'm floatin'
Trying to make this minute stretch
'Cause what's in my face is so picturesque
I mean, it even made me quit the cigarettes
I mean, shit I guess I got a fish to catch

Just like an answered calling
When I drop this line in the water
Keep fishing, man with a vision
Look brother I saw the future
Look past I'll draw it for you
Strong words of an old soul
""Don't rock my boat,"" I told them
""Reel em' in throw em' back slow""

Everything looks clear in hindsight
If you can adjust to the twilight
Tryin' to live enough life to last a lifetime
Roll with the ride like I'm supposed to survive
How you know that you alive?
If you ain't fighting for a mouthful of future?
This ain't business as usual, check the tackle
Box full of beautiful, look like shrapnel
Break the cycle and the old mistakes
But the boat obeys the waves
And then the little fish spoke as it broke away
It said, ""Know limits, but know with a 'K'""
Yesterday's catch will cook tomorrow
Right now I gotta do what I gotta
Took a time out from the human drama
Put my line in the water, now who wanna holler?

Ringo,Fishing Blues,2016,"I think I'm still drunk from last night
I woke up in a lawn chair
I feel faint like an old ass flashlight
I don't remember how I got there
Waiting at the train stop, hoping that the rain stop
The pain throbs at the front of the skull
I should have took the day off, looking for a pay off
The brainwash is insufferable
I'm on purpose, coffee in a thermos
Squint like Clint tryna spot me in the cursive
Missing persons, lost in your costumes
Blood, moon and a boombox full of volume
If I had the authority I would probably
Make everybody throw their hands in the sky
And everything I said in this song would be classified
And all of y'all would be captured alive

I mighta showed up when the party start
I mighta  got high with your bodyguard
I mighta  passed out at the airport bar
Everybody wanna see a falling star
I mighta  thrown up in a rental car
I mighta  woke up in a reservoir
I mighta  got robbed at Mardi Gras
Everybody wanna see a falling star
Everybody wanna see a falling star
Everybody wanna see a falling star
Everybody wanna see a falling star
Everybody wanna see a falling star

Once upon a time in the next few days
I gotta wake up and get out of the shade
I might put on a beat down pair of Chucks
My old swimming trunks
And AmirSaysNothing in my earbuds
Just me and my beer gut
I absorb it before I get deported back to orbit
Over the winter I remain indoors
I want the summer in my city to feel like a rain forest
And you know we should skinny dip
In the middle of the Mississip
Do a couple of spins and shit, synchronicity flips
A three-sixty finish, Twin Cities bitch
And I don't care 'bout what y'all think
Dressed up like a cop, stuck up the bank
The police came in some Russian tanks
And I'm in jail with nothing to drink

I mighta showed up when the party start
I mighta  got high with your bodyguard

I want a snack machine on the party bus
Your flag is green, in God we trust
You were born in sin, we were born in debt
I guess this is about as feel good as it gets
I want Wonder Bread wrapped in rubber bands
It's not too much to understand
I wanna color the world but only got one Crayon
Reach for the sky, try to touch my hand

Seismic Waves,Fishing Blues,2016,"Armageddon started, I guess it wasn't that hard to miss
It didn't trip the alarm on your hybrid
Carbon footprint, the darts are rigged
And I'm a big fan of carbs and the artist Prince
There's a marginal risk that your cards won't hit
It's like tryna borrow a barbecue rib from a starving kid
Be thankful if your stars are lit
Or you might get caught between the Charmin and shit
The armor fits to stay outta harm's grip
But Karma's a bitch so when your heartbeat quits
Consider all the death you've invested with
The shoes, the booze, the phone that you textin' with
Disrespecting gets Second Amendment-ed
But the species still seem to be trendin'
From the friend zone all the way to the Kremlin
The devil give a fuck about a flag or an emblem
Things ain't been the same since Trayvon, shit
Things ain't been the same since Reagan, wait
Ain't a single thing change from the days
When the gods went crazy and broke the languages
We trying to make these payments
Ain't got the privilege to exhibit the patience
Gone next week, so tonight we lie with no lives to save
Seismic waves

I should jump back and kiss myself
But I've been working on learning to resist myself
I used to think criticism was the definition
Fish swimmin' up a river full of pessimism
I wanna catch one bare-handed
Clean it, cook it, and feed it to Lazarus
All around the planet's the same as Minneapolis
Everybody looking for a little love and happiness
I don't romanticize the rain
And those drugs only hide the pain
Turn up the temperature, high as a plane with non-sequiturs
The tired be trained
And you keep Christoper Walken with the shit that you're talkin'
You can't take it with if it don't fit in your coffin
As a kid, I didn't give it much thought then
Just wanted a mouth full of nipple and a Zippo in my zipper pocket
I remember when the whole world stank like an ashtray; yeah
The good ol' days
I wanna laugh when somebody say 'The Good Ol' Days'
But they was good 'cause we did learn to look both ways
Across a road way like everything'll be okay
Before we go the fuck away like a snowflake
Gone next week but tonight I'm tryna reach those seismic
Climb those seismic waves

And I'm smiling for this mugshot
That's when I knew the plan was bound to fail
By the time you hear this song I'll be singing it from down at county jail
Still filled to the maximum
So fuck Bill Clinton with his saxophone
And cut, I'm trying to follow a lit fuse
I must have missed a day's allowance of fish food
Like who's tit do you think that this is dude?
She ain't your bitch to misuse
And when there ain't nothing more to grab
I might give something back to the floor of this cab
I might tag my name on the door of your building
Might even make a couple of your children

Some plot and scheme on the scene, he play dumb
From the load out, true emissary who forever ready
Ask your secretary 'bout the melonberry
It's elementary, fedora or the ski hat
Drawers or dungaree slacks, where you gonna be at?

Still Be Here,Fishing Blues,2016,"I didn’t believe that I could have anything else to share
I mean that I knew I could help somewhere
But I never felt as bare as when I felt your stare
That's what I get for thinking that I’m self-aware
We purposely search for what the purpose be
But the truth is I wasn’t even present in the currently
I coulda been a phone call for an emergency
From some hotel on Bourbon Street
I try to keep reminding my mind that what's mine
It’s just a asinine way to pass the time
Go, hold your kids 'fore they grow too big
Like a minute is forever when a memory’s a gift
Give this one to anyone
No box, no lines made of dots, no labels or locks
Gotta brave through the pain that we're shaking it off
Shave with the crane and aim for the top

I wanna give you the world like it was mine to share
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
You'll always have my words, I try to speak ‘em clear
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
And if that don’t work, I might be unprepared
But I’ll still be here, I’ll still be here
From the bad to the worst, my love’s sincere
I'ma still be here, I’ll still be

And I'll still be fascinated by the freedom of wings
I wanna know what you dream with no strings
Looking at shadows and the shapes on the ceiling
Make a little noise to communicate your feelings
I feel fortunate, I found fulfillment
I see my father in the faces of my children
I'm so vain that my heart's like a rooster
You make it hard to be afraid of the future
And when I hear you singin' along
I remember that I'll never be alone again
Judge me on what I depend upon
I want forever to spend with my fam’ and my friends
And I still be guilty
Of challenging the people that balance and build me
That’s why I’m speaking to you and when you reach it too
You can pick up the pieces and see what it do

I wanna give you the world like it was mine to share
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
You'll always have my words, I try to speak ‘em clear
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
And if that don’t work, I might be unprepared
But I’ll still be here, I’ll still be here
From the bad to the worst, my love’s sincere
I'ma still be here, I’ll still be

And I ain’t gonna front like I deserve your love
I'm still trying to learn to love
It's my long term ambition
But the burden burns so big you can’t miss it
It was worth the tears
I want my verses to persevere
I don't need a souvenir to prove that I was here
'Cause ever since you appeared, it’s been a happy new year

I'd give you the world like it was mine to share
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
You'll always have my words, I try to speak ‘em clear
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
And if that don’t work, I might be unprepared
But I’ll still be here, I’ll still be here
From the bad to the worst, my love’s sincere
I'ma still be here, I’ll still be",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-still-be-here-lyrics
Next To You,Fishing Blues,2016,"Darlin', you don't even know
I'm layin' right next to you
Sometime I feel so alone
That I don't know what to do
I don't know why, I don't know why
I said I don't know why, I don't know why

I was out with my crew tonight
We were all gettin' super nice
I had so much to drink that you'd think
I'm 'bout to go and paint the bathroom sink pink
Rule number 1: always puke alone
The second rule is always puke at home
I guess it's time to go
Didn't see nobody from my family around
So I went outside to flag a taxi down
I told a cab to take 35 south and let the windows down
I gotta air myself out
I put a new piece of gum in my mouth
As the car pulled up right in front of the house
And all that I can think about is how much I love fucking you
I can't wait to get inside
But I never considered that you'd be fast asleep
And now I'm masturbating with some Vaseline, and

Darlin', you don't even know
I'm layin' right next to you
Sometime I feel so alone
That I don't know what to do
I don't know why, I don't know why
I said I don't know why, I don't know why

I'd love to press my face into the flesh
In between your pregnant breasts
I'd love to squeeze your butt and make you horny
But I know you gotta wake up in the morning
So I'mma just lay next to you
And think about when I make sex to you
It probably sound kinda perverted, I imagine
But that ain't enough to make me wanna curb my enthusiasm
It feels so right in my left
And I don't think she protest if I don't leave a mess
I disappear into the smell of your hair
And it's becoming apparent that I've become incoherent
With my mind on my business, fist full of carnal
Blurry with the vision, I'm spinnin' like a marble
Fade to black way under the shellac
Can't fap, too wasted, if you was awake you'd laugh
And...

Darlin', you don't even know
I'm lyin' right next to you
Sometime I feel so alone
That I don't know what to do
I don't know why, I don't know why
I said I don't know why, I don't know why

Like a Fire,Fishing Blues,2016,"A recording...it's like ""Hi this is a recording"" and then....

I was born on a rug made of dogs playing poker
Shoulda never let me cross your border
Sock full of quarters, lost on the corner
Not too high but I'm not too sober
I filled it up just to spill the cup
Better fix your bridges, they're still corrupt
My dreams are vivid, I don't wish for wishes
You know nobody that beats the business
And I don't even miss when it was all so simple
Sick off the vino, kicking out the window
Sometimes life's like 
the card game War
Hide a couple knives in the silverware drawer
Loot like a cop then deploy of troops
Got heavy artillery shootin' from the rooftop
She can't see me when I move through the nuance
What, so what, so what you want, huh?

Run wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fire
Run wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fire

I figured out that you're fraudulent
I hope you feel that that's a compliment
'Cause you've been hollering the phony rhetoric for a minute
We outta give you a ribbon for the commitment
It's no squabble, salute, I raise my bottle
To the fact that you found a few fools who would follow
We live for the now cause there ain't no tomorrow
But my mixtape still needs an outro
And you can mark these words with a Sharpie
We make party as long as there's a heartbeat
I'm like a Harley, you're like a Hardly
Get behind me, Satan, you can't harm me
I'm not scared of the flood, squaring up
When Armageddon come, I turn the stereo up
Making love in the back of an American truck
Bust a nut, jump up and hit the airhorn button, what?

Run wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fire
Run wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fire",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-like-a-fire-lyrics
Everything,Fishing Blues,2016,"When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live
For as long as I've been living it
And I ain't saying I expected to die before that number got high
Just never deliberately considered it, go figure it
Who'da known I'd 'a had so many kids
And the first one's grown n' doesn't answer his phone
The third sun from the stone got me supposing
I'm supposed to focus on keeping this home
Outta foreclosure from all four corners
Feels like I'm riding on an old roller-coaster
The ghost of Christmas sober
Mostly, but I'mma overdose on these four leaf clovers
You can dance like a crash survivor
You can laugh or cry, whatever pacifies you
Funny how time flies
Till my family sets my raft on fire

I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb
I don't pretend to be hard, don't pretend to be first
And most of all I don't pretend to be concerned
I don't pretend to be rich, don't pretend to be broke
I don't pretend to be asleep, don't pretend to be woke
I don't pretend to be deep, don't pretend to be clean
I’m everything and everything that's in between

They said you only get one life
But I lived at least four lives in the life I'm living in now
And if I could handwrite what they say when I'm gone
It's that he said everything that he could fit in his mouth
I got the coldest shoulders in the solar system
I know because I drove around this whole existence
Resistance to personal growth seems suspicious
What, you really didn't want to go the distance?
I don't stand still, wander off, I’m a drifter
Look at the bigger, digital, panoramic picture
You catch a panic attack from tryna handle the facts
You inanimate on a map
Wait though, I'll never be finished, infinity
Grateful for every opportunity you give to me
And when the time’s right, y’all can lighten up
Like there's too much life to love

I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb

A Long Hello,Fishing Blues,2016,"Let's make a bonfire
I got a blanket in my trunk
One blanket, and we could wrap it around both of us
The lake is beautiful this time of night
I wanna listen to your breath
While I look at the moon
Plus, plus I got you this overpriced iced latte
Look at the stars, check this out

There's far too many breakup songs
And there's not enough songs about the moment we met
A lot of words get spread, the pain, shame, and regret
And I'm not holdin' my breath for any change to the sketch
But I hope to death somebody can sing about
The countless times that we found a way to even out
Even though we were born to work with these hands
It's in the plan for us to learn the insecurity dance
It goes: make a party as the method to prevent it
I'm so sorry you reacted so defensive
If I could lend an unsolicited suggestion
Don't even know if I'd recommend that you paid attention
They told me ""Hell never felt so good""
But I could tell that they only tryna sell some books
""Look, y'all know that I would help if I could""
But I was too busy tryna nail myself to some wood
There's more songs praising the people we went to prison with
Than there are praising the people we make children with
And I ain't saying either one is more legitimate
But it'd be ridiculous to think that it's coincidence
Shit, I'll never be the best at this
I write songs that I'm living in, welcome to my sweatshirt
I think it's magnificent that you're presently present
Thanks for listening, appreciate your effort
Cinderella, fit your hand in the glove
We on a spaceship, crash land from above
We on a lazy river, fly fishing for love
We on a double barrel shotgun, hunting for dove
Life is just a song, I hope that it's long
It starts with ""hello"" and it goes till I die
If I did know it all I'd at least attempt to clarify
Why we try to over-emphasize the goodbyes

We try to over-emphasize the goodbyes
We always over-emphasize the goodbyes
So just pretend this is a long hello
So just pretend this is a long hello
You can pretend this is a long hello",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-a-long-hello-lyrics
Sugar,Fishing Blues,2016,"You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

Tell me, have you ever been addicted to somebody
Still functioning within the melancholy
Baby's mommy got me raw like a zombie
Prolly won't stop until she murder me softly
Vanity is such a popular scene
We could build a family out of the crop of the cream
It's you plus me, we followin' dreams
So why we treat each other like we on the opposite teams, huh?
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
I'm trying to play without my poker face
I put the joker in a shoulder holster
Underneath the floor in a hole
And I'ma save it for a stormy day
And if the clouds break tint
The sun will brush it off like it's all made of lint
Silly you, gimme kiss, never say you never gave me nothing
'Cause you gave me shit

You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so
You're such a sweet thing
You're so mean to me and me and me
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

Sometimes I wonder if you're fucking with my head
Some kinda monster living underneath the bed
But forever I'mma ride with you, one hundred percent
Even when I never fully understand whatever you said
Feels like I'm looking at something, painful
A little illustration of an angel
You're like a tattoo that's on my eyeball
I'm blind from the shine of your halo
Girl, my imagination is the busiest
Why you trying to match wits with an idiot?
Passion is the measuring stick
We qualify, we set the world on fire
Just to burn up all the pretty shit
I promise you, that I'm accountable
Probably trying to prove, our love is possible
Now paint a portrait of complaints
But when it makes a mess, confess the stains

You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so
You're such a sweet thing
You're so mean to me and me and me
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

It must be the devil when I taste her sweat, it's the sweetest
Might forfeit just to reach an agreement
Throw the fight and then I'll hold you tight
Poke a hole in the lid so we don't suffocate and choke tonight
I know I prolly ain't right, but I'm just right
We thug life for the love life
And look at where we took it, but you ain't have to cook it for me
Sugar ain't good for me, sugar ain't

You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so
You're such a sweet thing
You're so mean to me and me and me
You're such a sweet thing

Anybody That I’ve Known,Fishing Blues,2016,"In my past
I’d wish for something different from what's within my grasp
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
As a child
I’d try to find a way to be okay with how I smile
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
Anybody that I've known

Look at my face
So many miles, I can’t complain
I won’t complain, I don’t complain
I might complain, but still told the truth
My water stay running, but my food don’t move
I make a size 12 footprint
Make love to my wife, make music with my real friends
My voice make enough noise for the books
Then I hunt these woods to catch dinner for my children
Got me dreaming I could reach through the phone
And kiss the family goodnight then sleep like a stone
Hotel, motel, feel at home
If you play a little Nina Simone
Don’t quit your day job, this is my day job
It won’t stop a single raindrop
I gotta get money to purchase a space pod
Then fly up to heaven in person and thank God

In my past
I’d wish for something different from what's within my grasp
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
As a child
I’d try to find a way to be okay with how I smile
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known

I'm all about the sarcasm and optimism
I'm kinda like a bumper sticker
Listen, you’re kinda like an artist, you got the vision
Looking at the mirror like it's competition
And it’s always trippin', but you’re not intimidated
We all tryna stay alive and innovative
Everybody aiming at the face of similar limitations
We all cut from the same pavement
If you and I are gonna search through this universe together
First gotta desert the center
Some of us will be mad at the world forever
And some of us don't even curse the weather
Whether or not I gave it everything that I got
It won't stop a single raindrop
But when it finally wash my finger-paints off
I'm tryna make sure it don’t spell my name wrong

In my past
I’d wish for something different from what's within my grasp
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
As a child

No Biggie,Fishing Blues,2016,"She said, ""No biggie""
Territorial enough to try to build a wall around the whole city
Make it pretty with some Deutsch graffiti
Got a ex tattooed underneath the bikini
She was encyclopedia thick
She got a fanbase, everybody speak with a fist
And you can think about her till the heartbeat skips
Make sure you got the name up on the marquee big
I got such a bad feeling
The last time you heard me say that, we were burnt alive
Roadkill on the grill, gas turned up high
Stepped off the patio with the courage to fly
We all wanna find a bridge to the upside
While you pretend to be dead on the inside
Take a photo with the number one loser
Tryin' to get used to livin' in the future
Years ago you were a different you
Attitude of a hot bowl of cat food
Opened it up like, yeah motherfucker so what?
We all grow up, what happened to you, what's the holdup​?
Throw your nose up bourgeois character
Trying to claim careless wearing an air freshener
You blow a lot of stink, I promise
You're not bold enough to take your mask off in the populace
So make believe, you ain't what you claim to be
It's obvious, painfully
Why you wanna play games with me?
I'm nobody act like you ain't plainly see
She only hears so she can hear you cry
I'm trying to cherish life, you're trying to steer on ice
I wanna put my DNA in your American pie
There's no life after death, I'm not ready to die

When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live for as long

Chasing New York,Fishing Blues,2016,"I used to be in love with Brooklyn
Way before I ever got to go to Brooklyn
And I really enjoyed the first time I stayed there
But disappointed about how clean them trains were
Spray paint to debate the claim
But she say ""the fake fur don't taste the same""
But your chips on your church and save your place
But first make sure that that's the ace of spades, huh
You know you got it made in the fade
When the worst case scenario's a big bowl of cereal
I tried to state my case to the stewardess
To let me take the steering wheel, but they don't hear me though
I know that I could fly this bitch
And if the bitch don't fly I'll build a pirate ship
And when the bottle tips, the model hits the ground
But they love you whenever you're around

You know, still got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, grow up just to take up space
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase
Still got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, judge us on the love that we make
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase

But the frame didn't fall when the mirror broke
I can't recall what life was like a year ago
Spit it on the front row, disappear, I'm ghost
Call me Smokey like I'm rolling with some miracles (coals)
I got a yard full of love
It grows like a garden with guards to guard it
Around the same time that this party started
We was on the red carpet with artist access
Shooting down garbage for target practice
Martians living in the margin
Imagine the clean streets and the dirty police
We tryna keep the peace while disturbin' the peace
You know, hitchhike to the mountain's top
To take a picture of the  peak that surrounds your thoughts
And my favorite spot to catch a drink still be down the block
From wherever you sleep

You know, still got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, grow up just to take up space
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase
Still got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, judge us on the love that we make
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase

All these days are numbered
Falling forward, failing upwards
All these roads to Eden
Maps to nowhere, cold to breathe in
All these days are numbered
Falling forward, failing upwards
All these roads to Eden
Maps to nowhere, cold to breathe in
All these days are numbered
Falling forward, failing upwards
All these roads to Eden
Maps to nowhere, cold to breathe in
All these days are numbered

You're just another superstar
Everybody gets to shine at the hotel bar
With the fireflies that fell in the jar
Ain't even trying to get free
Buzzin' around is fine with me
That's why I keep one eye on the clock
The other eye on my drink
Make it link like a lock, the timing is key
Got my hands tied up, still climbing this tree
So can't none judge what my crisis might be
Everything will even out when I finally sleep
Tipsy, dreaming about being a pirate at sea
Huh, I hear the sirens singing for someone else to listen
Got me thinking I avoided a bullet
But a lot of my vision was under blurry conditions
I watched from the top of a volcano of bullshit
Which came first, the thirst or the curse?
Most can't distinguish which one is worse
Bartender in a tuxedo shirt with the sleeves rolled up
'Cause she's seen enough dirt, whatever
Look, I don’t know if the ocean is close but
I'mma keep going til I no longer float
Aight, so quit trying to micromanage my emotions
Keep the glass half full or keep the tab open
Last call for alcohol protocol
The television that's attached to the wall
It show a basketball game with the volume off
And I don't know who's playing but I know I'm not, it goes

I feel like a firefly
I chase all the fireflies
I feel like a firefly
I chase all the fireflies

It doesn't matter what you think, either way it's all relative
The buzzing from the neon lights is like a sedative, I follow it
Into outer space like an Apollo ship
Coasting off the bottom shelf booze and the klonopin
I'm lost, wrote my room number on the fob
Put a dollar in the jukebox, ordered up a shot
Now everything is frozen, just floating flickering dots
As we fade into the night without ever giving it thought
But that's the idea, we don't come for the atmosphere
The food's shitty, the cable's blurred but I'm happy here
We're all alone but ain't nobody keeping tabs there
'Cause misery's a meal that's served better with a glass of beer
Yeah, so fill it up and let me sulk
Smelling like whiskey and complimentary soap
It's the same four bars in every city I go
Surrounded by fireflies just trying to find their glow

I think you've had too much to speak
Give me the keys
, plug the leak

But I wanna do splendid things
I mean I want somebody to remember me
And maybe drive me around in a limousine
I'm just joking, I rather drive myself
Rather fly myself, most time, rather be all by myself
A party of one
And I'll keep going for as long as the arteries pump
Don't start no junk
I'm not a thug but I'm hardly a punk
And if it ain't the hard part of the month
Throw your hands in the sky, sing the harmony once

Got a hiss on the tongue that you just can't trust
I might be a fuck up
And maybe you are too, but I ain't no judge
Run through dirt just to kick up dust
Put a little paint on the tip of the brush
Go ahead breathe with no regrets
Life's too brief to be so upset
Gotta take the lost and plead the fifth
Sometimes the world will make you eat that shit
Gonna jump like a kangaroo, break outta the zoo
Let the universe know that you made it through
Stay true to your name and crew
But watch what you say and who you say it to

Trying to Fly,Frida Kahlo Vs Ezra Pound,2016,"And I don't even know why
I can't hold on to a word that you say
You escaped from your cage
Just to dance and play across a random face, like
Fly away, little horse, fly
'For it finds you on the front page

To say we stay sedated, it's an understatement
Look alive, life is a celebration
We would like to use your current location
Lost faith after the first rotation
And gave it back to the dirt like it wasn't worth saving
And oh, Lord, if I wasn't so bored
I'd already poured this bottle on the floor
Yeah, right, we ain't spilling a drop
About to get so high that we feel like Gods

Even though I know nowadays
I should probably have found a method to count my ways
I'm tryna leave the runway
Confident, I need to go surround myself with sunrays
Life's too short to keep shoveling flakes
I walk into the water till I'm covered in waves
From the first breath till the next laugh
Better have a plan to catch your best half
Never let the lakes break beneath the heavyweight
Gotta spray a little paint on this designated negative space
And I don't even know why
But I'm committed to leaving you with the valid and vivid impression
We could separate the pain from the message
But state of mind still in the state of corrections

Or at least you should line it with a bag
Tie it up to keep the lye bacteria gagged
To a minimal stack, it's a fixable flat
A sideline will get you sidetracked
Put it up if you feel like a blind rat
Just trying to climb out of a wine glass
We under attack but not allowed to fight back, right?
You not about to fight back, right?
We might strike combat if it's time for that
After I take my IQ test on this iPad app
In the iRock on the way to the IHOP
With your high ass

And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right

I'm Herbie Hancock
I rock it
I'm not a prophet
I'm not not for profit, nah
I don't stop, I'm the opposite
I'm on my Spock shit
Trying to live long and prosperous
Excuse me for trying to be modest
But ooey, I feel kinda marvelous
It's obvious that these socks fit
So I'ma stomp around the block
Like the goddamn apocalypse
Preceded by a stampede
Of fire-breathing rhinoceroses
The promise of awesomeness
Not a problem, it's no conflict
Party on the rock bottom in a lake of toxins
And if you ain't starving, then change the topic
Ain't nothing left to say about it
You eating dirt, 'cause you like it
And dirt from the graveyard, you put gravy on it

And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right
And you right

Yeah, go ahead you write it, man
Write what’s, go ahead write

Virgo,Mi Vida Local,2018,"I pledge allegiance to myself
Food, shelter, and health
Let me find a beach full of seashells to sell
Put your oxygen mask on first before you offer me help
I've got receipts made of scar tissue
Got the vision of somebody going fishing in the dark
When I start up the motor, it still turns over
But nowadays, a little bit slower
Never been afraid of getting older
I'm much more nervous about these public servants
Kill the lights and shut the curtains
You ain't a real lion if you love the circus
Looking at myself like, ""What's the purpose?""
That's when I started to hallucinate
Tryna touch the surface and recuperate
You should've seen the look on my face when I was losing my faith
Y'all got me feeling hesitation, embarrassment
I might be the last generation of grandparents
I know that I've been fortunate for all the opportunities
Disproportionately disappointed in the human beings
I get it, we're specks of dust
At the bus stop busking for extra crust
Like fuck it, you can sacrifice me to the weather
If you promise that you'll let my songs live forever

You're looking for a bag of tricks
But my love is like a stack of bricks
Cobblestones and untreated lumber
I'm a father of fists, strength in numbers
And when they come for my box of dreams
I'ma finally depart from this toxic scene
No posturing, just lots of self esteem
Got you feeling like the popular queen
This ain't magic, this is fabric
And it's the type that never requires patches
And it's the fire that illustrates with ashes
It's our life, it's nothing we can't manage
Lower the arrow and take a breath
I won't waste ammo aiming at the angel of death
I might have already left, but they hear me still
With my pale knuckle grip on a steering wheel",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-virgo-lyrics
Delicate,Mi Vida Local,2018,"That little kid in the window's looking out at the winter like:
""This whole world is mine if I can get this bitch to shine""
There's no kind of friction to find
'Cause ain't nobody runnin' towards the same finish line
Looking at the dirty snow in the street make you believe
Everybody must've just adjusted to the grief
Choose what you use to motivate yourself
You can either hate me or you can hate yourself
Can't trust your fears
You spent a whole bunch of years being judged by peers
All you wanted was to touch my ears
And get inside of my head like: ""What the fuck's in here?""
Had to take space from the hazardous waste
Save the rags for acid rain flashbacks
If it can wash off that awful toxic aftertaste
Maybe that can replace all your trash bags
Baby, I don't know, but you're obviously feeling yourself
And that's a beautiful thing, I hope you're real with yourself
'Cause all we got is ourselves and these mouths to feed
And those keys on your belt that held you down on your knees
Whatever dawg, I'm not the underdog
I'm just a side effect of following my thumbs through the fog
I'm outta here, all apologies to your kids
Your whole forest on fire, hollerin' 'bout the bridge
And everybody tryna do they best
But everybody's best didn't take the same piss test
I guess I should expect resentment affects perspective and context
And you've perfected your bomb threats
Yeah, we get high and we gon' die
But either way, those leaves don't lie
And as the seasons go by, more friends say bye
Less luggage makes it easier to fly

And when the trees turn to skeletons, listen
You can hear the bones rattle in the wind
It's a delicate condition
Everything's gotta go if you wanna know what's underneath the skin
We all have the capacity to take it there
But if I'm gonna use gravity to take it there
That's a delicate condition, I'm not in the position
To tell you how you livin'
And when the trees turn to skeletons, listen
You can hear the bones rattle in the wind
It's a delicate condition
Everything's gotta go if you wanna know what's underneath the skin
We all have the capacity to take it there
But if I'm gonna use gravity to take it there
That's a delicate condition, I'm not in the position

Jerome,Mi Vida Local,2018,"I ain't the one
I never was the one, just another son of a son of a gun
Grandpa had the skin of a drum
Ru-ru-run but you can't escape what you came from
Bite your tounge, chew blood like it's gum
Climb aboard the diving board, time gets shorter when a child is born
I'm a quiet storm, but when I'm dry and warm, I take final form until you slice the chord
And make the line go flat on that life support
I gotta make some space so I can reach these stars
My face looks like an old race car, tryin' to put it together before it came apart
And when they lay my parts where my name is carved, they should save my heart in this mason jar
Minnesota, Uber drivers, Google Maps to the universal fibers
You're nobody 'til you stole some lighters, cat burglar disguised as a nervous tiger
We've been to many places but earth is liver
Save it, give me likes and favorites
Everybody's famous, I'ma need a lifetime of patience
Remind me what your name is? You won't find me in the known locations
I'd rather be alone in my beautiful basement, whoo

This on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh
Or we can fight about it after school
Whatever you have to do, I'm cool

When I leave this Earth, feel the after tremors, might see my curse upon the back of the mirrors
Graffiti bridge is all tags and stickers, but we are the children of the action figures
And now we drop like matchsticks, figures
I got too many friends, and I can't keep up with the trends
And I know that I'm supposed to pretend
Like I'm afraid of the day that it's all gonna end
Where the hell have you been?
And how did time get spent, huh?
I gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Stick the neck out like you're stretching it out
The king wears a crown made of clouds
The whole crowd will get loud if you miss this foul
If you don't mind I'ma go mind my business now, whoo

This on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh

But I'm alive
I thought that it was more than a tattoo
Try not to get caught in the classroom
Tomorrow morning while the galaxy is forming
I'ma find a box of stories
Buried in the garden underneath the pouring rain
Never seen the storm before it came
Find the strength to forgive my jinx
Swim the length of the kitchen sink
Freedom of speech don't mean what you think
Hold that thought I'm 'bout to close the ink
Y'all know I never gave a frozen shit
I'm just trying to keep my head above the hopelessness
They wanna blow some kisses at the showmanship
Until they poking at your legacy with broken sticks

Ugh, here we go
I’m trying to be peaceful
Keep on clashing with your ego
No logic or reason when speaking your piece in disagreements tell me what you’re really thinking when you’re drinking or when it gets heated
Say that you don’t mean it I heard that before I don’t believe you listen to people they’ll tell you everything in how they treat you
View kindness as weakness
Say you don’t need me
Hard to let go but I’m leaving
Face what’s right not what is easy
Give the very least, that’s exactly what you’ll receive
What you see’s a reflection of what you think and perceive
Don’t make a promise you can’t keep or keep what needs to be released, repeat the things that you should change your hands ain’t clean can’t point the blame
No, you can’t stay
You can’t just take, reciprocate make an exchange
I’m lighting sage to cleanse the space
Getting that bad energy up off of me
Replace with inner peace
Fools gold you sold exposed enemies with false identities
You’re no friend to me so don’t pretend to be

In a coma, I'm blinking
And in my own mistakes
Lay in my bed and rest, ain't no use in trying
When I'm shocked I won't shoot
Don't know what, they're trying to hurt me
Love me then desert me
Don't give me your mercy

Make It All Better Again,Mi Vida Local,2018,"And ain't nobody seen him around anymore
Ever since she left it's like he doesn't even open the door
He'd rather be by himself anyways
In the comfort of his home and his video games
Until the break of dawn, early in the morning
Alarm clock sounding like Gabrielle's warning
Gotta get yours like there is no wrong way
The worm and the bird both worked a long day
And when he comes home afterwards
He looks back once more at the last chapter's words
To try to reinterpret exactly what he heard
When the universe collapsed and flattened the Earth
Pretend that you don't live in the past with us
Give the kids a reason to laugh at us
His heart's broken, but when he hears a car door closing
It gets him off the hardwood floor hoping

And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
To find a place that we ain't never been
Make it all better again

He so exhausted of mourning his losses
Doing his best just to cope with the process
A grown man can't depend on the promise
Plus you gotta be careful not to be too cautious, right?
Getting dumped ain't the worst that it gets, I guess
You could literally lose your breath
You could die in a fiery car crash underwater
And never understand why somebody doesn't want ya
And every night it's the same routine
Ever since you disappeared he just staring at a screen
A couple beers 'til he's light in the head
And then sleeping on the left side of the bed
Well everybody's waiting on some sort of return
Keep the honesty soft and the priorities firm
And even though you'll never ride a horseback through
He needs something to look forward to
Of course we do

And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
To find a place that we ain't never been
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never
Never never never never never never
Never never never never never never gonna end
Never
Make it all better again

Graffiti,Mi Vida Local,2018,"I wrote this one when I was still alive
Hey you, yeah you, listen
And if I had a horse
To climb up and ride off into the warmth
I'd never turn around
I'd just kick up this dust 'til I find where I'm found
And If I qualified as a genius
Maybe I'd live out my dreams and die dreamless
These voices in my life are all make-believe
Trying to find a way to exploit my choice of pain relief

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me

I'm examining the clouds like I'm looking for a sign
I hope you're having a good time
If you wasn't afraid, would you lie so much?
You got your tail between your legs chasing fire trucks
You can tell I'm not the best at expressing how I felt
That's why I hide it inside the words I spell
I mix the medication, it fixes whatever ails them
And now she treats me like a snake oil salesman, huh
Well, thank you for your vote of confidence
I don't give a shit about how it figures into all your politics
Still believe you gotta make your art, play your part
The world waits for you to break my patient heart
Now let me find a road by the airport
To park and watch the planes arrive and think of what I'm here for
And I ain't tryna kill the vibe, but I'm grateful that you're still alive
Now gimme a high five

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me

And that's what we s'posed to do I guess
Spread love 'til you've used your last breath
No matter what the challenges hold
I was bold because I knew that we could handle the cold
And just in case I don't say this enough
Thanks for the love, I love the way that you love
And I ain't making this up, you put some change in my cup
And then you gave me a hug, it's like you came from above

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-graffiti-lyrics
Stopwatch,Mi Vida Local,2018,"Yes, and I guess, it's just a sign that I'm a pessimist
But life is limited if time is how you measure it
Nobody's innocent
Let's quit pretending such
Just let it finish up so this message can self-destruct
And I don't know my high from low anymore
I'm just trying to do my best
Trying not to get carried off the floor
Climb down the fire escape and throw the mask in the trash
We drowning in a tidal wave from a bath tub splash
And when they finally try to harvest a colony
It's probably when everybody is around an olive tree
It's likely gonna be too late to crown a hero
But we can make a statement making party at Ground Zero
And I can do this to ya all night long
But I, no matter what, I'd still be doing ya wrong
And when I'm strong enough to break out of my eggshell
I wanna hear the ladies yell like I've aged well

We fought ourselves we think we won
We taught ourselves to reach the sun
Took a chance going against the odds
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught

And now I
Now I believe I've got the right of way
To make a brighter day
Instead of wasting life away
Waiting for lights to change
You not seeing me
I'm swallowed by the scenery
Camouflage my injuries
Channel all my energies
I leave room for the lens to shift
Should've predicted or presumed that you'd be sensitive
But every story needs a conflict, and ours is
I can't find a fuck to present you with
And baby it's the same song whole world singing it
Some of us just humming along some of us really bringin' it
And if it fires up a fraction of the sleeping giant
May we live long enough to see the times that redefine it
And I'm certain all that pain is for a purpose
Makes no difference who's the first one to write their name up on the surface
Some day your work will find its way to get observed
It's just there's too many words and nobody's getting heard

We fought ourselves we think we won
We taught ourselves to reach the sun
Took a chance going against the odds
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop

I can't listen if you can't be accountable
I'm not your competition never been your obstacle
You peacocking just to walk a dotted line down the middle
When you talk now you sound like a pillow
I see the daggers in your eyes like javelins
Ain't nothing going on but the smile on the mannequin
I fantasize about a peaceful release date
But that's standard life we all reaching to keep faith
Sometimes I gotta climb inside, start it up and drive
Just to figure out why I'm allowed to be alive
I was overestimating the damage
It ain't supposed to be as average as the picture on the package
Your fireworks got my sensories on high alert
I'm not trying to put my energy inside the worst

I ain't got the wish to waste on a perfect bitch

Another morning in my mirror with my self righteous
Remind myself that you ain't the first that felt like this
However I should've know you'd be putting in work
To make sure my songs are full of those beautiful curse words
And I don't wanna be dramatic about it
I'm the protagonist, I guess I'm automatically 'bout it
I took the batteries out of my back a hell a while ago
Trying to help the smile grow
That's why I'm listening to music just to try to feel human
No introduction necessary, pardon my intrusion
Honestly not interested in whatever you're doin'
Just let me get my ticket for that rocket to the moon then
I don't get bored instead I shut the doors
Until I'm feeling like the ceilings trying to touch the floors

We used to show up at the bar just to start some trouble
Now we got three more mouths to feed
And now we on the couch 'bout to fall asleep, yeah
I'll be the ground underneath your feet but I'mma need you to peel off those mommy jeans
And I don't mean for this to sound obscene
But I wanna push your panties down around your knees
Feeling like I miss you, but I'm living with you
Help me take the garbage out so I can try to kiss you
You forgot that it could get so hot inside of parked car up in the target parking lot
Put me on your calendar and dedicate a little time this month to let me tie you up
You can't imagine how much fun I'm having up in my brain
So meet me at the bathroom it's at the front of the plane

I wanna chase you, catch you, and bite your lips
But I'm afraid to, don't wanna traumatize the kids (nah)
Looking over our shoulders like criminals
All because we tryna give each other stimulus
And we've enjoyed every possible position
But we probably should avoid on the counter in the kitchen (right)
Grandma play with your grandkids, let mom and dad sneak away to lay in these blankets
Lets take advantage of the circumstances
You'd think we tryna murder the mattress

And one of us gotta crawl under the bus
If we wanna stand a chance of standing up without a crutch
And I ain't trying to sound dismissive of that target you've been squinting at
We've all been aiming far beyond our range of limitations
Even when I try to take the bullet I'm impatient
Looking at your face for validation
Fly like dishes but sleep like strangers
Protect my interests, what you think these fangs for?
This isn't even anger
It's just disappointment pointed in familiar directions
This is tight and stressed like a tightrope stretched
Across my whole chest, this is why I'm flexing
Please forgive my voice but I'm lost in the void
When I look to the future neither one of us enjoying it
We ought to stop and start smelling these flowers
Before the world reminds us that it's not really ours

Both of us are running from experiences
Frustrated today, nitpicking tomorrow
Sittin' in a sorrow, sippin' from a bottle
Where do we go wrong, why do we prolong
I wanna grab my hat and throw my coat on
We sleep in different beds, we're taking different meds
This relationship is so Night of the Living Dead
I know it's morbid, but there's the mortgage, there's the storage
There's the four kids, I will not forfeit
Whatever, we can make it under pressure
We're both bad with money, we spent the college fund together

Puddles of rain reflected the stop lights
The world fell asleep, but I'm wide awake
Listening to traffic on the highway, from half a mile away
I'm looking up in my family, kaleidoscope
I'm trying to float with some harmony, hit some higher notes
And I don't know if I'm supposed to cover your eyes
But I chose to hold your hand and watch the sun rise
Live within the gift
Recognize the warnings
Memorize the answers
This is a recording
I love you to the moon and back
There's nothing new 'bout that
It's just a proven fact
And somewhere my dad is listening to the engine purr
Someday I'm gonna finish my verse
I inherited that free-refills-type thirst
I'm counting on my children to break this curse
It goes

I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'mma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth
I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'mma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth

It's funny right
Our only reason that we're trying to find this money is to buy us some time
Rise and shine, I gotta weigh these fish
To educate my kids, on how to bait they lines
I wonder if this is how the aliens felt
Just 'cause the hate theyself, don't mean they change theyself, nah
Still chasing after gratification, at this point I ain't even know what that would take
Don't make a mess in your drawers just to get some applause
You don't wanna be the bullet that your ex has dodged (haha)
Another bumper sticker, but it's enough to consider not to jump in the river
I can play the xylophone out of a pile of bones
But sometimes can't even find the stones to dial your phone
I built a whole kingdom out of styrofoam
And you can have it when I'm gone

I don't know how much time we have left

You complain but you're still in the soaking rain
Hoping that she'll come and open up the drain
The years go by you grow that grain
Until you try to find a bowling lane where somebody knows your name
I wish it was as simple as a sitcom, from the eighties
I wanna crack jokes and raise babies
With a laugh track and ""aww"" for shit that the kids do
""Oohs"" and whistles every time that I kiss you
Girl, I wanna call the front desk and tell them everything's messed up
The whole world's messed up
But then I remember I've got a home I can go to
Come here, let me hold you

I wanna show you what I've got in my mind
But I'm afraid of what you might not find
I guess I'm paranoid that it ain't worth your time
(Specificity)
Ooh, I don't know what the hell to do
But if I'm welcome to tell the truth
I guess I wanna put a spell on you

Randy Mosh,Mi Vida Local,2018,"As the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance
I ask you to witness what revenge is
Moving mountains and inches
The business is resistance
Powerful as we evolve
Get involved, we can get it all
Altogether we could get it solved
Bosses that'll pay the cost

You gotta try now
Waiting on the morning light
This is what you want in life?
You gotta shout now
Sleeping all morning 
Is that what you want in life?

Hot Juba, black Buddha, smoother than Luther
Out of the womb ruthless, deliver with no toola
Rougher than loofas, clueless and ruthless considered nuisance
Barren and fruitless, no power, a cup juiceless
I aspire to inspire given devil's fire
A sin higher, make profit like Jeremiah
Turn the mercury to gold to extract worth
And my circumference trying to tell me it's a flat Earth
Elegant aggression, glamorous suppression
Ballad of the bullet, immaculate conception
Innercity slums seeking galaxy connections
Trying to follow God, hollow like a faulty log
Han Solo in the Jedi, I'm unthawed
Hyper-vigilant and militant, en garde
Unscathed, slaves free while they unchained
Life's a maze, fiends live in concaves

I would send you back to the bowels you're born from
I raised a glass when you swallowed your forked tongue
I recognize your counterfeit confidence
Got me convinced that the crime is the consequence
You're a derivative of bullshit, literal
Unoriginal, that's why you're miserable
We had to pick up the pieces, it wasn't difficult
I guess you didn't know, your impact was minimal
The opposite of opportunism
Your costume is so transparent, now you're virtually invisible
There's no such thing as a typical individual
There's nothing left except ""fuck you"" on principle
Seventh of September, still running the temperature
Smoking like an ember, drinking like an amateur
Tripping like your grandpa at the strip club without his pills
Make it rain two dollar bills

Yo, peep the piece of scum, you conceded to become
Competing with me is dumb, seed it deep inside the trunk
You must be drinking cum, 'cuz you talk a lot like a cunt
Get punched and knocked out in the crosswalk right in the front
Your existence is food for my machismo
When I push up on a fool, he's stuck on freeze mode
That ain't a full quip, riding on the Jean-Paul
I ain't got no attitude, I just got a mean soul
Everybody else telling me I needed to grow
Shut your pharmaceutical ass up, and put that weed in the bowl
Got some cancer cells to kill, now the answer from hell
So pass the bill fast, 'cuz I over pressurize my master seal
Don't over glamorize a man to kill
Don't let 'em grow up, thinking he has to actually blast to steal
And make sure they know there's more to life than just some rap skill
It's like decades later emcees get trapped still

Power to the people
Don't let a coward lead you
Can't preach to you if they don't know how to feed you
I burnt the haystack and found the needle
Then proceed to, invest the water, cows, and diesel
And sour diesel, wholesale banana trucks
Hotels in Panama, no dope sales, we're manning up
Unplug the cord, debug the store
We love the lord, but keep getting drug into war
What's the gun for? If all we're doing is talking
What are you doing marching when all of these humans starving?
The diamond's like, shine a light, they got it right
Or, we can set it off like dynamite
The balance is found, Los Angeles bound
In a van full of cannabis pounds
We came back to stick our flag in the ground
If you're down, put your damn hands to the clouds

You gotta try now
Waiting on the morning light
This is what you want in life?
You gotta shout now
Sleeping all morning 
Is that what you want in life?

As the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance
I ask you to witness what revenge is

Sleeping On The Bright Side,Mi Vida Local,2018,"The snow's deep I can't wait for the spring
I go to sleep to try to change up the scene
I'm overeating, still running on steam
I know I'm drinking just to numb the dream
I'm sitting in the courtyard lit like the north star
I'm trying to figure out where yours are
The bonfire kept your hair out my face
While we was staring up at space asking Jesus for a raise
But of course now you're gone
You've got me looking forward, towards a new dawn
I got a look up more words to forge a few songs
So I can cook some d'orderves for my boys and they mom
But the chase stays driving me craze
And I'm supposed to embrace it like, ""Thanks""
And I shouldn't waste time complaining
'Cuz I'm alive and I'm inside from out of the raining
It goes

And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as I can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side

I know I'm wrong, but sometimes
I know I'm right as well
Might as well let you know, right now I'm as right as the time
I'm the opposite of left, all the opposition left
It's just a song, but sometimes
It's just a song that helps
Might as well make a sketch
Write it down, used to write all the time
I see you from the other side of the shine

And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as i can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side

Do you remember when I slowed it down?
I was trying to make it last like the letter zed
And I'll admit that in the back of my severed head
I'm asking if she'd rather be sleeping up in a seperate bed
She's the magnifying glass between the sun and the fuse
She matched every single hue of blue
She was eleven eleven, I was a catch 22
Make a wish, but wait until i'm sleeping next to you, huh
And I can go my whole life without another love
But can't go a full night without fucking up
Are you serious?
The sky fell, I'm still walking on shells trying to protect myself
And each time that lightning strikes
You said I look so lifelike
But that's like it looks like
Somebody brought some sunshine to a gun fight
Come find me on the bright side

And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as I can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side

It's the middle 2 of a four bar, watch
Skip the first bar
Hit the second bar
Grab the third bar
Move off of the fourth
Skip the first bar
Hit the second bar
And the third bar
Lose on the four
Lose on the four
Come on
I skip the first bar
Grab the second bar
Hit the third bar
Now I'm fuckin' drunk
Flip the first bar
Grab the second bar
Hit the third bar
Lose it on the four
Lose it on the four

Lovely,Whenever,2019,"Lovely

Have I told you I'm so impatient?
What I meant is there's no escaping
I practiced my smile, laughing and singing
Protect you in between the span of my wings and
Heard y'all was flying to Mars, but
I think maybe y'all trying too hard, huh
I used to feel like a weirdo
'Cause it was so difficult to be cheerful and
We trying to reach and explore
In case I can locate some supportive resources
Afford us the breath of existence before
Metamorphosis is more than just metaphor for next
I was watching my son play piano and
Thinkin' 'bout how we survived that avalanche
Lookin' down at these shoes that I'm standin' in
I might be happy, this might be happenin'

All this love and all is lovely
Feels so good, can't take shit from me, I mean
All our days, no storms, just sunny
It's sweet like honey, it's sweet, lovely

When I told you that a sad song was simple
What I meant was, the parts sound familiar
In the dark, watch you dance with your shadow
Loneliness feel like it's sharp enough to kill you
But even when you got somebody to build with
Won't automatically promise it's solid
Keeping my feet planted firm in my footprint
Learning to look through the clouds when they crowd it
When the thunder hits louder than hunger
Start running for cover, cut off and block numbers
I honestly wonder if I'm just trapped under the
Thumb of the weather or whatever's up there
Trying to use all my colors to paint with
I flew up to space just to find isolation
So I'll be the starlight that started tonight
Gotta love myself, so I can love you right, right?

All this love and all is lovely
Feels so good, can't take shit from me, I mean
All our days, no storms, just sunny
It's sweet like honey, it's sweet, lovely

Jeg ved at når jeg dør, så sker der ingenting
For ligesom at jeg ikke eksisterede før jeg blev født, så kommer jeg heller ikke til at eksistere når jeg er død
Og jeg ved at det betyder at jeg hverken kommer til at tænke eller føle noget, når jeg først er død
Og det er selvfølgelig en ret deprimerende tanke at have, men jeg har heller ikke lyst til at leve mit liv og lades som om der er noget som jeg godt ved der ikke er
Og slet ikke når det kommer til døden
Så på nogen måde så føler jeg mig egentlig lidt heldig fordi jeg er så bevidst om hvad det er jeg har i mit liv, og hvad jeg så ikke har når jeg er død
Fordi så behøver jeg ikke gå og måle livet på langs og vente på hvad der er for enden, fordi det ved jeg godt
Og i stedet for så kan jeg holde mit fokus på hvad det er jeg vil have ud af det, mens jeg har det",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-lovely-lyrics
Postal Lady,Whenever,2019,"I wipe the crust from the corner of my eye
I walk towards the kitchen and pour myself a coffee
I'll prolly step on a Lego just to verify
That I'm still alive and y'all ain't killed me already
Daddy loves you, I say what's up to the baby
Like, ""What's up, baby?"" You're such a baby, huh
And then I find the other kids and give 'em all high fives
Say good mornin' to my wife, it's a glorious life, right?
(Meow) I put some food in the cat's bowl
That way the cat doesn't think I'm an asshole
And put some Cheerios in the Sean bowl
Mixin' in the Golden Grahams for the combo
The sun kinda sneaks in slow
Like melting gold, it's like lava when it starts to flow
Even when it's cold outside
And the whole south side's still covered with snow
But this is a beautiful, summery kind of bright-color
Coloring book, good vibes and good looks
Got me lookin' out the window from the front of the house
I put my foot on my knee when I took a seat on the couch
Wakin' up my phone so I can watch the clock
Like there's a countdown, but there's not now
And usual you're punctual like a nail
I see the government vehicle, here comes the mail
And the package that's arrivin', it's not mine
It's some shit that my wife ordered online
Like if the sun burns out and civilization stopped
My doorstep still catches more cardboard boxes
It's a problem, this ain't the time to address it, though
I'm not tryna look like a mid-life mess, but, yo
Here she comes now, no words, no smilin'
Just hands me my mail and walks towards the horizon

Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go postal lady
You make my own day a little bit brighter
You got me hopin' that my signature's required
Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go postal lady
I'll never stop you or pester you
But I appreciate the fact you're not another sweaty dude
Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go postal lady
You're kinda like a unicorn
The only one to ever really deliver it in that uniform (Cringe)
Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go postal lady
She come rain, sleet or snow
What the hell is sleet? Yo, I don't even know

На самом деле я не знаю, хорошо это или плохо — испытывать эмоции, потому что часто из-за эмоций мы поступаем неправильно, это влияет на наши отношения с другими людьми и на наши поступки. Иногда мне кажется, что я бы не хотела чувствовать вообще ничего, потому что мы постоянно выливаем негатив на самых близких людей и... они страдают для нас",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-postal-lady-lyrics

I'm looking at that lake like I'm waiting to break
Into your traffic
Yeah, it's overly dramatic, but it only takes one bad trip
To leave you holier than magic
I'm all alone, I feel it all in my bones
It's probably why I'm not going home
I'm sitting in the passenger seat of my own car
I don't know where my keys are, sipping on a warm
Lone Stars in the sky don't sponsor my house
That's why I pay no mind to what comes out of they mouth
I stopped pretending like I knew what to do
And let the universe push the needle into the groove
It's no substitute for the love of the truth
So who the fuck am I to be a judge for you, huh?
I fall back and let the chips descend
Go 'head, call me back when you miss your friends
And maybe later we can talk about the weather
Pick a day and we can try to get together
Bring along whatever tool you use to measure
How the temperature reacts to your temper
And lick a shot for the messenger, it's not a mess if ya
Control the stress, never let it get the best of ya
Shit, it's easier said than done
If we can't get free, might as well get dumb
Just keep it rolling and document the whole thing
As if it ain't too late, already seen where it's going
I shape shift to make it fit in any opening
That halo's gonna stay debatable until I grow some wings
You're not supposed to need a boulevard of broken dreams
To build the will to fill your bag up with some groceries
I want that middle of the lake serenity
That's why I stay alive inside your energy

Before I threw away the keys

And if I was your lover
Would you let yourself suffer?
Should you ever have to give another second thought
To whether or not you could discover somethin' better off?
But if it turns out I was the right one
Would you return to work this out like, ""Hi, Sean""?
I should remind you, I'm just one fish
There's an ocean full, you could take your pick
And don't forget to take some pics and if I'm just a Band-Aid
Would it be considered bad taste
If we should decide to let the ship set sail?
It could be the destination that's destined to fail
And if I was a poor choice
When I made noise, would you hear me in your voice?
Should we be concerned about the future of
Or do you think that we can turn this into some mutual love?

Would we still have this amazing sex?
Should we try to wake up and make some pancakes?
Could we find a way to combine our campaigns?
If this was just a friendship
How would that be any different?
Should you be instigatin' my decision makin'
If it couldn't compliment the experience that you're chasin'?
I gotta know if it's just a phase
Would you put away the maze?
I should get paid to feel this crazy
We could both raise the argument we both deserve a little change
And if it's all the same to y'all
Would you please step aside and let me take this fall?
Should you still feel like you've got a case to prove
You could tell everybody I'm afraid of you (Huh)

Your mama say that I be rappin' in my dad voice
Defense mech to protect me from the fuck toys
Joysticks, see me swerve through these asteroids
Life is good, V.G. plus
But, yo, I still got that hunger to hold a box cutter
Let me carve my name in your security blanket
I'm sleepin' on a train on a sweat-stained mattress
I'm not expectin' company, hit the floor
If death comes for me somebody gotta get the door
You might choke on a sucker from the liquor store
We might get so high we don't exist no more
I'm like smoke, I'm supposed to rise

Spit flame just to keep the matches lit
They say I'm half insane, the other half immaculate, could you imagine it?
Whatever, I don't like to shoot 'cause I'm just way too accurate
When they be at you they don't ever at you, that's the wackest shit
And ain't too many bitches that can hang or even match my wits
I mean, I've had it up to here, I'm talkin' Atmosphere
'Cause I don't even talk to them, they say I'm too cavalier
I'm like your greatest livin' fear when I twist the gears
Gimme props, I ain't have to drop a bitch in several years
I look at OGs as my only peers
So let me know when you done playin' in the snow, the slopes for real skiers
I'm droppin' real tears from laughin' at you weirdos
Drag you lil'— by your earlobes
Number one stunner, stone cold, below zero
Too dope, I'ma need more than one kilo

Oral Krylon, I spray all my style on
Mind brighter than them orange end zone pylons
Two hands from the zebra man

I pack the stands with my stanzas

Fans raise they hands but they ain't got the answers
No performance enhancers
Six rings, piss clean, I ain't takin' no chances
Who else could dance with the devil?
Samba with the mamba, Macarena with ya mama
Fuck a double entendre
Put it plain 'til I leave this plane, I'm a problem

Quick witted, sharp tongue, I don't mince words
Plentiful supply, use strife as my cistern
Take it in stride but describe it uncensored
Wadin' through the pain, love, lies and adventure
Gotta ensure the time spent wisely
Pops' tenure didn't outlast the Isley's
Walk soft, big stick and a slight lean
Kept the Nikes clean when nights got unsightly
Last real hitter alive, bitch, I might be
Death swarmin', head forward, kept forgin'
Never fret or let 'em see me sweat when I was left for it
Records reflect what I rep once it get sorted
Duckin' twelve with bench warrants to gettin' bread tourin'

But caught between your soft lips
Good morning, a clear blue sky
But by the time the storm arrived it was like a category five
You know we had to keep the story all the way live
And though I never meant to draw any blood
I wasn't innocent, I had a little dirt in my eye
And I would drown in a flood just to cover my mud
And I ain't saying that we not genuine
I'm just looking at the product you're peddling
I stopped following the mess you kept stepping in
I got my own problems to wrestle with

I'm not a victim, I'm not a victor
I'm trying eavesdrop when the cosmos whisper

I don't where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go
I don't where you're gonna go

And I don't recollect if I detected the warnings
The sex was rewarding, the fights got boring
It might sound corny but you a freak for control
It seemed likely the right time for me to get old
I knew you that were still feeling me but knew
You probably willingly fantasized about killing me, too
So tell me what the hell did you expect me to do?
That's why I never said bye and never checked in with you
It never connected that you'd eventually find me
Nothing that suggested you'd even come looking
But I guess I should be flattered, and if I could stand up
It wouldn't even help free myself from these handcuffs
There's probably not a lot left to say

Like you never done before, 
who's that lady

Mini apple pie, you can hear the doves cry

Let's dance and celebrate modern love
We could shout and let it all out
But what happened in the past is not what this is about
You've came a long way and it's good to see
But here's an S.O.S., just be good to me
And I'll be good to you, we can look to do
Some things like get together and cook some food
To clarify, I'm not shy or an introvert

Made me wanna play guitar, but I gotta play it off
'Cause I can't play a lick, but I play it off slick

We litty like Mork and Mindy 
drivin' through Erotic City (Skrrt)
In the bubble Lex ES, left on 94 West
Time to flex, got me crushin' on you like The Jets
And I don't care where we go, just take me with you
Reservations at The Lexington, table for two
I feel blessed to be in the presence of so much excellence
All this estrogen got me flexin' again
I wanna be your lover, my future baby mother
Let's see you play up a number
Run up a check, ball out and run game on each other
Your luxurious appearance got me curious, I'm serious
Every time you call my phone I get delirious

She said, ""We still haven't liberated Mumia""

She synced up the Bluetooth to play Aaliyah
I made myself a drink, tastes like pruno sangria
Nice to meet ya, knock on wood
I said, ""I'm sorry, that my English is not so good""
She said, ""It sounds like you're fishin' for compassion""
I said, ""You're dressed like an assassin""
And it's true, though, she kinda looked like Trinity
It's kinda cool, though, reminds me of Italy

In Rome, didn't even leave the airport
And that ain't even the important part
But somethin' started warmin' up her broken heart

She opened up a roll of quarters into a tube sock
All of y'all are poseurs, go and kick some moon rocks
I might be the droid that they lookin' for
Or I might be the boy you mistook me for
I might float across the ocean on a horse back
Just to get closer to your outdated format
I might be the gecko from Geico
Got the white women celebratin' Cinco de Mayo
They finished off a whole fifth of mayo
I grabbed the queso, flew away like an angel

Like, open the window, I'm 'bout to leap to my faith
For real, I feel depleted
An ocean full of weeds, emotional fatigue
And maybe if I had a bag of money
I could be the crash test dummy, quietly standin' for somethin'
I would love to get as fly as them
But I fell overboard, now I'm trying to swim
I'm still learnin' but the water is burnin'
And the world keeps turnin' like it's not concerned, and

I can't believe I used to love you
You don't believe I used to love you
But who you gonna run to?
What happened to the people that you once knew
I'm like, hold up
You lookin' at me like I'm supposed to know what to do
But when I see you come around
All I think about now is how I don't fuck with you

And even if I had a way to say to you how much I miss your kiss
And even on a perfect day, I behave like I'm nervous of the risk
And even when I'm confident the consequence'll cost another wish
And even when it's obvious we're probably just lost in the abyss

I'm trying to breath my way through it
Sink into the waves, let 'em move me, stay fluid
So many voices and inflections
Multiple choices and different directions
And even if I had the opportunity
I don't qualify to speak on behalf of the community
And I don't even know who that would be anymore
I lost track of the tracks, I stopped keepin' the score
Or maybe I've been puttin' up my own walls
I don't return your phone calls
Got me floatin' and bobbin' on top this pond
Full of problems we bought from these dishonest spokesmen
I kinda hope we turn it all into ash
I don't wanna have to adapt to the aftermath
The tolerance is as powerful as the pain
You'd probably never know my name if you've never heard me complain

I can't believe I used to love you
You don't believe I used to love you
But who you gonna run to?
What happened to the people that you once knew
I'm like, hold up
You lookin' at me like I'm supposed to know what to do
But when I see you come around
All I think about now is how I don't fuck with you

And even if I had a way to say to you how much I miss your kiss
And even on a perfect day, I behave like I'm nervous of the risk
And even when I'm confident the consequence'll cost another wish
And even when it's obvious we're probably just lost in the abyss",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-son-of-abyss-lyrics
The Hands of Time,Whenever,2019,"The hands of time
Are slowing down this old heart of mine
The hands of time
Are slowing down this old heart of mine

I used to be assertive
But now I'm just exhausted
I used to wanna burn shit
But now it all feels force-fed
Yeah, I've got a fuckin' headache
I've had enough of all the heartache
I wanna get away, sing about the better days
It's all shade when you're fallin' through that dark space
I didn't know my story'd ever get told
I thought that I would disappear into a cold black hole
No oxygen, no control over the pressure
And no mess left after I implode
And I suppose all the confidence grows
When the shovel breaks ground and success starts to show, yeah
It's no way it won't affect the ego
So keep the injury clean and protect your emo
I'm tryna find a buried treasure
I don't got the time to carry any extra
Don't ever register the efforts of a heckler
Unless you can exploit it for your own agenda, right?
Jumped off of the top rope
And I landed at Bob Hope
Hopped in the cargo and drove to the racetrack
The player had a trailer in the back just to take a nap
I came to rap and break free from the cage
Don't ever misinterpret nothin' 'bout what keeps me engaged
I'm tryna act my age, I'm tryna lose some weight
I'm tryna face what I'm afraid of just to prove that it's fake
Then I'm out, but hold up, before we head to the exits
Let's get these bread sticks and dead this death wish
And even if we lose everything we've collected
They could never remove all of the lives we've connected (Ooh-ooh)

Push Play,Whenever,2019,"So special, it's so stressful
And no rest for the devil on a weekday
And I'll remember the first time I met you
I wasn't really punk rock, just a cheapskate
Go to sleep to the waves on the freeway
Wake up wasted, ain't nobody tryna see straight
Lookin' at me like I drove up in a pumpkin
But climbed inside like you're tryna find somethin'
If we lucky enough to get drunk and fall in love
Maybe decades later we could be arguin' for nothin'
The parts fit like a puzzle and all of a sudden
She let me put a couple Slugs in the oven
I put a ring around Saturn on a Saturday
Valentine's, so I took you on a valid date
Starin' up at the stars above a frozen lake
Maybe the stars are ghosts, it's hard to say
Either way the Milky way doesn't even feel far away
With your lips on my face and a car full of mixtapes

Just push play, don't even ask
Runnin' around in Minneap' like it's the whole map
From the bottom of the rock to the top of the trash
They tried to blow, but couldn't copy my jazz
And I'm tryna slow it down, soften the crash
But when I'm gone, I hope the last sound I heard was your laugh
The vanity plates say ""Love Life""
But the look on your face say ""Uptight""
I'm upright 'cause I ain't supposed to crawl
And then I, I held breath and dove into the fall
I'm not waitin' on death to write my name on the wall
I'd rather swim through the flood with a chain and a ball
The background took the shock of the tremor
Put the sad clown flag down, but not to surrender
I accept the challenge, got me lookin' at the mirror
Like, ""I hear ya crystal clear, you're still here""
I'ma play my position 'til the end of existence
I made this new playlist, give it a listen",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-push-play-lyrics
The Ceiling,Whenever,2019,"Transmitting live from the cusp of extinction
Look you in the eyes like, ""Fuck was you thinking?""
I'm kinda feeling like there's nothing left to defend
But if we keep it Franklin, that's just another weekend
I guess karma really gives you what you paid for
'Cause AmeriKKKa got blood in her carburetor
I'm in the mountains hiding out from the park rangers
Something 'bout putting a slug in your heart chamber
If I ain't the one that wrote it, then I quoted it
Ipso facto, I overlooked your ownership
Kicked that back door to open it, broke it in
Hit those bad notes and drove it like I chauffeured it
S'posed to get me on a guest list, but I'm skeptical
In my profession don't nobody act professional
Decided I'd arrive a little bit ahead of schedule
And started up a heavy metal band with the devil, it goes

I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling
But I been working my whole life
I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling
But I been working my whole life

And it's a viking ship, there's no breakfast
And it's the life we live, it's so precious, yeah
And don't pretend that you was over our heads if
You know you never meant for us to catch those references
(Right?) And just so I can understand
Nobody in command'll willingly give up their upper hand
Unless suddenly their gun is jammed
And you pry it from their motherfucking hands (Right?)
And I been working my whole life afraid of the clock
And I know that ain't right 'cause I can't make it stop
Gotta show up and finish the shift
The baby told me being present is a gift
And maybe that's why you refuse to fall asleep
Probably keep it moving 'til the heart stops respondin' to the beat
But my brain's still self-conscious
Like I coulda cut my losses if I would've acknowledged I was exhausted

'Cause I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling
But I been working my whole life
I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling
But I been working my whole life

And I dunno if this is how it's supposed to feel
How will I know if this is how it's supposed to feel?
And I dunno if this is how it's supposed to feel
How will I know if this is how it's supposed to feel?
 
Ey, du?
Hvordan kommer du deg ut av buret ditt da?
Prøver du å rømme, eller?
Ja, hvor er det du skal dra hen da?
Du kommer deg ikke noe lengre
Det rommet her e'kke noe bedre enn et bur, det er bare større

Minnesota Nice,"News, Unreleased & B-Sides Vol.5",UnKnown,"I don’t wanna be
I service you with a smirk (I smirk)
I don’t wanna be
Shoo you away like a fly (shoo fly)
I don’t wanna be
You might be bad but I’m worse (I'm so worse)
I don’t wanna be
They call me ""Minnesota Nice""
I don’t wanna be

I’m staying phresh to death mother fucker, check the kicks
Pimpin' 101 homes, what the lesson is
Man you’re real ugly, and she's worse
Who wants to volunteer to leave, me first
Smelling like a platypus
Feeling like a hippo
See the girls scream soon as I step out the limo
And just because we shared the same mic don't mean you're nice either
Really any shirt can be a wife beater
There go Prof flexin' on 'em again
Follow couple gorgeous women an I'll holla 'em in
Haul um/take um to the dollar store, the bar with the friends
She'll be calling again, you can call it a win
All I do is do it, flossing in my Buick
Prof get the club bug like, Ole, do it!
I grab a couple of bars, I’m living with the fist full
Everybody all together now, blow the whistle

It’s official, I’ve been made aware of the ratio
Now all I care about is gears and fellatio
The soul of a man’s career on your Casio
Control your battle drones and fly you off the patio
Everybody wants money off the microphone
So they can just cronie, and drop a Viper on some chrome
But I’m the classiest beast of the trashiest
My planet exists in the streets of Minneapolis
And I’m the catalyst for world class lyricism
Be glad your chick is blastin' this in her system
She loves that rock hard rhythm presentation
Fallen rap stars used to crash in her basement
This year the flash dated six point five
Head shots up here; we’re making this joint live
And affect once again my man
Now show some respect and shake gentleman’s hand

Ahhh, I’m like a breath of fresh air
Sexy muhfucka with the long-ass hair
I didn’t mean to be tasteless
Just thought I take a second to explain my greatness
I’m an example of how to step your game up
Aim up, when I'm out hunting you lame ducks
Ride through my hood entertaining your sister
Bass bumping old school, solo pair of Kickers
I’m trying to tell it like it T.I. is
I hope you catchin' on, what you know 'bout this
I’m so bad, like a single parent mommy with her hair all did
But her kids is looking sloppy
You can’t stop me, broke the breaks on this Chevy
Moving fast, try to catch the homie Sep Sevy
It’s getting heavy, hit the gym to get my weight up
It’s bigger than your block homeboi so throw your state up

Came up the hard way and put my name up
Now why would anybody wanna hate Slug
Straight up, your fake heart pumps snake blood
Fuck you and the space you take up
My eyes are red cause of life and death
I'll put my feet up on the table where they slice the bread
Boast and brag till my toe gets tagged
Old man swag with a grocery bag
I go one for the road, two for the encore
Couple more make you feel like you’re holding down floor
You ain’t a whore cause they make money
You’re just a bum with somebody’s DNA on your tummy
Ask your peers bout Atmosphere
Went to hell and got a souvenir rap career
Now I walk into the place with the grace of a John Deere
And then your face got weird",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-minnesota-nice-lyrics
Shhh,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I wanted to make a song about where I'm from
You know
Big up my home town, my territory, my state
But I couldn't figure out much to brag about
Prince lives here, we got 10,000 lakes
But wait the women are beautiful, to me they are
And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars
And it hit me man, Minnesota is dope
If only simply for not what we have but what we don't
It's all fair, it ain't out there, it's in there
It's in the mirror, behind the breast under the hair
Follow the dream doesn't mean leave the love
Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough
I love New York and Cali, but I ain't moving
Too overpopulated, saturated with humans
And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models
If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago
None of this is to diss no one, nowhere
Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air
Too many mosquitoes and our fair share of egos
But like my man Sabe says, that's where my mommy stays

So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell them where you live
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you know this is where you want to raise your kids
Say shhh, say shhh
If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where
Say shhh, say shhh
If you can drink tap water and breathe the air
Say shhh, say shhh

Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay
The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space
The women outnumber the men two to one
Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son
The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay
I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day
And the jobs ain't really too hard to find
In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme
This is for everyone around the planet
That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they standing
Don't take it for granted, instead take a look around
Quit complaining and build something on that ground
Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground
Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around
That ground Make a family, make magic, make a mess
Take the stress, feel your motivation and build your nest
It sucks that you think where I'm from is wack
But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back
And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said
I beg your pardon but this is my secret garden

All right
In the land of ice and snow
Well okay
In the land of ice and snow
Well all right
In the land of ice and snow
Well okay
Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis

If the playground is clear of stems and syringes
Say shhh, say shhh
If there's only one store in your town that sells 12-inches
Say shhh, say shhh
If no one in your crew walks around with a gun
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you ain't gonna leave cause this is where you're from

Wooden Ships,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The shock value shook me off
Adrenaline like a rookie cop
Can I turn the siren on, please
Never before have I been so secure with my reactionary inability
And she's killin' me again
It's the same old tale
I've been murdered a million times
Some how I keep coming back to life
Same mountain, I continue to climb
And I'm not as confused as I am considerate
Back and forth between my cigarette and her clitoris
I'm workin' on both like it's nobody's business
Such an odd way to gain god's forgiveness
And all of my friends believe I should forgive myself
They insist that I've done nothing wrong
But I'm not convinced 'till I finish every bottle on the shelf
And I've run out of reasons to write my songs
And all of her friends think I'm holdin' her back
It's beautiful, but they don't know the half
They're barely aware of a fraction
Blinded by dramatics
Ignoring all the passion

Wooden ships, on the water
Rescue me

The clash of the titans
To balance the excitement
Challenge the enlightenment
And flash my vice grips
Maintenance man, keepin' faith in my plan
If it's possible, I'll fix it
And if not, then I'll kick it
There was a time I would follow wind into a storm
And all I wanted was for someone to keep me warm
But now I'm torn by my tolerance
I fight with my head
I don't need to pollinate a flower that's dead
And everyone I've built, I watched wilt
And everyone that has built me is killin' me
And as much as I love her
Neither one of us should suffer
So I'm a glue both the wings back on and watch her flutter
Go fly butterfly
Don't cry shut your eyes
Gonna watch each other die
Before we give it another try
Hover little hummingbird
Dart through the sky
I've been under the thumb
It's no wonder I'm still shy
Hunger, onward, with my desires
Learned the hard way not to play with fire
From a comfortable distance, I'll admire
Because I got to take a break
I'm exhausted, I'm tired
Hunger, onward, with my desires
Learned the hard way not to play with fire

Looking like he spent the night getting hosed up
Smoke a butt, lit it off the stove and rush your focus up
When they breaking bread they never broke enough
Just another day of waiting for tomorrow
Situations got him pacing at the crossroads
Staccato
Face full of nostrils
Heart beating like you getting chased on that cop show
He's sick of getting cut short on the stick again
They sittin' pretty, but won't let the business in
Projectin' bricks of aggression
Protect your section, don't covet the next man's
I know you frustrated, must hate it
Maybe stuck in the ditch when the revolution's updated
Some make it and get upgraded
Every little prick wanna fuck Lady Luck butt-naked
That's why I overreact
Like you opened your lap and gave birth to a swarm of rats
Somebody should have warned your ass:
Its worse to crash than to run outta gas

Forever stuck like a tattoo

 Go check your gut and snap-to

Boar's head helmet,
 long in the tooth
I walk a three-headed dog, I call him ""Duck, Duck, Goose""
Ooze through the cookie isle hands down marvelous
Possibly escorting hundred-handers outta Tartarus
Man's damp claws stack adorable cash
And flip a cardboard crown like a spork in the mash
Stone-walling
Two knees knock on a tucked tail
Swan song wrong, flower-topped thumbnails
Pop the mop one hotel robe and a Plymouth duster
Eighty sixed from his given infrastructure
Beard to his feet that filter his Hail Mary's
In the company of cartoon stars and canaries
Kid Schroeder
, 
ivories picked over
Parts marched out to sea on sick shoulders
Broadcast images of 3D art littering the diagonal arrow on your bleeding heart sticker
People of Earth, we are not as we are seeming
The radio is on but the dialogue isn't breathing
That's why my people drive along leaning
Back into the fires that forged the whole evening, speeding
 Go real
 Cruisers get excited on the turnpike
 No meal
 Ticket, no brakes, no birthright
 Don't feel
 Nothing. Sleep days, work nights
 So deal
 And stay the fuck outta the search lights

No meal
Don't feel

F*@K You Lucy,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Leave never would you, you show could i if

She said that she still wants a friendship
She can't live her life without me as a friend
I can't figure out why i'd give a damn to what she wants
I dont understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like
Is about you and how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you, I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what I showed you, how you could leave it
A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent
If I stay around, I'm bound to break resistance
Fuck you, Lucy, for defining my existence
Fuck you and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad with a part time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother, I digested her pain
And vowed no woman on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And I travel with feels so I can deal with touch
Its like that, thank you very much, fuck you very much
Yes
Yes it is
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Yes it is
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Fuck the what happened, I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck, used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I wanna stand on top of this mountain and yell
I wanna wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star fighter is wounded time to give it up
On a pick it up mission, kept it bitter
Getting in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keeping emotions controlled
Cookies for the road, took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder
Interpret the eyes, read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?
Fuck you, Lucy, for leaving me
Fuck you, Lucy, for not needing me
I wanna say fuck you, because I still love you
No, I'm not okay, and I don't know what to do
Yes
Yes it is
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Yes
Yes it is
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Do I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed
Every action has a point, five points make a fist
You close 'em, you swing 'em, it hurts when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits
I got an idea: You should get a tattoo that says warning
Thats all, just a warning
So the potential victim can take a left and save breath
And avoid you, sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream, ""Fuck you, Lucy""
But the problem is I love you, Lucy
So instead I'ma finish my drink, and have another
While you think about how you used to be my lover
(fuck you)
Yes
Yes it is
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Somebody said times are tough; bills piling up
You still trying but, you ask ""Why the fuck?""
Couldn't drown - all the water's all dryin' up
You can medicate and never make it high enough
Try to breathe easy and relax
But you put another baby in your old lady's basket
Good job, God bless, Congrats
It also means you gotta get some extra cash
Come on, you know there's no such thing
You see no upswing no matter what you bring
Or how much you get, y'all buried in debt
Check to check and y'all barely get fed
Worried, desperate, certainly depressing
Somebody said that adversity's a blessing
Do your best to dance with the stress
Someday we'll be dead with time to rest
It goes


It's not apathetic when it's that pathetic
Revolution is broke, it got the bad credit
We can't burn the suburban developments
When the unleaded accelerants is too expensive
I can't focus until I catch a buzz
So hopeless, we need some better drugs
Puppeteer all up in the guts
As if a stomach full of blood just wasn't enough
A lot of obstacles, we ain't stopping though
The species grows even when it seems impossible
Free your head from the lies they spread
Cause you won't get the truth 'til everybody's dead


We built an army out of blue hearts
Pills and poisons and used parts
And we're so afraid of death
We stopped saving our souls so we could save our breath
Someday soon gonna get what's due
Gotta rent that room with the better view
And I ain't checking out 'til I'm ready to
Let me through and I'll stand next to you
I'm in your car, I'm on your laptop
I was there when you lost your wife and your last job
Blue-collar raps for you to holler at
Touch the heavens before Earth calls you back
You gotta take that appointment
You won't escape it, you can't avoid it
So I'mma make noise and try to enjoy it

S: Here's to the Newfie cuties, come and get me
E: And here's to the hometown hoodies in the twin city
S: Here's to my man Nool and his drunk friend Andrew

Here's to the good times, and the good rhymes
And every cat that shook my hand after I took his or he took mine
I put life in the mic - for what that's worth
Plus I turned out to be the type that always wants the last word
There ain't no pieces to a dream on my keychain
But I got the secrets of the ages, on the papers in my briefcase
And if I could see straight, I'd of drove myself home
And if you really was a B-boy you'd have a cell-phone
I seen my share of war, mess em' of their royalty
Watch the soldiers jump off the dock to test their buoyancy
Took a drink from the gauntlet and passed it left
And waited for the master of the class to catch they breath
Oh wow, now you got freestyles for days, right?
But a lot of cats that got flows can't write a song to save they life
And I can't figure out, what you're talking about
Try to do it - after you take your man's unit out your mouth

You tryna get paid, now that I understand
Cause if a man's to have a family then he has to have a plan
And I'll be damned if I do, and I'll be done if I don't
Still I keep my heart tucked under a thick winter coat

From this day on, I'll never be fooled by a fool
Always be cool with the rules, and never eat food by the pool
See, I'm not here for the amusement of you
I stare right through with a clue
And appear as the student's of who? No one
I asked Mr Notebook ""do you care if I doodle for two minutes?""
I knew that he knew and he didn't refuse cause he's true
I neutered a few, went to the moon with a flute
Flew on a broom into the future and came back with a pair of shoes and a crew
Drew a blueprint of a new computer - super human
And opened my eyes and noticed that I was alone in my room on a stool
Yeah - I'm a loser. (Yeah, I'm a loser..) So why don't you kill me?
My tooth hurts - and due to your blood squirts my school shirts are filthy
Skills seep from a closed mouth - quilts keep the cold out
The hills steep - Let's roll south
Until we can prove worth, to the whole house cause really
My soul's mouth is ill see
It can move words, at, oh about two/thirds light speed
Silly, Mic's bleed, Fancy amounts of glow in the dark kool-aid
Which was the gas to drive over the hump of my flow and it starts today
You say life sucks, so you refuse to touch tomorrow
Read my bumper sticker, it says ""death is better cause it sucks and swallows""

S: Here's to the kids that don't need me to tell them how to live
E: And here's to one's that have it all and still find it in the heart to give
S: Here's to my peeps that know to look before they leap
E: And here's to the lyrics and beats that makes life complete
S: Here's to all my folks that don't let life kill they hopes
E: Here's to the man with the mic in his hand that walked away with a sore throat

S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Yeah, Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me

Fear,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Into my brain)
Something sinister sits in the corner
Ignore it if you want, but remember that we warned you
There in the basement, behind the furnace
Eating off all of your fears so I can flourish
Puts the shook in your bones
Making all my noise when your parents ain't home
And if the bulbs burnt out in my underground lair
Guarantee you're gonna sprint back up them stairs
Step by step by, let me get by
It's all in your mind, you do it every time
The dark you're scared, is anybody there?
Try to stay strong, pray for help
Well you can bring that fear, I survive on it
I thrive on it, I'm alive as you allow
When I climb out of your mind, to eat your time
You can redeem your fear now
And all the white girls sing along
Into my brain (repeated)
You can hear me growl, you can smell it fowl
But as hard as you try you'll never see me prowl
You can feel my touch to the heart and spine
Some have all the luck all the time
Fear that I might take your life
Fear that I might fuck your wife
When you hear a gun, you hear my voice
When you hear a crash, you hear my voice
That tingle on the back of your skull
Cut the edge off insanity, the blade is dull
They gave their all, but I took a little more
Cause I made a promise that I would win this war
Cause I made a promise, I'm fear motherfucker
Cause I made a promise, I'm here motherfucker
The bams, the booms, the bumps in the night
When it's on, it's on
And all the white girls sing along
Into my brain (repeated)
Get over it, get over me
You're the one that left me my opening
Forgot to put the lid down tight to the truth
So I climbed out and set myself loose
The only thing to fear, is fear itself
 (I'll kill you)
Love, money, God and health (I'll spill you)
Where do you put your trust (I'll kill you my damn self)
Is it within or is it with us?
Is it breath or is death?
What in the name of God do you run from
Run for, run to someone, done for
Sit still and take it like the bitch you are
You can fight and resist, you won't get too far
You made me, all the power you gave me
Cultivate the hatred and fed it to the babies
Spent lifetimes pretending I'm a kook, but I'm a product of you
Now all the women sing along
Into my brain (repeated)",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-fear-lyrics
Love,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm moving in this place, I struggle everyday
Sometimes easy, sometimes hard
Now I know what it's all about, I have no where to hide
Living with strangers, back to bases, learning how to survive
Now I maybe know how to
Stand by me
Chorus:
Cause I feel alive, knowing what I feel inside
I just speak my mind, tell me bout the human inside
If you know what I mean, then you know what I'm up to
I say what I feel, then I'm in control this time
The fellowship that we have, will last for a long, long time
Together we have so much fun
It's a party everyday, the happiness will stay
So turn on you tv, I know you can see me, I'm giving you my life
Now I maybe know how to
Stand by me

Standing on the Edge,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I turn in my head
Rolling round and round in my bed
Eyes closed deep breaths
Heavy heart is reaching for rest
A ghost a past life
It grows deep inside
Scared of what might happen
Closer to the edge I go
Further from the truth I know
I’m standing on the edge
Looking for a place to go
Pull me in again don’t fall
I’m standing on the edge
I roll with the punch
I might be drinking too much
I reach for your touch
Try to remember
A ghost a past life
It grows deep inside
Scared of what might happen
Closer to the edge I go
Further from the truth I know
I’m standing on the edge
Looking for a place to go
Pull me in again don’t fall
I’m standing on the edge
Was I so weak from the start
Gravity pulls me apart
Standing on the edge
Gonna turn this all around
Stop myself from looking down
Standing on the edge
I roll with the punch
I might be drinking too much",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-standing-on-the-edge-lyrics
Who’s That Cat ?,UnKnown,UnKnown,"And a one and a two and a three and a four and
Who's that cat sitting in the back corner with his face buried in his notebook
Who's that kid who can use one hand to count every meal this month that was home cooked
As ugly as i am how is it that i manage to avoid sleeping in my own bed
Twenty-nine years old brain works like a motor so the diagnoses is bone dead
And he used to climb tree's and throw snow balls it was never a chore to endure
Don't know who's voice that it was that I heard but it told me to go search for a cure
So now I move with the ease of the breeze in the race to cross last place
Who's that cat sitting in the back corner with his heart laying in an ash tray
On the go where I go only god knows
Maybe I can see if I got rid of these obstacles, wiping down the residue with a paper towel
Screamin at the world from a stage tryin to wake the crowd
Make it loud, turn it up and drop off, shed a tear for every single sock that got lost
I gotta stop watch that tells a lot of lies, finish your drink first, and than we got apotheosized
Creepiest belief's smashed them with an ax on a quest to figure out the best route to relax
Went on a vacation, move over I'm back now, better believe the chief how quickly he sat down
And in the background, the soundtrack was caution
Woke up found himself lost in Texas, called the thirty-five up in the tele and meet me god
Don't even know what to tell me, so tell me?
Who's that cat sittin in the back corner with his face buried in a girlfriend
Who's that kid who wants to use one hand to count the days left until this world ends
As ugly as I am how is it that I manage to avoid sleeping in my own bed
Twenty-nine years old brain works like at motor so the diagnoses is bone dead
And he used to ride a bike down the street with a boombox strapped to the back of the seat
Don't know who's voice I ignored I don't care anymore I'd rather stare at my feet
So as I move with the ease of the breeze in the race to cross last place
Who's that cat sittin in the back corner, with his heart laying in an ash tray
She asks where iv been, I says iv been nowhere, no fare
She can read my mind, don't even go there, I gotta cold stare I pull out for such occasions
Focus on the path, when I have no destination
Respiration, need to keep the breath steady, desperation, tryin to read the benefits of Betty
Test my patience, yes in DDR automatic, exclamation point valid, drama addict
I got a bad case of the goods, I spent a lot of fucking time in these woods
I guarantee I would change your life, if I could but could not, your having a hard enough time trying to be understood
Stompin in my boots and my blind fold, what iv given do back to me nine fold
Times are cold, and all of my rhymes are old, but I'm binded by my soul to make something they could hold
Who's that cat sittin in the back corner with his face buried in his notebook
Who's that kid that can use one hand, to count every meal this month that was home cooked
As ugly as I am, how is that I manage to avoid sleeping in my own bed
Twenty-nine years old, brain works like a motor, so the diagnoses is bone dead
And he used to climb trees and throw snowballs, it was never a chore to endure
Don't no who's voice, that it was that I heard, but it told me to go search for a cure

Pour Me Another (another Poor Me),UnKnown,UnKnown,"All she wanted was a little bit of solid
Feels like love, it doesn't matter what you call it
Heal those cuts or hide 'em underneath the polish
Break another promise and take me as a hostage
Hold your job down and let the zombies crowd around
Thankin' mommy's God that it's a cop's town
Keep it safe for me while I chase a fantasy
Swervin' through the galaxy, searchin' for a family
Happily surrounded by planets and stars
She was stuck uptown while you was landin' on mars
It's all fucked up now, caught your hand in the jar
Another small step back for the man at the bar
Spill a little bit of blood on the street
For the love that goes to those who they drink too much
And hold your own glass up to the heavens
Take a little time and try to count the seconds
It goes: Pour me another so I could forget you now
Pour me another so I could come let you down
Pour me another so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you, now
Pour me another so I could forget you now
Pour me another so I could come let you down
Pour me another so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you, now
Drink it all away, numb it down to none
Stay awake tonight and wait for the sun
You say you hate your life, you ain't the only one
Let your frustration out the gate and watch the pony run
One double, for the hunger and the struggle
Two for the fool tryin' to pull apart the puzzle
Three now I smile while I wait for your rebuttle
By the fourth shot, I'm just another child in a bubble
Tryin' to play with the passion and the placement
Just to see what these people let him get away with
Still tryin' to climb a mountain for you
Hammer in my hand, still poundin' on a screw
She don't listen so he don't speak no more
Nobody's winning 'cause neither is keeping score
Don't wanna think no more, just let me drink some more
Pour me another, 'cause I can still see the floor
Pour me another so I could forget you now
Pour me another so I could come let you down
Pour me another so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you, now
Pour me another so I could forget you now
Pour me another so I could come let you down
Pour me another so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you, now
Live life tipsy, still if it don't fit right with me
Kiss my whiskey, lift my lips, press to my angel
Swallow it and leave her empty bottle on the table
Let the past fall, making faces at that clock on the back wall
Countdown to the last call, ask all these people that make sounds
How long does it take for the pace to break down
Another lonely little trophy
If only I could walk a straight line, I'd make it home free
And everybody in this bar thinks they know me
And my story like poor me
I can count the days 'til you come back
Or I can follow them sun rays down to the train tracks
I can stumble drunk over hope and love
Or I could keep drinkin' until I sober up
Pour me another so I could forget you now
Pour me another so I could come let you down
Pour me another so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you, now
Pour me another so I could forget you now
Pour me another so I could come let you down
Pour me another so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you, now
Bottles and pints, and shots and cans
Couches and floors and drunk best friends
Models and whores and tattooed hands
Cities and secrets and cats and vans
Good times, laughter, bad decisions
Strippers and actors and average musicians
Mornings after and walks of shame
The bartender knows me by my real name, sing it",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-pour-me-another-another-poor-me-lyrics
Cashier in a Convenience Store,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(slug arguing with himself)
Get up man, wake up
What time is it man?
Yo, its late
What time is it?
Don't worry about it, it's late
Fuck man, this dirty motherfuckers gonna yell at at me again?
Just go, just go
Im sick of this job man
Don't forget your keys
I should call in sick, no no, I should call in dead
Dude you need this job
Never have to see this place again
What are you talking about?
Slug can't come in hes dead
Dude you need this job, dude
Late for work (fuck)
Wearing a wrinkled shirt (fuck)
Id love to set this place on fire
Let the sprinkles work
Then thatd be me getting fired
Instead ill get stoned
Arrive late
And pretend that im tired
Do you need a book of matches with those?
Would you like a bag?
Thank you, have a nice day, i hope you fuckers gag
I pity the fool that pays twice the price for our shit
They could save cash and take their lazy ass to the super market
Theres that chick from last month
Remember the one that couldn't figure out
Which side to pump her gas from
Shes coming in, ive got a grin
Cause tonights the night
Yo toots, my nametag might be crooked
But your looking alright
We all pulling a hard days labor
Gas, milk, soda, bread, porno mags, and newspapers
Back here got the condoms
Over the counter drugs
Listerine for the drunks, robotusin for the gutter punks
And everyday i look into that mirror
Im trying to see myself a little bit clearer
I never notice any progress
Although ill be here again to look tomorrow
Im just a cashier in a convience store
Selling cigarettes and beer between cleaning floors
Ive seen it all without leaving this counter place
People, freaks, demons and creatures from outer space
And everyday i show up and sell you your soul
We both inch a little closer to where we're trying to go
You only land for a moment then resume the race
People, freaks, demons and creatures from outer space
And ive got your pass to paradise
You can escape all these other parasites
With just one buck, a little luck, you might, yah right
I suggest you go home and check your ferinhiet
You ain't gonna get rich
Your stuck here just like me
The only difference is your drug is the lottery
The lotto got your mind sometimes your ass down
Use your fingernails to scratch off 3 of a kind
And ive got your pass to paradise
And id love to ask you babe wheres your life
Wonder how you can be so high and still be scared of heights
But i stop cause the customers always right (ya right)
Must take a lunch break before i snap on the next cat
That doesnt know what they need
Gimmie a cigarette, a poison apple, i dont care
Id be happy to just go outside and choke on the seeds
Im just a cashier in a convience store
Selling cigarettes and beer between cleaning floors
Ive seen it all without leaving this counter place
People, freaks, demons and creatures from outer space
And everyday i show up and sell you your soul
We both inch a little closer to where we're trying to go
You only land for a moment then resume the race
People, freaks, demons and creatures from outer space
Seems like everything happens on the retail night shift
Been robbed, had fights, caught fools trying to shop lift
One time some kid got shot in the parking lot
And the cops only come to surround the coffee pot
After bars close, freaks come out the wood work
All drunk and dumb, trying to play their game
Takes patience to deal with iniebriated jerks
But i smile cause theyre the easiest ones to short change
The runners trade me dime bags for squares
The crack heads offer blow jobs for beers
I watch the clock in my head tick tock so slow
And wait for the time to get the fuck out of here
White collar, blue collar, dont care, gimmie a dollar
Either way its all the same for only seven something an hour
Your all a bunch of monsters, you live in hell
Just waiting for these products to go on sale
The best customers are the ones thats just passing through
Asking for directions, gassing up with fuel
I swear to god some day im gonna live that way
With no one to answer to and no more dues to pay
I hate you but i love you
Dont know what i think of you
I can't seem to shake you from my life
Just pay me and save me
Before you drive me crazy
Dont know if i can take another night",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-cashier-in-a-convenience-store-lyrics
Say Shhh,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Such a pleasure to come home
Cause I...I have a very special love for this city
Well all right, well okay (x3)
Well all right (x3)
I wanted to make a song about where I'm from
You know? Big up my home town, my territory, my state
But, I couldn't figure out much to brag about
Prince lives here, we got 10,000 lakes
But wait, the women are beautiful, to me they are
And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars
And it hit me, Minnesota is dope
If only simply for not what we have but what we don't
It's all fair, it ain't out there, it's in there
It's in the mirror, behind the breast under the hair
Follow the dream doesn't mean leave the love
Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough
I love New York and Cali, but I ain't movin'
Too overpopulated saturated with humans
And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models
If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago
None of this is to diss no one, nowhere
Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air
Too many mosquitoes and our fair share of egos
But like my man Sabe says, that's where my mommy stays
(Chorus:)
So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell em where you live
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you know this is where you wanna raise your kids
Say shhh, say shhh
If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where
Say shhh, say shhh
If you can drink tap water and breathe the air
Say shhh, say shhh
Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay
The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space
The women outnumber the men two to one
Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son
The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay
I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day
And the jobs ain't really too hard to find
In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme
This is for everyone around the planet
That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they standin'
Don't take it for granted, instead take a look around
Quit complaining and build something on that ground
Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground
Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around
That ground Make a family, make magic, make a mess
Take the stress, feel your motivation and build your nest
It sucks that you think where I'm from is wack
But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back
And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said
""I beg your pardon but this is my secret garden""
All right
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well okay
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well all right
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well okay
(Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
(Repeat Chorus)
If the playground is clear of stems and syringes
Say shhh, say shhh
If there's only one store in your town that sells 12-inches
Say shhh, say shhh
If no one in your crew walks around with a gun
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you ain't gonna leave cause this is where you're from
Say shhh, say shhh

Snapshot,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Stare through your little square and focus
Ready, set, action, flash, capture the moment
This ain't life, it's more like a composition
The dirt'll make 'em look, the funk'll make 'em wanna listen
Working to make a living to make it work
Still distracted by the accidents, Adidas and the skirts
It all hurts so good, couldn't believe we took the time to scream
Get the fuck off the stage, bitch, we need the wood!
Hey love, that's the signal, take a breath
Put your gun to my head, put my soul between your breasts
Pull the trigger, bust a shot, watch the life go soft
Left for dead (?), wipe it off on the tablecloth
Have another drink for all the blood and ink that's spilled
Covering up the blueprint for what they think they've built
And look at all the dirt on these pale hands
You're damn right I make love to my female fans
Exhibit A for the way they wish that they could live it
Maybe on some other day I'll find a place to take a minute
Caught somewhere between a laptop and the jackpot
Now say cheese, living in a snapshot

Do you even know
What you look at?
Let me breathe and grow
Until I'm put back
I won't bring no wrong
Let me sit here
I'll just sing my song
Take your picture

The day is like a drumbeat, doesn't feel complete
If some drama doesn't come along to interrupt the sunbeams
Someone said that it's a wonderful life
And if you disagree then someone isn't fucking you right
Attractive is the head but the expression looks dead
Let's blame it on the music, the movies, and the books read
I'm just a cynic but I believe what the cook said
The main ingredient for most beef is bread
Shed the skin, come join the caper
Point it at your neighbor, take the coins and paper
Won't settle for less than a purpose
Hold your breath until this picture is perfect


Do you even know
What you look at?
Let me breathe and grow
Until I'm put back
I won't bring no wrong
Let me sit here
I'll just sing my song
Take your picture

From Lucy Ford to Lucifer to Larry Flynt
She said ""Fuck America! but god bless the Americans""
Staring at the female, spare me all the details
It may kill me but it won't bury me in retail
That little light can't eliminate the red (?)
I don't fight I just inebriate the head
And sing about the monster, write songs for her
I'll keep doing wrong until I'm drawn and quartered
Take what you can from this still life
And wear a smile on your grill like it feels right
Look at me, look at she, look at he
Booka B break it down so I can hear myself see
When Armageddon comes it'll be a videogame
These kids'll know the codes and they'll stop it in a week
Someone'll find the drums everyone overlooked
Sample it, chop it, flip it and drop it to the beat
From the space that I take, to the way that I talk
Might make you stop to wonder what rock I came from under
But which face you g'on make, coach, player, or mascot?
Yea, hold that pose, living in a snapshot

Do you even know
What you look at?
Let me breathe and grow
Until I'm put back
I won't bring no wrong
Let me sit here
I'll just sing my song

Smart Went Crazy (clean version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Smart went crazy, truth went trendy
The story got lazy so I rewrote the ending
Manipulated the entry, more user friendly
Now a city full of pain pills and tattoos defend me
I waver from the dead to the half dead
Grey space between the fan base and the crackhead
Sunset, sailboat set course for hell
A cross and a hammer, but you'll have to get some nails
Take credit, for anything embedded in the edit
As long as you meant it when you said it
And all of the kids laugh, when you admit that
It mighta been witchcraft that made my noose fit bad
Well I'ma act like I don't give a make love
Take what I got to teach everyone to break stuff
I'ma act like there's poison in the pancakes
And amputate the one that wasn't loyal with the handshakes
Proud to know ya, Minnesota missile
Never sold coke and I never had to hold a pistol
Civil and simple, but set the freak show
Loose on the nipple, watch her whole fucking titty ripple
It's why we battle, it's why we travel
It's why the mascot thinks that I'm an asshole
We made the team without putting on a uniform
Smart went nuts and rode a unicorn through the storm
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, where did you go now?
Smart went crazy, kiss Ms. Daisy
Loved you when everyday was Christmas, baby
Maybe we can take it back to the way we was
Still on some ""what have you done for me lately""
No gravy if the base is porkface
Tour dates ate my big little brother's court case
Poor taste got passed up as gourmet
This beer is foreplay, we'll meet up at your place
I sting like a first divorce, or them first Newports
Whatever hurts you more
""You're headed for self destruction"" been there, did that
Kick back with the wrong angel to fuck with
Carve my charm into your arms
Fuck around, unravel this tall ball of yarn
Snuck round back to disarm the alarm
From the plantation to the reservation to the farms
And nobody knows where you'll end up
Only guarantee in life is death or a headfuck
Yeah, you thought it was a set up, well guess what
Now, you you can catch up with the rest of my ""Best Of""
I got a few blocks left before I reach my destination
And retrieve my breath
And god blessed every step I stole
Just to let me know, she wouldn't ever let me go
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, where did you go now?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?

Maybe conjure up a storm of locusts
Or maybe cockroaches
Or a gang of angry bees
Some type of plague or disease
It's all the same to me
Of everyone I know, I like you the least
I've lost all respect I could have ever carried (Gone)
Now I curse your name when it's mentioned
I'd shoot you in your face if I thought it would relieve the tension
When I see, you my temper's temperment just sky rockets
I wanna grab a pipe wrench and put a dent in your eye socket
Pry apart your jaws, pull out all your teeth
Shove a funnel in ya, fill you up with ammonia and bleach
Gotta get a grip, can't let you effect me like this
But I'm pissed, you're at the top of my shit list
I wish you'd slit your wrist and kiss an electric fence
So the means can finally justify the ends
I stare at you in contempt, you look at me the same
Won't be content till I forget your fucking name
Here I am once again, high out of my mind
Staring at the Bathroom mirror screaming ""Die motherfucker die""",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-die-motherfucker-die-lyrics
Paint The Canvas Brown,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Analysis, canvas, cover up
Irrelevence, call me bastard, run 'em up
Just one drag short, of a bad cough
Please fill up my glass, so I could blast off
I've hit the jackpot, to often to count
I'm a pro, you could tell by the way that I mount
I'm not as young as I look or as lonely as I act
And I'm the only one here that ain't holdin' me pack
Everyone's friendly, 'till the dugout's empty
So she's looking for god at the 7th street entry
I'm honest depressed so she's got two hits of exstacy
And right now we really need a referee
The boys with baseball caps like to hear me speak
They relate to me, their trouble looks like mine
The women however they like to watch me fall
They like to watch me stumble, I do it all the time
Just one more, reverberated night
I'm a keep practicin', until I get it right
Continue to swim through whoever, whatever
Let the Earth turn 'till I learn to control the weather
Starving, trying to feel important
Hardly, well let me get my point across
Farming, gonna grow my portions
I'm guarding, keep 'em from the greedy goblins
Heart string, they play me like a game
Bombarding, flatter me and come home
My darling, don't even know my real name
The bar scene, designated me a low life
Barring, between love and the truth
Starting to die, always in a rush
Sardine, packed me deep into the groove
Parking is easy when you ride the bus
Yo, carving, my name into the tree
Alarming, let 'em know that I'm there
I'm parting my hair like I part the seas
I'm barking my words into the atmosphere
Marketing, everyone come on down to the party, we're gonna have a good time
Charting, spin my record round
I'm starving, I'm trying to eat my rhymes
Babylon ain't the far of move for them
Babylon and them got somethin' to prove
But when the battles on them not know what to do
You better move baby, you better move
Caught within the corner of the eye of the beholder
Supporters metaphorically massage from neck to shoulder
But the missiles with the messages
The man at the war with every issue that encompasses the plan of the soldier
I like to hold my breath when I attempt to talk to the cousin that debts the men
I could walk all along ledge in ten and fallin' off without one cent, no sense
Tell all my people I got sucked under a needle
And it's less about the evil than it is about the ego
More low, no high, tryin' to fly like an eagle
How many folks can fit into a Volkswagen Beetle
He sleeps on a bench under a blanket, that doesn't charge him rent
He'd like to thank you for the time and thought you spent regardin' anger
He knows it's hardly meant, you didn't mean it
And she's learnin' to pronounce all the daddy's holy doubts
More bounce to the ounce
A mouthful of how did the clown make the magic, make the rabbit make the sound
Pull it down, paint the whole canvas brown",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-paint-the-canvas-brown-lyrics
Life Sucks Die,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Die for the plight, die just to fight,  i’m dying to grab the mic, dying to see the light, die for love or hate, die to escape, die for the high, just die, you’re gonna die...
Junkies get high and junkies die and most of y’all probably won’t know me until I OD, believe what they told me, hate what they sold me, kept the complaints in my head to dull the edge.  Flag from the inbred , And left them all for dead, peddled my Haro up Mount Kilimanjaro, swallowed the sorrow can’t breathe until tomorrow, borrowed the best of and burned all the check stubs
Joe Cocker nailed it when he said you can leave your hat on, now everything goes out to those that passed on, that’s wrong that’s right that’s whack, that’s tight, personnel took the Duracell‘s out of my flashlight, site the way with the ideas of others, can’t follow the voices until I hear my brothers ,Catch me in the alleyway behind the hardware store huffing, most of us die for nothing, you’re gonna die
Die for that bitch and die for what you did, could die from the cops, die for the props, die for the earth, die behind your words, an eye for an eye, just die
No the equivalency of my ignorance be, that canyon labeled as grand, so I’m not taking a stand or making demands or shaking your hand, nor escaping the man with the masonic plans
It’s super unleaded in bedded within my head trips, kept it in check with the skeptics and the dead wits, when it festers, infects, it fills up with fluid, applied the pressure, bursts satisfied the thirst, drink to the pain, you’re all hurting for the answer, it’s simple and plain, you’re all gonna die from cancer. We all try to make the process faster,I need relief, because we all want to lie down in the pasture. (Peace), the asthma regulates your breath control, so thanks for buying the tapes and eat your vegetables, and let it go if you ain’t trying to change it, keep the hate sacred, and die kid die
Die with vigor cry me a river die for the people die in the sequel die in your youth and die for the truth you’re gonna die for those lies just die you’re gonna die
Twenty20 site so I’ve got no excuse my soul has broken loose from overuse who will hold the news while I make certain it fits me judgment first impressions somewhat shifting but 50 paces passed this place is the waystation filled with familiar faces the taste of the predecessor was much stronger and the lines that you’re sucking off the mirror is getting longer
Each one a try to teach one when it begun, struggling for freedom trying to build a kingdom,  now you’re sipping on Seagrams trying to fix a threesome between you your girl in that bitch with the Nissan ,  wheels keep spinning Excelerator Styx sugar up your coffee and cellophane your dick, Lace the Spliff,  but measure the dosage right , cuz’ life’s a bitch... and Imma hold it tight.  Cuz’  life’s a bitch...and imma hold it tight

Princess Spoken Word (Slug),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Shes a formal princess
From the moment she wakes up to reach her face
All the way to when she lays to asleep, in space
She creeps through life
The energy she uses exclusively
To keep all of these people in their place
If only she would understand them
If she understood, how good, or am
Maybe, find the root of the problem
With a plan, is it plausible
Can't be the princess, carries the pride
Of a diety, sexy little goddess
Fashionably modest, obviously falsified, honestly doubtless
Lotus, of course ive noticed the imaginary roses
Made it impossible not to focus
Hopeless, ill never get my point across that bay
Hopeless, tried and denied at least once a day

My man you do not know the boundaries
Your circumference got sketchy in the center when you found me
From around these parts regardless of where these parts is
I start shit cause thats where my heart is
I've been dubbed the design never intended for the weak mind
I transit pass that cheap line responsible for ur confidence
Brainwash hence since you grabbed the mic all i can hear is rinse cycles
Clean your lint screen, keep your low balance, keep your low balance
You've got no talent therefore, you are no challenge

You get stuck between my dentures when you feel me enter

Another Knight,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Could have been a princess, crown out of thorns
Pretty little summer dress, fabric is torn
You got my interest and when i see you
I wanna free you, bring you
Out of everything, trouble in your life
But its your kingdom, and im just another knight x2
She fell asleep in the passengers seat
So we turned up the music, hit the automatic unlock
Tapped the gas, took the corner too fast
Put her ass out and left her on that black top
You know that dream you have when youre falling
But you always wake up before you hit the ground
It was like that, except her body went smack
Took a minute to figure out what just went down
So she stood up, she brushed herself off
She hurt, but nothing felt broke
She gave a little laugh because gods a comedian
Always surrounding her with all these jokes
She looked around, she knew where she was
Walked a few blocks and hopped on a bus
Went back to that street that they nicknamed hell
To go manifest a couple more stories to tell
And i still can't figure out why she ain't figured out
A better way for her to use that cute little mouth
Between the jons and the jakes
How long will it take for her to clean her front lawn of these snakes
Anyone of us could have loved her
Anyone of us could have been her father or her older brother
Hold her, until she discovers the light
Besides the one at the end of a tunnel, another knight
Could have been a princess, crown out of thorns
Pretty little summer dress, fabric is torn
You got my interest and when i see you
I wanna free you, bring you
Out of everything, trouble in your life
But its your kingdom, and im just another knight x2",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-another-knight-lyrics
Just For Show (Single),UnKnown,UnKnown,"So what you saying, I hear complains*
I could repeat every statement you made verbatim
I treated you better back in the day and
Now you feeling like I'm changing, like I'm not the same man
I used to force your heart rate to run a race
And now it's safe to say that it's running out of patience
Frustration, you want some separation?
You want no placement within this mess I'm making?
I'm painfully aware of my mistakes
And maybe you should break an escape from the situation
Or take a little taste of the blame
Then instead you still full of hate telling me get out your face, yeah
You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show
You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show
Now you wanna threaten me, is that what you're telling me?
Like if i don't step it up, what you gonna step from me?
Where you gonna go? You next to me steadily
At this point it's like I'm joined with your chemistry
Guess that it just wasn't meant to be our destiny
It's upsetting, see, I gave you the best of me
All my friends are like just let her leave, huh
So go ahead and pretend that I set you free, what?
You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show
You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show
Alright already, now you make this headache pound
I ain't trying to mess around, you ain't allowed to get me down
It's no sweat at all na I won't stress about
Anything projected out of your passive agressive mouth
Let it out, if we walking on a separate ground
Go ahead and step off with all of those brand new friends you found
Hit the town, you'll be back for a second round
If you was gonna leave me you would have already left me now",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-just-for-show-single-lyrics
Watch Out (clean version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"One little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpack, watch 'em all...
It goes watch out!
Jack the Ripper, Jack Jack the Ripper
Peace to Jack Tripper and those well stoned bumper stickers
My name is Sean and I never had dreadlocks
Instead I got an army full of women screaming Headshots!
I guess that explains it, don't it
She started to make a mark but it came apart
That's what you get for tryin' to make your little sister eat the kitty litter
Let's watch a rapper get bitter like the city winter
What the fuck you thinkin'!?
You frustrated or something? Did you have a bad week?
Man, you got issues, I feel sorry for you
Yo, shitting on me is so 2002, Bitch!
Turn your mic off, and turn the lights off
Whoever put your record out must have needed write-offs
Who they play when the game's in a tight spot?
Slug, you can find me in the A's of your iPod
Watch out!
When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out!
When you open up your mouth
I can smell that you don't know what you're talking about(It goes)
Watch out!
We all love a clown
But we don't wanna se you climb up out the underground
Watch out!
If you don't like the sound
Fuck you! I'm just tryin' to put it down for my home town
Cars drive by with the booming system
I must be getting old cause the bass sounds ridiculous
And nowadays, every body's biting 2Pac
So fuck it, I'ma stand over here and do the moonwalk
Besides police, I've got no beef
Just me, my beliefs and my bad teeth
A cargo van and some Ant beets
Enough rap to slap you to last week
Caught between the vice and the advice
Drunk, walking out in traffic just to fly kites
Time out, the free-style rhyme out, my last rights
Fuck a classic album, give my life 5 mics
And when the smoke clears, you won't be able to suck dick
Like you did as a teenage slut trick
And with a mat on his grill, he asks ""Who the fuck are you?""
Don't worry man, someday I'ma be nobody too
Watch out!
When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out!
When you open up your mouth
I can smell that you don't know what you're talking about(It goes)
Watch out!
We all love a clown
But we don't wanna se you climb up out the underground
Watch out!
If you don't like the sound
Fuck you! I'm just tryin' to put it down for my home town
Look, I understand your hate
When I was younger, I wanted to be LL Cool J
Then he started making records for the girls and shit
So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away
I stole moves from KRS-One
A little Big Daddy Cane and some DJ Run
And then we took our life and made it into a song
And look, nowadays Rhymesayers is on
It's the B-I-G D-A double D-Y S-E-A-N
He hasn't hit the rooftop to jump, guess he waitin'?
For what? I don't know, but who wanna come with me?
I got at least one more tool with me
So criticize me, or idolize me
Study from a distance or stand right beside me
It don't matter, just act like I know
And watch your back on the beat and get sacked at the free-throw
Watch out!
When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out!
When you open up your mouth
I can smell that you don't know what you're talking about(It goes)
Watch out!
We all love a clown

Get the bird, catch her, shot her, i dont care, get the bird, bring down to the ground from out the air. Gotta tear her apart, let me at her first. Sink her to level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth. Whats she thinkin? Does she really believe, that shes above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets. See her up in the tree lookin down at you and me, like shes chosen over those that walk around on two feet. The bird, the melody she plays, the music she makes, rubbing our faces in the feices of the daybreak, trying to remind us, its time to awake, antagoning and instigating my hate. The cherps, i'll turn them into screams, my feathered friends end will justify the means. Disturbed, i'll grab her by her beak, and swing her in circles until shes too dizzy to speak. Well i'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest, break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast.

I Wish Those Cats At Fobia Would Give,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Tomorrow's forecast: flurries motherfucker
Snowman in full effect so play the odd side 'til April
The tapes will grow so we can by posters and staples
I bet that kid Slug will bust flows if you ask nice
It's Friday night, point me to the party wanna grab mics
Used to get queezy when it was time to rock that b.b
But nowadays I'm just tryin to get Musab away from the TV
Cause I can't fuck with the Zenith I'd rather criticize Tuesdays releases
With the elitists at the Fetus
Yet another factory film is what we present
Surrounding, ditch weed in a ballpoint no grievance
Let's all point our fingers towards the path we venture
Minneapolis native taken the wrath of winter bad contender
Let me catch a lukewarm triple mocha to reach the speed
Of the graph writer that's crashed on my sofa
And in the green room is MC's and in the kitchen is dirty dishes
And my postion blurry vision
And I'm livin in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powder sniffin kids is posin talkin shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the main room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the roll of Jesus, got the part of jerk
Armed with a Walkman and a fake grin in a basement mind state when I
Simply took a left at Nicollet
Sucking on a cigarette did some binge hits before I left
And now the nicotine is liftin it
Choke at the last drag and flick remains at the gutter
Flip up the hood just to keep the brains covered
I'm trying to grow a mountain out of a foothill
I see people rockin my t-shirt and I'm still shopping at Goodwill
In a struggle in a war zone grew some extra personality
Now I won't have to flee or fight alone
The microphone that's my weapon and I'm on a quest for heaven
Or rent me some comprehension
As busy as fuck just gimme a three hour lead
So I can reflect maybe rent a flick and relearn how to breath
And we turned out the sleeves and found a bunch of tricks
And used a cleaver to relieve all these unnecessary limbs
Misplaced the gems and jewels I meant to give you
To lift you and lost my mind inside the issue
And I'm livin in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powder sniffin kids is posin talkin shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the game room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the roll of Jesus, got the part of jerk
Armed with a Walkman and a fake grin in a basement mind-state when I
Think
Now I've got spies positioned at various Cheapos around the city
Lots of people that's down with me cause the evils out to get me
Its easy to decipher who can taste me
A lot of locals used to hate me but now I think the tolerate me
You could only hear what I feel when my eyes are shut
Mistakes are piling up excuses they lining up
I'm trying to fuck reality but I'm impotent can't get it up
Cause shes a duck and her personality sucks just my luck
I caught the wrong bus I guess I'll get off at the crossroads
And take a long lunch
Next month when I got my head right I'ma grab a lead pipe
And beat some life into this dead mic
So let the tape roll and extract all the juices
Read the hate mail in the bathroom and place wagers on the losers
In the beginning you can't help but wanna be innovative
But eventually the opposition leaves you jaded
Like hell no I don't wanna be a baller
I'm six foot three their ain't no need for me to be any taller
I just wish those cats over there at Fobia would hit me off with some free gear or somethin....
Cause I'm livin in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powder sniffin kids is posin talkin shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the game room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the roll of Jesus, got the part of jerk
Armed with a Walkman and a fake grin in a basement mind-state when I
Think of how simple it could all be
Oh yeah, Joe said that uh... I could come in, and just pick some shit out. That's cool? All right",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-i-wish-those-cats-at-fobia-would-give-lyrics
They Call It (clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Don't you love it madly when it sleeps in your basement
On some gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today shit
And don't you love the way that you can relate
To everything your favorite rapper has to say about your hatred
Get a hobby now why they wanna watch me in some hotel lobby
Getting sloppy with this pillow built mommy
Probably never be global like 2Pac
But the local boys keep my shit hard in they jukebox
Sittin' here pretending I'm not tipsy
Watching over sensitive hippies
Use my records for they dog frisbees
Be a good little fishy
And book me a ticket to your city
So your girlfriend'll kiss me
I'm the bee that came to pollinate the flower
Make a meal borrow a towel and take a shower
It's called love in return they bake bread
Pay dollars, make bets
Catch buzz, give head
They call it love and I get plenty of it
The rich kids burn it, my broke people dub it
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
The snakes always wanna put your name where they tongue splits
They call it love and I get plenty of it
Give hugs to the public put plugs in the budget
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
But they know who to call when they want the party jumpin
We bust in to your system search through the evidence
Opening hoping to find why you love your residence
Put your fists up, put your chips up
Act a kid act adult or get your fabric ripped up
They said like what? Like they didn't know me
6 foot 3 ugly mug and simple flow (like that, like that)
And a bottle of jimmy beam (peace)
My name is slug and I'm down with the winning team
They wanna kill my steam I didn't care
Just lead me to the fiti with the pretty hair
Jumping up and down with the passion of a battle
Jester of the kingdom see me amalgamate(?) the castle
Sean is such an asshole naw I'm a dickhead
Stealing cigarettes from the rest of the mislead
And join me avoid me do what you must do
But man up and understand why they don't love you
They call it love and I get plenty of it
The rich kids burn it, my broke people dub it
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
The snakes always wanna put your name where they tongue splits
They call it love and I get plenty of it
Give hugs to the public put plugs in the budget
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
But they know who to call when they want the party jumpin
Looking through your pinhole
Who you gonna insult
Atmosphere up in here
Yea where'd your grin go
Got a sock of nickels and quarters
For unsupportive cocksmokers that wanna ripple these waters
You hate to love it
Keep changing up the subject
Still ain't saying nothing
We knew you that would jump ships
Get back inside your magic pumpkin you puppet
Cause all you got left in your life is a big what if
No names just pertains to a flock of you
The fuck you gonna do when no ones watchin you
Sweep up the fuck-ups
Tighten up the lug nuts
Let your world turn with no concern for what slug does
I'm not number 1
I'm just my mothers son
No regrets show respect what's done is done
I understand why your so discouraged
Now show your love like it was when you was discouraged
They call it love and I get plenty of it
The rich kids burn it, my broke people dub it
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
The snakes always wanna put your name where they tongue splits
They call it love and I get plenty of it
Give hugs to the public put plugs in the budget
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
But they know who to call when they want the party jumpin",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-they-call-it-clean-lyrics
Bird Songs Why the Caged I Know,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's the bird, it must have been the bird
Disgusting critter, it must
We should have known better then to trust
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her shoot her, I dont care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Gotta tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
What's she thinking? does she really believe
That shes above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodys she play
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us, its time to awake
Antaganizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I turn them into screams
My feathered friends end will justity the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles untill she's too dizzy to speak
Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(she's a snake that can fly) she's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?
I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(she's a snake that can fly) she's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?

They Call It (a cappella),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Don't you love it madly when it sleeps in your basement
On some gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today shit
And don't you love the way that you can relate
To everything your favorite rapper has to say about your hatred
Get a hobby now why they wanna watch me in some hotel lobby
Getting sloppy with this pillow built mommy
Probably never be global like 2Pac
But the local boys keep my shit hard in they jukebox
Sittin' here pretending I'm not tipsy
Watching over sensitive hippies
Use my records for they dog frisbees
Be a good little fishy
And book me a ticket to your city
So your girlfriend'll kiss me
I'm the bee that came to pollinate the flower
Make a meal borrow a towel and take a shower
It's called love in return they bake bread
Pay dollars, make bets
Catch buzz, give head
They call it love and I get plenty of it
The rich kids burn it, my broke people dub it
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
The snakes always wanna put your name where they tongue splits
They call it love and I get plenty of it
Give hugs to the public put plugs in the budget
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
But they know who to call when they want the party jumpin
We bust in to your system search through the evidence
Opening hoping to find why you love your residence
Put your fists up, put your chips up
Act a kid act adult or get your fabric ripped up
They said like what? Like they didn't know me
6 foot 3 ugly mug and simple flow (like that, like that)
And a bottle of jimmy beam (peace)
My name is slug and I'm down with the winning team
They wanna kill my steam I didn't care
Just lead me to the fiti with the pretty hair
Jumping up and down with the passion of a battle
Jester of the kingdom see me amalgamate(?) the castle
Sean is such an asshole naw I'm a dickhead
Stealing cigarettes from the rest of the mislead
And join me avoid me do what you must do
But man up and understand why they don't love you
They call it love and I get plenty of it
The rich kids burn it, my broke people dub it
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
The snakes always wanna put your name where they tongue splits
They call it love and I get plenty of it
Give hugs to the public put plugs in the budget
They call it hate and I get plenty of it
But they know who to call when they want the party jumpin
Looking through your pinhole
Who you gonna insult
Atmosphere up in here
Yea where'd your grin go
Got a sock of nickels and quarters
For unsupportive cocksmokers that wanna ripple these waters
You hate to love it
Keep changing up the subject
Still ain't saying nothing

Rhymesayers Entertainment Artist Bio,UnKnown,UnKnown,""" 'People are just looking for something they can relate to. Something that they can take and apply to themselves. Some of us are lucky enough to become that through our art.
​Sean “Slug” Daley​'
Defining success is not an exact science by any means. In some ways, it’s especially difficult to quantify one’s success when they have a job that places them in the public eye, a position that is ripe for critique and high expectations. Perhaps those who best thrive in those scenarios are the ones who can navigate through all noise and continue to evolve and grow, both in their skill sets and as individuals.
In many ways, that is an integral part of the Atmosphere story. Over their twenty-year career they have managed to continually tweak and strive to perfect their formula, while neither straying too far off their path, nor resorting to playing it safe. Starting at 1997’s Overcast, the group’s first official album, and traveling through 18 years of new albums, side projects (e.g. the Sad Clown series and Felt), and various collaborations, all the way up until 2014’s Southsiders album, Atmosphere’s music has evolved in a way that differs from many of their peers and predecessors. A hard look at that evolution doesn’t reveal the commonalities of following trends or struggling to fit in, by either over-extending in an effort to stay cool to the younger generation, or succumbing to the pressure people tend to place on artists to maintain the same sound from album to album. Instead, the Atmosphere discography evolves in a natural way.
Musically, Ant has continued to define Atmosphere’s sound, ranging from a healthy mixture of upbeat and fun, to the oft more iconic, moody and personal. Through out the 1990s, Ant spent countless hours in his basement with a wealth of records, a keyboard sampler, a turntable and a 4-track, working with a who’s who of the Twin Cities’ Rap talent of that time. Those experiences tuned his ear, molded his work ethic, and shaped his vision. In turn, those lessons have continually become more prominent in the Atmosphere aesthetic, blending live musicians and sampled production with his keen sense of how to compose a well-arranged song. As for the lyrics, Slug started his passion for rhyming with an obsessive-like penchant for the way words intersect, as well as how those words can be manipulated for unexpected and clever meanings. But, at the same time, early on Slug expressed an interest in doing more than simply proving he could be witty, but also writing about subjects that speak to people personally, as well as emotionally. These practices also naturally helped the Atmosphere fan base to expand beyond the usual independent Hip Hop audience, extending their reach to an alternative audience who also related to the personable appeal and emotional range of both Slug’s songwriting and Ant’s musical backdrops. Particularly, Slug has been consistently successful in leveraging his understanding for the power of words, recognizing that a song containing the right story or personal perspective can be extremely effective in capturing and holding the listener’s attention.
Undoubtedly, the impact of Atmosphere’s music has been the roots to their long-term success, but their continued rigorous touring and performance schedule has been the vessel for engraining these stories and the legacy of the music into their fan base. Early on in their careers, Atmosphere stepped beyond the genre lines and performed shows through out the Twin Cities with Rock bands, Punk Rock bands, and Jazz Ensembles. This was directly influenced by the fact that both of them were already fans of a wide range of music. Although this was a natural reaction to being a fan of the music, that experience also afforded Atmosphere, and their Rhymesayers peers, the opportunity to witness first-hand the D.I.Y ethos shared by some of these other musical movements. Atmosphere began to apply many of these tactics and work ethics to their growth, which was specifically influential in the development of Atmosphere’s approach to touring. These strategies found Atmosphere expanding their tours into cities that few, if any, Rap artists were including in their routing. The result is a storied connection between the artists and the listeners, which has grown into long-term Atmosphere fans passing down that experience to their children and so on, and thus continually ushering in a new generation of Atmosphere fans. Early on in their touring excursions, Atmosphere shows were noted in history for challenging the idea that Hip Hop audiences had to be filled exclusively with scowl-faced males fueled by ego and testosterone. Instead they created an environment that invited women to join in on the party. All of these factors have led to a fan base that ranges from ages 14-54 and beyond, and one that remains solid, as well as ever evolving.
As Atmosphere steps into their 21st year of making music, Slug & Ant show no signs of slowing, compromising or losing sight of their vision. Nor has time revealed any diminishing of those qualities that have brought them this far. As 2016 swung into gear, Atmosphere had already ended the previous year and led into another with a string of singles, and still have an abundance of music on the way, including their latest album, “Fishing Blues”. The title of the new album speaks directly to the sentiments that opened this bio; Is this the point in the career where Atmosphere chooses to step back, put up the Gone Fishin’ sign and reminisce about their successes? The answer, a resounding no, is found in the music, a collection of songs that both define and redefine the Atmosphere sound. Their passion and creative spark are as illuminate as ever. Slug and Ant still have plenty of stories to tell” ""

No dont do that no
No dont do that

Look at em they couldn't handle it they nerves 'll collapse
Drag em up sip em up skinny boy rip the cut no excuses needed
This ones wack that one sucks
Dont even front like u got close to balls inside
Ur egos in planted personifolcified
Everybody wanna score aimin at an all time high
Shootin at the stars tryin to make them fall out the sky
The gray matter blade runner screamin thoughts of anger at the world from beneath this rock i stay under
Tonights rain and thunder was brought to u in part by that same fucker that put the fear of the atlas in ur heart now
Guess where im standin (where?)
Over the head
If u put a hand up u can fondle everything i said
And if i lose my patience sombodys loosin they limbs
And gettin left in this basement with the rest of these gimps
Chorus:
Atmosphere dont front like u can't hear
Come on come on
Atmosphere dont front like u can't hear
Ha ha ha ha
Atmosphere dont front like u can't hear
Atmosphere dont front like u can't hear
Dont touch urself and keep ur muff in ur belt
Who the fuck u think holds the controls over wut u felt
U need way too much help
Take a seat on the bench
Gunna teach u how to make sense while i make my rent
If u reach the fence
Without kickin the land mine u get a peice of my mind and the number to my fan line
No wonder ur wack
Most of mankind is wack
Can't nobody read the sign that says there ain't no turning back
Steppin the at
U better be prepared to have a hobby to do
But wen we blowin ur career so get a copy of the papers that u think gave u the right to even come within 100 yards of this spot
But here i am breath deep count to ten
Keep the beat locate the loose screws so i can pound em in
It all spread news get news city to city
I ain't mad at none of yall cuz can't none of yall fuck wit me
Chorus
Im on the poverty tour with j-bird my man
Kickin every raw soul across this desolate land
As it meets the expectations
It gets broken and cornered
Tryin to strangle the stupidity and choke its supporters
From this day forward
Ill be the voice that u wait for
The one that u pay for and the one that u hate more
Wheteher u drive a ford
A tugboat
Or a skateboard
Put my tape on open up and face forward
Cuz wen we land anywhere near the mic stand
We get u pleasin with the meaning of your life span
Motivation u been watin for to make a tight plan
Gotcha like i think that i can yes i think that i can
Well go ahead take a sip
Introduce us to yourself
Place us on ur list of influences im a live for ever
Fuck bein rich for seven years

What They Sittin For?,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Verse:)
Messing with the big Texas Hold 'Em
Fools think I'm rich now, I'm always on the road and
I no longer play this as much, think I lost touch
What's the buy in? I'm bout to choke up
When it comes to getting in a tournament
I play safe cause I'm still kind of learning it
Looking for a little help from the cards that are dealt, uh
Pocket nine on the felt, well...
Which of y'all want to call the big blind?
Short stack to the left, all in, fine
One more stayed in trynna re-raise
But I played requests like DJ
Fool you can splash chips, act big
Swig that beer but don't forget me over here, yeah
Keep my chips stacked up like a high rise
Drinking water cause I gotta keep my mind dry
I know you got face cards, so I'm a play hard
And avoid the late charge
Nine double Jack at the flop
C'mon, Jake needs brand new games for his Xbox
Fool, you can't even fuck with me
You're the first to bet in that the turn becomes a queen
And I seen that excitement scene
When the bitch laid down, yep, you got a king ten
Now I'm feeling like a winner
Flocks of birds don't even need to see the river
You want to go all in too?
No problem, I called them, your chips is falling duke
Full house when I pulled out my nines
Turn a high rise into a skyline
Damn guy, your stack came down in a landslide
Yeah I'll pay for your cab ride",https://genius.com/Atmosphere-what-they-sittin-for-lyrics
