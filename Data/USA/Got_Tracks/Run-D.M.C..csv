It’s Tricky,Raising Hell,1987.0,"This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock (a rhyme), that's right (on time)
""It's Tricky"" is the title, here we go...

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... it's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tricky) Trrrrrrrrrrricky

I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said ""It's not that easy""

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... (How is it D?) It's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Trrrrrricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tricky (Tricky) Tricky

In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... (How is it D?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) huh!

When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father cause he's down with me

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... (How is it?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tr-Tr-Tr-Tricky) Tr-tr-tr...

We are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)
They offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone
It's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit
You keep on (rock!) shock 'cause this is it...",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-its-tricky-lyrics
Walk This Way,Raising Hell,1986.0,"Now there's a backseat lover, that's always undercover
And we talk 'til my daddy say
Said you ain't seen nothing, 'til you're down on a muffin
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheerleader, that's a real big breeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving, was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this!

See-saw swinging, with the boys in school
And her feet are just fly up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just didn't care
So I took a big chance, at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way!
She told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
Ooh, like this!

School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee
It was three young ladies, in the school gym locker
And they find they were looking at D
I was high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor had a daughter, had a favor
So I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With her feet flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle, with a kitty in the middle""
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' when she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-walk-this-way-lyrics
Peter Piper,Raising Hell,1986.0,"Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rocked rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down, that’s his hard time
Jack B. Nimble was nimble and he was quick
But Jam Master cut faster, Jack’s on Jay’s dick
Now Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice chilling somewhere in Wonderland
Jack’s serving Jill a bucket in his hand
And Jam Master Jay’s making all that sound
The turntables might wobble, but they don’t fall down

Now Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing
But Jam Master’s getting loose and D.M.C.’s the king
Cause he’s adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay king of the crossfader
He’s the better of the best, best believe he’s the baddest
Perfect timing when I’m climbing I’m a rhyming apparatus
Lot of guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix real quick and I’d like to say
He’s not Flash, but he’s fast and his name is Jay

It… it goes a one, two, three, and…

Jay’s like King Midas as I was told
Everything that he touched turned to gold
He’s the greatest of the greater, get it straight, he’s great
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay, to see him play, will make you say
“God damn that DJ made my day”
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He’s a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were kids he would be due
Not lying, y’all, he’s the best I know
And if I lie my nose will grow
Like a little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story go

Tricks are for kids, he plays much gigs
He’s a big bad wolf and you’re the three pigs
He’s a big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good

There it is

We’re Run-D.M.C., got a beef to settle
D’s not Hansel, he’s not Gretel
Jay’s a winner, not a beginner
His pockets get fat, others get thinner
J-j-j-j-j… jump on Jay like cows jump moons
People chase Jay like dish and spoon
And like all fairy tales end
You’ll see Jay again my friend, huh!",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-peter-piper-lyrics
My Adidas,Raising Hell,1986.0,"My Ahhh-didas, walk through concert doors
And roam all over coliseum floors
I stepped on stage, at Live Aid
All the people gave, and the poor got paid
And out of speakers I did speak
I wore my sneakers but I'm not a sneak
My Adidas touch the sand of a foreign land
With mic in hand, I cold took command
My Adidas and me close as can be
We make a mean team, my Adidas and me
We get around together, we down forever
And we won't be mad when caught in bad weather
My Adidas... my Adidas...
Yo, whassup?

My Ahhh-didas, standin on two fifth street
Funky fresh and yes cold on my feet
With no shoestring in 'em, I did not win 'em
I bought 'em off the ave. with the black Lee denim
I like to sport 'em, that's why I bought 'em
A sucker tried to steal 'em so I caught 'em and I fought 'em
And I walk down the street, and bop to the beat
With Lee on my legs and Adidas on my feet
And so now I'm just standin here shootin the gip
Me and D and my Adidas standing on two fifth
My Adidas... my Adidas...

Nowwwww - me and my Adidas do the illest things
We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
We slay all suckers who perpetrate
And lay down law from state to state
We travel on gravel, dirt road or street
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat
On stage front page, every show I go
It's Adidas on my feet, high top or low
My Adidas... my Adidas...

Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare
Myself homeboy got 50 pair
Got blue and black, cause I likes to chill
And yellow and green when it's time to get ill
Got a pair that I wear when I'm playin ball
With the heel inside, make me 10 feet tall

My Adidas, only bring good news
And they are not used as felon shoes
They're black and white, white with black stripes
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of our famous university
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen
Hollywood knows we're good if you know what I mean
We started in the (alley) now we chill in (Cali)
And I won't trade my Adidas for no beat up Bally's

It’s Like That,Run-D.M.C.,1983.0,"Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with 
my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is

Christmas in Hollis,Tougher Than Leather,1987.0,"It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer
But then I was illin' because the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus""
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me

It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog
The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols
(Christmas melodies)

Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out
And that's what Christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We want to say

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-christmas-in-hollis-lyrics
Sucker M.C.’s,Run-D.M.C.,1983.0,"Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Def a-then it went this way
Took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry
 
put me inside his Cad-illac
The chauffeur drove off 
and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin on the microphone
And then we talkin autograph, and cheers and laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see ahh, ah that's the life, ah that I lead
And you sucker MC's is who I please
So take that and move back catch a heart attack
Because there's nothin in the world, that Run'll ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a b-boy stance
And rock on the mic and make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above
I'm rockin on the mic and you can call me Run-Love

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin girls just a-move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride
It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker MC, you just ain't right
Because you're bitin all your life, you're cheatin on your wife
You're walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin on the ave, chillin with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through

Ah with the one two three, three to two one
My man Larry Larr
, 
my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face
Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker MC's, you 
sad-faced clown
You a five-dollar boy and I'm a-million dollar man
Youse a sucker MC, and you're my fan
You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine
Youse a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin from the wackest, part of town
Tryin to rap up but you can't get down
You don't even know your English, your verb, or noun
You're just a sucker MC, you sad-faced clown
So D.M.C. and if you're ready
The people rockin' steady
You're drivin big cars get your gas from Getty

I'm D.M.C., in the place to be
I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens
And I love eatin chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love the style
I'm an MC you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
With who? me, myself, and my microphone
All my rhymes are sweet delight
So here's another one for y'all to bite
When I rhyme, I never quit
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
Cause it takes a lot, to entertain
And sucker MC's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop
You gotta let em know you'll never stop
The rhymes have to make (a lot of sense)
You got to know where to start (when the beats commence..)",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-sucker-mcs-lyrics
King of Rock,King of Rock,1985.0,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect
They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a verbal treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?
Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down ree's
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send
Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch.
 
I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these

They wanna be down with the King!
Producers die, they wanna be down
Wanna be down with the King!

Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers mackin' mic, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
'Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
'Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down

Down with the king
The king down with the king 
The king

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts,
 
wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to forte better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and I'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
C.L. and Run D.M.C. so rush it
Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not meant for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is branded when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king

I'm the man you see, in the place to be

And after twelve grade I went straight to college

The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'

For all you sucker MC's perpetratin' a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
You're the kind of guy that girl ignored
I'm drivin' a Caddy, you fixin' a Ford
My name is 
Joseph Simmons but my middle name's Ward
And when I'm rockin on the mic, you should all applaud
Because we're wheelin', 
dealin,
 
we got a funny feelin'
We rock from the floor 
up the ceilin'
We groove it, 
you move it,
 it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin'
We create it, 
relate it,
 
and often demonstrate it
We'll diss a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it
We're risin', 
suprisin',
 
and often hypnotizin'
We always tell the 
truth and then we never slip no lies in

no braids

Because the rhymes I say, sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh, could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of a
 
word
, 
that's what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm the master of a mic, that's what I say
And if I didn't say that, you'd say it any
 
way
Bust into the party, come in the place
See the first things come, the music in your face
Girls on the walls, some on the 
floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it can't be missed
And you can't leave til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you can't leave
 
until we're through
So relax your
 
body
 
and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme,
 hey
You might think that you have
 
waited
Long enough til the rhyme was
 
stated
But if it were a test it would be
 
graded
With a grade that's not
 
debated
Nothing too
 deep 
and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of
 
sense
So move your butt, to the cut
Run amok, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there, we got the notion
We want to see y'all all in motion
Just 
shake, wiggle jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side,
 
back and forth
We're the two MC's, and we're gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or run
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJ's better than all these bands

[Verse 1:
(One) day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side to side
He asked this old lady, ""Yo, yo, um...is this Kentucky Fried?""
The lady said ""Yeah"", smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fries,

(To)day you won a ticket to see Doctor J
Front row seat (in free!) no pay
Radio in hand, snacks by feet
Game's about to start, you kickin' popcorn to the beat
You finally wake up, Doc's gone to town
Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream ""Touchdown!""
You be illin'

Verse 3
The other day around the way I seen you illin' at a party
Drunk as a skunk you illin' punk and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said ""Yo, yo, can I get this dance?""
She smelt your breath and then she left you standin' in your illin'
Stance

Jam Master Jay,Run-D.M.C.,1984.0,"Kick off shoes, jump on the jock
Listen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock
His name is Jay and he's on his way
To be the best DJ in the US of A
J-a-y are the letters of his name
Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, 1 2 3
Jam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C
He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better cause he knows he has to
In '84 he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master
We're live as can be but we're not singing the blues
We got to tell all y'all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not 5, not 4, not 3, just 2
2 MC's who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Beacause it's about time for a brand new group
Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay""
Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt
We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of the people on off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day
But we're talking bout Jam Master Jay",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-jam-master-jay-lyrics
Raising Hell,Raising Hell,1986.0,"Kings from Queens from Queens come Kings
We're raisin hell 
like a class when the lunchbell rings
The king will be praised, and hell will be raised
S-s-s-suckers try to faze him but D won't be fazed
So what's your name? D.M.C.! The King is me!
Your High-ness, or His Majesty!
Now you can debate, you c-c-c-concentrate
But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!
Dissin all devils, causin havoc in HELL
At a very high level base and treble shall YELL
Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme
So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
So loud like a cloud with thunder and LIGHTNING
So proud to the crowd it is somewhat FRIGHTENING
No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed
There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin cannot cease; BREAK!

You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft
Courageous and contagious so you better break North
Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough?
Just listen while I'm dissin cause you're pissin me off
Cold bedding is spreading all across your face
You can't take when I break and if that's the case
I'll go on, and on, and kick the bass
So back up off the cup while I take my taste

It's highly appraised when the hell is raised
So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true
I cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you
My mighty mic control, already brought his soul
The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
A black hat is my crown, symbolizin the sound
Signifyin, we won't play around; BUST IT!

Rappin and climbin beat-makin every day
No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say
I am great, get it straight, cause that's my fate
My name is Run I'm number one, that's how I rate
He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace
His name is Jay he's here to play, and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall yes y'all,
 
he's down with me

From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
The word is heard as told by D
I don't sing I bring, much delight
Like a star shinin bright in the darkest night
If you are cold, I'll bring you heat
Like I brought the whole world my funky beat
Mysterious and serious I ain't no joke
Fire from the depths of hell AND YOU CAN SMELL THE SMOKE!

Kickin and tickin while you're havin a ball
Like chicken finger lickin I'll be vickin you all
So +Do The Bird
, have you heard, did they give you a call
Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin the walls

There's no fearin when hearin sound of this kind
Across the land every man is goin out of his mind
On the face of the earth spreading like disease
Contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees

Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion
Ruler of rock, and king at cold-crushin
Puller of people - controller of crowds
Lingering lyrics, long-lasting and loud

Left y'all, ah to the left y'all
Because I rock upon the mike real def y'all

And to the right y'all, ah to the right y'all
Because I rock upon the mike all night y'all

You see, I..

.. want respect, if I'm correct
They're all like a ball that I have checked
And the shots they take have no effect
The punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck
Cause I rock harder, and I get farther

I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never failed
(Clubs and the pubs is where she dwelled)
Story about Mary was well to tell
She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent a night locked in a cell
I knew Mary well cause she “Raising Hell”

“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

It’s not Mary who was quite contrary
Talkin’ bout Mary who was always in a hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need, a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she’s crazy and I’ll say very
Livin’ in a house that’s out on the prairie
I worry about Mary, cause Mary is scary

She was a tiny black woman, but she was brave
She was livin to be givin there's a lot that she gave
There's not a slave, in this day and age

It could never be fiction cause it is all fact

I'm in my pro models that I model like the pros
I go full throttle I'm a lot like Derek Rose

Hey!  You over there, I know about your kind
You're like the Independent Network News on Channel 9
Everywhere that you go, no matter where you at
I said you talk about this, and you talk about that
When the cat took your tongue, I say you took it right back
Your mouth is so big, one bite would kill a Big Mac

You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up

You talk about people, you don't even know
And you talk about places, you NEVER go
You talk about your girl, from head to toe
I said your mouth's moving fast, and your brain's moving slow

You talk too much
You never shut up!!
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up

You're the instigator, the orator of the town
You're the worst when you converse, just a big mouth clown
You talk when you're awake, I heard you talk when you sleep
Has anyone ever told you, that talk is cheap

You talk too much
You never shut, up!!
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

Talking is the one thing, that you can do best
You told the cavity creeps, to watch out for Crest
You never have the story, right and exact
And then you always try to bore me, with your yakkity yak

You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

Everyday you are out fighting someone in the street
And you're always fighting someone you know ya can't beat
Then you wonder how, you got in this mess
Just think of what you said, then take a guess

You talk too much
You never shut up!
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

You're always spreading rumors, whether bad or good
You're the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood
The Barbara Walters, and the Howard Cosell
You always come around, with a story to tell

You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

Said it's everybody's business that you love to mind
And talkin' to you, is like dropping a dime
You're spreading the word, like it is your job
You should be a stool pigeon, who works for the mob

You talk too much
And you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up!

A big blabbermouth, that's what you are
If you were a talk show host, you'd be a star
I said your mouth is big, size extra large
And when you open it, it's like my garage

You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up

You always like to gossip, just like a girl
You talk so damn much, it's outta this world

SHUT UP!!!

Twenty-five hours, eight days a week
Thirteen months outta year, is when you speak
I'm tired of listening to the garbage you talk
Why don't you find a short pier, and take a long walk

You talk too much
Then you never shut up!

You talk too much
Man you naggin' me to death

Tired of hearing you speak

Beats to the Rhyme,Tougher Than Leather,1988.0,"DJ's and MC's, coming up next is the one and only
Incredible, Jam Master
Yo, back up off the ropes, punk

Beats to the rhyme, of the rhyme I just made
Party at the jammie til lights the night fade
Trooping for the feature we all get paid
So let's go

Yo! D that's me, the King, the MC
Rhyme get mine on the t-o-p
Can another MC ever **** with me? (Hell no!)

It's like the A the B to the C
It's easier than (1, 2, 3)
(He's Jam Master Jay, I'm D.M.C.)
So hit it Run!
It's time for we to cease (So what?)
So rhymers speak your peace
Why? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)
Cause he's number (1, 2, 3, 4, hit it)
(Let's dance) to the rhythm, the rhyme, the cold flow
Chance that I gave em is done I told yo
For these routines like 1983
It's just a little reminder
So those suckas is kinder
A little message from (Run-D.M.C.)

Cuts for days will amaze and maze
But will make you sad to tan all the dance aways
Got the mic, the man, the master plan
But the ram, the jam
(Know I am?) Goddamn!
Spins he wins, clocking endless ends
To his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends
Jay lose today, this is what I say
(Dick in your mouth all day)

My beats were played and laid rhymes made
Jay DJ'ed and I got paid
Made something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)
Yes my brother I would do it for you
I roam in the zone of the microphone
And I'm on the throne but I'm not alone
Got bones of steel and not of stone
I'm known to be prone and make your momma moan

Time for the rhyme so let the stars shine
Shame for the fame and the name combined
Run for the fun but you can gimme your ring
Show I gotta go so now a word from the King

Hardcore, rhymes galore, giving you more
And like I said before...
Beats to the rhyme the name of this jam
D that's me and that's who I am
Rocking on the mic cause you know I can
You gotta understand I don't give a damn!

Jay here to play today, I must say
Arranged in the way that is A-OK
As we wax the tracks all the DJ's play
With (dick in your mouth)

Tougher Than Leather,Tougher Than Leather,1988.0,"Unconceivable, unbelievable
Grammar like a hammer information receivable
Sent by the Lord, here and abroad
With words well adored now they can't be ignored!

For-For-For-Force of course that makes Run the boss
So get lost because I just toss a punk
Make way today and if I may I say
I make pay with Jay, so get away OKAY?
Gainin weight, I ate the whole plate to date
Never rate the great, I go state to state
Just peep and keep but don't sleep or weep
Get deep to leap or I'll beep the Jeep
Put down the clown, get 'round the town
I found the sound and I'll pound the ground
Get paid and laid, not 'jayed or 'fraid
So I stayed and made, not a bad debate
Got a group to troop, with a shoop de shoop
Shoot hoop then scoop, on this loop to loop
Goin off and on, not soft of course
Just black and back to go back and forth
Go to school and cool, not drool or pool
Got soul and gold and cold hold a jewel
Upset the best, I met, met a jest
Just lest the pest, and I am the best
Got a punch to crunch, cold munch for lunch
Not Grady or the lady from the Brady Bunch
Got G's and Lees, like D's and T's
Charge B's to freeze, all MC's with ease
No dope to cope, just good to go
There's hope to Pope, big nope for nope
Quite clever and never, we're together forever
Run-D.M.C. and we're ""Tougher Than Leather""

Strong and mighty, hard as can be
The perception of the life were as strong as D
Never frightened I'm writin, writin for what's right
Not schemin thievin in the night
, I'm keepin with my mic
I got to go for broke, and I ain't no joke
I won't yoke and choke, 'cept the suckers I smoked
Bumrush and crush, leave 'em in the dust
I choose to bust the bust, the scums who mess with us
Only strong survive, and the weak will die
As long as I'm alive I keep my head up high
Because I'm strong in body, and smart in mind
I was born to rhyme, as a gift to mankind
No punk or chump, never givin no slack
We'll be killin a villain and like chillin, ""Yo black!""
I'm not a bum, I'm not dumb, it's me you run from
I'm the king I do my things until my Kingdom Come!
{*guitar solo*}

Cause I'm
Rough and tough, cold huff and puff
Don't bluff the stuff, got enough to muff
Go long and on, no longer song
Go on and on just for past the dawn
Put preach and teach, with a speech to reach
All streets and each, with beats for treats
Got the King Supreme, may seem the clean
With a beat and a ring, no dream machine
Not a gang to bang, out to hang with slang
Talking yang and tang, about everythang
Just brothers and others, like fathers and mothers
Who discovered they love us that think they're up and above us
No crime or time, just rhyme and I'm
Full grown and own, no phone or dime
Just cut the stuff, til you get enough
Cause we're rougher than tougher and rougher tougher than tough!
{*guitar solo*}

Ah with a voice like thunder, words of wonder
Over all standin tall and the suckers fall under
Posessed with power, cowards will cower
Ducks we devour hour hour after hour
Three man riot, you can't deny it
We're so ill that you can't defy it
Gonna live, POSITIVE, forever, AND EVER

It's not just a lean dish, your soup and salad not valid
I serve a mean dish.. mean dish..
I got my mic in my hand and my plan to come

All wet behind the ears I freeze I froze you're numb

PUMP PUMP!  Run you round the track then walk it off
So, check for me take in a weapon and even steppin

I hit you with the rhythm and they give me dough
I'm one of a kind, I rock your mind
I'm stingy with the digits when I rock my rhyme
I bust a vein, inside my brain
I came with the name and I claim the fame
I'm hard to the core, wicked and raw
The rhymes break raw when I'm breakin your door
I kick a ill style cause I'm sticka-still wild

Easy does it, Run'll do it, speakin fluid vocabulary
Vocal, we makin em come to it - then I have you very
Often, lost in, Run'll run a boss then
Confuse you lose you're all lost up in the sauce
Then I stir you sir you're all shakin cause I'm diesel
Drop hip-hop, and then POP goes the weasel
Comin and runnin and seekin daily for my kingdom
Takin my lyrics at first they hear it then they sing them
I take a sucker and do em, the heads I flew em
First I chew em, then I school em and sue em, and steppin to em

When I woke up this morning and got out the bed
I had some really fresh thoughts going through my head
They were thoughts that came from a wonderful dream
It was the vision of a world working as a team
It was a dream     
Just a dream       , , 
There were no guns, no what
No tanks, no what, atomic bombs
And to be frank homeboy there were no arms
Just people, working hand in hand
There was a feeling of peace all across the land
It was a dream     
Just a dream       , , 
Between all countries there were good releations
There finally was a meeting to united nations
And everybody had an occupation
Cause we all worked together to fight starvation
It was a dream     
Just a dream       , 
Everyone was treated on an equal basis
No matter what colors, religions or races
We weren't afraid to show our faces
It was cool to chill in foreign places
It was a dream     
Just a dream       , , 
, , , 
All cities of the world were renovated
And the people all chilled and celebrated
They were all so happy and elated
To live in the world that they created
It was a dream     
Just a dream       , , 
There were no street people, we live rent free
And every single person had a place to be
A job, a home and the perfect pay
And the world was free of greed and hate
It was a dream     
Just a dream       , , 
Unemployment was at a record low
And the presidents were chillin at our show
Listening to the things that we had to say
And trying to create a new and brighter day
It was a dream     
Just a dream       
It was a dream

Christmas Is,"A Very Special Christmas, Vol. 2",UnKnown,"Ho ho ho'n, when you think on Christmas it be snowin
And people get their equal, hit the full one, one for growin
Ya knowin, we're flowin in the ghetto, they get nothing
No toys for little boys, no curls for girls and turkey stuffing
They laugh, they know that half the presents ain't thick
You might just wanna ask, ""Yo, where my presents, Saint Nick?""
So think, a little 'bout the people minus money
And when you get your dough, why don't you show some kindness, honey?
Go 'head, get fed, and spread a little love
Give what you can afford just like The Lord from up above
A quote, a note, and one you won't believe
It's better to give than to receive
(""YO~!"") It's Christmas, no dissin, listen all you listeners
Think of all the prisoners that's in prison during Christmas
Not tryin to bring you down, but tryin to put you up on
Landed it on the table so you're able to put your cup on
No snow, not a flurry, so hurry don't you miss it
Not dissin you, but whishin you a very merry Christmas

Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Christmas, YO!
Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough! - HERE WE GO! HERE WE GO!

I'm from the ghetto, now this mean I get
No toys or presents beneath my tree
I wrote my list, I made my wish
Is this what Christmas means to me?
No snowflakes droppin, can't go shoppin
Rhymes I'm a-poppin, to keep the hip-hhoppin
Why can't a Santa +Pause+ for the cause?
I'm gettin mine, you gettin yours
That's how Christmas is supposed to be
A very merry Christmas for everybodyy
Fight poverty, give to the needy
Don't be like The Grinch cause The Grinch, is greedy
Deck, the malls with bows of holly
'Tis the season to be jolly
No presents for my tree yet
And I don't even know if any gifts I'm gonna get
Happy holidays not like a lotta days
A few here, a few there, a new year
Season greetings are the reasons for the cheer
If Santa Claus, is coming to town
Hope it's my chimney he's coming down
On Christmas, because Christmas is
On Christmas, because Christmas is

(HERRRRE WE GO, FLOW!)

Ha-have a, very merry merry, and hurry
And if you'll need a leader, Run'll be there for your flurry
Blurry sight, and write, a rhyme for the night
Christmas is the time for giving not for the type
So open, your pockets, your heart, unlock it
Dollars train from Hollis, I give it like I clock it
Cold as the weather, minus the humidity
Don't mistake, harmonies and kindness for timidity
Christmas, this must, be the time of year
Leggo of your Eggo, rather ego, me go there
And here, my dear, so give a kid a beer
Cause every time you give, it's coming back, let's get it clear
I'll be scopin, and hopin, brothers lend a ear
So have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

Yeah, that's right! Give up the dough!

I want my Sega Genesis! I want my Nintendo!

I remember the time, I visited the grave
My life on the line, only my life to save
All by myself, with no one around
Did not understand a hand comin out the ground
I knew it wasn't mine, it was somebody else
But I didn't care G, I just screamed for HELP!
Then - GHOSTBUSTERS - had strapped to their back
Screamin - GHOSTBUSTERS - those 'busters attacked
""We are your friendly neighborhood ghostbusters,""
That's what they said to me
""We are the busters of an ?, G-H-O-S-T""

	Scaring screaming
	Ghostly ghosts
	Ghouling demons!
	Monsters spooks
	Werewolves and devils
	All those things
	on the same level
	Nightmares (bad dreams) cannot be beat
It takes a brave man (to stand in defeat)
Must be the bravest (yo, the bravest and most)
You must be able to say, ""I ain't afarid of no ghosts""
	A good sense of humor, is important to have
When a ghost tries to scare you (ha, don't make me laugh)
They be dustin off ghosts, like true ghost-dusters
	Go, go, go, go, ghoooooosstbusters!
GHOSTBUSTERS!

Busters, busters!

Kool Moe Dee

One for the treble, two for the bass
Come on Jam Master, let's rock the place
I'm a dominator in my field
And when it comes to rap, other rappers yield
Cause when it comes to rap, I'm the epitome
The rappers' idol, and my title is Kool Moe Dee

They call me iller than iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
One def rapper, cold know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool & the Gang

Well, I'm one of the chosen few
So when you need that lift just to get you through
All you have to do is say Special K
And help is on the way

Well, I'm D.M.C. in the place to be
And the place to be is with D.M.C
And by the time I'm through, you will agree
No other emcees rock the house like me

Well, I'm the coolest of the cool, they call me Moe Dee
It ain't another rapper who's as bad as me
I got a high-powered voice, I'm the party peoples' choice
I got so many rhymes, you gotta take invoice

Now party people, I'm so happy I don't know what to do
Cause I'm the emcee with the rock, cold down with the crew
Rhyme from Africa to France, and then to Kalamazoo
And every place that I play, I hear a ""Yeah"" and a ""Woo!""

Well, I know that when a party is packed
You need a guide to show you when and where to react
You need a motivator -- that means you'll need me
Special K, huh, from the Treacherous Three

D.M.C., that's who I am
I love to perform, but I'm not a ham
My mother said, ""Do it"". I said, ""Yes, ma'am""
And I can do it cause I know I can

Well, don't touch that dial -- just sit tight

If you liked that battle, huh, that was light

I know you're gonna love this next act

Cause we'll have Shannon when we get back

A vain from my brain means I'm causin em pain
Comin rough with the stuff that's just a part of the game
The rhymes have been hard since the start of the jam
So I'mma pull my jammy out and I'mma murder the man
Bust a rap like a cap, put a hole in your soul
Take the trigger then you figured that I'm losin control
I go loco with the vocals, yo goes the chokehold
And I broke those pros with the dope flows
I slow rolls, NO I don't smoke those
Leave the blunts for the punks in front rows
I said mine, headline or deadline
You see redline, here comes your bedtime
I lay it down, lay it low
Now I'm off and runnin on some new rhyme flow
I flex break necks bust tecs mic checks son
Fill you full of lead and now get ready for the next one

It's goin down on the mound watch a nigga pitch
Bang your thang and hang your damn NECKS, now you gettin it
I see them go, and come, cause what they pumpin weak

Queens Day,Crown Royal,2001.0,"Queens Day, cash made on Hollis Avenue
Make it seem easy

From the days of arm call niggas hung around blocks
And corner stores
Herringbone chains and fantasies rushing the door
Niggas from Rochdale popping shells, snatching rings
Fly from Shirt Kings, from Queensbridge to 118
I had my eyes open, stepping out into the world
So fiendish, Ole English 'til I hurl, growing pains
A young kid, learning early how to know the game
USA Roller Skate rink, mobs and crews would take minks
Clean streets, hustlers, crack cocaine
Gave back by throwing block parties and basketball games
A lotta cash made on Hollis Ave., fast and change
High rollers was living, until the Task Force came
A lotta ghost towns and memories, bad blooded enemies
So many died with the same gangsta pride that entered me
Peace to them old timers, they who taught us
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters
We all glow, and I'm proud to be all that I know
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, who I die for
Survival, how we came a long way in solidarity
Don't let nothing try an spoil this day
To Run, D and Jay it's love and my thug salute
Cause real love's the only thing that comes above this loot
Carhart jeans, it makes me think of LL's Troops
Let's celebrate, it's Queens Day, this one's for you


Some come out they hometown and they never get dealt
But three teens from Queens took over the world and never let go
Just regular cats you know that just happened to blow
Not anonymous with Hollis, Jake, Darrell and Joe
Ay yo, we made so that others could grow
Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb and Nas Esco
Ain't taking credit, we showing pride, look at us now
Got haters mouths all open wide, wondering how
In some cases the only thing that father and son
Have in common is they love for Run
Been the illest since day one, I'm too advanced to ever be caught
Who's more legendary than me... that's what I thought
And if somebody wanna test mine, yo, watch this
Peter Piper picked peppers...
And see I knew you knew the next line, and I bet you said it
It's been a minute, I'm still the king of the world so don't forget it


This is for my Q dogs who live the block life, pa
We grew up on Old English, Summertime Roy Wilkins Park
Used to be the shit, why they have to stop
On the Ave niggas looting all the jewelry spots
Hit the Shirt Kings for an ill airbrush top
That'll match my Cortez Nikes
Niggas getting robbed at the back door coming out with bags
We used to get our gold fronts from Eddie's gold caps
What y'all know about that, I bet the whole Queens do
Around '86 with the chrome bass crew
The young guns and Lost Boys made the news
Queensbridge and Astoria, too, the story is true
So let's party for the borough and shit
And everybody come outside, cause it's Queens Day kid",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-queens-day-lyrics
30 Days,Run-D.M.C.,1984.0,"Heard that they said that it's rainin' men
But the offer that I make, it won't be made again
You don't have to write, you don't have to call
It's a one-time offer for nothing at all

And there's no red tape, I don't make it hard
You don't need cash money or a Master Card
I got easy terms, and a lay-away
But I need a quick decision, and I need it today

And if you find that you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days

Now have you ever seen a man with a guarantee?
Well you're lookin at him now, cause the man is me
And if you don't believe all the things I say
I'm certified 'prime' by the USDA

Now the name that I use is DJ Run
And I'm a fast-talkin, slow-walkin, number one
And if you don't believe all the words I say
Then you're a natural born fool who's got to be that way

I got a 50 rating and a 50 share
Every minute, every hour that I'm on the air
And when I come to town, I'm on a big marquee
It says (DJ Run) and me, D.M.C

And if you find that you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days

A good job and lots of money might not be enough
And to satisfy your needs it may be rough
But I take some care and treat you nice
And if it ain't sufficient once, I cold work it out twice

And if you find that you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days

I'm gonna give you everything that you ever need
If you need a pint of blood, then I'll even bleed
If you're lookin for a car, I will buy you two
And if you're lookin for a pet, I'll buy a kangaroo

If you need a vacation, we can fly the world
And you'll know I'll never look at another girl
I'm a single-minded man, and my mind is set
You're the lady of the '80s that I'm gonna get

And if you find you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-30-days-lyrics

Control of the game, I'm right here over the rain
A human pot of gold, I already had a lot of flow
Ready to rock steady with Run and make a lot of dough

You might tell from the way I talk
That sucker MC's is who I stalk
Create in a rhyme that is in formation

My ice glitter like hold up

Thinks he the bomb, bet his beeper stay blowed up""
So much frost on my wrist look my fist froze up
A photographer is tryin to get a little close up
Why cause I'm a star now?  Buy out the bar now?
Or I press one button, start up my car now?
I heard that you wanna spar now, so baby it's on
I spit flows, rip shows 'til the day that I'm gone
And this day I hit 'em off I'll have America sewn

I entered your home, lick you down, strictly to bone

You’re Blind,King of Rock,1985.0,"Tenement buildings, and skyscrapers

Are polluted and often invaded
With troubled hearts, and weakened minds
Living their lives and hoping to find
The golden key, to prosperity
Never have a grip on reality
This makes day to day living hard
Trumpin your fate, never peepin the card
You just goin through life without a trace
When the answers you seek are in front of your face
	You're blind! (2X)
	Tell 'em D!

You're headed for the top, or so you think
But that's not true for you, your life is on the brink
Of self-destruction, total corruption
You better get out or die from consumption
Sweat for a dollar, to get nothin back
Cause at the end of the week, you still get taxed
You'd even sell your soul to make your life correct
But with the rate of inflation you should eat your check
So you try to make a hustle, to get ahead
But the only thing you manage is to stay in the red
Coppin from John, to sell to Rex
And your jones for success has put your life in check
	You're blind! (2X)
	And you can't see
	You need to wear some glasses
	like D.M.C
	You're blind!

So you think the facts means you can't win
So you devote your time to a life of sin

Hangin out late is how you survive
Makin deals, talkin jive, and tellin lies
Pressure beatin you down
	Like you're not handlin
And all the while, your mind is ramblin
	About bein fly
Or even sly
	And bein held low in the public eye
You decide these things but you don't know why
	You're standin on a corner cold playin the post
	Cause another sucker you were chillin the most
	You're blind! (2X)
	Yo you can't see
	You need to wear some glasses
	like D.M.C
	You're blind! (2X)
	
You (Run) round talkin bout what you hate
Livin your life just to perpetrate
You think your style is chill, because you're always cold
With your platform shoes and your fake gold
	So you think you're bad
Sheer dynamite
But if you only knew the crew called you freak's delight

Wearin the tightest jeans, and shortest skirt
You think you're cold chillin, lookin like a jerk
No matter what you do, come out second rate
	Thinkin you're on time but you're already late
	You're blind
	You're blind!  And you can't see
	You need to wear some glasses
	like D.M.C
	You're blind!
	And you can't see
	You need to wear some glasses
	like D.M.C
	You're blind!
	The moral to the story may not be clear
	And the only way to catch it is to lend an ear
	Stop frontin so hard
	Why don't you peep your card?
	And your goals in life may not be far
	Because these words I say are meant for you to hear
	So if you bust these facts you will persevere

Pause for the cause, cause broken laws
Are just like broken jaws
They take a long time to heal

Before you break laws just pause!
I think that worked man (4X)

And if they offer you some say NO
Or pause
The reason I wrote this rhyme, is not to climb
But just to tell all mankind
That the use and abuse of drugs -- will what?
Will, blow, your, mind
Like dough makes bread, it goes straight to your head
You're misled and then you're dead
Now that's not fly, when you die
On a high
Like a trip, oooh, you make me sick
Ill, lookin like doo doo on a stick
You don't have to be a vic
Life is like a flick, so pause
Pause, p-pause, pause, p-p-pause
Alright y'all, now that you understand
My man Run never ran
I'm gonna take this mic yo my hand
And hand this to the one man band
Now pause, now pause
I'm Jay, I make up the trey
Now check out the dance that I display
It's called the pause
A new thing, on the dancefloor
First you move, then you stop
Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because
It's called the pause
Slammin, the dance is slammin
Pause, the people are jammin
Stop again, back to the groove
I show you how to move
Pause
It's simple, just like stop and go
You can pause on the fast or slow
Participate, won't you all get down
Here's a solo from my homeboy Stanley Brown
Ahh yeah, I like this R&B shit...

Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?

We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play

Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?

I just go through life with my glasses blurred

You noticed one time he was your man

It’s Over,Crown Royal,2001.0,"Gloria sit tibi semper
Sit tibi domine, sit tibi Christe
Uh-huh, huh, uh-huh, ahh-haa, ahh-haa, see
When y’all heard that, all I’m doin is laughin’ at all y’all niggas
That’s been frontin’ on my mans and them man
These niggas started this shit man

When it comes to the shows that I rock and the flows that I drop
Y’all know Run kills the mic
Can’t forget about the Olds that I got, and the Rolls in the spot
Y’all know I ain’t stealed it, right?
How you gonna take a old song, been around so long
So So Def done made it tight
Done went from a deejay to a emcee
To the R-E-V like overnight
Everybody lookin’, players get shook when
Rev Run walk up in the spot
Even all the crooks that been livin’ outta Brooklyn
Just can’t help but point a lot
Everywhere I go now, people say “Oh, wow!”
Cause they know how I get
It don’t matter if it’s Motown, all the way to yo’ town
You can’t slow down my hits

Can’t slow it down, man… Think about this! From 1983 to 2000. It’s 2001 and these niggas still on the run? Y’all, niggas, just crazy, y’all out here tryin’ to front, like… they ain’t the reason, you went and bought a pair of shelltoe. The fuck is wrong witch’all?

People wanna hurt Rev Run, say cause I got dough
That I must be a type of fraud
But you know the thing that’s funny, this garden ain’t money
Then how rich is the lawn
Went got JD, made me crazy
Play me up in the club
Got a brand new Mercedes, for my lady
But see me, I’m older
To the Bentley and all that come out the garage
On the side of a grand prestigous home
Y’all ask if I’m blessed by God, player what you thought?
What Rev you seen on chrome?
Gotta make these dollars, comin’ out of Hollis
Got my collar on too
I got the rhyme and the beat and the vibe from the street
And now the rest is on you

The rest is on me man. Let me let y’all know somethin’. The first rap group to get on MTV, hard heavy, ya heard me? And then, they gon’ turn around, and resurrect Aerosmith like… You know what I mean, boy, ain’t enough of that, knahmsayin? If it wasn’t for these cats, man. Y’all wouldn’t know nothin’ about no LL Cool J or Beastie Boys, y’knahmean? And this comin’ from me, I’m lookin’ at it, man, since I been 13 years old man, I’ve been watchin’ these cats, man. I ain’t no old nigga, but I know, nigga, ya heard me, y’knahmsayin? So stop all that frontin’, man. Stop all your frontin’, ya heard me?! Yeah!

Forget the hits that I made or the gig that I played
If you had love back in the day (That’s right)
Just raised up my kicks and I changed what I spit
And returned as the Run y’all love today (Yeah)
I pick the mic back up, came right back up
To the top where I’m ‘posed to be (‘Posed to be)
And when the track light up, y’all can back right up
Y’all players too close to me

You know what I used to like? The way my man used to come on stage and grab the mic. And just throw the damn stand across the stage, man. Then he used to tell his man like, “Yo, D, come right here in the middle of the stage, grab yo’ shit and say what you gotta say”. And you know what D used to say? He used to say, “Party people! Your dreams have now been fulfilled, get out your seats, and let’s get ill. That’s right y’all, we’re not just rough, we more than tough. And when it comes to {shit} like this, ha, we got enough!” Y’knahmean? You know who the fuck I am, you know my name, you know my game. It’s So So Def, Run-D.M.C.

I'm the epitome of royalty, you versus me is a joke
I'm a rage and major blaze, you cigarette smoke
Your video's number one and that was part of our plan
Went from ""Rock Box"" to a whole countdown jam
Took rock music, switched it and flipped it and made it raw
Anywhere you played, we played it before in eighty-four
Every show, a hundred thousand people or more
Fame'll still give us tours and we be tryin not to take 'em all
I bake 'em all, quicker than Sara Lee, come battle me
Imagine that, what a site that'll be
Front page of the Times, I can read the headlines now
Rev. Run beat clown down for tryin to take his crown


I'm the reason you started rhymin
I'm the reason rap sales started climbin
That's why I'm still headlinin
I'm the king and before I stop y'all cats gon' learn
Yeah y'all niggas wanna burn wait your turn
Run I'm a living legend, my suggestion is learn your lesson
I leave you stressin confessin (?) and strivin for blessing
And whatever your impression it better be, that we the top pedigree
Bringin y'all enegry since eighty-three
I run this here since way back when
I pick up a pair of shells and make y'all wear 'em again
If you thought it I done did it
Heard it I done spit it
New cats wanna pay their respects then son I'm with it
But if not, I'ma reclaim the top of the charts
Doin shows for dough flows rip 'em apart
Other than that, I'll just be holdin my own

	Not the best, not the worst, cause my name is Run
	And I'm second cause I wreck it, that you want to see
	An emcee (like D) inside the place (to be)
	And have you heard that he is third and his name is Jay
	I'm Run the Ace
	D's the Deuce
	and Jay's the Tre'
{*Jam Master Jay cuts*}

I'm the rapper of the year and this the year of the rap
And I'm never drinkin beer, it's champagne at the tap
And I'm cold makin money on a regular basis
Pullin out, knockin sucker MC faces
Travel round the world with my mind at ease
No Calvin Klein, just wearin Lee's
Got credit in countries I've never been
Cause the records I write are in the top ten
The top of the chart, is where I stay
But I also chill, around the way
In Hollis, Queeens, is where I stop
On the streets with the beats is where I walk

When I perform, many hearts I warm
I'm better known, as the Quiet Storm
I don't talk too much but I got beef
When I kill MC's, I cause grief
Devestating mic control is my main goal
My name is Darryl, and his name is (Joe)
The Master of music his name is Jay
Leave us alone, and let us play
We give it up, and turn it loose
We're not like Dr. Seuss or Mother Goose
Sucker MC's like punks who are picking flowers
Go for yours, WE WENT FOR OURS!
{*Jam Master Jay cuts*}
	Start at 3, end at 6
	Jam Master Jay is on the mix
	For all the young ladies
	and all the chicks
	We got all of the girls
	on our tips
	Don't buy gold lighters
	only Bic's
	Rock all microphones
	just for kicks

Sucker MC's I will be snuffin
In my pocket I'll keep on stuffin
When I say I'll beat em up I won't be bluffin
They can't beef cause that ain't nothin
But it don't matter, my pocket gets fatter
I got more hats than the Mad Hatter

Well I'm the rapper with the mic, drive a Caddy not a bike
Drop a rhyme in your face, and you'll damn sure like
He's an MC with the rhyme know the day and the time
Never ever goin low, cause he only climb
(And Jay's the DJ with the) cut (move your arm) and your butt
So D take the mic, huh hah

Say what?  I will not stop, I will not quit
Because some at the top but I'm on the tip
That's as high on the top as you can get
And you best believe, I'll be on it
So before you decide, to try me out
I'm gonna let you all know what I'm all about
I'm a fresh MC, who's on his way
To be an MC with the most to say
And to all those out there, that don't know me
I go by the name of D. M. C
In the place to be, I will MC
The Master of the Ceremony cause it's easy to D
Control of the mic, is so devestating
That all other rappers you will soon be hating
No matter what race, creed or color
When we perform things don't get duller!

Don’t sneak this peak, because I keep on taking
The lead with speed, and records keep on breaking
I pop and drop, all op-position
And pop Hip-Hop, cause I’m the top, position

For a mill I thrill, but I’m still a trooper

Sucker M.C.’s (Krush-Groove 1),Together Forever: Greatest Hits 1983-1991,UnKnown,"Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some emcee rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Def and it went this way
Took a test to become an emcee
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
And then we're talking autographs, years of laughs
Champagne, caviar, and bubble baths
You see, that's the life that I lead, and
You sucker MC, this is who I be
So take that and move back, catch a heart attack
Because there's nothing in the world, that Run will ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a be -boy's stance
And rock on the mike and make the girls want to dance
Fly like a dove, they come from up above
I'm rockin on the mike and you can call me Run Love
I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin' girls just move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride
It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker emcee, you just ain't right
Because you're bitin all your life, you're cheatin on your wife
You're walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin on the ave, chillin' with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
Ah with the one two three, three to two one
My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face
Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker emcee's, you sad face clown
You're a five-dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man
You're a sucker emcee, and you're my fan
You try to bite rhymes, all lines are mine
You're a sucker emcee in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin' from the wackest part of town
Tryin to rap but you can't get down
You don't even know your English, your verbs or noun
You're just a sucker emcee you sad-faced clown
So DMC if you're ready, the people rockin' steady
You're drivin big cars, get your gas from Getty
I'm DMC in the place to be, I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens
And I love eatin chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love to style
I'm the emcee you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
With who? me myself and my microphone
All my rhymes are street delight
So here's another one for why'all to bite
When I rhyme I never quit
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
'Cause it takes a lot to entertain
And sucker emcee's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with a hip and a hop
You gotta let em know you'll never stop

Rappers won't be dissin after this rap song
Cause they sing like Rodney King, ""Can't we all just get along?""
Chorus

From a harder core, I'm kickin the raw
I wreck it on tour, I'm breakin your jaw
This is what Run-D.M.C.'ll be about y'all
I make the party people want to scream and shout y'all
I'm just a b-boy, so watch me destroy
You best believe in you're receivin D.M.C. boy
I used to explode, I never let go
I let the tec go back because I said so
Yeah I'm a hoodlum, but I'm a good one
So punks gunnin for my run I wish they would come
So back up, Mr. Softy cause you're not hard
You're never comin off because I got God
Just ?? ?? and get a beat down
Never weak kid, I come up with more street sounds
Rhymes galore and soarin 'cross the floor an'
Some more is pourin, knockin down your door an'
Chorus

C'mon and jump to the rhythm I give em is what I give em
When I get em I just hit em and split em
And when I split em lit em up like a bulb in the dark
I made you blink you figure out, cause I know you're the mark
I gotta lotta what I gotta, that'll be what I got
So step to me or D.M.C and it'll be in your heart
Now ease up back off the bo-zack, you know that you bite
You think you're doin me or D? Nigga please.. (what?)

IT'S NOT FUNNY!

Take The Money And Run,Crown Royal,2001.0,"Let me tell you bout what I love in Gina
Love is like no other couldn't get in between her
Always stayed fly man I wished that you seen her
Said they had a scheme but nobody believed her
No real job cause she stay in the streets
Gina did nails but her love made beats
When they wanna eat they just walked in the store
They took what they wanted man the illest you saw
Til one day they went up kindin fiendin with ice
Butter like(?) the jeans and Gina said ""The rings are nice""
Next thing you know they wanna pull off a heist
Shook took a look and shot the jeweler twice
Diamonds all shinin as they flew in the air
Butter actin up and grabbin stuff by the pair
Gina at the door cause she good with the gun
They both grabbed the money and run

C'mon, take the money and run {*v/ scratched: ""Run""*}
C'mon, take the money and run {*v/ scratched: ""Run""*} hey, hey, hey

Spoonie was a rookie that was new on the scene
Used to be a thug now he's doin it clean
Ironic he was coppin and they gave him the spot
Knew Butter back from Hollis used to chill on the block
Seen Butter round the way with a brand new Benz
Gina lookin pretty in the city with friends
Spoonie's sayin yo I gotta get these ends
And these are the two I gotta apprehend
A big boy from Hollis promised not to tell
And lead these cops on a long long trail
Spoonie saw Gina and the chick turned pale
Runnin sayin somethin like she don't got bail
Butter said promise me I won't see jail
Spoonie want a watch and a brand new cell
Butter and Gina moved to Pensacola
Spoonie got a Roley and a Motorola

All I can say is about the story
Is livin like Butter Love is not for me
Let me show you how we get the money legit
Jack B. Nimble was nimble, and he was quick
Rev. Run, D.M.C. is the +Kings of Rock+
Rolled to the top and then we never did drop
You still here to jam me in two thousand and one

Can I Get a Witness,Down With the King,1993.0,"Chorus: Run-D.M.C. (repeat 4X)
Can you kick it like I kick it when I kick this
Can I get a witness? (Yes you can!)

New jacks better back up, before they get smacked up
By the R-U-N-D-M-C (that's where it's at cuz)
Known as the tough cats, kickin tough rough raps
In jeans, leather jackets, my Adidas and gangster hats
A ?? ?? ??, yo here we go
I'm tired of brothers tryin to front like they don't hear me though
Knowin if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be able
Cause I'm the man with the hand that rocked the cradle, uhh
A lot of punk for the chunk baby that's a bet
Album number seven and we still ain't finished yet
I didn't get old, I got better at the craft
Sat back and watched you try to kick it but you made us laugh
So get back, you already had your chance to dance
You proved you had no waist to fit in this man's pants
Word to God, I'm back fo' sho'
Hollis Queens gettin wreck so act like you know
Chorus

As I spit this and get this out of my throat
I need a witness to get with this - take notes
Great quotes like boats float flowin so dope
Never givin up hope, nope, know what I wrote
I'mma saver spectator educator entertainer
You wanna ask me, can't be now or later
I'm a rough rugged person, been that way from the start
Darryl Mack got the knack to put the H in heart
(And it ain't no fun, to step to D and Run
But if you wanna step up, step up and get that ass - done)
A reporter with recorder was recordin the slaughter
As I'm peepin 'cross the border leapin water keepin order
Lit it up like a spliff, get a whiff of this hit
Cause I flick em like bits, and I bust 'em like zits
Dippin down to grip this microphone I rip this
I'm glad not sad I flipped this, now can I get a witness
Chorus

Can I get a witness, can I hit a, never been ?? fitness
Don't play like I'm bitter, when you come with your best
And I make a suggestion save it David with your bull
Cause you're full of congestion
Soft? Never me, never get more hard
The King of Kings, Lord of Lords, is the one Lord God
Can I can I get a witness ?? ?? next
To my God, DJ Run and I kick it

Suckers suckers suckers
Suckers get flipped when I start to flip
Slip in a clip when they die I dip
Still spray a gun, see how DJ Run
Leave a sucker stunned, gettin ill to the drum
Mic check and I wreck and I'm second to none
Accept it don't regret it I expect to get dumb
So don't you forget this, we'll put you on the hitlist
To stick ya stick ya wicked wickedest can I get a witness

Come come and see the way we play Then that's your way day
In and out, sendin shouts out the mouth
If in doubt, chin em out, grill his mouth and send his snout South
I'm out - of course the force from up North
Ain't up for grabs yup whattup then it's up yours!
You see we ain't open up doors - that's BUSINESS
We knocked those things off the motherfunkin HINGES
Whoever said we fell off, I have no taste for it
We couldn't fall off a skateboard, don't WAIT for it
Cruise the city hard, tell your city we're in charge
Watch it gitty-God or you'll be head and titty scarred
This alliance by my mind and rhymes are more than shiny
So in the 90's watch your tiny heiny get grimy

Livin larger, I give it to the highest bidder
So ante up, and come on out your pockets punk
The punk rocker, is gonna lock ya in a trunk

Livin in the city - the crack the mack and all that
Easy does it, is it was it
The black or white that Friday night
In those racist places - let's get it right
Ah to the maximum, and keep askin 'um
When the city gonna fix where the BLACKS are from
And every day around the way another one got
Bucked in his head - from a gunshot
No chance in advance for the ambulance
Cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
A brother died, the mother cried, it was a pity
But that's how it goes down when you're livin in the city
{*Jam Master Jay cuts ""What's it all about?"" samples*}

Just a hard rock, call him a hard rock
In the metropolis there's no stoppin this
Can't agree with society poppin this
Disagree with the plea when they coppin it
Some men pretend the end will come soon
They gather what they can and them BOOM
You played yourself, you made your wealth;
The deal was dealt - now your health is in question
Three Card Molly, hoodlums - who are we?
Pollution, prostitution, In God We -
- need a solution, revolution, substitution
For the thing's that we're abusing
Pity the city, for the people livin out on the streets
Yo we homeless, the homeless need to eat
There's no progress for the rest
God bless for less

And now it's tumblin down
Freedom of speech for each

NOW HERE WE GO as I flow and show and kick

The Ave.,Back From Hell,1990.0,"These are the words that I wrote so I hope that ya don't man
I'll never joke about the coke that you're smok-in
Understand you're fuckin up, fuckin up the block
Got shot rocked and that's just where the shit stops
..
What's the meaning of this? I must be dreaming
Everybody's ?? when I see men dealing
For a rhyme or rope, or a dime of coke
Sometimes I rhyme when I'm crying broke
Many many many records broke laws, broke jaws
A few months ago I had to ""Pause""
During that time, me and my man
Was chilling on the corner with a quart in our hands
A beef broke out, at Soul Kitchen spot
It was crazy Baby Pop, someone got shot
I seen him drop - then came the cops
Sayin, ""Nobody run - everybody stop""
I wanted to run, cause I was carryin my gun
Darryl Mack packin mine, strapped with my nine
Everyone on the wall, that's what the cop said
Everyone complied, except Bald Dread, he said
""Blood claat boi me nah hafa deal wit dat
Yo I'm a superstar for de world dem call 'I'm Darryl Mack""
I turned around and said, ""Word up cop!""
He said, ""D.M.C., take your ass down the block""
If it happened to him, it could happen to you
Cause that's what's happenin on The Avenue
When I.. ""uhh, uhh uhh, uhh.. uhh..""
""Na-na-na-na-na! The Ave.""

Now on The Ave. (what?) people steal and they dealin away
I got the feelin the illin will never ever pay
Cause on the street, you're never in the fast lane
You go to jail or get a bullet in your brain
People laugh and smile at a stick-up
A young man in a rut, shakin a big cup
People pass his ass and say, ""Tough luck""
To waste time for a dime is cold fucked up
A loud shot in the air - not rare
A brother fell to the ground, nobody cares
You ask why, the baby cry, a man laugh
Nobody give a damn, that's how they livin on The Ave
... AUUUGH!

Away from The Ave. they have what's called the backstreets
Another world of girls that crawl the backseats
Systems that are kickin, sinkin many black beats
(This and that goin on ??? street)
I remember the time there was a jam in ???
??, the music, no ?? til after dark
That's when the shit starts happening
(Brother from The Ave. this and that again)
Body move in the back and a quarter in the jar
Find the rules by the basketball court in the park
And the ? by the bench where the 40 dogs spark
The crowd crowds around like they found Noah's Ark
The young, hung, and swung on a swing
Glidin and slidin and ride the ding-a-ling
I didn't see a kid by the see, so he saw
(Near the monkey bars, funky cars we adore)
I'm throwin fate to the gate ?? ??
(And my man from Japan got vicked for sure)

The beats are clear, the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor, or see a nurse
Just listen to the music cause first things first

First of all, get off the wall
It's time to party, so have a ball
We slow it down, so get on up

I see real well cause I have four eyes

I do not sing, but I'll make a song
You'll love your whole life, and I hope you live long

Strong as an ox, threat out the box
The crowd so loud, they comin in flocks
And when we come on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock there's nothing soft (so)


We won't only rock the house, but we'll house the rock
We won't stroll but we'll roll straight to the top
We're Run-D.M.C., and Jay makes three

The baddest b-boys in his-to-ry

When I record it, you'll be rewarded
You know my song is great cause y'all all applaud it
Not P-C-P, or L-S-D

And when I rock the crowd can't wait to be right there
Even my kids that ain't yours still yours
Cause you love 'em and you treat 'em like your very own
We be holding hands and I be holding doors
And with my mother-in-law spend time alone
Call about five hundred times a day
When I'm off and gone cause I'm on the road
And when I'm on the phone you know I wanna be home
Cause that's the one and only spot where I really belong
You know I love calling you the preacher's wife
With the keys to the Bentley living it up
And everybody would know, done seen us in the video
On the dance floor straight cutting it up
I love you baby

Comin' off, time and time, and that's whether
You, your crew, knew, whatever
I did, done, do, I'm this clever
I come again and win, and you'll never
See a man like me, your idol
So joke, smoke, toke, but this title
The rhyme is mine, fine, and so vital
It's time for me to rock, my recital
Gonna tell you about a groove, that's comin'
From the heart in part, and just one in
A million, or you, will be bummin'
So check the time, the rhyme, that comes from it
Inside your brain, remain, so just keep it
Plain, sane, refrain, so just peep it
Look, see it, check, but never stop it
The hook, comes, next, so Jay drop it! ""I'm not..""

Gotta go Joe you know, to the T-O, P
And see Dee, you know, we know
The way today I say, I'm not a Leo
The King is Dee and Jay, he score ??
That's left to smile a while, keep grinnin'
This past style, is wild, and I'm winnin'
Roll, stroll, control, and I'm coolin'
The King of Rock and Roll, and I'm rulin'
I rhyme, shock and stop, and I'm droppin'
I pop hip-hop, I'm hip-hoppin'
Receive a G, believe while I'm throwin'
It's D.M.C. it's me, I'm not goin ""I'm not..""

Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

He's a one-man band, in his own right
Jam Master jams to the broad daylight
No instruments needed, just two record players
A stage, a crowd, and two rhyme sayers

Ingredients are here, so have no fear
Definitely defy the position is clear

You couldn't be late, hesitate to debate
Jam Master is here and you could not wait
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

Now he's the Jam Master, and we're the emcee's
Like lightning and thunder, we're knockin down trees
While sucker DJ's, are bustin out Z's
My man Jam Master's stretchin hard 'cross seas
So why don't you listen, or you'll be missin
The cuts and the scratchin bass treble and the mixin
The force and the power comin hour after hour
So get up off the walls don't you be a wallflower

The meaning of Master means he's ahead
The meaning of Jam is ??
The records that he plays when the crowd's up on it

He adds a little soul, to rock'n'roll
Every record that he touches, turns to gold
He's well conducted, self-instructed
His style's worthwhile, heavenly constructed
Mechanically inclined, and if you don't mind
He adds spice to your life time after time
I think it's bout time, to heed the long lecture
We rock our rhymes for the Jam Master

Puller of people (controller of crowd)

Slayin MCs', make 'em walk the plank

Sophisticated sounds, not soft or sour
Servin' you suckers sellin' dreams in the shower
Rockin this party, hour after hour
If a girlie try to diss me (Oh my God!) I won't allow her!

Not soft, not a sucker, could never be a sap
You might get jacked, 'cause you talk crap

From the old school on down to the youth
Since the days, that I was the age of
""Three""; stop - listen to me
This is how it used to be - Go!
Stand on the ? line, why?
You did a crime now the time is mine
To school you and your crew, why?
Using my brother
Stop - selling and killing one another
Take some time, to see what's missin'
Brothers in the ? like you, we on a mission
Thinking back from the sale you made
And back home, a grave is what your brother paid
His life, 'cause of a system
Now you think you're down, you cold dissed him
Shut up, cause I'm fed up, with this culture
I'm flying high in the sky, a big vulture
Waiting and debating, to see who's next
For ""brothers and sisters"" of the opposite sex
So hold on, keep it intact
And go on, flow on, positive black
B-boys be black be proud, right on
""Come on! You know I'm proud to"" be black

They'll soup you up, til you think you're large
Got a spot on tour, but I'm still in charge
A big gig, a shindig, don't renege

That extends from the hands of a branch on a tree

Is he the Jam Master?

Slays suckers one by one
Rather chill than kill
Cause the killing's no fun
So together forever
Crew be tougher than leather
We gonna slay the bad ones
Until there are none

Who be less when they 'fess, against the test

And I insist that this, with a flick of the wrist
Will be kid not dissed at the top of the list

Crashin mashin and bashin, my name is Run, call me Joe
Fat as ever and clever, and never second to none
Wearin leather and better (What's your name?)  DJ Run
But in the summer's a bummer, cause I leave em at home
Just Adidas and me, and ? and D on the phone
Diggin eyein the crown, sellin skills by the pound
Makin breakin and takin all of the suckers around
Puttin fear in the heart, at the top of the chart
Stunning gunning and funning, cause Run's running this art
DJ's facing the rage, never losing a show
Cause when the set is a match, then they're ready to go
Swervin curvin deservin, the grass grow everyday
Cause makin money ain't funny, ain't that right JMJ?

Full in effect, set comin correct
Yet gainin respect, still breakin a neck

skankin

I said I rip some, tearin' 'em up, a big up

I'm born again, I got a friend the Lord I rearrange
But other than that I'm livin fat and ain't nuthin' changed
Big Willie still in your grilly, you better block son
I bust you up and then I blast you with my bop gun
A million times rhyme risin to the prime
While another nigga's cuts get bucks, like it's a dope rhyme
Be instead I'd rather leave another brother dead
'Cause yet another brother deaded from the slow dread
I'm makin' papers, brothers catchin' vapors
Try to lick shot, you get got, catch you later
This ain't The Cosby Show you know what it's like A Different World
We're livin inside a world where you get the cash, you hit the girl
So check the hypeness, I'm not livin like this

You see I'm Uptown and rockin the dope spot
So I dip to the dive, thrive and come alive
The two MCs that make ya name survive
For alla y'all, my name is Run
I rock big parties, have big fun
The mind blowin, body rockin MC fiend
Who came along and made his home and chained the toll on my team
The cool calm brother from around the way
Where I'm from, DJ Run met a kid named ""Jay""
We go Uptown, and come back home
(With who?) ""Me, myself and my microphone""

Gotta gotta gotta gotta keep it on
Gotta gotta gotta keep it on

""Give us respect""
Get much respect when I flex my TEC
Unique when I speak and wreck your set
I used to take the train to go to school
The microphone holdin on the golden rule
Pop pop pop, you can't stop my flow
I rock it in my pocket everytime I go
Straight Uptown, I come back home

Ragtime,Tougher Than Leather,1988.0,"I.. woke up this morning got ready to roll
Put on my green bomber it was, freezing cold
Applied longjohns with Adidas not matching
I called up Jam Master cause I knew he was scratching
(Whassup?)  Jay to the telly music, loud as hell
He said - ""Hold up Run,"" *DING DONG*, ""it's the bell!""
Jay to the door as he leaves the cut
For his eyes a surprise, ""D.M.C. WHASSUP?""

I need a little help Jay, I got a little problem
A guy like yourself, maybe you can help me solve em
I only want to know why this happens all the time
(What?)  Everywhere I go, I start to rap and rhyme
I rock them in the day (yeah you rock em every night)
I rock em when I left so def I knew something was wrong (alright)
I rhyme when I am sleeping, I rhyme when I'm awake
When I was nine I said a rhyme by putting candles on my cake
I just came from the bank (you said a rhyme?) A rhyme so funny
A song about the line so long they all gave me their money
That's why I came to you, you're my friend (yes that is true)
Said maybe Jay knows what to say, he'll tell me what to do..

Hmmmm.. yo you go get Joe, and all the rhymes you made
And we'll go to the bank, AND WE CAN ALL GET PAID!

Cruisin down the block, in the sixty-six Olds
Girls are on the jock like the ride was a Rolls
Feelin kinda great, got change for the toll
Suckers gotta wait, that's your fate, poor soul
Heard you on the records and I heard you on the tapes
Stop, switch the conversation over to grapes, because
You're not bustin none, so stop fussin son
You're not down with Rush, they call us Russ and Run
Since that's the company, you won't be chumpin me

Party Time,Back From Hell,1990.0,"Intro/Chorus: {unknown singers}
It's party time, and we came here to party
So get up and move your body, cause it's party time
It's party time, and we came here to party
So get up and move your body, cause it's party time

Come inside, the time is fine and I'm
Really ready to drop a heavy bassline
On the crowd that's loud and proud the rhyme
Is mine and the jam of party time
We're well equipped to flip and trip you out
I never slip but I rip the jam no doubt
So grab a girl ?? I know you wanna play
The funky jam I never quit until the break of day
Here we go on a Afrolistic journey
Here come the jam but don't forget to bring ??
To make sure the beat is upheld
The beat is raw and Run's banged it well
To make it take you to your destination
It's just the jam that slam across the nation
I gotta rock, you know I gotta good rhyme
So grab a girl, and listen to the good times
Now sweat til you're wet and get done
And I'll bet you get some..
Heat to release the piece to have fun
So just grab a girl, cause it's party time
Chorus

Groove, breathe, wind blowin the leaves
I'm at ease, can you feel the funky sensation
I might take a vacation
On the seven seasons
Reasons to be cheerful, sun shinin, Run rhymin
I'm right behind him
Jay, you know where to find him
Shinin like a diamond, if I'm lyin I'm dyin
{girrrrrrrrrrrls, drive me crazy}
So fine, goin out of my mind
I keep em goin, they sayin, I've got the rhyme
Ooze, cruise, gonna take a cruise
Jing-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling I'm never singin the blues
Afros, studios, doin shows
Four-O's I suppose, no one knows
Who's rockin the hoes, tell me that
You gotta be (funky)
Chorus

Now let your body be free
And yeah, go you know
Never slow the flow til it's time to go
Cause that ain't the way you play the crowd
You gotta mingle, single girls allowed
So round em up, get a cutie in the spot
Look at the booty, do me, time to rock
And make all the girls give up the play
Get on the floor and make your day
So you're illin, still it's four o'clock
You won't leave til you see em close the spot
You gotta stay til they play the last song
Til the night gives light to the early morn'
Check the place and the taste of the bass is on the case
A negative thought that you brought just erased
Put away the nine and keep in mind
That the jam'll slam when it's party time

Yo Run my papa was CRAZY, crazy as can be
And my mama said that he left ME when I was three
But my mama never told me he was out of his mind
Drinkin wine, all the time, never earnin a dime

He was so in debt somebody broke his neck
And on the day that papa died, they wrote on his grave

Seen this girl on the block by the boondock
On the spot she was down for the boot knock
Drop top, she was rockin the 2Pac
Said, ""Yo D, not me, whatchu got?""
D said, ""She's a vivrant thang..
Vivrant thang, vivrant thang""

Seen a girl so crystal clean, I mean
Since I been on the scene I dream of girls
In tube tops, pools on rooftops
Now this girl, who cruises to 2Pac
Get this girl in my bathtub, give her a backrub
My bathroom's like a nightclub
A few ladies in my den, fondlin
A few ladies in the den, so bring some Jello in
And a mighty fine fellow in like myself
To organize the panties on the shelf

Them girls, them girls, them girls I do adore
I like 'em sweet or fine, a genuine divine
All kinds I love 'em all
Them girls, them girls, them girls around the way
A like a lemon to a lime, the women so fine
Sometimes they make me say

Had a fly girl cold called her honey
Went in spent up all my money
Fred went to bed with a girl from college (what?)
D told me she was lookin for dollars (dollar)
I be the MC that don't get played (played)
Girls come check in but the don't get paid (paid)
They might get naked but they don't get laid (laid)
Been schoolin these girls since I made first grade

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
I like the small girls, I like the tall girls
I like all the girls, bustin dirty call girls
So Run let's bring them girls in
And their girlfriends, but don't let the squirrels in
As for their boyfriends, they'll find joy when
Their girlfriends come home and bring Limp Bizkit toys in
I like to rate shit when I'm in the snakepit
But no silicon cause I don't like the fake shit

 Them girls (16X)

Yo yo
Girls delight line, girls galore (ore)
Girls I never even seen before (ore)
The way they swayed and make me smile (smile)
But Run get the dimes on the top of the pile (pile)

Girls are freakin, things are good
The girls can fill up my neighborhood
But don't take my sunshine, I'll be okay
As long as them girlies, are here to stay

Knuckleheads in my face for a second

That a sucker might jump and try to bait
So kill that noise and get out my FACE (punk)
And let a real MC collect dollars
The true crew and few come from Hollis, Queens
And by all means necessary
My vocabulary is very extensive, and expensive
So hard it'll put you in intensive care
Proceed with caution
Often suckers get lost in the sauce when
Faces just start speakin on faces
And leavin traces, other races be mocked
And it sparks a fight, day and night
Dark and light - different types of faces

Faces, faces
And everywhere you go you see..
Yeah yeah yeah
Break!  As we come back on..
As we come back on..
All in your face, I place this rhyme!
Facin this crew, you're facin your doom
You got punched in the face
As soon as you heard this tune!
I race at a pace with no shoelaces
To racist faces, placin disgraces
Taste the bass of the racial facial
Disgraceful tasteless racist faces
Get out my face, don't bass, don't waste my time
My brother, I'm not color blind
I walk the face of the Earth, face death
Face the best and I'll just
Rip flip and trip won't shut up or let up
Get out my face so we can go head up

Hypin the stereotype of a face

Haste makes waste, don't trace to other places

Faces sweatin you and they sweatin faces
Around around the world, international faces

The way she looks that Jay must say
Somethin bout the way my afro is growin
But is it funky? (YEAH!) Well okay
Is she jockin my 'fro or my fade?
Do she want me because of my name?
I like the ladies, sweet and serious
Not those hoes, that plays, the game
On every Tom Dick and Harry
Shawn Jerry John Nick Curly Moe and Larry
You thinkin you married?  Well you CRAZY
My baby you won't carry
Cause I like a girl that's low-key
That's how it's gotta be to be with me
And I'll take her to all the exotic places

Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we're not just rough, we're more than tough
And when it comes to rhymes, we got enough

It's like that y'all, and we don't stop the body rock
Now it's together (forever) forever (together)
Run-d. M. C. And we're tougher than leather
We're making and breaking and snatching and taking
The deal's for real we could never be faking

I'm chilling, he's cooling, I'm a king that's ruling
Preach and teach and always schooling

See, we're learning, and earning, the tables keep turning
To be like us, you could cold be yearning
Pulsating dominating up above
Cold chilling and I'm willing, the name's run-love

Creating devastating in the place to be
Full of soul and mic control because it's easy to ""d""

Beat making, never faking, chilling all of the time
For playing rhyme saying, I get mine

No way to rock me, no way to stop me
It's seems quite shocking to those that mock me
And that's not all, mc's have the gall
To pray and plan for my downfall
But I'm not running, I'm just stunning
Smart not stupid cause I'm so cunning
Mc's regret it, I'm upsetting
My recitals take titles and titles I'm betting

Like that y'all, so just keep above
See my name is dj run, they call me run-love
Creative creator, creating the rhyme
Devastating devastator not doing a crime
Making beats every day, and I get mine
The biggest star going far, so check the shine
Big winner, not a sinner when I do my thing
I might have a sling or a fling cause I'm down with the king
Biggest rap no crap, I do not sing
You want a show, let me know, just give me your ring
Like that y'all, we're just keeping it on
D. M. C. My man, to the break of dawn rock

I'm ill, I chill, with skill I kill
And none of my rhymes are run of the mill
I cause grief, I'm chief, there is no beef
And if there's beef I knock out teeth
Mc's act dumb, they know where I'm from
The king from queens and I'm down with run

I take a stand my man, and I won't sit
Cause I'm the real deal, like coke is it
Then you won't find my name in the yellow page
Cause run only speaks when it's on the stage
I got a rhyme in line that's easy to find
With a sketch so check, so one of a kind
Got two mc's and one dj
Grab at least 20 g's when we play
So D. M. C. My boy, my mellow my man
So get on the mic and won't you take the stand

My rock is hard, you can't pull my card
I'm a shining star, shining near and far
Shining like the sun on a day of fun
Always on the move cause I'm down with run
I'm the cool and calm, I'm the calm and cool
I'm not a fool, I went to school
My name is D. M. C. I tell no lie
And I graduated from cooley high
I am the only rapper who will not die

Get Open,Down With the King,1993.0,"We get open! (8X)

I seen you hopin and scopin I'm copin as I get you wide open
Dyin and lyin while you're cryin and mopin
Flippin and rippin money-grippin be gropin
The baddest apparatus got the fad as I'm open
I never slip or fell, I raise up ?? well
I bash you in your bell, you got static in hell
And when you seen the fire you got jealous, you jeal'
So sucker just retire, you admire my skill
I'm never the type of guy to close the door in your face
I got you wide open, Run is runnin a race
Takin what's mine and what's left is a waste
Leavin them behind and all suckers on the chase
Got a dope track, comin real dope an'
I get legit, we get, I get..
We get open! (14X)
We get..

Word up!
I freak the beat up, boom! Now bass up, pick the pace up
Jam Master blastin through the plaster cause I has ta
Hard rocks like to rock it, you can't stop it
?? Poll in ten years, I'mma walk away a prophet ??
You don't stop, I stop styles in the attic
Kick the fat flavor that you can't be mad at
?? what's the matter, more mix in granny's batter
Run-D.M.C.'s fatter, so kill the chit-chatter
Zigga zigga Jay, jigga jigga pump pump
Gettin bigger Babe Pah, figure nigga freak the funk
3 in the Head, ten yards to go
Blow up the spot for those that forgot
Stay stable as a navel, try an' rhyme rough and able

Boom boom boom, broke-in, got ya jok-in
Me, Run and D, we're gettin open!
We get open! (16X)

Open the door, let me in
So my rhyme, can now begin
Forget the hit and all the (shit)
That you used to get with, because it's not legit
I rewrote the script, I flip the ship
I bust a lip, it's time to rip the mic I grip
Darryl McDan', use abuse
I bruise the crews, I refuse to lose
My composure, I will bulldoze ya
A froze enclosure, where no one knows ya
Who dat - who flew that head, well it's said
D put the head to bed and you're dead
Moms is cryin, MC's is dyin
I'm knockin down jaws with paws, like a lion
I wrote the dope quotes, now the punks is scopin
I knuckle up and punch and bust his fronts open
We get open! (8X)

Ahhh,Crown Royal,2001.0,"Uh-huh, yeah, what?  Yo, yo
Aiyyo I seen Run with the chrome spinnin
Watchin the Knicks in the back of the 6
Pulled up on the side like, ""Who's winnin?""
Nigga said, ""Me since eighty-three, get it right""
Politely flashed his Roley, then dipped to the light
Next night seen him on stage with some platinum shells
With baguettes on the side that spelled ""Raising Hell""
I said, ""Run the crowd yell like you paid 'em well""
Then he said to ask Bert Padell, who the hell?
Oh well - I thought I was done bein impressed
Until my man called me up and told me listen to Flex
{""Yo yo yo, turn on Flex""} I ain't know what to do
It was like Run was sunnin everybody but then again the shit was true
MC's must want him gone, hoppin on chrome
Sayin they the kings, please, you kept the seat warm
Ain't nobody better than this twenty year veteran
Even as a Reverend, hotter than you ever been
It don't really matter who the hell you are
The fakest of all cats or the biggest of stars (uh-huh)
Tryin to doubt these three, you breakin the law
They the kings, LEAVIN Y'ALL IN AWE, THAT'S REAL PAW

Like ahhh, Dunn done did it again
Ahhh, pad done hit the pen
Ahhh, man they droppin gems
Ahhh, the kid's bout stackin the ends

Yo, Rev. Run, run the block, swerve the Dat'
Flow is hot, don't need no gun to cock
I'm sick of Vidal, your brother tried to get me to fall
I'm kickin it raw, even in the thick of it all
Run laps around wack cats, I hate DAT's
Since way back, made great tracks, I lace raps
Yo face that, before you catch aluminum bats
From numerous cats with Run-D.M.C. on they hats
You ain't gettin no show 'til your album out
The label don't wanna spend money yo what's THAT about?
No clout, had to settle for a fake amount
While my catalogue bigger than your bank account
No doubt, I'm the greatest all time fo' sho'
Rev. Run comin through and leavin niggas in awe
 - 2X
 Yo Run remember that night at the light in the back of the 6?
 Yeah I was mad the Knicks lost, I got a new whip
 Yeah I see, the Bentley Arnage, with the four doors
 What is that, for more horse?
 Nah son, for more tours
 I see you've been peepin me for quite some time
 Yo my bad
 Ain't a thing, nigga I noticed you rhyme
 Yo what a nigga gotta do to be more like you?
 A nigga like me ain't got a clue
 First things first I DJ, Run all the rappers
 Actors, they want status
 But they can't have this
 Since ""Krush Groove"" you been makin them papes
 A lot of rap movies been made since but most of them fake
 Thanks for the compliment kid, now jump BACK in your car

I'm red rum, Reverend Run, brother son, earthquakin
Industry shakin, you kiddin me? We money makin
Your money fake son, I'll call you clay 'cause you get's Play-Doh
Jamel and Joey Simmons holdin millions on the lay low
Platinum hailos, hero heads high from hydro
Hit the dime on the combo, she try to diss my rhyme flow
She ain't know we only glamorous like Phat Farm fashion
Simmons name sinamous wit this cash
It's our passion... What!?

Yo basically I'm here to rename rap, it ain't rap no more
Call it Simmons Incorporated, since '74
Lotta money in this fam, think about it
Me wit Run-D. M. C., and him over at Def Jam
Well damn, how the hell you think we livin?
How you think it feel to be a Simmons
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving
People wanna know why I ain't on my brother's label
If I did this whole rap game be unstable
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors
It's only fair that we share those naked papers
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck
If 20 years after his first single, his name's stuck
From '74 to '99, did novice to king, wit a million
Mc's waitin in line
Keep a barrel on this album if my man's and them rise

Now speed it up, uh

Run really make ya wanna drop, drop
Now wanna make ya go live, live
Now wanna make ya go live, live
Now hold up

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
John-John Phenomenon, deadly but calm
Word to my born, dead by dawn
Got the right to bear arm, ring the alarm!
Another sound boy dyin, hot irons
Slugs flyin out the hardware appliance
Baby mamma cryin, sobbin and grievin
You was at aws wit them kids till they made it even
Let down ya guard, yes you did, now you barely breathin
To unaware, open season on a duck, we don't give a what
Yo best best to give it up
Sho indeed, 
let's Run D's mc's
, they phony
Some hump free, they mad bogey
Saddle up ya horse, if the sunset mosey
Jam Master Jay deserve a trophy for this track, right?
Futuristic G past type, if that's yo girlfriend
She wasn't last night punk, little boy
Stylin mad chump, ain't no wins here
This sport's extreme, know what I mean?
Gettin royalty, +Down With the King+!!!

Crack, crack, cracks in the cradle
Cracks, in the cradle
Cracks in the cradle, cokes in the spoon
Little Boy Blue higher than the moon
Will he, will he want a weapons, will he wanted the wound
I come to school and lay down the rules
Two, two, two channel empty guzzle, brake gallons of drop
Shorty wit the forty, once sport in the dark
Co-co-corner, black as a goner
Didn't really wanna call my momma in Savannah

I spit dynamite ignite turn off lights
Recite, spit poetry type, get my squad physically hype
Get a hundred blast from Funkmaster, crush ya life
+Blast+ Time to go now, show these fake rappers the way to go down
Down With The Kings, like Smokey down wit Motown
Who wanna come and see, come and test me
Take about a million mc's to wet me
For Run-D. M. C. I let shells fly, freein the five
Wit the red eye, niggas talkin to much
Tape 'em up, leave 'em hog tied

You thinkin about it way to hard, how to get down wit the Gods
Kenny Cash, the Bronx cat, but it'll ride wit gats
Peep chicks huggin the sacks, yours scratchin the back
I'mma shark in a shack, y'all cats is feedin the fish
Now hate and feed wit clips, nigga that leave you ripped
And I'm leavin 'em dry, shit's crushed wit bleadin lips

You know we know we know we wreck shop

I kick a wicked rhyme, what more can I tell ya
You're quick to pick and find a hardcore record seller
I paved the way for days, I'm a new wave yeller
For decades gettin paid, comin straight from the cellar
The paper was my trade so I stayed in the lab
Now the record's gettin played on the tape that you have
I'm like a heavyweight with a great left jab
Keep it truck diesel for the sake of the ave
Never bring no witness cause I freak this with uniqueness
For the rap fan, black man talks decent
Prop me, jock me, rock but don't stop me
If a man's got belief then a man's got beef
Sometimes I get sore from the war of a tour
To wreck it down ??, to get the crowd to roar
The records get dropped and my lyrics get popped
Let me off next stop cause I'm flex to wreck shop now
We wreck shop, you know we wreck shop (3X)
You know we know we know we wreck shop

Bust it!
I wreck shop, now pull your leg I beg your pardon
And rock a wicked rhyme like eighty-seven at the Garden
The hardest of the hard and I be harder for the hardened
?? but the smartest broken artists by the carton
Livin while I'm givin ?? ??
Not hear to bust your bubble send your trouble down the drain
Hurry on the double cool and subtle that's our game
My crew came out the huddle and I know you'll feel the pain
We wreck shop, and I can see they always give in
Life is like a mic and that's exactly how I'm livin
Ladies love the lover and the lover love the women
My name is DJ Run but you can call me Joseph Simmons and

The mic checker, I take my pilgramage to Mecca
Jay with the records still a dose of double-decker
Me and Run'll come and have some fun, and we'll wreck a
Shop on down, to the last stop, ha
We're givin rhythm to the Wisdoms on the block, ha
And ain't no business be a witness to the shot, ha

Stomp the competition, opposition seeks to
Confuse abuse and use all that I speak to
I bust a sucker, a nucca that I speak through
They keep pursuin never doin D.M.C. you

You better shut up, you're gonna be a dead up
Bucked and stuck your butt broke and chopped

He never would steal, he never would lie
The type of person money could not buy
Thought he be that way until the day he DIED!

MAAAAAAN, he met this girl, made his head swirl
To him she was worth more than diamonds 'n pearls
But she wasn't like all the other girls
Because she was only out, to crush his world!

He didn't care what his friends, had to say
'Cause he had to see the girl, everyday
He quit his work, his J-O-B
And he gotta lose his touch with his family

HEEEEEEE would lie for herrr, cold die for herrr
Did nothing in the world wouldn't try for herrr (yeah)
Get ill for herrr, he'd steal for herrr
There's nothing in the world he wouldn't DEAL for herrr

He sold his car, stole a VCR
So low on dough, he went and robbed a bar
He lost everything, he had nuttin to LOSE
For staying wit this girl, he was paying his dues

Well he tried to leave, but the love was strong
He shouldn't have stayed with T'HER so long

Now What's Going On? He sings the sad song
What was right in his life, has now gone wrong
He said, I got to leave, for a day or two
But on the very next day he said, ""I need you
I can't live without you, and you know this true
'cause my love for you just grew and grew""
So he took her home, she took him back
They made so much love, he caught a heart attack
She drove him to his grave, that's where he's at

Scoldin and holdin me 'gainst my wishes
Searchin my ride, my body, my soul
Tryin to find some kind of substance control
Maybe someone is carryin a gun
No, nothing, no one has none
Gloomy and sorry when I come clean
Yo officer, what does this mean?
My system is loud and I draw a crowd
Not only King, I'm black and I'm proud
This ride is mine, do you mind if I own
So stop tryin to rob mines and leave me alone
The officer said I saw you before
Comin out the door of a grocery store
I said to my partner there goes a man
And he's got a trouble starter, inside his hand
My man Eric Blam said stop on the cops
And then what the Blam said, you're sure to get shot
Now they ignore me cause you saw me with a 40
He thought the brothers were about to get naughty
	The brother's about to get naughty! (4X)

How ya livin on the ill side, makin a livin
Driven, never givin a damn about the women and
If this is life, your wife, you're livin trife
For spite you hit the pipe every night and just fight
You're naughty, make a girl get physical
She get loose for juice and then you diss her
Pull and take another girl on a escapade
A trip around the world a what a mess you made
Another lady, gravy, maybe you're crazy
You see ? ?? today, you don't faze me
But gettin kinda hectic on the power tip
A brother gotta pay no matter how it get
Face the facts, base the crack
Taste the stacks last, and these suckers are back
So when you see the company that claim to be
The truth you done get raw, see
Check out the three, Run-D.M.C
And the brothers about to get naughty!
	The brother's about to get naughty! (4X)

Open up the door and let the brothers in
Cause it's a sin, if we ain't down, on what's happenin
Yo what's up, you don't like the way I walk
Or I guess it's, just the way I talk or are you prejudiced
Invited to the show, threw on my afro
Jumped out the limo, get to the front, you tell me no
Yo I just came to mingle, watch the earrings jingle
Grab a cutie rub-a-dub 'til it tingle
But you wanna single me out, but I ain't did that
Check me, I ain't strapped, pull the barricade back
I'm comin in black, I know you're hard dick
Six foot bodyguard, but why should I be barred
Yo, yo, pass the 40
Cool T, Hurricane, Run and D's about to get naughty..
	The brother's about to get naughty! (4X)",https://genius.com/Run-dmc-naughty-lyrics
"Ooh, Watcha Gonna Do",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Never let a punk get away with murder

Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
Ooh, whatcha gonna do?
Ooh, whatcha gonna do?
Ooh, whatcha gonna do?
Ooh, whatcha gonna do?
A vain from my brain means I'm causin' 'em pain
Comin' rough with the stuff that's just a part of the game
The rhymes have been hard since the start of the jam
So I'ma pull my jammy out and I'ma murder the man
Bust a rap like a cap, put a hole in your soul
Take the trigger then you figured that I'm losin' control
I go loco with the vocals, yo goes the chokehold
And I broke those pros with the dope flows
I slow rolls, no I don't smoke those
Leave the blunts for the punks in front rows
I said mine, headline or deadline
You see redline, here comes your bedtime
I lay it down, lay it low
Now I'm off and runnin' on some new rhyme flow
I flex break necks bust tecs mic checks son
Fill you full of lead and now get ready for the next one
Never let a punk get away with murder
Gun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a
What's up? What's up? What's the word up?
Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked

You never knew, DJ who? DJ Run'll wreck
Hard, God, may be dope you never knew me nope
Where you been your hand is sendin' down, can you really cope?
Forever makin' and breakin' it and cold wreckin' it
As for my title it's vital, you're never takin' it
I throw a stand across the stage and you'll get bucked down
Like Kris-One said, I fly a head you better duck down
I sold good and then plenty like? Charlie said
Like Mike I glove it you love it and now it's for my bread
It's goin' down on the mound watch a nigga pitch
Bang your thang and hang your damn necks, now you gettin' it
I see them go, and come, cause what they pumpin' weak
And now I'm flippin' the script and they can hardly speak
I bust a nut then run amuck all on a sucker cool
Now whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?!
Never let a punk get away with murder
Gun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a

Kick the Frama Lama Lama,Back From Hell,1990.0,"AUHHH!

Yes yes y'all
Off to the lagoon, so soon, my tune'll have room
To go boom so I go to the ?pazoom?
Place where the bass in your face is never 'ternal
Then I ran into my man the alligator so
How you livin like a sucker wife is such a nag
I wish I wish when niggas fish they'd make a gator bag
But other than that I'm livin fat I got a record deal
Me and this pig got fifty gigs yo homeboy check it squeal
He said his rap and that was that and I was left alone
Let me kick you this lyric
Gather round now hear about the Flintstones
Fred and Barn' and all the rest of the Flintstones
They got a Benz with rocks and dark tints homes
Kitted out, VVS the whole bit
People screamin on Fred and sayin, ""Oh shit!""
And then my man Fred came home late (doin what?)
Cold beefin bout, Mr. Slate
And then he walked to the door, seen Wilma cryin
Fred said, ""Yo hoe, I ain't lyin!""
And next thing, you heard a little crunch
Fred fell (what?) result of a punch
And then they got up, and went and got the crew
Back to the hoe's house -
Yabba dabba dabba dabba doo y'all
A dabba doo y'all
And that's comin straight from me to you y'all

You need a umbrella if it starts to rain
You need a umbrella if it starts to rain
You need a umbrella if it starts to rain
So why didn't you just bring a raincoat?
And I hope, that you have a boat
Cause my cussin is floodin and you need to stay afloat
Not on water, but on somebody's daughter
You never ever wanna say that you caught a
Breeze, that'll freeze or some kind of the disease
To make you ill and sneeze (AH-CHOO!)
I'm tryin to tell you Baby Pop
You press your luck or youse a sucker suckin on a lollipop
You knocked off the boots and only got your shit wet
Needles inject just to disinfect, you're upset
Your stupid monkey-ass didn't protect yourself
Kick the frama lama lama lama lama!
AH-CHOO!

Motherfuckers poppin shit about a nigga goin out
Without a hit or shit to his name to claim
And aim that shit towards me, nah..
That ain't what time it is, cause this is mines and his
'Member the crime you did?  Don't ever close your lid
Cause if you sleep I keep the cheap motherfuckin
Tape you gave me, so behave see
My name is Run and I'll run this ruler up your ass
And measure the shit you're poppin

I go by the name of Jam Master Jay

Hey, as we let the music play
Pay attention and listen as I mention
A recital of mic to speeches
From the book of the 40 Ounces
Of the most powerful words ever spoken

Topsy-turvy, they try to serve me
Disturb me, curve me, boy they never heard me
Slammin, jammin, I be bammin
Makin takin breakin and rammin
Run got a beef with those that cold think that
Sun and the moon and soon you will drink that
Wine for the rhyme that I'm, not a stink brat

Up on the top I pop and drop, you feel
So low you go for Joe you know, what the deal
I might just strike tonight, and make you say

Go check the clock I rock your jock so hard
Make you feel the deal is I'm top card

I'm makin a mill, and damn I'm still
Makin history on the M-I-C
And for the young ladies, a nigga like D'll
Be waxin taxin no relaxin breakin backs
And bustin raps and I'll be strapped
In my Cadillac, and you know that for a fact
I'm strapped with rap but yo, I'm also
Record breakin never flakin wide awake
And titles I'm takin and I'll be makin
Ladies groove cause I prove I can soothe when they

Deliverin, I'll deliver and give ya
Whatcha been waitin (one two three) for/four
This, is the gift of the gab
That I had when I came out the lab
The masterpiece was released
Let's cease the beef and all those misbeliefs
That we can't do our thing on a positive tip
I'm tryin to tell ya
It's been a long time -- we need a change
Time for things to be rearranged
Time to get our act together
Whoever's clever or better - never let
Another brother or sister get dissed cause they missed the
Knowledge and wisdom and damn I wish ya

Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is
(DMC)
People in the world trying to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus or feet
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed
Where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying
That you're underpaid
