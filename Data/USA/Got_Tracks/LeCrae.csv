I’ll Find You,All Things Work Together,2017.0,"Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

I'm hangin' on by a thread
And all I'm clingin' to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knockin' on the front door
Pain's creepin' through the back
Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waitin' for 'em to attack
They say ""Don't get bitter, get better.""
I'm workin' on switchin' them letters
But tell God I'ma need a whole lotta hope keepin' it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face
I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
They don't know the battle I face
They don't understand what I'm goin' through

The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do

Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

They say fear haunts and pain hates
I say pain strengthens and fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Pickin' up the pieces of my life
And hopin' that I'll put together somethin' right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight

The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do

No don't let the fear make you feel
Like you can't fight this on your own
You know I – I'll be there for you no matter where you go
You'll never be alone, no

Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you",https://genius.com/Lecrae-ill-find-you-lyrics

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby, I'm too busy countin' all these blessings

Yah, yah, yah
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Swear the sun shinin' on me in my huddle
No matter the trouble surroundin' us
They don't see that it's a lot of us
Everybody move anonymous
Won't take that credit, I know where we get it
Them blessings be comin' from God above
I was doin' all kinda bad
Where the choir at? Tell 'em I need a verse
Hit the pew and tell God He's first
Hit the studio to body a verse
I remember pushin' mama's little white Hyundai with no gas money
I just bought a car, cash money
I ain't even tryna brag on it
I just tell it how it really is
I ain't trippin', they ain't feelin' this
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
I've been punchin' in the clock
Tryna keep the kitchen stocked
Man it's a blessin' 'cause we ain't ever had a lot
But all we need is all we got

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby, I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings

I put my mama in the crib, said, ""Stop stressin'""
I put my girl in a brand new diamond necklace
She said she need more of my love and affection
'Cause lately I've been workin' harder than ever
She said, ""Baby, you a boss, baby, clear your schedule
Dolla you a boss, let's do somethin' special
Take me on a PJ, we should go to Mexico
I've been down for you boy, since when the money was low""
Anything for my bae 'cause she a blessing
If you woke up this morning it's a blessing

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby, I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings

I took so many losses
Coulda lost it
Left 'em leaky like a faucet
Almost cost me
Everything that I got, all of my fam
Part of the plan
I was eatin' fried bologna out of the pan
Y'all don't understand
I was tryna get it
I'm in that studio tryna keep it pushin'
Patty pies, boy I kept 'em cookin'
All I needed was the Mary Mary
But the God in me was havin' commentary, woo!
I got angels all around like Anita Baker
Blessings fallin' in line, guess I need a taper
And every loss is a lesson
Tell my haters I confess
Treat 'em like the green bubbles on the iPhone
I probably never read the message

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby, I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up

You slow me down cause you know me now with my phony smile
And I'm acting like it's all copacetic
It's so pathetic, so juvenile

One time for H-Town
One time for D-Town
One time for A-Town, M-Town

R.I.P. to Medgar Evers, R.I.P. to Dr. King
I ain't tryna' hate on my own kind
But Al and Jesse don't speak for me
I'm probably gon' catch some flack man
But I'm-a swallow this pill like Pacman
Some of these folks won't tell the truth
Too busy tryna get them racks man
Church tryna rob my paychecks
Choir members probably having gay sex
Pastor manipulatin' hurtin' women
I wonder which she's gon' slay next
Bookstore pimpin' them hope books
Like God don't know how broke looks
And telling me that I'm gon' reap a mil'
If I sow into these low crooks
Plus I know ol' girl a freak
And how she singin' a solo
I walked in the church wit' a snapback
And they tellin' me that that's a ""no-no""?
That's backwards, and I lack words
For these actors called pastors
All these folks is hypocrites
And that's why I ain't at church
Truthfully I'm just doin' me
And I don't wanna face no scrutiny
As long as the church keep wildin' out
I can justify all my foolish deeds
Smoking weed, pourin' up
Keep that lean up in my cup
Maybe I could change the world
But this porn on my laptop got me stuck
Yeah I know what's right from wrong
But that there ain't gon sell a song
I rather sell my soul then save it
If that's what make my money long
It better not be no real God
With real hope, that heals hearts
That shows me that I ain't livin' up
To all the things that He put me here for
It better not be no real church
Real saints, who pray hard
And let me rock my snapback
With the 501's and the J's on
It better not be no real folk
Who don't think that they better than you
Straight or gay, drunk and high
They walk through the cold and weather wit' 'chu
'Nah we don't wanna see that
Cause that might mean ""life change""
That might mean I'm worth more than money, cars, sex, and pipe dreams
Better not be no real Jesus, real forgiveness, for hurt folks
If God gon' take me as I am I guess I already got on my church clothes",https://genius.com/Lecrae-church-clothes-lyrics
Cry for You,All Things Work Together,2017.0,"This thorn in my flesh
Is the only thing I got left
And it's so hard to confess
When everybody thinks you're perfect

But I cry for you
If you feel it too
And I'll cry for you
If you show how to lose
The elephants in the room

Take it away, I beg you, take it all away
The pain it causes, it makes me wish I could fade away
If they knew what you knew, they'd probably shun me
I'm surprised you know it all and you love me
I know I break your heart
Body of death, give me rest if my heart stops
Then it don't hurt no more, can't get worse no more
Can't pursue all these desires, it ain't cursed no more
No more lies about my worth no more
I understand the thoughts of suicide that do reside
But when I stop and think about my family, I feel new inside
I promised I would die a thousand deaths 'fore I cause them any pain
But somehow I end up killing everything
I cry for you
If you feel a dark, twisted, heart-wrenching, hate-to-see-your-own-reflection
Praying for an intervention, feeling guilt and feeling shame
I just call on Jesus name
Praying daily, can you take away this pain?
Take the thorn away
Still, it remains, I
Feel the same, I
Know that I'm here, but
Still feel insane
Satan would love to see me give up and throw up my hands
He say I'm guilty but You say I'm clean

This thorn in my flesh
Is the only thing I got left
And it's so hard to confess
When everybody thinks you're perfect

But I cry for you
If you feel it too
And I'll cry for you
If you show how to lose
The elephants in the room

Yeah, Sunday morning, or Sunday mourning?
I woke up dead inside from all the hurt I saw before me
Evil tryna take away my testimony
Starin' at my phone, feelin' like a phony
Oh, I cry for you, I would die for you
To escape the pain I feel from all that I've been through
I feel it in my soul and in my chest
Take away this ugly thorn inside my flesh
Give me death
But grace is sufficient to start my mission
I'm so far from perfect, can't believe they listen
But hear a broken man 'til your healin' happens
And hear a liar tell you truth to bring you gladness
I could never boast in my accomplishments
I can only hope in God with confidence
Opposite of optimist, U and I are consonants
Broken all the vowels, deservin' of every consequence
Will you cry for me, or will you judge me?
Will you throw stones at my head, or will you love me?
I could never be everything that you wanna see
But crooked sticks draw straight lines, just look at me
(But crooked sticks draw straight lines, just look at me)

This thorn in my flesh
Is the only thing I got left
And it's so hard to confess
When everybody thinks you're perfect

But I cry for you
If you feel it too
And I'll cry for you
If you show how to lose
The elephants in the room",https://genius.com/Lecrae-cry-for-you-lyrics

Look at me I'm all the way turnt up
I ain't smoking but my homie in here burnt up
Yeah, I'm working on him, but he straight though
Couple girls trying to twerk it on me, wait- no
No, hold up
Before you even roll up I'm in here with my lady
Can't you see me? Man, I'm sewed up
Man, I'm in here trying to celebrate a birthday
And you know I'm good aware its a work day Don't matter, we still gon' kick it
And we ain't getting trippy, no molly in my sippy
Ain't fighting nobody, ain't nobody set tripping
It's Southeast Daygo in the building
Shout out to Peter Pan, Skyline, Imperial
We out here trying to function, holler if you with it though
Prolly think I'm rolling, I'm just high on the Spirit, bro
The only thing we popping is the truth, you don't hear me though

Came 40 deep, cliqued up, crew love
Got em' looking at us crazy 'cause we so turnt up
Yeah, homie, I'm turnt, I'm turnt, I'm turnt, I'm turnt
I ain't popping, rolling, and I ain't burnt
So tell Mary and Molly I don't need em' to party
Someone woke up in the lobby trying to locate they wallet
While I'm nine holes in trying to work on my hobby
And I wish somebody would get me started
Aye, deuces up to Nipsey, K-Dot, and Game
I'm out here in the west, go and holler at me, man
My blood stream clean, nothing running through my veins
Its 116, yeah, I'm still Unashamed
I call it network if I'm out here fishing
You know I'm with clique and man we out here trying to kick it
You know that we turnt

Whatchu mean? Now, whatchu mean? (whatchu mean?)

Bustin' moves, had to hit 'em with the screens
Jump away (move away), that's extreme (oh)
See us mobbin', 116 (oh)
Ain't no way I'll ever let you in between
'Cause whatchu sayin' whatchu mean ain't whatchu mean

I was always Pippen with the flow
I support the Greatest, give-and-go
Tried to hit me with the bad vibes, let 'em know
Shake that dust up off my feet before they hit the floor
Focus on the ones I love, yeah, them my folks
People love to talk the talk, but they don't really know
Catch me outside on the field, that's the goal
Goin' for conversion, extra points on the low
All I know is come up winter to the summer
Work on top of work, you know we did a ton of
Movin' lowkey like we diggin' tunnels
Haters, I don't see you, on my Stevie Wonder
Guess it's safe to say I stay in my lane
Always on time, never hesitate
Watch the execution, I'ma demonstrate
Tryna hit me with your regulations

I'm picture perfect, I don't need no Canon like Mariah
I'm makin' movies, I direct like I control the choir
I got it groovy, then they kick me out the church like ""hiya""
A rub-a-dub, you ain't the cleanest in the club, I'm flier
Yo' baby momma told me that you not a good supplier
So I'm a father figure to Malik and Anania
I'm not the daddy, oh no, no the Devil is a liar
It's goin' down, but I can guarantee you, baby, we up
At first they couldn't see, now everybody wanna be us
I said I'm not the one, don't make me have to play Vegeta
I got a stripper friend who told me she believe in Jesus
Hold on Aha
I ain't come here to prove nothin'
I been woke before it was cool and before y'all hit the snooze button
The flow's hot, but I'm ice-cold like I'm on the remake of Cool Runnings
The same things that y'all dream about are the same things that I do in public, no discussion

Lemme guess you counting money to the ceiling
Difference 'tween us like at least a couple million
It's foreign cars, pretty girls everywhere you go
Yeah, I heard it 30 times on the radio
Louboutin ain't gon' pay you for that bragging
And Donatella prolly never heard yo' album
Yeah, they prolly 'bout to label me a hater
But I know these people greater than the songs they creating
It's little homies in the hood regurgitating
And everybody watching thinking that you made it
The truth is for a few designer labels and a little bit of paper now you 12 years slaving
Hey but you ain't Lupita, so why you beat up and pushing people to lean on a double cup and a seizure?

Talking bread like we at the last supper
Throwing money at these women, make it rain in the summer

They expensive and I know they ain't gon' pay me for it
Telling kids to go in debt for the 'vette that they'll prolly never get, but I talk about it every song
In every song talking 'bout they selling work on every corner
Don't talk about the laws, taking kids away from mommas
Don't talk about ya' homie in the trauma 'cause he shot up
Or what about ya' young boy messing up the product?
They don't talk about the bond money that they ain't have
And e'rybody snitch on e'rybody in the jam

They be talking 'bout the same ol' thing
I'ma have to call a foul in the game
What you talking 'bout?
A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me
They ain't talking 'bout nuthin'
A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me
They ain't talking 'bout nuthin'

Hey man, the way I see it,
 
I think we were made for more than just, you know, the simple things that we, uh, aspire toward.
 
We were made for more than just telling stories of, you know, how much money we can get from selling poison to people.
 
It's time to talk about who we are and who we can be. Man, we need to build each other up, not put each other down.
 
I feel like we not talking about nuthin' right now",https://genius.com/Lecrae-nuthin-lyrics

If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Fed time, watch me kill the scene, fed time
Fed time, we gon' steal the scene, fed time

I say ""MC Hammer out the slammer, I'm set free for real""
Phew Montana ridin' through Atlanta, Jesus took the wheel
I can't keep the Truth inside of me, I gotta squeal
Some folks trust in God just 'cause the words on dollar bill
Aw man, He gon' touch back down and seal the deal
Y'all playin'
Sorry I can't understand a word that y'all sayin'
Big boss moves, never heard of small plans
I just want some acres, I come from a small land
Nah, for real, itty bitty
Used to be down, bad boy, now I'm up like Diddy
Got a new wave, and we surfin' through the city
Christ is walkin' wit' me, shinin' bright, we got it litty
Like ""sheesh!""
Out the dog pound, we done made it off the leash
Makin' sure the people comprehend like ""capiche!""
Young Georgia boy comin' straight up out the East
Grindin' 'cause my family gotta feast

Hold up
Now tell me, who you foolin'?
Saw you coolin', flexin' with the jeweler
Whatchu doin'? You don't measure up, I met the Ruler
Closet full of Js, boy, you never been a shooter
And I don't need a chain, just to prove you, boy, I'm movin'
When you movin' out yo' mama house, off yo' mama couch?
If we livin' what we talk about, you don't talk a lot
Sound booth, rented Lambo, you can say that
Took my money, built a studio, and took the Range back
H-Town to Atlanta, country bama, MC Hammer
Boy, we too legit to quit, I die, I resurrect, mañana
Put a nail up in your coffin, my hammer awesome
I ain't worried 'bout no pro'lems, the Lord I'll call on
My God!
Everybody eatin' if you part of my squad
And they know I'm workin', boy, I stay on my job
You know God my standard, He the answer
I ain't perfect, I'm just purchased, out here workin' with the hammer like

Was a slave for the cars, then we got free
Used to only wanna pull up in a black sport
Just a white man excellin' in a black sport
Now I'm really doing pull-ups
Got a honeymoon for the summer tryna get a six-pack for it
Say I won't catch 'Crae slippin' in the studio at like 3 AM
Autograph that fo'head with a Sharpie pen and then Instagram
Might swag out a fanny pack
I might bring Velour back
Nobody wanna change the game, man, y'all just want more trap?
Okay, say I won't rap over bagpipes
Say I won't talk about that price
To know Christ then live life like every night my last night

Sneakin' up on a tour bus with a demo to hand to us

Say I won't turn the music up and get to it
Won't come down, H-Town all the way to they town

Fear,Anomaly ,2014.0,"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff they comfort me

I honestly grow insecure as I get older
Cause even when you hot there comes a day when you get colder
Comes a day when you slower
Time is takin' it's toll
45 on the back of the jersey upon yo' soul
I'm scared of letting go
I don't know what the future holds
My nightmares are having nightmares
I'm quite scared of what's right and fair
How I fare an eternity
Will I hear well done when He turn to me
Will I hear you care too much 'bout all of this stuff that really don't matter
You chased the wind and you won it
Got to the top of a two foot ladder
What's after I can capture all this mess my heart was after
Will I end up empty handed when I stand before my master
Did I master the mathematics of a passive disaster
Adding my selfish ambition all the while subtracting what matters
I don't know

Late nights I can't sleep
Will I fall
When I peek through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking 'bout
At late nights I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing right at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering
What they thinking, thinking 'bout it all

In high school we tried to act all tough
I remember a couple times I couldn't back that up
Like when I ran from them vatos
Scuffin' up my zapatos
Scared of losing my hide
I was so embarrassed inside
If I could go back in time
I would stand and say something like
I ain't never scared, never scared, never scared
I'm lyin' I'm scared of these thoughts in my head
I'm scared of possibly pushin' people right over the ledge
When I said I pledge allegiance to the struggle
Then I turn around and buckle under stress and under pressure
Bible on my dresser that could teach my pain a lesson
But I'd rather not address it
Address is in depression
I'm scared if I confess it
That you gon' look at me like I'm somethin' less
And I'm such a mess

Celui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes
Est celui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter
On trouve la liberté dans la confession
Et la liberté dans la reconnaissance

And it just so happens I'm wrestling with my status
I'm tryna see me like He do, not focusing on this madness
They count on me count me out
On account of they fear and doubts
Keep account of my wrongs
Trying to keep me inside they house
Some just keep me around
Gotta wonder what that's about
Yea, they wanna be politically correct I suppose
But I'm comfortable in my skin while they just pretend in they clothes
I'm scared of falling and failing in front of all of my foes
And I feel some friends are unfaithful
So I keep my small circle closed
I don't want no handouts or favors
No functional saviors
I'mma tell that truth 'till it kill me
And I'm chillin' with my Creator
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters
For the ones that think I forgot Him
And the ones who won't let me say it
I ain't scared no mo'

Late nights I can't sleep
Will I fall
When I peek through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking 'bout
At late nights I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing right at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering
What they thinking, thinking 'bout it all

Everybody always
They gon' have something to say
Whether you like it or not
Everybody always
They gone have something to say
Baby, don't take it to heart
Something to say

Welcome to America,Anomaly ,2014,"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from the flight deck
We're cruising at 37,000 feet and we just passed over the coast
We'll be beginning our descent in about 30 minutes
I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America

I was made in America
Land of the free, home of the brave
And right up under your nose you might see a sex slave being traded
And who will do anything for the money
Boy, a mama might sell her babies
Sell porn, sell pills, anything to pay the bills
Anything to bring that pay
Gotta scratch that itch, gotta scratch them ticks
Ain’t rich, but I might be
And Imma shoot these flicks, Imma turn these tricks
Anything for a slight fee
Yeah, made in America
Momma told me that I belong here
Had to earn our stripes, had to learn our rights
Had to fight for a home here
But I wouldn't know a thing about that
All I know is drugs and rap
I probably could have been some kinda doctor
Instead of holding guns and crack
I was born in the mainland
Great-Grandpa from a strange land
He was stripped away and given bricks to lay
I guess you could say he a slave hand
But I was made in America
So I don’t know a thing about that
All I know is Uncle Sam looking for me working on his corner
So I know I gotta pay tax
Getting paid in America
I was raised in America
And this is all I ever known
If I’m wrong then you better come save me America

Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America

Man I’d die for America
I served my time for America
Got shot-shot back went to war
Got back and ain’t nobody give a jack in America
I could had lost my life boy I lost my wife
I can’t even get right in my home land
Cold sweats, whole ticks, paranoia
Looking out for a threat in my own land
I was trained in America
How they get up in the planes in America
Flew them right into the buildings
Taking out civilians
People getting killed in America?
And I’m still in America
Though America ain’t feeling me
I went to war for this country
Turn around came home and you drilling me
When y’all free here saying you don’t wanna be here
Boy you probably couldn't breathe here
If I didn’t load a couple magazines here
Y’all just complain in America
I’m jumping out of military planes from America
Aye, I was made in America
Thats why I’m out here saving America
I got a brother in the cemetery now
Cause he wanted y’all safe
And everybody want the freedom but nobody want to hear ""about face!""
We bled for America
To keep y’all fed in America
But what's the point of talking
A lot of y’all don’t really even care America

Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na

I wish I lived in America
Wanna raise my kids in America
Heard everybody rich
All I gotta do is run, jump, kick
I'm a hit in your area
So please pick me America
I know you probably never loved me
You never hear about me on the news
And you probably never been to my country
I hear you selling education and got clothes that you throw away
Got plenty food in your nation
I could tell cause a lot of y’all are over weight
I already work for y’all
I’m at a sweatshops making these shirts for y’all
Naw, I ain’t gettin money
Go to bed hungry, but I make some exports for y’all
But y’all don’t know a thing about that
You was made in America
I’m trying to find me a ticket where the sky is the limit
Catch a plane to America
It should be plain to America
Y’all blessed and you got it made
Heard y’all don’t pray no more, y’all ain’t saved no more
Y’all looking for another way
Well I hope it ain’t true, but I’m packing my suit
Farewell to my mother land
Said bye to my loved ones
Fate here I come, I’m going to another land
I done made it to America
I’m amazed at America
But I couldn’t get approval to stay so they sent me away from America",https://genius.com/Lecrae-welcome-to-america-lyrics

OK, I'm tatted up with my J's on
Hat cocked, to my fade showing
Folks thinking we Ned Flanders
Okely-dokely, game on
They don't hate me they just think they know what I'mma say and
I can't promise that them tv pastors ain't gonna prey
On your grandma with your auntie nem'
Promise y'all I ain't none of them
And you can call me lame, just don't
Call me fake and then call me friend
Cause I don't pretend, boy I live this
Some of y'all on the fences
Oh girl you took home with you
Man she swore she was a Christian
She might be and likely
She like you and just like me
An imperfect person, broke and hurting
Trying to do the right thing
And I'm courtside like Spike Lee
Keep it mellow nightly
Ok, G?
Cause I ain't 'bout that drama in my lifey
That bad one? That's wifey
You know she bout that life, B
She got red bottoms you ain't never seen
And her soul's covered up nicely
That's blood dipped, I mean blood bought
No SuWoo, but this blood talk
Never thought they'd see
Have a concert in the club, huh?

Who could step in these size tens?
White boy, cool grey 11's
Since age twelve I represented
Now I'm digging them 13 letters
My church clothes these leather pants
Boy sick? I got medicine
We found the light, Edison
Do God exist? We the evidence (Whoop!)
We the children of the Light, you know what I mean?
That's why I'm hating on the darkness like Paula Deen
Cause in my hood they masked up, like it's Halloween
We going hard for the Rock, but we not some fiends
See and the mission we live for is bigger than everything you could attain
They trying to hate us for sharing our faith but I bet that we do it again
Your hubris is humorous, real talk we true to this
Y'all rappers acting like Ludacris
We unashamed, get used to this, boy

Them have flu, we na catch the fever
Ya can't cut through my life like degreaser
You coulda never shut the mouth of a believer
Big foot can't fit ina mi sneakers (ah)
Them have flu, we na catch the fever
Ya can't cut through my life like degreaser
You coulda never shut the mouth of a believer
Big foot can't fit ina mi sneakers

We have to drop it one away
We have to choose Christ for a better day
Yes sir, we have to drop it one away
Live to see me friends them gone astray
We have to drop it one away
We have to choose Christ for a better day
Yes sir, we have to drop it one away
Live to see me friends them gone astray

Ay, look. Perpetrating not likely
We live here we don't sightsee
Ain't trying to brag on my service
Telling my left hand where my right be
And it's real rap, no faking
Not some rap dudes who couldn't make it
This ain't the life I chose, boy
It chose me I can't shake it
I can't feel 'em
How come they can kill 'em?
How come I can't heal 'em?
They be drilling me with codiene stripping
Plus they popping pills
So I feel what's popping on the charts is popping body parts
And yeah, sometimes my music's for the church, I call it body art

Them have flu, we na catch the fever
Ya can't cut through my life like degreaser
You coulda never shut the mouth of a believer

I grew up hearin' how they fed my momma eggs and grits

Heard a heart beat that wasn't hers or mine
The miracle of life had started inside
My God
Ignored the warning signs
Supressed that truth I felt inside
I was just havin' fun with this
I'm too young for this
I'm thinkin' me myself and I
Should I sacrifice this life
To keep my vanity and live nice
And she love and trust me so much
That whatever I say she'll probably oblige
But I was too selfish with my time
Scared my dreams were not gone survive
So I dropped her off at that clinic
That day a part of us died

Come on everybody sit down (sit down)
People wanna act like they are in the know (in the know)
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile (off your smile)
And tell you what's the word around town (around town)
I know you don't wanna hear the truth (the truth)
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

I remember back in the day
I was barely in the first grade
Got teeth missin'
Watchin' Tom & Jerry
Tryna go outside so I can play
I was told to watch out for strangers
Keep my eyes peeled for danger
Folks workin' late I had a baby sitter
I ain't 'bout to sit here and name her
I was almost 8 when she came in late
Woke me up with a game to play
Did a few things that's hard to say
And told me to keep that secret safe
Now how a young boy supposed to deal
I'm tryna act like it ain't real
Had my innocence just stripped from me
And I still don't know how to feel
And I wonder how to address it
Can't tell my family too messy
So I just embrace it it's hard to face it
I'm too ashamed to confess it
So I kept it in and ain't speak
Didn't think it hit me so deep
So into it I got promiscuous
And only God could help me get free
But I been forgiven
My Savior risen
I'm out the prison
I know that (I know that)
I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles
God will control that (yeah)
Every time we slip and we fall
Gotta get back up and fight on
We are not defined by our past
The future look bright
I see the light on (I see the light on, I see the light on)

The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly yeah, yeah, yeah

Come on everybody sit down (sit down)
People wanna act like they are in the know (in the know)
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile (off your smile)
And tell you what's the word around town (around town)
I know you don't wanna hear the truth (the truth)
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof (the proof)
But I just need you to believe (to believe)
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

Man, I'm insecure and I'm so unsure
My motives don't be the purest either, my little sister
Prolly need me, I ain't been around, and I ain't tried to lead her, ugh!
Help me, Lord, I ain't ever have no daddy
Feel like a failin' father tryna raise my family
I've seen cancer take my lady's pops and he fought so hard
And we cried so hard, but sometimes life's so dark
But he told me, ""Boy, you keep yo' head up, never let up, and never give up, and don't cry for me 'cause I'ma live up in the sky""

Misconceptions 3,Church Clothes 3,2016.0,"Fictitious foolies got me on a sick one
I'm still from Tha Side 
ready to die for the mission
Or meditate it, then I levitated
Elevated, celebrated
You should celebrate it, this is that embedded greatness
Good, good God
I'm a mad man, mathematic-static
Still in the stars
I'm a bad man, bask in the battle
I'm a battered mad hatter with the earth on a platter
Meek and mild 'til I get freakin' wild
It's a misconception messin' with your intellect
I reckon it'll be neck and neck
Before I let the deck eject the message
This is not a warning, this is what you wanted on the table
'Crae, let 'em know the lil' homie willin' and able
It's Givez

Vegas, get active
Flippin' your city like gentrification all in the ghetto upon a dirty mattress
Word to that sister actress
Nevada gets it crackin'
It’s hot and J got a jacket
Pull petals back if you askin' if love’s a long practice
Full metal jacket dually known as a banana clip when rappin'
That's a loaded magazine of ammunition
Plan out snippets so these magazines don't go bananas
Over loaded clips or flows floatin'
Only showin' sinkin' ships 10% of
 
why he's frozen
Let it go, it's hotter than sprinters in Arizona
Juxtapose 'em to a snowman in Nova Scotia
It's rap's Christopher Nolan
Picture me rollin', pistol emoji, blaow!
This a misconception triple threat
Did Givens flex? Still a Christian? Yep
Don't need acknowledgement, just respect the conglomerate
Double tap it and follow it
They shocked to see us like Donald Trump up in a taqueria
Watchin' Evita, cryin' over Argentina
Or Maria dominatin' Serena
I'm tryna find a big homie for Slim Jesus
Thesis of a new hope
More hardcore than Star Wars part four rated R
Or Rosa Parks sore feet kicked off the bus exitin' starboard
Light saves like a time change
Hands up and down like a sine wave
Gospel be the humble, don't sleep the beast is a mind frame

They told me to rap: what's that?
Is it tracks, is it facts?
Is it trap, is it rats?
What metaphor? Is you ready for the medic stored inside it
Is it similes or violence?
Is it sympathy or similar
The sinner's lord's inside 'em
The problem ain’t wordplay
I get schizophrenic with sittin', straight jackin' the beat
Blood all on it, #DraculaScheme, trick or treat
It ain’t magic, I'ma vanish when I pass to the team
32
, 
half that
Grab a 16 and let us shoot
Betty Boop wit the black top
I’m a mascot for the dreaded truth
Locks all in my head, ain’t no chain that I hang from
But He hang from where I came from, that’s death
Guess what, I ain’t done
I'm rappin'
Beneath it is Jesus reachin' for actors
Living halle', add the 'lujah with the asterisk
Correction,
 
then bury the body under the mattress
Livin' my dream while you sleepin' in different caskets

Look, I was created to make a statement
A sentence sent us to earth on this mission
Tryna make a way for my siblings
Brothers and sisters who drinkin'
Out of them cisterns with cracks in 'em
Listen but lack hearin'
Who lookin' but lack vision
Initially made in the Lord's image, dynamic
Nothing lackin', magic couldn't make it happen
Look at us, you hear us rappin'
Now they complaining but how can they be mad at all?
King dreamed a dream but we seen scenes that'll make us all
Change the channel, we channel all of this energy
Pretend to be savages, we ravage our so-called enemies
That look like us
But it look like us ain't gon' make it less we shake it
We can't look back much
Turned around to give a helping hand
I'm like, ""Man, they gon' make it, makin' baking soda boiling inside these pans""
Now they're wondering, is it rap or is it Gospel?
Look all you need to know is I was dead, now I'm not though
Real recognizing real, and if they don't love me like Pac
They better respect how I'm movin' and that I'm never gon' stop
I hit my pastor on the cell, I said, ""I'm catching hell""
Well, what you think they did to Jesus?
Only time will tell
Can't believe we rap about the faith and people like the sound
We out here workin' in the streets, you better ask around
Tell them other rappers we don't want it, they can have the crown
They have to lay it down when you hear that trumpet sound
We know who got the keys to the kingdom
When the King come, crown Him, and your king dumb if his kingdom ain't bout Him
Say it with your chest, when the bishop is the king and the knight
The queen get the rest
I'm the only pawn that's on one,
 
back in '01
I was wishin' labels signed me, but now I own one
That ain't braggin', that's just motivation
Get your education, this industry overrated, Satan-saturated
Folk be lyin' to your face, and sayin' they glad you made it
Turn your back and you can hear 'em hatin' in they conversation
Ooh, snake face with the same bait and the same fate
Fake faith will get your face
 
ate, zero-eight bass
Nah, base like the base plate
How you runnin' home?

A slave to myself, but you let me go
I tried getting high, but it left me low
You did what they could never do
You cleaned up my soul
And gave me life, I'm so brand new
And that’s all that matters
I ain’t love you first, but you first loved me
In my heart I cursed you, but you set me free
I gave you no reason to give me new seasons
To give new life, new breathin’
But you hung there bleedin’
And you died for my lies and my cheatin’
My lust and my greed and
What is a man that you mindful of him?
And what do I have to deserve this lovin’?

And I was so dead I couldn't hear you
Too deep in sin to come near you
But you drew me in, you cleaned me up
So take me home, beam me up
Before you do, just let me tell the truth
And let these folks know that I done seen your love
And it's everlasting, infinite
It goes on and on, you can’t measure it
Can’t quench your love, they can’t separate
Us from the love of God: there’s no estimate
My face look the same, my frame ain’t rearranged
But I’m changed, I promise I ain’t the same
Your love’s so deep, you suffered and took pain
You died on the cross to give me a new name
Ain’t nothin’ like I've seen before, I got a beamin’ glow
I was low, down and dirty, but you cleaned me, Lord
You adopted me, you keep rockin’ me

Got a mil' in the bank
Another two up in the safe

But instead, I'm sharing my gift with the world

Now she used to strip at Onyx
Working her way through college
Tryna put food in her son's mouth
On a pole for them dollars
She was looking for some solace
Told the Lord, I promise.. I'm heading to the hills with my heels on
Where the feels ain't a touch to the billfolds
No copping feels from no Uncle Phil's, just Phil Jackson coach her
And get her out that game where they losing they dignity for a Coach purse
No skirts just, ""Skrr"", found another way around a real worth
And left that fine establishment
It's like her whole life is having a growth
Spurt
She out the game and they hate it, mad at her she made it (haters)
They ain't nothing but some shellfish in a bucket
Probably get crabs if you touch it
Now she graduated from college -- scratch that -- graduated with honors

Hollow points in it and all of that, I'm ready. We gang bangin'!

My cousin *

* was a killer
He done pulled a lot of triggers
He done made a lot of mamas cry
And if you ask him why he do it he'd just say, ""I'm young and foolish""
Bang on you right before he made them bullets fly

He ain't have no sense of dignity, his daddy was a mystery
He'll probably end up dead or sittin' in a penitentiary
And tell the judge he can go to hell for the sentence
And it probably make no sense to you but listen to the history
The new Jim Crow or the old one
People out here fightin' for equality and honestly I think they owed some
Back and forth some
Cleaver got a message for the people
Bunchy with 'em and they tryna stop the evil
And they cliqued up with they fist up
The whole neighborhood feelin' like they meant somethin'
Then it was a mix-up, Fed's got 'em fixed up
End of the movement, back to the bricks, bruh
And Raymond Washington about to start the Crips up
They gettin' bigger every day and tryna fix stuff
They saw Geronimo Pratt dodgin' bullets from attacks
Guess they figure, ""We don't really want it this much""

You know originally, the gangs were created to protect everybody in the community. There was lynching and bombing going on and the gangs were there to protect. What people don't understand is that a lot of the leaders died. Medgar Evers (has been shot), Bunchy Carter (has been shot), Fred Hampton (has been shot), MLK (has been shot in Memphis Tennessee). These youngsters didn't have any direction. No leaders to look up to so they imploded on themselves

They say that Crips stands for Community
Revolutionary InterParty Service
Way before the genocide and the murders
A little after integration was the verdict
When bombs might go off at the Sunday service (baow!)
They protectin' they community
Then it turn into diplomatic immunity
Then a fight against oppression was depressin'
Now they keep on losin' battles and they started losin' unity
Now they beat each other blue-black
Force fed self-hate 'til they tooth crack
Got they own folks hidin' on the rooftops
They ain't finna take no more, they finna shoot back (baow!)
Now they bond like a family, they all bloods
From the concrete jungle to the small hoods
Throwin' signs up, now the crime's up
We was meant to kill oppression now we load 9's up
But never mind us, grind us
Factory done closed, now a lot of people jobless
Now they got the drugs comin' in from Nicaragua
Government done turned a blind eye or they liars

It was a perfect storm. I mean, we're talkin' post-segregation. And what are you gonna do? The factories have closed and no one's hiring anybody from the urban community because of what you look like. And now there's a war going on in Nicaragua and drugs are being imported into your community. Are you gonna sell drugs or are you gonna be homeless? 'Cause the government's not paying attention

Huh, man, you tell me
What's a reasonable man to say?
There's a high school in Alabama named after Robert E. Lee
And it's 89% black, you don't see the irony?
What it do to a psyche, it's simple, you don't like me
What I'm 'posed to do now?
Delusional calling that system criminal justice
Where the rich and the guilty are safer than the poor and the innocent
Why would we listen?
When American churches scuff they Toms on our brother's dead bodies
As they march to stop gay marriage
Yo, we had issues with Planned Parenthood too
We just cared about black lives outside the wombs just as much as in
Young man gon' find purpose somehow
And The Nation was at least around
And when them vice lords told him he was of royal descent
And that war on drugs felt much more like war on the poor
He figured forget it
Why don't you come stay a while?
Tell us that the son of man walked on Egyptian
And Eastern soil and wasn't just a Western construct
Our master used to control us
But what the Master used to free us
And it was a crooked system just like this that left the King of Kings bloodless
Yeah, we are truly a descendant of a King
Only his reign is infinite
And being right is a distant second to the joy of compassion

Yeah, and you say Audemars, Audemars, Audemars
I still don't know what time
That the sun comes down from the stars
Lights off
Ain't nobody watchin' me
I heard about the Man in the sky
But He prolly fell asleep
Yeah, and you say Audemars, Audemars, Audemars
I still don't know what time
That the sun comes down from the stars

Yeah
They say that time waits for no man
Nah, they probly lyin'
Cause time waits on me like a servant all of the time
But, uh, I know some people who actually servin' time
Committed to this grind or just committed some crimes
Sometimes I wish I had some more time to think
And all the time in the world is all the time I need
And I know eternity's calling
But my mind too busy racing to pay any mind
Spent a whole lot of money on a watch
Ironic cause I got it, but I hardly sit and watch the time tick by
I spend time tryna buy it to own time
Never thought that I was only wasting my own time
Who holds time?
They say He'll be coming in no time
Pray I pay attention cause I'm giving Him no time
When the lights off, is anybody watching me?
Heard the Man above never slumber, never sleep

Lights off
Ain't nobody watchin' me
I heard about the Man in the sky
But He prolly fell asleep
Yeah, and you say Audemars, Audemars, Audemars
I still don't know what time
That the sun comes down from the stars

Yeah
On the corners in the alleys
I see conans and cowards
Scared to question their existence
Like ain't no final hour
Can we blame the sins of a reverend for all our irreverence
Does my time spent on earth qualify me for heaven
Did we tick Him off by wastin' all of these ticks on this clock
Or is He graciously givin' me time to give Him my heart
I'm sure it's the latter, sure that it matters
And I believe I've been given all this time
So I can try and redeem it
Or make the most of this stop watch that I'm racin'
You stop and watch you ain't racing'
You erasing yo' minutes, you can't replace 'em
And at the end of yo' days when eternity's in yo' face
You had one life to offer up in his service or lay to waste
So my Rollie's tellin' me to roll out
Make investments with my time while I'm tryna hold out, hold out
And fame, money, success be competing for my investments
But I can't take 'em with me when it's time for me to exit
Turn the...

Lights off
Ain't nobody watchin' me
I heard about the Man in the sky
But He prolly fell asleep
Yeah, and you say Audemars, Audemars, Audemars
I still don't know what time
That the sun comes down from the stars
Lights off
Ain't nobody watchin' me
I heard about the Man in the sky
But He prolly fell asleep
Yeah, and you say Audemars, Audemars, Audemars

Broken,Anomaly ,2014.0,"I’m just a broken instrument in the hands of the Greatest
So if the notes are off it’s ‘cause I ain’t nothin’ to play with
And you can fault me, but ain’t we all off key
Majorin' in the minors like there ain’t no errors behind us
Somehow he still makes these melodies with my felonies
I ain’t buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me
Broken pieces actin' like we ain’t cracked
Man we all messed up and can’t no one escape that
We some broken people
Came from broken homes
Broken hearts inside of a broken soul
Alcoholics, the addicts
English, African, Arabs
Ain’t no riches to fix it
You still broke when you have it
If you ain’t breakin' bad and you still chasin' the habit
It ain’t no wonderland so we still chasing the rabbit
Ain’t a soul on the planet, that’s better than another
And we all need grace in the face of each other

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams I thought I found
Can you put me back together?
I need your grace for my flaws

God I’m broken in this mess I’ve made
I need you to restore me

From Heaven we all small
Can't nobody buy tickets
You better have will call
That reaper he will call
They hurt just like me
Work just like me
Lust of the flesh the pride of life they flirt with like me
Regardless of our money we all broke together
And if we don't swallow our pride we gon' choke together
Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands
Fell off the wall of purity
Doing that Humpty dance
Forget the king's horses
Forget the king's men
The King is coming to put us back together again
Been fighting since my daddy left
Fighting for approval
Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile
We Tyler Durden won't be the burden of being less
Than what we were made to be like being what they suggest
We are outsiders, outliers
Out cry is loud, the meek inherit the earth
And God opposes the proud, wassup?!

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams I thought I found
Can you put me back together?
I need your grace for my flaws

God I’m broken in this mess I’ve made
I need you to restore me

Your presence in me
Is all the strength that I need
Your presence in me
Is all the strength that I need
And I'll always be whole
And I'll always be whole

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams I thought I found
Can you put me back together?
I need your grace for my flaws

God I’m broken in this mess I’ve made
I need you to restore me

You never left me
You never ran off
You never gave up
You never left me
You never ran off
You never gave up
You never left me

Dirty Water,Anomaly ,2014.0,"Hold up, hold up, hold up
Ya'll gon' get me bowed up
When that beat hit it's like three kicks in
Yo' knees up to yo' nose, huh
You knows us
Unashamed, Uno Uno Seis, whoa
Tatted on my skin, all up in yo' face, whoa
If I ain't bout that live, then I ain't really livin'
But if you can't see my light then maybe I ain't in it
Champagne, champagne, celebratin' my campaign
I just dug a well in West Africa
But how many of my friends is African, huh?
No habla español, just show me tu baño
Ain't tryna get to know you, I'm too busy readin' Daniel
Most segregated time of day is Sunday service (My Lord)
Now what you think that say about the God you worship?
First of all, I know it ain't a song that's gon change the world
There's no way
It's not a guilt trip, it's a field trip that's gon' last more than one day
What you thought, huh?
Faith ain't 'bout no soft stuff
I heard you just went overseas, now come back home and boss up

Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water, dirty water
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water
Ain't no filters in this town, dirty water

Worthless, worthless, 400 years we done heard that
My family came here on slave ships
Some herd cattle, some herd blacks
Know some of ya'll done heard that
My kin was treated less than men
That's why we raised to hate each other, cause we hate our skin
Lies you told about yourself that you don't realize
I must be a thief, she locked the doors when I was walking by
They must be whores cause the master rapes them
And leaves the child
So dead beat daddy was taught to me way before my time
Now we extreme, buying fancy things like gold chains
Just pretty shackles, we still enslaved
Put 'em round your neck, cuz we still hangin'
Hood preacher told 'em they should live as kings
You call him devil, he fightin for self esteem (think about it)
It's hard to dream when your water ain't clean
Now look at Lucifer's scheme as how to be in a teamOh
Blood in the ocean to these African streams
This dirty water ain't nothin we haven't seen

Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water, dirty water
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water

Boasting,Rehab,2010.0,"If this life has anything to gain at all
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I'm not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

With every breath I take, with every heart beat
Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song
It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known
Every day that I lie, every moment I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment
I, without the cross there's only condemnation
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration
So in times that are good, in times that are bad
For any times that I've had it all I will be glad
And I will boast in the cross. I'll boast in my pains
I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign
What's my life if it's not praising you?
Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit
I do not count my life as any value or precious at all
Let me finish my race, let me answer my call

If this life has anything to gain at all
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I'm not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear
Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air
God has never been obligated to give us life
If we fought for our rights, we'd be in hell tonight
Mere sinners owed nothing but a fierce hand
We never loved him, we pushed away his pierced hands
I rejected his love, grace, kindness, and mercy
Dying of thirst, yet, willing to die thirsty
Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?
Patiently you turned my heart away from selfishness
I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery
I know the Spirit's purging me of everything that's hurting me
Remove the veil from my darkened eyes
So now every morning I open your word and see the Son rise
I hope in nothin, boast in nothin, only in your suffering
I live to show your glory, dying to tell your story

If this life has anything to gain at all
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I'm not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

Glory was solely meant for you
Doing what no one else could do
With All I have to give, (With all I have to Give)
I'll use my life, I'll use my lips. (My Lips Yeaaah)
I'll only glory in your Word. What gift to me I don't deserve
I'll live in such a way that it reflects to you, my Praise

If this life has anything to gain at all
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, cause I need you

Worth It,All Things Work Together,2017.0,"It's just a little dirt, it's just a little stain

Listen, now you gon' have to explain to me how the Lord love a little sinner like me
I've been over-stressin', I've been second guessin'
I was on them Xan's for a second, I was feelin' so defeated
I thought I was a leader
Hurt so many people, all I see is teardrops when I try to go to sleep
I heard you had a soft spot for the black sheep
Offer me forgiveness while I struggle to receive it
Now would you still love me if I took her home last night?
Smokin' and sippin' on that Patrón last night?
If I was poppin' pills tryna cop a thrill?
And I know I'm wrong but I do it 'cause it feels so right
Would I, would I still be a child?

She put the blame all on herself (self)
She run into the arms of another man ('nother man)
And she done gave her heart to another man ('nother man)
She know she ain't the woman that she wanna be
Can't look in the mirror 'cause she don't see what she wanna see
She gave her love away too many times
Heard too many lies, she don't got no tears left to cry, yeah
Somewhere, she got a little child, but
She ain't see him in a while, now
She gave her baby to the system
Dealin' with her demons, she was fightin' her addiction
And this is all fact, not fiction
Prayin' that the Lord could really fix it
Said the last time was the last time
But the last time got her feelin' like the Devil's mistress, but listen

It's not easy, when you gotta face yourself
Truth is, I don't deserve not one bit of help
Promise that your lovin' never leave
Once you've seen all of me
It's just so hard to believe it all but for grace
To trust you more (trust you more)
To love you more (to love you more)

You say, ""But I was misused""

Mayday,Gravity,2012.0,"Awakened from my slumber by the thunder, lightning clapping
Raining on my window pane and praying I make something happen
A preacher's prophecies never bothered me when I was younger
Sitting on my Grandma's lap, as she cried I often wondered
What was her tears for? Could it be for my grandfather?
Or maybe she felt for me cause I'll see more of those cold tomorrows
Then she see the world will up and turn on me
Cause the morals that she often spoke were meant for 1923
I fall asleep off in her arms, a Psalm was spoken
The Lord is surely my shepherd, he lead me to the water
Thought that often stuck with me
Amongst the wolves that run the streets
Out here paying dues to lose
I pray your angels come for me
A non-believer I never have or could be
Lord give me time to peep the signs I should see
Sipping got me feeling like a player riding clean
Bending corners hoping I might find my saviour on the curb
I rarely go to Church
False prophets rocking Prada so I rarely feel the word
Jezebels lurking in the pews on the first
Preacher's weaker than the deacon cause it's hard to fight the urge
It's hard to live and serve when you on the Devil's turf
Sell your soul for the low with no sense of what it's worth
Don't get it twisted, I ain't no saint, I ain't no pastor
But prayer ain't just for cloudy days and natural disasters
Aware of what comes after, I bet you ain't for sure
I was warned that Heaven ain't the only place to go
I'm doing what I can cause there really ain't much time
I leave this in the Lord hands
I'm tired of crying
Yeah, Krizzle

Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Am I biased?
 
I been pious put my nose up in the pews
Like Paul I bear good news
They think I'm pall-bearing
My message sounds like death to these hearers as they perish
Scaring to think we on the brink of death
But no one stops to look for answers on what happens next
Got a couple scriptures from my grandma
Sayings from a preacher
But can't live out these standards that we heard it takes to reach 'em
But when I look at Jesus, He lived the life I couldn't
Suffered for my crime so I wouldn't
I used to have to sneak into movies cause I couldn't afford to pay
Explain to me how someone paid my way
When I hear K.R.I.T. confessin', I respect him
Cause most of us be lyin' like our lives don't need perfecting
Nothing that we can muster, nothing that we can change
Admittin' that we're imperfect, offending God with our games
Look I'm just being honest so don't take me for no lame
I seen it for myself, I'm a product of this thing
Now I found true religion, and it's not inside a denim
And them overpriced shades have never given us vision

I just wanted it to end

I couldn't shake it off
Another murder on the television
Man, somebody go turn it off
I spoke my mind, I got attacked for it
Thought these people had my back boy
Then they tellin' me I asked for it
I guess I'm just another black boy
And then they killed Tamir Rice
And they just go on with they life
They tellin' me shut up talking 'bout it
Like, I should just talk about Christ
But the truth is I started to doubt God
I started to question my purpose
I started to act out
I ain't wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile

I almost had a breakdown

This what I'm made to be
My daddy still on that crack
And he might never come back
But I still love the man, I don't judge the man
I could be on that track
I'm glad that Jesus ain't American

People started praying for me
And homies tellin' me I was being arrogant
I quit poppin' them pills

I know a lot of people that are scared they gon' die
Couple of 'em thinkin' they'll be livin' in the sky
While I'm here livin', man, I gotta ask Why?
What am I here for? I gotta figure out
Waste my life? No, I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gon' do about
Everything in Luke 12:15 down to 21 you really oughta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrected we wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryna show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of any women or men that you admire
It ain't no lie, we created for Him
Outta the dust He made us from
Elects us and He saves us for Him
Jesus comes and He raises for Him
Magnify the Father, why bother with something lesser?
He made us so we could bless Him
To the world we confess Him, resurrect Him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man, I know I got Christ
If you don't' see His ways in my days and nights you can hit my brakes, you would stop my life
Then I lost my rights, lost my life
Forget the money, cars, and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet that'll cost that price

Don't wanna waste my life

Armed and dangerous
So the devil just can’t hang with us
Christian youth them a stand with us
Livin' and driven, given a vision
Fullfillin' the commission He handed us
London to Los Angeles
The rap evangelist
My Daddy wouldn't abandon us
I got a backpack full of tracks, and I keep a Johnny Mac
So are you ready to jam with us? So let's go
Give me the Word and let's go
Persecution–let's go
Tribulation–let's go
Across the nation–let's go
Procrastination–best go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for the young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows
How many souls are going to Hell or to Heaven so we gotta go in and get 'em

Don't wanna waste my life

Suffer, yeah, do it for Christ
You tryna figure what to do with your life
You make a lot money? Hope you doin' it right because the money is God's, you better steward it right
And stay focused, you ain't got no ride?
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The color of your skin, nah, you Christian first
People get to living for a job
Make a little money, start living for a car
Get 'em a wife, a house, kids, and a dog
When they retire they livin' high on the hog
But guess what? They didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ, and that's Paul, I recall
To die is gain, so for Christ we give it all
He's the Treasure you can never find in the mall
See, your money, your singleness, marriage, talents, your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See, my whole world is built around Him
He's the life in my lines
I refuse to waste my life
He's too true to chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time cause I'm constantly tryna be used to praise the Christ
If He's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by His grace you could put your faith in a place that rules your days and nights

Don't wanna waste my life",https://genius.com/Lecrae-dont-waste-your-life-lyrics

One thousand
Biz busy on the boards
I hear 'em cheering from the sidelines
Wait, hold up, I think they hatin'
People told me take my time, right?
Nah, they tired of waitin'
They say ""'Crae, you sold your soul, man""
For real? Who bought it?
""Let the Spirit take control, man""
I don't go nowhere without Him

They scared that I'ma cause these babies to stumble
They scared that my integrity is gon' crumble, appreciate the prayers
But all that pressure either gon' make you humble
Or make you hang out on the sidelines, and fear you gon' fumble
Put me in coach, ain't out here flexin' for nobody
I was born to do it, God don't make mistakes and say I'm sorry
He ain't never dropped the ball
I don't never plan to fumble
Catch me runnin' with them lions
Reggie Bushin' in the jungle
Came from nothin'
I remember spendin' summers on the corner with my cousin Shootin' dice and playin' dozens
Me and BJ in that Cutlass, CD playin' missin' buttons
Up at Lincoln High in Dallas with that
 
Jesus Muzik bumpin'
Now it's Joseph graduation
Turn on that radio and T-Dot on the station
I remember when we used to split the rent up
UGK was bangin' loud inside his pickup
Wait, let me pick up
Back when promoters wouldn't let me back in
'Less I pay 'em on a back end, that ain't happenin'
We just pray to God that somehow He would let us crack in
Took that door off of them hinges
Told us, ""Get it crackin'""

I hear 'em cheering from the sidelines
People told me take my time, right?
Hear 'em cheerin' from the sidelines
Hold up, I think they hatin'
People told me take my time, right?
They tired of waitin'

They braggin' they in the buildin'
Ain't buildin' nothin'
We out here buildin' the children, you know I love 'em, boy
Spit it how I live, feel it in my breath
Walk it like I talk, put it to the test
Gina, get to steppin', we get to startin'
You dream of bein' a king but you watchin' the wrong Martin, Bruh Man
This ain't the fifth floor, it's the penthouse
Either you change your outlook or get out
And life ain't never been a dream, you just oversleepin'
If it wasn't hard work, they probably cheatin'
Yeah, give that arrogance some rest
This ain't happen overnight, that's why I do this thing to death
I might do this 'til I'm deaf, dumb and blind
You know I don't need my eyes to see my faith working fine
Never mind me
I ain't worried 'bout how they define me
Long as they can find me they'll never confine me

Woo!  Man forget the bench press - today it is a cardio day for your boy! My goodness, she bad!
Holla at yo boy!

Uh, I can't lie, I admire beauty  like the next man
I still remember when I used to get my check cashed
Get my hair cut,  I hit the streets with my head gassed
Lookin' out for little mommas with a fat faaasssss
That's what my auntie used to tell me
Girl in my rear view  tryna tell me
Cause she knew wasn't nothing you could tell me
Always on a trail of another female
Well, well they say my papa was a player
So my dishonesty is honest in me baby
Somehow in college greek letters made me cuter
All the time on line I still couldn't compute it
Uh, I pledge girls then it's on to the next girl
My next girl eventually be my ex girl
But its' funny how it all unfolds
I done finally found a woman I ain't never letting go, whoa

Ooh she looking bad (Don't do it)
I wonder if she got a man (Don't do it)

Keep it one hundred, love everybody want it
But the lies and the lust keep lying next to us, but
I got past, and now I'm known to pass it
Up from my passion and I ain't here blastin'
Born a sinner just like any man standing
Couldn't keep the standard so God sent a stand-in
If you creepin' when you feel desire creep in
I know another way to win that don't involve cheating
Don't involve another heart broken into pieces
When a girl call you tell you she saw you on Peach Tree
Meet pretty underscore nice features
Had a couple drinks and had yourself a little piece and
Now you feel like the man in the streets pull 'em to the crib
I see your pants in the street, man

The wait is over (Cannon, Cannon)
It's about time I suit up
And get ready for business (The Cannon)
See it's been a minute since season one (The Cannon)
So we had to gear up for season two
Only difference is, the army got stronger (Das facts)

Uh-oh I done woke up
Slept on me trying to eat with vultures
Ya'll look frail, lemme feed the culture
Can't get full off the lead and coke, huh?
Still sober? Y'all OD, follow me
Wanna reign, follow me
King, ya'll know the King
Martin Luther King
You ain't really on a throne, boy you in a dream
Wake up, wake up, y'all don't want it
Down to The Wire, better put Marlo on it
And el es un chico malo, homie
And if I'm scared, I guess I don't know it
Cause I'm still going
Still right where the heat at
And where I ain't supposed to be
That's where I be at
And I spit that, sit back
Listen to the truth
'Fore the sky crack and the Lord gets back
Or somebody want some hit back
And they click-clack, they be bent back
Leaking out that syntax
Never left but I been back
Cross on my big-knack
And I don't rap Gospel, I live that
But I'm nothin' but a gimmick?
See me in a club
Funny, you was in it?
Skip a co-sign shout out to the homie Kendrick
And all I hear is crickets
When I run into the critics
Oh well, it sure tells me a lot
When they tell me to rock
Keep my eyebrows raised smell what I'm cookin'?
And the sales may drop
Yeah, the mail may stop
But they ask for the truth
(Yeah then I'mma do it)
They like ""how you do dat dair?""
Sounds kinda nice, boy ""who dat dair?""
Is everything real, good, true and fair?
But you prob'ly wouldn't listen
If you knew ""dat dair""

There's nothing you could do or say to me
To knock me off my square
The Reach Records empire
The number one co-signer Don Cannon

Creepin' out the lions' den
So really all it takes
Is a little training camp
And the attributes go right back up
Left hook, check
Right hook, check
Uppercut is a check
Right, left, right, jab is a check
A hundred wins, no losses

Shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
Yeah, ayy
Shine a light on me

Learned a lot over these last few years
Industry people ain't friends, just peers
I learned that these girls easy like the morning of a Sunday
They don't love you 'til you gone like Harambe
Still killin' over colors, now it's black and blue
We dyin' every day, B, we just don't make the news
When you speak out for your race, just watch
They gon' twist and say you hate these cops
I'ma take these shots
How can he love Jesus, Kanye, and K-Dot?
Martin, Malcolm, and Schaeffer, Mitsubishi, and Maybach?
Contradictory, nah, it's complimentary
Understanding me ain't for the simple and elementary, oh

I know this might go over some heads
But I come from being government fed
Could be running from feds
But now I give the government bread
'Cause you playin' back the words that I said

I can't believe we made it through
My momma said she ain't surprised, told me that she always knew
My day ones still the same ones, love to the crew
I told my lady, ""I ain't never met nobody like you""
I thank you

Now I remember, uh, I was sittin' in my room
Glued to my television daily after school
And I never saw me goin' to college
Higher learning was a different world, I can acknowledge
I used to imagine me in a black Range
Gettin' paid from doin' this lil' rap thing
And now I'm payin' these professors couple thousand for a lesson
Graduated, in recession, Sallie Mae just wanna check in, I'm stressin'
Rap music, it was all a dream
Now I'm in a session chasin' my dream
Who would have knew? Man, it's crazy
S1 introduced me to JAY-Z
Never met my dad, but I met the music that raised me

I know this might go over some heads
But I come from being government fed
Could be running from feds
But now I give the government bread
'Cause you playin' back the words that I said

My day ones still the same ones, love to the crew
I told my lady, ""I ain't never met nobody like you""

Listen, I know God did it, can't take the credit
Paid off all of my debts, but I still feel so indebted
Been all over the world with these songs I wrote
My life story oughta to give y'all hope
Without a doubt I've been doubted and counted out
I've been down for the count, about to quit
Momma told me keep going 'cause I was made for this
I either get a scholarship or I could get a hit
I still can't believe I made it here

I can't believe we made it through
My momma said she ain't surprised, told me that she always knew
My day ones still the same ones, love to the crew

People riot in the streets
Killin' unborn babies
Catchin' shots from police

Never thought that I would see the day
When I would have to pray for God to hold me down
'Cause Lord, I feel like giving up today
I feel like giving up the faith
I swear these people fake, I swear they full of hate
I swear to tell the truth until I'm in the grave
Shots-shots fired, everybody quiet
Tryna hear the preacher, he ain't preachin' to the choir
Preachin' to the riots that he got fired
He ain't got no Medicare, sippin' liquor in his chair
Blank stare, need a blank check, where your bank at?
Babies had a birthday, they gon' need a rain check
Rich man need a vacation, hop a plane
Broke man need a vacation, Mary Jane
Walk outside and everything is lovely
Butterflies in my stomach from this girl I wanna see
Party in the neighborhood and everybody on the street
They was on that Stevie Wonder now it's Frankie Beverly
I done seen days go crazy, time fly by
Maybe it was yesterday or maybe 65
Peace then war, born then die
All too familiar, more lifetimes

One time for the memories, two times for the crew
Three times for the love, y'all
And four times for the truth
And some days are a nightmare
And some dreams come true
But the Lord's still right there
It's just déjà vu
It's just déjà vu, déjà vu
It's just déjà vu, y'all
It's just déjà vu
It feel like Tribe Called Quest, it feel like De La Soul
It feel all too familiar, it feel like déjà vu

I said I love you, hit the door
Got a mission, gotta go
Yeah, it's cold, but I'm gon' pursue that
She said she love me but she know
I'm too old to be waiting for a handout, boy you knew that
And if they try to keep me down
Hold my ground 'til they all look around
And they wonder, ""Who that?""
They don't respect my mind or respect my grind
So I told her, ""I got to do that""
Now maybe I was talkin' to my lady
But I think I told my mama same thing
I told her I was all about the action
And then I got Ghostface in my dream
Déjà vu, parlez-vous français? Quoi de neuf?
Everything the same under the sun, that's why we burnin' up
Don't believe astrology, but man, I hated cancer
Breast, lung, throat, blood, prayin' for an answer
Seem like it was yesterday, they came and took your breath away
And I ain't get a chance to tell you everything I want to say
Now they say your sister got it too
Yeah, they say it's true
Guess it's never finished 'til it's you

And freedom got a price nobody payin'

Write a song justifyin' the lies we take for him, hold up

Stomach filled from another meal that my momma killed still
I can't keep still
I'd probably steal to keep a couple of Nike checks on the back of my heels
Grandma back on them pills
I need a stack of them bills
They say we slaves to the money
I guess we back on the field
I'ma go pursue my happiness, they told me it was free
But I'm still payin' for it, I'm indebted to this thing
Heard a prophet say the profit, don't focus on makin' change
Just focus on tryna be it and maybe you'll make a gain
Maybe you'll free the slaves, maybe you'll bring a change
The destinations are different but everyone's on the train

Please let me be free, please let me

King Kunta, or king of coonin', or Kenan & Kel
Rather rot in a jail cell than be up in hell, well
Well done, is you cookin' or is you hearin' your Father say, ""Well done""?
Is He lookin' at all your honors?
Modestly I'll be honest, I'm hangin' onto that promise
'Cause honestly I ain't really been everything that I oughta
Oughta be on my Harriet, bury me next to Honest Abe
Here lies another man murdered for tryna free the slaves
I gave Chief Keef my number in New York this summer
I told him, ""I could get you free"", I'm on my Nat Turner
Back burner, cookin' up a fat burger
While we shuck and jive to a song about a crack murder
Know we need a change but we threw it on the stage
Got some money and a soul and neither one of us saved
Slaves, get free

Before the Lord get me I gotta say something quickly
I grew up empty since my daddy wouldn't with me shoot
I wasn't picky I'd take any male figure
You stepped in at the right time
It's 'cause of you that I write rhymes
You probably never knew that
I loved the way you used to come through
Teach me to do the things that men do
True
You showed me stuff I probably shouldn’t have seen
But you had barely made it out your teens
And took me under your wings
I wanted hats, I wanted clothes just like you
Lean to the side when I rolled just like you
Didn't care people didn't like you
You wanna bang, I wanna bang too
Skyline, piru
You would've died, I would've died too
You went to prison, got sick, lost your pops
Yeah, I cried too
You never know who's right behind you
I got a little son now and he do whatever I do
But it's something deep inside you
That tell you that's gotta be more
Than doing what other guys do
They had nobody there to guide you
But I followed your footsteps

Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life
Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life
If this ain't living and they lied well
Guess I married an old wives' tale
Wow, fail
I don't know another way to go
This is the only way they ever showed
I got this emptiness inside
That got me fighting for approval
'Cause I missed out on my daddy saying “Way to go”
And get that verbal affirmation
On know how to treat a woman
Know how to fix an engine
That keep the car running
So now I'm looking at the media
And following what they feed me
Rap stars, trap stars
Whoever wants to lead me
Even though they lie
They still tell me that they love me
They say I'm good at bad things
At least they proud of me
(At least they proud of me)

I just wanna be like you
Walk like, talk like, even think like you

You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, be like
I just gotta be like you, like you

I was created by God
But I ain't wanna be like Him
I wanna be Him
The Jack Sparrow of my Caribbean
I remember the first created being
And how he shifted the blame on his dame
For fruit he shouldn't have eaten
And now look at us all out of Eden
Wearing designer fig leaves by Louis Vuitton
Make believing
But God sees through my foolish pride
And how I’m weak like Adam
Another victim of Lucifer's lies
But then in steps Jesus
All men were created to lead
But we need somebody to lead us
More than a teacher
But somebody who buy us back from the darkness
Say He redeemed us
Taught us that real leaders follow God
Finish the work 'cause we on our job
Taught us not to rob
But give life love a wife
Like He loved the Church
Without seeing how many hearts we can break first
I wanna be like you in every way
So if I gotta die everyday
Unworthy sacrifice
But the least I can do is give the most to me
'Cause being just like you
Is what I'm supposed to be
You said you came for the lame
I'm the lamest
I made a mess but you say you'll erase it
I'll take it
You said you came for the lame
I'm the lamest
I broke my life, but you say you'll replace it
I'll take it

Tell my queen to pawn all my thoughts
Sell those songs the people ain't got
All these folks who with us for the last ten
And look at us, now we can't stop
Sometimes, the first one to lead
Is the first one to make big mistakes
And the first one to be criticized
And the first one to feel hate
But I swear the moves that I made
I was trying to work on my faith
I've been wrong before
But where I'm 'bout to go
Won't put it all in my face

It's evident you run the show, so let me back down
You take the leading role, and I'll play the background
I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines
I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs
I don't need my name in lights, I don't need a starring role
Why gain the whole wide world, If I'm just gon' lose my soul?
And my ways ain't purified, don't live according to Your Word
I can't endure this life without Your wisdom being heard
So word to every dancer for a pop star
Cause we all play the background, but mine's a rockstar
Yeah, so if you need me I'll be stage right
Praying the whole world will start embracing stage fright
So let me fall back, stop giving my suggestions
Cause when I follow my obsessions, I end up confessing
That I'm not that impressive, matter of fact
I'm who I are, a trail of stardust leading to the superstar

I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

I had a dream that I was captain of my soul
I was master of my fate, lost control, and then I sank
So I don't want to take the lead, cause I'm prone to make mistakes
All these folks who follow me, gon' end up in the wrong place
So let me just shadow you, let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in you, cause I only trust in me
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothing
You pulled my card, I'm bluffing, You know what's in my hand
Me, I just roll and trust you, You cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow you at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is You the boss
Man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background, like it's an instrument

I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

I know I'm safest when I'm in Your will, and trust Your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred
And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games
Got plenty aims, but do they really glorify Your name?
And it's a shame, the way I want to do these things for You, yet
Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and glean from You
Seems You were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's cause she never heard of this

I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead",https://genius.com/Lecrae-background-lyrics
River of Jordan,The Shack (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2017.0,"They say wash in the river of Jordan
Wipe away your sins like I’ve done mine
And the people then they’ll be equals
There’s too many sinkholes we’ve left behind

I’m losing my religion
I’ve realized I wasn’t built for these conditions

Yeah
I gave up my all
When I felt lost not a one of ya’ll called
When I took off everybody else stalled
I don’t really understand what ya’ll on
What ya’ll want
I can’t live, can’t be free
I can’t be here
Gave my sweat gave my tears
Gave up all the best of my years
I done gave everything
I ain’t gained anything
Just pain and more sadness
Just broad strokes and blank stares
No details and no canvas
Nah I ain’t livin for your love
Case dismissed I don’t need another judge
I done got everything off my chest
But I got one more thing to confess

I’m losing my religion
I’ve realized I wasn’t built for these conditions
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah

So Imma leave religion for a relationship
Never sell my soul Imma sell my ship
I failed you all because I failed to help
Just know I failed myself
But faith keeps me from folding
It’s all I got left I’m left here with no one
I ain’t choose You but You say I’m chosen
And when I feel lost the cross all I hope in
I lost my religion but I found God
Sounds odd but I’m better at seeing how far
Did I come from the dark is the nights to the light
Irregardless of all of my many flaws
Amen
I ain’t livin for your love
Case dismissed I don’t need another judge
I done got everything off my chest
But I got one more thing to confess

They say wash in the river of Jordan
Wipe away your sins like I’ve done mine
And the people then they’ll be equals
There’s too many sinkholes we’ve left behind

I’m losing my religion
I’ve realized I wasn’t built for these conditions
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah

They say wash
In the river of Jordan

Believe,Church Clothes 2,2013.0,"Ohh, welcome to the Heat Academy

I came home after a trip to Atlanta, a different planet
Is where they thought I came from after my ship had landed
Truth is I had this meeting with God and confessed my sin
And he gave me this new beginning all I could do then was pen it
I came home after a trip to Atlanta, a different planet
Is where they thought I came from after my ship had landed
Truth is I had this meeting with God and confessed my sin
And he gave me this new beginning all I could do then was pen it
All down in my notebook, just a lot of verses
Me learning how not to curse was like learning to write in cursive
She still flirting with me even though we up in church
And I'm fighting to memorize all these verses up in the word
You would have never seen it coming
A couple months ago I'm getting high with my cousin
And fast forward now around campus I am buzzing
Not really but it felt like that, it felt like rap was just another passion
Never thought I'd be at the Grammy's talking about my fashion
You don't believe in God? Well how do you explain what happened?
I promise we ain't plan it, now Christians unashamed from Zambia to Manhattan
Still looking for the pattern? Come On

What would it take to make you believe?
More fire from the sky? Another part in the sea?
The honest truth is, that you ain't got the power to see
And let me take you on this journey, it all started with me

What would it take to make you believe?
More fire from the sky? Another part in the sea?
The honest truth is, that you ain't got the power to see
And let me take you on this journey, it all started with me
Yeah

Most of the things I thought I'd never do I did though
And I ain't nothing but a man standing up on his tiptoes
Shoutout to Kirk Franklin, but I ain't him
I'm what happens when hip-hop lets all the Saints in
I wouldn't call it gospel music, but I'm Christian though
And this what happen when a Christian flow
Now it's funny cause I don't really got a home
And this industry saying leave him alone
Unless he become a clone
Have me singing the same old songs, no power in 'em
But I'm too hard to understand, I'm an algorithm
And evidently it's evidence I'm a resident
Of somewhere that you know that you oughta be but you never been
So try to get used to me,
 
cause I'mma settle in
Reminding you to settle your heavenly settlement
A sight for sore eyes, or an eyesore, it don't matter
I own a label, and guess what, I'mma sign more",https://genius.com/Lecrae-believe-lyrics
No Regrets,Church Clothes,2012.0,"(And they say) You only live once so live it up tonight
I hope we live twice cause I can't wait to give up this life
Don't get me wrong I love my fam and my experience
Been around the world and back seven wonders I done seen 'em
Number eight is just us wondering what happens when we perish
And I don't want no regrets I'mma tell the ones I cherish
That I love 'em thinking of 'em on this red eye flight to Paris
If I die before I wake at my wake please tell my parents
That your son will positively wake in paradise
Life is like a pair of dice so watch the ones you rolling with
Roll a clip of my life you gon' see a bunch of empty bottles
Broken hearts and blurry nights, Facebook likes and twitter follows
Im not living for today cause tomorrows looking pleasant
And the future is a gift even though this is the present
Yea I do believe in heaven but my actions ain't the key
Them gates remain locked if everything fall on me

So let ‘em know that when I come to the end of my road
And they ask me was it worth it
The hurting, the pain, and the life I chose
I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart-heart-heartbeat
I'll tell 'em I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart-heart-heartbeat
And I died with no regrets

You not a leader cause they follow you on Twitter
And you not a man based up on your age and your gender
If you die tonight you probably die a boy
Chasing toys objectifying these women thinking they gon' bring you joy
Don’t you want more than last night’s braggin' rights? What’s your life?
I know it's hard to think about underneath these flashing lights
Scratch the surface money's worthless when it comes to finding purpose
If you keep the end in focus you can't keep it when it's over
And when it's over this something else starts
Only thing that's really gon' matter is that hope inside your heart
What you trusting in what you lusting in
For that busty momma that's strutting in
And you popping bottles you throwing dollars
That's cool but partner this just in
That you gon' live forever whether you want to or not
Some of us gon' end up holy some of us gon' end up hot
Tell this life to keep my problems kiss my momma when I'm gone
Tell her I have no regrets and I'm home I'm home

So let ‘em know that when I come to the end of my road
And they ask me was it worth it
The hurting, the pain, and the life I chose
I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart-heart-heartbeat
I'll tell 'em I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart-heart-heartbeat

Wish,Anomaly ,2014.0,"Yeah
I wish I never held back
Wish nobody had to sell crack
Then I may have seen my dad a little more
Maybe I can dream a little more
But I still wishing on stars in the sky
Wish a lot of people was alive
And I probably passed on a whole lot of truth
But I know about a whole lot of lies
Man I wish I had me a time machine
I would tell Martin it was all a dream
And I wish like Ray J back in 06
Guess it worked ‘cause I got my chick
And I wish like Kellz did
If I could change the clock
Man I’d change a lot
And I probably wouldn’t be so selfish
I woulda gave a lot
Man I’m ashamed of that
I wish I coulda told O thank you
Before it got way too late
I wish I woulda worked on my jump shot
But time just fades away
I probably wish too much
I know I pray less than I should
I know I did too much
I take it all back if I could

Wish I had another chance
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Every time I think about all of my mistakes
I just wanna turn it around
Be like oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
If I never went there, I would never know
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Maybe I can turn it around

I wish I didn’t do it but I did it
Man it happened last night
Man I wish I would try to act like you ain’t never lost your sight
And I don’t even do it for the money
Except when I do it for the money
Trying to find yourself and you find yourself doing things in the dark kinda funny
I wish I had ten more wishes
I swear I got ten more visions
And life is a game that I can’t stop playing
Baby gimme like ten more minutes
I’m almost finished
I wish I had a little more time
I gotta whole lot of goals I wish I could achieve, I believe Imma lose my mind
Before I get to those
Yeah I miss the goals
But my shot was off
Can't tell what I lost until I count the cost
But I probably missed my calling
Wish I was a little bit taller
Wish I was a baller
Then again every time I get a little money
I be looking at the next man like he smaller
I can’t call it
And I wish I didn’t go and get high on the one first date
I was all zoned out, paranoid like “did you hear that noise""
And I know she probably thinking I’m cray
No pun intended
I wish I repented
A little bit quicker
Then again I didn’t pull the trigger
I know I said I have no regrets but I sure do wish every chance I get go figure

Wish I had another chance
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Every time I think about all of my mistakes
I just wanna turn it around
Be like oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
If I never went there, I would never know
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Maybe I can turn it around

Lost My Way,Church Clothes 2,2013.0,"Running, running ‘til the fear is gone, don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know if I’ll make it home, tell Mama I’m sorry
I know that I’ve made mistakes, tell her it ain’t easy
I’ll see her on judgment day
I lost my way, I lost my way
I lost my way, I lost my way
I lost my way, I lost my way
I lost my way, I lost my way

And tell the pastor to pray for me, I’m gone
Ayy look, tell my mom and my partners who knew me since I was younger
I’m ‘bout to sell out for fame and a couple dollars
Probably seen me on TV, standing with girls in bikinis
Bragging on money and things that I had to borrow
They knew it, I blew it, fame and fortune got to me
Keeping it real will keep you broke, I’m out here looking for glue
You wanted real hip-hop, I’m sorry
‘Cause this VIP is free and all these girls want to party
So, super producer, pop singer, plus the yola
Now they got my record spinning, trying to sell you cola
Ah man, what happened? I started moving too fast
Traded the craft for the cash so now you do the math
Subtract the heart and the art you make for the people
You end up with a whole lot of zeros feeling like a zero
I use to be a hip-hop hero, now I’m just a victim of my ego
I lost my way, yeah, I lost my way
Mama, tell 'em I lost my way
Lord, I lost my way, yeah

Crazy can’t nobody relate to nothing real no more
They want something fake, they want something fabricated, it’s crazy, you know
Can’t nobody relate when I say, when I say

When I say riding in the Hyundai, happy it’s the weekend
‘Cause I know Verizon won’t disconnect my cell on a Sunday
They killed my Uncle Heli for nothing, I hate this gunplay
I can only talk to you from my soul, it’ll pay off one day
One thousand, I got to be like an open book, we're spitting
It ain’t the car you drove, it’s the road you took to get it that defines you
Forget all that faking, whipping and soda
Spending their life savings in front of a club promoter
Like they got it like that, man that’s a kid on that car
Acting like he bought it like that, you only get me so far
You ain’t no artist like that, art ain’t loud, it’s thought provoking
And often the biggest words come from those who are softer spoken
For the ice and the cream they be Baskin' and Robbin'
At gunpoint, they love it, I pray you ain’t walking beside ‘em
At one point, we fought together, made 'em stop all they lies
But now we lie to ourselves in that we don’t realize
Lord, help us

Running, running ‘til the fear is gone, don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know if I’ll make it home, tell Mama I’m sorry
I know that I’ve made mistakes, tell her it ain’t easy

Haven't you, haven't you noticed
Rappers they flex on the place where they come from
They brag that they eatin' while we got no groceries

Barely Americans really do dream
That couldn't leave heritage, we marry codeine

Twenty-four years old, my momma brought me to the globe
Tried to tell me it was cold and taught me how to keep the coat
Now, now, now she told me to go to school and get my education
But remember there's a bias to them books that they be makin'
Gave me, Soul on Ice and taught me
'Bout the Middle Passage, told me
God ain't white and that there's
More to life than rap and I

First of all, let me be clear one time
Let me be real one time
If you want a religious puppet you gon' have to hang this guy
I've been around the world and seen pretty girls get caged up like sex slaves
Crooked cops done pulled me over, treated me like I ain't made
In the image of God and that's so odd

Had an alter ego, but my ego altered at the altar call
Looked up at the ceiling and I heard the angels talkin', y'all
What'd they say? They said
I was made in His image, in His likeness
Bite this if you don't like this, herbs and spices is righteous
Nothin' in the world quite like this, hold on to it with a tight fist

I mean it's been some years since I left you in your bedroom wiping tears
I disappeared after I had met your momma now
And you met all my family too
They told us ""love was complicated""
We told them ""we gon' make it through""
But I blew it, I missed it, I didn't make you Mrs., I just made you miss us
I didn't put no ring on yo finger, but I did put you through the ringer
Yeah, I own that
Wish I could go back
Treat you right and take my wrongs back
But you should know that I

I wish you all the love you could imagine

I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
I know I'm the worst
You deserve the best
That's what you deserve

Yeah, yeah, now how we get this far?
Everything escalated
Late nights talkin' on the phone
Even with my situation, I'm so taken
But either way, I called you when you hit back
And we talked through all my dark times and you told me to just kick back
Lay on your shoulders
Know we friends but we closer
Thought that this could never work but I kept on walking that road
Maybe reconsider everything
Tell my girl we'll prolly never make it to the wedding day
I might not be ready, man
Oh, left her at the altar
Pretty sure I scarred her
And I hope that Heaven caught her

But I’m hearin’ screams from the stands cause we souled out, it’s so loud
I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one
If you don’t like it, cool
It is what it is, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is, it is what it is
I’m handlin' biz, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is

Some like, “I ain’t really feelin' that bruh
I ain’t with religious rap, bruh”
Some sayin' it is devil rap
Illuminati-on-another-level rap
Fell flat from heaven went to hell and back, huh?
A lot of radio ain’t givin' no play, but it’s ok
Cause my day one's been A-1
Before the co-signs and the pros came
Where you been, been boy, boy?
You ain’t been keepin' up
Church Clothes 1 and 2, then Anomaly
You probably need to turn your speakers up
And now I’m on my third tape
And I just might drop it on a Thursday
So tell the industry and my enemy
That your man wouldn’t follow in they rules in the first place
Thirty plus in the residential
In the truck feelin’ presidential
With my girl lookin’ detrimental
Killin' anything tryna to be a side piece out my mental
Outta your mind
You thinkin’ I’m leavin’ my baby by marchin’ for dimes?
You'll get that curve, you way out of line
Gave her that rock, I’m stayin’ with mine
I keep the huddle mad tight, too many players I don’t trust now
You wasn’t with me on the 4th down, huh?
Then you can miss me when I touchdown
And that’s no shade, no shade
It’s just those games, I don’t play
I’m gettin’ wiser with more age
And realizin’ some gonna hate
And that’s ok

I’m hearin’ screams and they sayin’ we sold out
But I’m hearin’ screams from the stands cause we souled out, it’s so loud
I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one
If you don’t like it, cool
It is what it is, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is, it is what it is
I’m handlin' biz, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is

Hold up
Let me get a minute from the flexin’
Foreign cars and the million dollar jets
Futuristic clothes, feelin’ like a Jetson
Cause keep it trill, it ain’t really that impressive
Blessed, but I ain’t frontin’ with the Grammys or the fame
I’m just stuntin’ with my family unashamed
And cats say, Crae, you done got it all
In the gym workin' hard, you should show it off!
Nah, that ain’t never been my forte
Pride come before the fall, what the Word say
And I’ve been eatin’ off the wordplay
Working hard on the lyrics that the world play
Remember where I came from in the first place
It’s all a gift, every breath is a birthday
So I spend time tryna find all of these souls lost
Cause it’s a wasted time if I got it all and they souls lost
I ain’t tryna to ball
If that’s what you feel then your goals off
It’s a different game tryna get this truth
Put you on and then go off
So, yeah, I may swag at award shows
Get some jet lag from a tour show
Keep a couple abs on my torso
But none of that is gon' matter when the horn blow
I ain’t tryna front for them flashin’ lights
Man they had us, life is a gift
So if last night was my last night, them I’m good
It is what it is

I’m hearin’ screams and they sayin’ we sold out
But I’m hearin’ screams from the stands cause we souled out, it’s so loud
I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one
If you don’t like it, cool
It is what it is, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish

Anomaly,Anomaly ,2014.0,"I never fit in I was a outcast
In grade school out blasting my Outkast
And I'll pass on running to catch a route pass
Gimme a pen and a pad I'm tryna outlast
All of my idols, American and the foreign-ers
Before the foreign cars & the boring bars
Money, money, money, sex, drugs and the coroners
All this killin' but where the bodies at
All this money where the Bugattis at
But dig a lil deeper
And you'll find another insecure man sittin' in a 2 seater
The same little boy that got beat up
Plenty pains in his past you could bring up
Nobody ever told him he could be more than he is
But inside he's a leader
I didn't know who was inside me either
Striving to be a captain
Hopin' I could date a cheerleader
Tryna get me a throne of my own so I could put my feet up
Thank God my kingdom was overthrown by the soul redeemer

Yeah, anomaly
Deviation from the common rule
Something or somebody that’s abnormal
That doesn’t fit in
I say that’s exactly what we are
We are the odd, the outcasts, the peculiar, the strangers
And they say we don’t fit in
But I say we are exactly who God created us to be

Now matter how you put it, boy, that’s still a 300
Stop that fakin’ and the flatchin’ dawg cut it off
Frontin’ like your paper longer than the Power Ball

Keep on fakin’ ‘til you face down in a Jacuzzi
With some killas in you room with some real guns
That don’t make noise when they blast it but they real guns

Pullin' me down...

I pen songs for the perishin’ and parishioners
Them hearers and them listeners, the home and the visitors
This is not a game, you can't tame or make it purty
They say the earth cursed, so our mouths stay dirty
There’s mud on the track, a slug in ya’ back
Police done pulled you over wit’ a gun in ya’ lap
And you ain't got the power to make it through this parade
The workers can't keep the profit - everything here is vain
My job is oppressive, I strive for my blessings
The pastor so corrupt it's hard to ride with his message
Riches destroy the owners, the government think they own us
My onus is to keep the police from ridin’ all up on us
Leavin’ money to kids who spend it on getting’ blitz
Say, what's the point of livin’ to give it up in the end
Then again, all my sin has been pinned to the cross
I know I'm free forever from this land of the lost

I’m just falling
So close to touching the sky
But gravity keeps pulling me back down
But I can’t stay here forever
I want to go, ooh one day!
I want to go
Somewhere where there’s no gravity
Where there’s no gravity

I said, “If that's the case then why should I believe you?”
Murder, money, and mayhem, every place that I lay in
My problems follow suit, I'm tailor-made for this, ain't I?
It’s deep. You wanna go deep? I’ll take you deep
Reality is really just cheap
Yo’ eyes wide open apparently, but you sleep
And everything you have in your hands you’ll never keep
So why hold on, I flow on to go on, before long I float on
Eternal life is what I'm thinkin’ I'mma bank my hope on
Believe me, easy is irrelevant
The devil want us burning for the hell of it
Elephants in the room say we can't talk about impending doom
Or we gospel rappin’ or preaching people out of they shoes
It’s cool, I'll be that dude
We glued to our depravity
Until somebody free us from this gravity, fly!
I want to go, one day
I want to go, somewhere where there's no gravity

Devil in Disguise,Church Clothes 2,2013.0,"Where am I going? What I'm living for?
I rolled the dice on life so tell me what they getting for it
I'm three shots in, probably depressed
But crying about my problems ain't gonna get me out this mess
Ride around playing Scarface, I'm a hard case
I want to die, but I'm scared of looking in God's face
Popping pills and powder, trying to kill some hours
Cause when I'm sober, man I promise I can feel the power
Of death eating me slowly I'm on my way
Heaven or Hell? Well that's only for God to say
I lost some people but I never like to talk about it (nah)
Hard time, we go through 'em we don't walk around 'em
I'm too mature to go listen to Black Hippy
Get trippy, smoke on the sticky, and find a Britney that's pretty, naw
I know that only pacifies my problem
There's something deep inside me and I can't seem to resolve it
My worst days, man I just want to revolver
My best days I'm blinded by all this fog, huh
I'm in the ride looking mean, money in the jeans
Ladies all cling to the fabric like static
But in the end, you know it's all a bad habit
Strangers on my Craftmatic, man we all some addicts
Purpose junkies trying to find who we really are
Hypnotized by the rims on a pretty car

Why?
Lord I know the truth, but I'm good in my lies
If loving this is wrong I don't want to be right
It keeps pulling me down, so I look to the clouds
There is the devil, the devil in disguise

They brag about a million dollars like that's supposed to make us whole
I know better, I seen Jay chase a hundred more
If he ain't satisfied with it, what's the point in running?
Just sit here with a blunt and watch these rappers try to stunt
And break necks for paychecks, if I ain't broke
I'm still broken; tie a noose into this tightrope
Then I walk and feel the hellfire on my heels
But I ain't hurt enough to heal, I don't want to kneel
If God's real, I believe he became a man
Otherwise, ain't no other way to understand
What it's like to be me
What it's like to be an outcast tempted by all the devil's diseases
So if it pleases Him to rescue a fool
I'll be drowning in a pool of liquor to keep cool
Smoking a Kool, like the old heads do
Call me Nat King Cole, like I'm gonna spread blue
Pain a pest, I been trying to smoke it out
But it never seems to die when I choke it out
I try to drink it away but my stomach swell
And what I'm drinking on earth, I'll probably throw up in Hell, well
Jesus they say You'll take away my cancer
Accept the mess of a man that I am and give me answers (please)
They say You died for the selfishness that I'm pursuing
Before I head to my ruin, turn my eyes to you
Six shots in and half past sober
I pray when I wake up the darkness will be over
God, I'm six shots in, half past sober
Pray when I wake up the darkness will be over

Why?
Lord I know the truth, but I'm good in my lies

Head first into the moshpit
And when that Marvin come on I don't have to be cautious
You messin' up that good music when you add the Consequence
Tryin' find forever minus God use your Common Sense
We set fire to your box, keep your four squares
I hear you hating from the crowd screaming, ""4 Squares!""
Yeah we Christian that's neither here nor there
The track still getting chewed up
, 
homie four pairs

We say they missing out and that don’t make no sense, eh?
YOLO’s a no show for repeat, we syndicate
Following their passions while we following the Master
So we sorta kinda imitate following what Sensei
Synonym, sin in ‘em
And its the sin in us if we keep it Benjamin
But the difference is that this life didn't pleasure us
Tried to let it rule us but that ruler didn’t measure up
So they question us living as king
“How He change your name to peace?”, you ain't get the metaphor
Let me write it down life’s more than spinning wheels
Christ bought the foul, you can pick that letter up

We’re flawless and we think we’re better
Its official got it all together
We don’t want em getting the wrong impressions
Cause that ain't real thats a misconception
Been a struggle only Jesus kept us
And we still fall, so its hard to get up
We don’t want em getting the wrong impressions
Cause this is real ain't no misconception

Got a girl on my arm but thats my wife though
And I don’t need a side piece, I don’t like those
Lil' mama working that body why she’s eyes closed
Say his pockets way too fat they need lipo
Twenty racks make it rain sparkles on them bottles
Lift em up, shorty bad, she look like a model
Rollin up, smoking loud, this is what we follow
Past that, looking back things are kind of hollow
I never be slaved to them O's and commas
Or that Gucci, Polo, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga
And miss me all together you talkin' squeezing that llama
We Live As Kings only mean we living to please the Father

Don’t approach me, better unproach me
My words were so killer even the gun quotes me, steel
Battle rappers murder, they probably quote me still
So sorry that I hurt em, and yo I hope they heal
Had to peel appeal 'em was the mirage
But homie that wasn’t real they still live in they garage
They got trend setters and hell raisers
We stay in our own lane we trailblazers
We all trail, we all failing constantly
Easy, thats a tall tale, apostrophe
But we playing to lose all, a new sport
So tell 'em we bruise hard

We’re flawless and we think we’re better

Cause that ain't real thats a misconception
Been a struggle only Jesus kept us
And we still fall, so its hard to get up

Cause this is real ain't no misconception

They throw stones, I just pick em up and build (somethin’)
I write in braille so these listeners can feel (somethin’)
I guess they figured if they kill us then we’ll cease
They forgot this problem started when they crucified our leader (frontin’)
And who is we? We just some raggedy believers
Some hip-hop hybrids who married Mother Teresa (huh?)
So they think but they don’t get to know me
They throw me out their circles for being a square (lonely)
Homie out the abundance of my heart, you hear my art speak
And I don’t fit in your genre, don’t try to box me
But punch me in, I’m tryna give this beat a beating
Pleading with your eardrums until they bleed the blood of Jesus (Jesus)
But wait I know you think this here is gospel rapping
Its more like bringing balance, these rap scales full of crack and
The streets told me real killers move in silence
Then how come all these rappers out here talking violent (shhh)
But lets take all your preconceptions or your misconceptions
That I’m something other than you with a different direction
I’m south side Chicago, I’m southwest Atlanta
I’m Compton with manners, I’m good truth and bad grammar

We’re flawless and we think we’re better
Its official got it all together
We don’t want em getting the wrong impressions

Misconception
I-I-I'll leave your brain stimulated

Slang came from a land where they suffer from the effects of depravity
Like gang-banging and earthquakes
Most famous no-namers split a brain and plant a taste for the King of Kings
I know it's a strange concept
Peddling redemption, boy, what more can I say?
Make me and Lecrae been trying to make Him famous since nine-tre
Filling these 58′s with phrases that would deem us
Unfit to succeed among these heathens
It's so crucial, in the belly of the crucible
That you would understand that stage like your morning candle
It's handing out cancer
That's why fame was never the aim
And the back is the front
Homie, left side up, that's a concept

I-I-I'll leave your brain stimulated...

So many misconceptions
Missing the mark, misdirected
Driving reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions
Our methods need corrections
Spitting venom in their face
And violate the ones we should protect as an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations, place the blame on someone else
Point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused view leadership as illegitimate
So they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules, or submit
They see authority as nothing more than a power trip
And they don't want to be plugged in to it
They'd rather see that power stripped, get it? Power strip
It's unfortunate, disproportionate
The door is wide open for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow,
 
left to our demise
Acting foolish, but can't see it, so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ is a beautiful depiction
Of service and submission within a leadership position

I-I-I'll leave your brain stimulated...

You probably have it all figured out, right?
Like, you're the type that believes that, if you act right
Then, that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person
You followed the good book as much as you could
You probably didn't go to church as much as you should
But it's all good
I mean, you never really killed anybody
Never really steal from anybody
You never lusted much, or did much, touching of any... bodies
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect your neighbor
You try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions
 
and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval
Of the removal of sinful discretions, your righteous acts in removing God's wrath is, in fact, the biggest misconception

Misconception

It's what your frame of mind has chosen
I-I-I'll leave your brain stimulated...

Since my conception, I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection
And the greatest misconception
The world believes the Christian is foolish without direction
And they knock it to knock it
But what does it profit, a prophet to be socially ostracized?
And no, we ain’t stopping the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock in the market
For a Biblical worldview, then there's no longer an option
Here with the Humble Beast, ain't no subtleties, ain't no tongue-in-cheek, this is what I mean
They don't understand anything about the faith I believe, and they want to belittle me
But it's cool though, they just want the pseudo
The fake faith, the false one
The western God that's man made and not the Biblical Awesome
Toss 'em, pick up the 
Reasons for God
 by Timothy Keller and read it
There is a God you should believe in, and his name is Jesus

Grip the grain, I’m swangin'
It’s Texas all on my roots boy
Ain’t no point in me changing
On 45, trunk bangin'
From fair park to south acres
I hit big T’s then I hit kings
In the same day no playin
I’m whippin, I’m dippin though the great state of Texas
I used to rock the gold, tall t's with a necklace
My car wasn’t mean but I kept that thing clean
Paint chip, couple dents
And the brakes used to scream
Oh well, I still gotta let that trunk knock
Hear me beatin down yo block
And my car just stopped again
Mayne, my gas gauge don’t work
I can’t tell how much gas I got man

Let it whip
I let it whip
I said I let it whip
Hold up
Let it whip
Paul Wall, baby
All ready

I pull up, trunk bumpin' like a bad shave
Speakers blastin' extra loud with the trunk raised
Four tires lookin fresher than a pair of J’s
Seven cars right behind me in this SLAB Parade
I’m a pro, I work the wood like a carpenter
Everybody tippin down, no bartender
Candy paint, make em take my picture, offered them
Money on my phone like a telemarketer
I weave the 'Lac through traffic like Malaysian hair

Your ride might be old

Mane you ain’t gotta be stuntin
Got a good job, a little money
Aye you don’t need no car note
You debt free and they frontin'
They strugglin'
You grateful you ain’t sittin on the bus, and
Got 4 wheels, I got a little bills and that’s so real, it’s 100
That’s factory, gon play that
That’s Japanese, well gon say that
Your leather cracked, and yo roof scratched
Well I’m cool with that so gon lay back
Don’t need a Benz and no Maybach

I know a lot of guys out there are tryna steal your heart

Shinin' armor, don’t harm her, arm her with all your honor

Any boy can go find a girl and try to satisfy her for a whole night
But a real man can take one woman and satisfy her for a whole life
Flex talk, sex talk
It seems that’s all they talk about
But real love is them sacrifices that you make for me when I’m out of town
They don’t know why you hold me down

Been here, been real, been trill
Never sold me out
Some stay in love and some fight together
Some breakin' up and some runnin' out

Hands Up,Church Clothes 2,2013.0,"They say the places we venture a Christian shouldn’t dare
Homie, that ain’t holiness, it’s fear, you scared
Homie, I swear, I won’t sin by osmosis
Nope, I got a blood bought prognosis
From the age when shoulder blades held ghetto blaster
No such thing as Christian rap, but rappers who believe
Stand your ground, pound the mic consistent with the truth you speak
You could watch the gospel stand on its own two feet
Really ain’t that unique, y’all just never seen it
Unlike the elephants we won’t let you ignore
Like arenas full of white kids all singing along
Make convos in the green room filled with awkward pauses
Don’t think I don’t know em, when they don't trust and it’s all love
We just came to provide y’all the soundtrack of life
Like around here a life’s like sounds from the mic, right
Every creed and color with their 116 tats
More humble rapper-tees all with their hands up
Understand before Grammys and stellas it was bars from the cellar
That soar higher than cellular
Less net worth, can’t tell you my net worth
I ain’t got a clue, low dough was never fuel to choose the type of tool we using
Just who and when, we could better prepare you to make amends with the Savior
Destroy your turntables, say

And you ain’t got to understand, just hands up
And if you from the West that’s W’s up, it’s all love
You and I know we both can’t afford to ignore, hands up
East to the west, y’all, hands up
L.A. to the Bay, y’all, hands up
Hands up, everybody everybody, just hands up
Hands up

Shout out to my man, Propaganda, from the mighty mighty Humble Beast
My name is Lecrae, I represent Reach, 116, unashamed believers

Ayo, dial the seven digits, call a chemist
I compound underground sounds with pronouns so pronounce
Our name right, rappers who take a stand, B-Boy
Pop the lock on minds of these slaves until they free, boy
Mischievous soul who don’t get it, so we spit it
Where the smoke is blowing loud and the crowds are looking frigid
It’s cold on the road, so the bars got to be hot
Christians want the message, but the world want to be shot
So I give ‘em both until they choke but truthfully
If one side say you dope, the other think that you a joke
Let me clear my throat as I provoke you with these quotes
I got a Grammy in the closet, but I trade it for the hope of the people
‘Cause these days evil
If you ain’t seen Jesus, you don’t want to see the sequel
People holla 116, ‘cause they know we represent
Something bigger than the dollars and the cents
Still it don’t make sense that I rock with killers in dark tents
Drinking liquor ‘til they thinking of speaking in past tense
And it’s past tense with pastors and past friends
Who don’t understand the mission in some of my actions
Get your hands up

And you ain’t got to understand, just hands up

Power Trip,Gravity,2012.0,"Who’s got the power?
(Derek Minor inhales)

The key to life: money, power, respect
Louie this, Gucci that, two private jets
Big money, big business, watch that paper stack
Treat life like a game, it ain't pool but I'm racked
Up, big bucks, no whammies
I swear I prolly lump somebody head for a Grammy
My heart black as the Lambo Kim bought for Kanye
And I ain't frontin', I'm just telling y'all what God say
Blood thirsty
Seek my own will since the day that Adam cursed me
The lust for power go to ya’ brain if you let it
You say, “What up, dog?” I hear “God.” I'm so dyslexic
Sit on the throne, it's really a toilet, heart is septic
I have no power, I get handed death, I must accept it
It's hard to see the light when you never listen
Our whole life’s blacked out, the power's trippin'

Who’s got the power?
(Do you really want it all, whole world in ya’ palm, tell me...)
Who’s got the power?
(It’ll make you a leader or a tyrant, you do the decidin’)
Who’s got the power?
(Do you really want it all, whole world in ya’ palm, tell me...)
Who’s got the power?
(It’ll make you a leader or a tyrant, you do the decidin’)

It was all a dream
I grew up readin’ hip-hop magazines
Double-XL got me wantin' to excel
They tellin’ me it ain’t hard to tell, I rock well
And now with every sale I'm feelin’ my head swell
Well, I'm a genius in my dreams
Even if I was, it was stitched inside my genes
 (get it)
I’m self-inflated, self-infatuated
And somehow I convinced myself I finally made it
The truth is I was made like the mob
Geppetto put me together; my strings lead to God
Pride come befo’ the fall, I seen it in the script (seen it)
So if you see me fallin’, prolly a power trip

Who’s got the power?
(Do you really want it all, whole world in ya’ palm, tell me...)
Who’s got the power?
(It’ll make you a leader or a tyrant, you do the decidin’)
Who’s got the power?
(Do you really want it all, whole world in ya’ palm, tell me...)
Who’s got the power?
(It’ll make you a leader or a tyrant, you do the decidin’)

Welcome to the culture where humility is not allowed
They do it big, if you don’t see that, you Shallow Hal
Tryna show them how love and power, it goes together
If they call us losers, that just means we last forever
I been connected to the power, I don’t have to chase it
I roll with the Trinity, this is sorta the Matrix
A hard pill to swallow:
 
we’re evil to the core
Wicked power exploits the poor, and it brings war
Power can be a field of dreams loaded with land mines
We know the ruler so you can’t say these are bad lines
(You might lust for that power!), but don’t forget that we’re forgiven
I know the Lord gon’ catch me when I’m power trippin’

Who made the crowd put they hands in the sky? Me
Who made the sky with they hands?
 What if y'all can't see?
This is kinda strange, God makes the weather change
And we braggin’ up on our change like ""look how we make it rain!""
We Invictus,
 this sin sickness is in us
Running a muck and 'causin' that mischief, tell me this then, “Who could really fix us?”
I'm, trippin’ to think that I'm really not limited in this position I'm sitting in
Gravity pulling me back to earth gradually, reality's hittin’

Under the sun I'm found, we were left to drown
Evil abounds, weight is pullin’ us down
No sight or sound, impaired to His care
Chasing after the wind, running after the air
Deserving of desertion, servants of destruction
And everyday we taste of a grace that we’re unconcerned with
My sin I should be burned with, I'm guilty, filthy, and stained
But He became a curse, drank my cup and took my pain
Yeh, for that He reigns, through faith I'm changed
And I don't have a reason why He loosened up my chains
I don't believe in luck; I believe in grace
But they say we’re lucky cause we seen His face
And we heard Him call us, and He heard our answer
And He gives us second chances when we throw our hands up
So weary and broken, hopin’ His arms will be open

Fortunate to trust in you cause I've doubted your plans
I’ve questioned your ways, every question I raised
Is foolishness compared to mountains, the wind, and the waves
You’re so mindful of us, we rise from the dust
You love these cheating, beating hearts and these eyes full of lust
Gave us power to fight it, though we cower in quiet
We have the faith to start a riot; how can we deny it?
Fire inside us that you kindle when it starts to dwindle
And simply put I’m sinful so your love is essential
I don't believe in luck, no, I believe in Grace
But they say we lucky cause we seen your face
Lord, we heard you call us, You heard our answer
And you give us second chances when we throw our hands up
I’m weary and broken, but your arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into your focus

See, I’m not sayin’ I’m always right

Was It Worth It,Church Clothes 2,2013.0,"On birthdays and Christmas I used to have you on my wishlist
Held my son the first time, looked him in his eye
And thought to myself, what kind of fool would ever miss this
I ain't ask for you to sleep with mom and make me
Plus I'm your blood, why would you leave, what was so important
They told you smash broads, roll up the weed
I guess that buzz got you high enough to float over me
I hope that every dollar that you made, every girl that you slave
When you close your eyes at night, I hope you say it's all worth it
Every graduation, birthday, game that you missed
I hope what you got instead make you feel it's all worth it
Being a father's expensive and its cost you may ignore
Just know me and your grandson is paying for it
Can't ask myself what would dad do in hard times
'Cus that means he'll be writing one of these rhymes

All these hearts that you broke, all these lies that you told
All this pain that you own, years all alone
Nights away from home, tell me
I hope it was worth it, was it worth it
Tell me was worth it, tell me was it really worth it

Listen, a lot of rap dudes never had a daddy
That's why we want approval from Nas like he family
But, it ain't just Jermaine, it's Dre to The Game
To the Birdman saying that he's the father of Wayne, man
What happened to us better yet what didn't happen
No happy family 'cus daddy left me
Deep in this Valley, of the Shadow of Death
I'm felling the breath of a preditor on my neck
Ate me alive while daddy was getting high
Trying to chase after something that I'm certain he'll never find
When the whole time, he could have had my young mind
Somewhere along the line I guess he spent up all his time
Sent me this birthday card out of the blind, when I was nine
Inherited a bunch of pain and some empty memories
Wishing that he picked me up from elementary
I wish he could have seen me on my graduation
Taught me to raise the son, and told me congratulations

All these hearts that you broke, all these lies that you told
All this pain that you own, years all alone
Nights away from home, tell me
I hope it was worth it, was it worth it
Tell me was worth it, tell me was it really worth it",https://genius.com/Lecrae-was-it-worth-it-lyrics

Throw my real shades on, not my knock-offs
On the street like fifteen minutes and the lights stay green

Slow down, speed got limits

Sunset, the scenery
Told my lady, ""Lean on me""

Father, I'm prayin' for a friend, he and I are pretty close
And out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most
He say he readin' daily, but he ain't really learnin'
He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon
His faith's weak, he ain't prayed in a week
He wake up and just weep with his face in the sink, Lord
You gotta help my man, I'm prayin' for him daily
He ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin' crazy
He say he feelin' trapped, can't even hit up the mall
'Cause every lady's half-dressed temptin' him to lust and fall
He keep the TV off
Videos just make him feel like he ain't really nothin' without money, girls, and shiny wheels
The other day he told me that he felt less a man 'cause he ain't have a 5-year plan
Or a piece of land
And, man, it's crazy 'cause his family thinks so much of him
Plus he got a godly wife who always show her love for him
But he's strugglin', even though he talk to me
I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta be
I'm scared for him 'cause there's people that look up to him
He got some younger siblings who've been changed by what he's done for them

But is it done for him?
Lord, don't let it be
If he don't wanna talk to You then, Father, hear from me
Is it done for him?
Lord, don't let it be
If he don't wanna talk to You then, Father, hear from me

Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, uh, yeah
I'm prayin' for you
Uh, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you

God, his condition has worsened since we was last conversin'
I'm with him now, he ain't doin' well, of this I'm certain
He say he tryna trust You, doesn't wanna disgust You
But he was in the midst of sinners and did not discuss You
And just today his anxiety's got the best of him
He knows Christ, but for hours refused to rest in Him
He's not the best of men, but Lord, I know he really loves You
And I can't understand why lately he's not thinkin' of You
People trust this dude, you could crush this dude
Father he needs more of You, I pray You touch this dude
What can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him
Father empty and break him, I pray You'll just have Your way with him
'Cause there's a change in him, and the effects are strong
I pray You'll open up his heart before the next song
And when he gets home
I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love letter You wrote and soak it up
'Cause he ain't hearin' You, and he ain't feelin' me
And God I know it's killin' You, because it's killin' me
And matter of fact there's something else he's concealin', see
The person that I've been prayin' about is really me

Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, uh, yeah
I'm prayin' for you
Uh, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you",https://genius.com/Lecrae-prayin-for-you-lyrics
Truth,Rebel,2008,"Bring it drums (Yah)
This song right here
Is for everybody out there looking for truth
Who says, you know
We all in the same boat
Yeah, Christians and Muslims, everybody like that, huh
Yow, you lookin' for truth
Oh, I've got some answers man
So good to be
Ah, let's get into it

Let's go
Night and day, I ain't scared to say that we different
They play the prostitute, but they like to say they just intimate
Idols in their heart, they can't seem to lose their grip on it
See them walkin' in the direction, that King Agrippa went
Our world is different like Whitley and Wayne man
They say we look the same but we ain't chasin' the same thing
It all boils down to they think everything's relative
Jesus might as well be a South American president
Very evident, they say that Jesus was heaven sent
They lifestyle reflects they worship themselves instead of Him
They don't acknowledge the Christ, if they did
They wouldn't worship themselves by the way that they live
All these rappers say they got guns that spray off 16
I've got a Luke 9 that can take all 16
That's the Bible the one they quote
But they don't care about the author they think He's a joke
.

Man, some folks say, ""All truth is relative, it just depends on what you believe.""
You know, ""Hey man, ain't no way to know for sure who God is or what's really true.""
But that means you believe your own statement; that there's no way to know what's really true
You're saying that that statement is true
You're killing yourself. If what's true for you is true for you and what's true for me is true for me, what if my truth says yours is a lie?
Is it still true? Come on man!

I promise everybody is asking the same questions
""Who am I? What is my purpose and my direction?""
You probably believe that you exist for no other reason
Than self-satisfaction, hedonism and pleasing things
Life's about you gettin' yours and bein' happy
Even if it means a divorce and switchin' families?
Your job, your house, your car, your spouse
It's all for the glory of you, else you out
You go to school get your degrees and get a job
So you can make a whole lot of Gs cause life's hard
You never thought of livin to please a real God
And that's the reason he made you
See, he gave you breath to breathe, the chest to breathe it
So you can taste and see He's the best, believe it
He made us for His glory and not for your own homie
Our God is Holy. 
You should repent and die slowly

See, there's this thing called secular humanism that says man is the source of all meaning and all purpose
You know what I'm saying? We're just the result of a big cosmic explosion
We don't really have a purpose or meaning, so we just come up with our own purpose
We're the source of our meaning and our purpose
But how can a man, which is the product of chance, a finite being be the source of purpose and meaning? You can't!
We're created with purpose man! Get with The Creator y'all!

Man, everybody got a problem with God
And when you mention the Christ, then they really get to turning the knobs
But some say they roll with Christ, cause some rappers made it seem like He was cool with all the sin in their life
No!
But then some say ""How can God exist when
All this evil stuff in the world keep persistin'?
Wrong question, ask again
""How come God ain't let you feel the wrath from sin?""
What you thought last night deserved a first class flight
To Hell
 where God doesn't dwell. You got that right
But He bought back life, on a cross that night
Christ died, 
you ain't know that it cost that price
?
All of God's anger poured on His son
Then together, through all of eternity. Now He was shunned
Praise God for the life that was won for us
Ain't got a beef with God because the Son was crushed

Hey look man, some people say that God ain't real cause they don't see how a good God can exist with all this evil in the world
If God is real then He should stop all this evil, cause He's all-powerful right?
What is evil though man? It's anything that's against God. It's anything morally bad or wrong
It's murder, rape, stealing, lying, cheating
But if we want God to stop evil, do we want Him to stop it all or just a little bit of it?
If He stops us from doing evil things, what about lying, or what about our evil thoughts?
I mean, where do you stop, the murder level, the lying level, or the thinking level?
If we want Him to stop evil, we gotta be consistent, we can't just pick and choose
That means you and I would be eliminated right? Because we think evil stuff
If that's true, we should be eliminated!
But thanks be to God that Jesus stepped in to save us from our sin!
Christ died for all evilness! Repent, turn to Jesus man!",https://genius.com/Lecrae-truth-lyrics
My Whole Life Changed,Church Clothes 2,2013.0,"Let's just say I saw the light
Let's just say I heard the truth
Let's just say I ain't' the same no more
I'm out here looking new
Let's just say I left the game
Take my jersey, I retired
Let's just say I'm at the game
Put me in I'm on fire
Boy!
My whole life changed (that's when)
My whole life changed (that day)
My whole life changed (right there)
My whole life changed
My whole life changed (that's when)
My whole life changed (that day)
My whole life changed (right there)
My whole life changed

Alright now, stop!
Ya'll don't quite understand the story I got
I once popped a whole thing of pills in hopes that I drop
My cousin walked out a party, bow, got shot
Pow, pow, pow
Some girl lied and my partna is locked in that box
So, I'm not concerned about what they think about me
Think about it
That truth is tatted up on my heart and can't nobody get that ink up out it
I'm eatin out and they thinking now I'm gone' sell out
Maybe I feed em' now
And some folks looking like they ain't learned the foundation firm
I ain't seeking out
So, I don't need a co-sign to get this
All the things you done
I done did that
I could rap about money and cars and getting high
But, why? I let the rest of ya'll pen that
Insecurity brags and I've been that
V.I.P. with Lebron James, I'm in that
So, I don't need a hug from Hip-Hop
A right to go pop and hope that ya'll feel that
Nah
Imma talk about faith
Imma talk about Christ
Imma talk about life
Cuz' I want to
Change my life I ain't lost my sight
I been on the same things since '02
And that's real talk
That's plumbline
That's UNT
My soul's rocked
And my life changed
I'm free indeed


Alright, Chill
Apparently, you can't tell the fake from the real
And these rappers getting all sensitive in my ears
Insecure whining makes it harder to hear
But uhh, that ain't here nor there
I swear I respect the kind of reject that
Wanna rebel and just reflect on real things like feelings
But these feelings are kinda suspect
Look, I came from a past so shameful
Took advantage of the girls by the handful
Had no remorse recourse was a boy until I ran into the source of the voice
Telling me everything I was on was wrong
Yessir, I was on my throne
Now I hear the same thing, same thing
But I hear it in a song and they wanting me to sing along
Woah, that's trifling, for a grown man that's stifling
I was on the same path for the wrath
I just never got paid for the trash I was writing
But like lightning, that light came and struck me
My life changed, and  then suddenly
I met The Lord, and it wasn't even a Sunday
Maybe, one day, someday, you'll give ya' life up to Jesus
Instead of giving ya' life up to pieces
That's gon' rust and fade when you cease

Rebel Intro,Rebel,2008.0,"Yeah
Just wanna dive into the beat
Swim around in it
Let's rebel

Rebel, I'm in rebellion
Yeah, to all my Rebels out there
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
Rebelling against the culture, being transformed
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
Not conformed to the ways of this world, or this age
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
Welcome to the Rebelution

Jesus was a rebel (He was), a renegade outlaw
Sanctified trouble maker, but he never sinned, naw
And he lived his life by a different set of rules
The culture ain't approve so you know they had to bruise Him
That's the way they do, man they swear they so gangsta
Everyone the same, everybody do the same stuff
Tattoos, piercings, smoking up and drinking
Money and sex, plus them extravagant weekends
Man if that's the high life I'll puff puff pass that
You live evaporated like missing a gas cap
I guess I'm past that, I'm in rebellion
Rather have a dollar in my pocket than a million
I'm scared to worship money and my wants over Elyon
I remain a rebel while the rest of them just carry on
This is what I live for, its the hill I'm buried on
If Jesus is the truth that means one of us is very wrong
Think about it
[Chorus: Lecrae & 
Mark Driscoll
]
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
I know in our day ""rebel"" means sinner
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
But everyone is sinning, so it’s no longer rebellious to sin
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
Jesus was a rebel who was countercultural
Rebel, I'm in rebellion (Yeah)

No glory in me, all glory's to the King of the throne
You either love him or you leave him alone
But you can't do both
Yeah I know you heard that once in a song
I pray you hear it ten more 'fore you're gone
Hey listen up holmes, the stage is the corner the crowd is the streets
And I rap the bread of life because they dying to eat
Yeah I'm a rebel, you know the kind that die in the street
Cause you refuse to conform won't eat the king's meat
Christ rebelled by shunning the culture
He eating with the sinners, giving Pharisees ulcers
He never got married, he was broke plus homeless
And yeah that's the God I roll with
Your boy got a wife, and no I never cheated
I'm praying for humility whenever I get heated
Forget about the drugs, rebel against pornography
This ain't how it ought to be homie its how its gotta be
A rebel
[Chorus: Lecrae & 
Mark Driscoll
]
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
You’re just a conformist if you're drunk and naked and driving around on a loud motorcycle smoking cigarettes and breaking commandments
And getting pregnant out of wedlock
Everyone's done that, it's so tiring
If you really want to be a rebel, read your Bible
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
Because no one is doing that
That’s rebellion
That’s the only rebellion left",https://genius.com/Lecrae-rebel-intro-lyrics
Free From It All,Gravity,2012.0,"But should I fall
I’m still free from it all, it all, it all, it all, it all

Round of applause, I pause to take a photo op
None of it’s real, it's just photoshopped
Crop out my flaws then my failures, my aches and all my ailments
Now I'm picture perfect, take all my dirt and conceal it
Really, I no better than any
But they pay me a pretty penny to sit and look pretty
Not too big, not too skinny, be whatever these fans demand of me
‘Cause otherwise they probably wouldn't love me
The show goes on even after the curtains close
I smile and pose, put my signature on they clothes
They lift me up so high that I'm surely about to fall
The higher that I go the more unforgivin’ they are
No grace and no exceptions, all they want is perfection
The man in the mirror can't even see his reflection
You live for their acceptance, you die from their rejection
But even if I fall, I fell in the right direction

Cameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen
Critics laugh, they hate us all as they applaud
But should I fall
I’m still free from it all

Life is a cage, a prison of everyone's approval
Fight for acceptance and struggle so you don't ever lose it
But livin’ for their acceptance has got us stressing
Insecure people obsessed with leaving impressions
Ladies spending time on their faces painting pretty lines
To you and me its make-up, but to her, it’s a disguise
You look her in her eyes and see her soul cry
‘Cause living for other people’s got her living a lie
Hadn’t slept in day, close his eyes and he pray
Someone would miss him if he fell like a star out of space
But I'm sure they'll replace him, just a name and a face
They say they love you, but it's easy to fall from their graces
Live for everyone else gotcha losin’ yourself
Why be slave when made to be free from the guilt?
To be free from the shame, you are more than a name
If you go down you got the freedom to get up again

Cameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen
Critics laugh, they hate us all as they applaud
But should I fall
I’m still free from it all

Every moment is passing; just let ‘em go
In fifty years, man, who cares? We’ll be super old
Many winners will lose, many heroes will fall
And if that’s me I’m still (Free from it all)

Cameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen
Critics laugh, they hate us all as they applaud
But should I fall
I’m still free from it all
It all it all it all
It all it all it all",https://genius.com/Lecrae-free-from-it-all-lyrics

An Inmate
At County detention facility
If you would like to accept this call
Please press 4

Look I don’t know what Cornel West know
I’m tryin my best though
And I don’t know what all you went to
But look at everything we been through
Man, we got high together
Went to the mall, got fly together
Police came through tryna ask us questions
Me and you sat there and lied together
Tryna keep in touch, it got hard
Had a couple kids, and found God
Probably heard I went off to school
But never knew I was snortin that raw
Well I’m past that but not perfect
I know it feel like it ain’t worth it
But you love dog and that’s real talk
Don’t nobody wanna put you in the dirt man
I know it’s hard out here to get work
Got 2 strikes and feel worthless
But you was made for more than that drink and smoking
Tryna ask the streets for your purpose
You got your family here hurtin'
My partnas callin' me, worried
And me and yo daddy did the same thing
Both left us out here struggling
Heard they locked you up so I came through
Forget what you did and what you ain’t do
It’s times like this we pray through
Gotta run to the God that made you
Gotta hang on, hold strong
Trust in The Truth to bring you home
I ain’t tryna sit here and preach to you
I’m tryna be the one you can lean on
Hang on

Lecrae: Whassup with it kinfolk?
Friend: Tryin' to take it one day at a time
Lecrae: So, whassup with the case tho?
Friend: They tryin' to hit me with that mandatory minimum, man
Gotta fight that charge

Talk with the homie through a glass wall
Letters gettin' passed off
Told me he was about to head to trial
Pray to God he don’t get cast off
Head to the sky cuz I need some hope
Kinfolk just got caught with dope
Partner just called said his baby sick
And this might be the end of my rope
Man it’s hard out here and I’m hurtin
Don’t need no choir girl flirtin
Don’t need no pastor tryna touch on kids
Telling me what I can't wear to church and
No fake cryin, a preacher lyin
Sayin God don’t love me if I don’t tithe
I need real Him in a real season
I need real faith in a real Jesus
I’m hanging on by a thread though
Crazy thoughts in my head, bro
Told my grandma to pray for me
Before I end up dead or a dead broke
Only few of my friends know
What I got to pretend for
Free fallin, tryna hang on it
Anything I can get my hands on
Hang on

Grandma: Hello
Lecrae: Hey Grandma. It's me

Lecrae: Hey, I need you to pray for me. I'm just going through some things right now
Grandma: Well, what's going on?
Lecrae: Well, you know, just everything. Family, money, just life in general. It's crazy
Grandma: 
Well, let me tell you what the good Lord say, He said don't be anxious about yo' life. What you gon' eat or what you gon' drink or about yo' body
See, life is more than food, and the body is more than for clothing
Birds in the sky, they don't sow, they don't reap, but yo' heavenly Father feeds 'em. So, He say just seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to ya'.

Now check this out, man, listen. I know you’re known for just being honest and transparent and all that good stuff
But listen, we ain’t got no time for all that, man
That don’t make no money
We need you to tell lies, lies, and more lies, man
It’s all about selling out
Don’t give the people what they need, give ‘em what they want, baby
Lie to these folks, man!

I’m on now, I can’t even stand me
Look at me, Mama, I’m known now, I got me a Grammy
Call Kami, Khiana, and Tammy, and tell ‘em that I made it
Broke my heart in the seventh grade, so this is how I repay ‘em
They say that money can’t make you, they probably ain’t making money
It made me richer than you, and it made me look at you funny
You don’t really want it, you don’t want no problems, problems
Goons be like, “Whatever you need, dawg, call me.”
So I be like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, ""Solve it.""
Money on his head, I put that boy under the water
I can’t even rap like that, but insecurity would have me sounding whack like that
I already made it when I graduated from high school
Ain’t validated ‘cause I’m at the top of the iTunes
But I too was once a fool for nice shoes
Spiteful of dudes who do what I like to
But if I’m honest on the other side of fame, it’s the same stains in the latrine
You still can’t buy love, and ain’t no way to buy off pain
That’s why these rich folks blow out their brains
More insecure they are the more they brag, advertising their pain
I don’t want no parts of none of that thing
Oh wait, hold up, this where I’m supposed to do something
Lyrical miracle metaphor simile onomatopoeia on a period
You’s a peon, period, I dominate rap
I failed algebra, and I ain’t paid my property tax
Oh well, I got bars, family behind bars
Throw money at insecure women and fine cars
People stealing right under my nose and my taxes whack
But no need to worry, my accountant handles that, right
I mean what you expect? I do anything to gain your respect, sell out

What you doing, man?
You know you started off good then you started telling the truth
We ain’t got no time for that
This is Lie-A-Lot records
We need you to tell more lies
Hello?
Hello?
Hey where you going, man?

Take Me As I Am,Real Talk,2004.0,"Grace through faith
I talked to a cat the other day
And he was like, man I really wanna come to Christ but I gotta clean my life up first, get my sins together
I told him, I used to think that way too
I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ, but Christ changed me, let me tell you my story, it starts like this

It's 5:46 in the morning
Tossing and turning
Chest burning
Sermons in my head keep reocurring
Having visions in my head of a kid
Crying at the feet of the Father
For all the wrong things that he did
Now I'm sweating in my sheets can't sleep
My mind keeps telling me I'm 6-feet deep (don't remind me)
Even though I'm still alive I can't tell
The way I'm living my life I feel I'm going to hell
God they telling me I should accept You
That You had to leave the world cause the world left You
Reason I can't change, like a mystery to me
So I make believe there really is a heaven for a G
Even though they say You loved the world so much
You shed Your blood
God, I feel I'm too messed up for love
They tell me come as I am, but I smell like smoke
My whole life's full of sin, cause it's all I know
The Bible told me that You died for my sins
If I believe in Christ to save me from the end
But I'm scared to ask You, to save me, my heart so evil
I got thoughts that's full of hatred, hurting people
I thought that first I had to clean up my life
Now I'm hearing, I just need to cling to the light
I'm ready to do it, but Lord I pray you understand
My life is a mess, will you take me as I am?

Will You take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own
Tryna make it alone
I wonder
How could You love me when my life's so ugly
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own
Tryna make it alone
I wonder
How could You love me when my life's so ugly
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am

I'm sick of tryna be the man that my daddy never taught me to be
I'm grown up now, life ain't what I thought it would be
I made, many mistakes in my past I can't fix
Now I'm staring at this crucifix, tatted on my wrist
Is it true what they telling me, am I just crazy?
Did You bleed on the cross for my sins to save me?
But why would You die for me?
My whole life I've been working for Satan while he fed lies to me
And now I'm hearing too much, tryna get a true touch
Of a love that can change me, I'm all screwed up
Figure hell is what I deserve
But Your Word says we all fall short
So I guess we all ought to burn
Teach me I wanna learn
How You could save a wretch like me
Before death says it's my turn
I think I finally understand
No matter my past
You'll still take me as I am
Will You take me as I am?

Will You take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own
Tryna make it alone
I wonder
How could You love me when my life's so ugly
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own
Tryna make it alone
I wonder
How could You love me when my life's so ugly
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am

If I was dying and had a few last words to give
I'd be telling people the reason to live
The reason to die
United with the King in the sky
This life is passing us by, I got no reason to lie
You'll never give the world enough, they'll hunger for more
They're fickle, their ways are nothin' to the wondrous Lord
More security than the man that left you
More love than the moms who kept you
He'll always accept you
Be everything you're supposed to
Let Christ rule your heart, mind, body and soul
Cause He chose you
And if the world don't know you
It don't matter, you're Gods child, and He'll never disown you
Your purpose, on Earth is, far from worthless
That's why you glorify like your life's been purchased
And it don't matter if the world don't see us
We still mean the world to Jesus
He took us as we were

Will You take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own
Tryna make it alone
I wonder
How could You love me when my life's so ugly
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own
Tryna make it alone
I wonder
How could You love me when my life's so ugly
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am

We're saved by grace through faith, it's not works, ain't nothing you can do, ain't nothing I can do that could get us this great salvation that we got man, it's only Christ, so if you feel like you gotta clean yourself up before you can come to Him, forget it, just come to Him, He'll take you as you are, and He'll change you, from the inside, out",https://genius.com/Lecrae-take-me-as-i-am-lyrics

Sacrifice,Church Clothes,2012.0,"Tomorrow, only tomorrow
Sadio ambe tomorrow

My eyes redder than blood shots
Nightmares of them gunshots
I took my girl from the lone star
To Memphis 10 on them cold blocks
And what you think we moved for
To see kids get killed in the school zone?
To see crack get sold, bodies turned cold
What you think, I think that's cool, bro?
And why do you think I went to school for?
To turn around and move back to the hood?
Nah, boy, that's what it's called a sacrifice
This is bigger than me, it's for a greater good
I went to cape town, had a breakdown
Mozambique seen a man face down
Took blows to the head, boy it's cold out here
So we're staying on the grind, no brakes, nah nah
If this a gimmick then explain what's the incentive
Been extorted, near deported for this faith I'm representing
And when I started penning lyrics
I wasn't thinking bout no cypher
I was thinking about them addicts
And them juvies and them lifers
Well this is what the people lose they life for
And what they give up all they rights for
It ain't no church in the wild, huh?
But tell me, who you think I write for?
And I ain't tryin' to be self righteous
But I write just so you'll think twice
Folks wanna call this gospel rap
Nah, homeboy, this is sacrifice

Tomorrow, only tomorrow
Sadio ambe tomorrow

Some of these rapper's reputations should be in dispute
Cause real recognize real
And you do not compute
Real is laying your life down
Sacrifice for a worthy cause
Not for a bunch of green paper stacks
Overpriced clothes and shiny cars, no
This is sacrifice, it's giving your own
Even when they don't understand you
You still answer your calling
And when the world is falling and they back is turned
You reach your hand out and pull them out that fiery furnace
I learned that from the old heads
You know the ones that never turned back
Martin Luther King got shot for it
That's priceless you can't earn that
Then tell me what do you think he died for?
A peace prize? A holiday?
So I can rap a whole bunch of weak lines
About how I'm a make my choppers spray?
If Jesus really lived, then He really died
Sacrificed Himself and rose before they very eyes
And if I ain't really changed
Then it's all a lie
Why put my life on the line
Mayne this ain't worth my time
Cause it's been real
When nobody knew us we been here
Before the billboards and the Grammy awards
It was Christ homeboy we been clear
I ain't never been fake
Got faith, if I lied to yo face
May I die a disgrace
Live for the truth that He died in my place
Thank God for the sacrifice and His grace

Tomorrow, only tomorrow

5 Fingers of Death Freestyle,UnKnown,2014.0,"Hey look, Cole talk that college talk
Wayne talk gangs
Jay be talking money man and Ye' talk fame
And people say I talk about the same ole thang
The reason why I sound the same is cause the truth don't change
Look, people get it twisted like a lemon in a spirit
If I ain't talking killing I must be talking bout healing
Nah, I ain't talking 'bout how Jesus gonna make me a million
With my hands to the ceiling I got that spiritual feeling
My head bowed down, my knees to the floor
Oh you a Christian and you rap
That must be the way you flow, no
I talk reality like mama on her death bed
The birth of a child, a soldier losing his left leg
Who gon' write songs to give him hope in they chair
Addicted to pain killers, wife left last year
Your favorite rapper was probably tryin' to make his next hit
Talking look at what I did, who I shot and who I tipped
Couldn't be more common if them boys made sense
Couldn't be more common if Serena was they chick
Ay, that's not a diss that's how reality sound
Let it off my mind, this how my mentality sound
We going, down south it sound like New Orleans
But this is kind of Floridian so let me get the scene
Uh, let me spit it
Hold on, that's off the dome
Get the microphone, yea you know it's on

I never fit in, I been a outcast
In grade school I was blasting my Outkast
And I'll pass on running to catch a route pass
Gimme a pen and a pad and I'm tryna outlast
All of my idols
American and the foreigners
Before I heard all of these boring bars
Money, money, money, sex, drugs and the foreigners
The coroners all these talkin' 'bout the coroners
All this killin' but where the bodies at?
Aye, all this money where the Bugattis at?
You dig a lil' deeper
You gon' see another insecure man sittin' in a two seater
The same little boy that used to get beat up
With plenty pains in his past you could bring up
But listen I ain't tyna string up
I'm freestylin' off the dome you know I had to get up

Y'all get to steppin' I get to startin'
You dream of being a king but you watchin' the wrong Martin bruh man
This ain't the fifth floor, it's the penthouse
So get it together or just get out
I know you rarely get out of the basement
This dark full of hatred your heart harder than pavement
But I came for something amazing
It's that grace that I lay in and I stay in
Uh, I gotta little mo' though
I got a little more flow though
Hold on let me get it together
Yea, oh the beat 'bout to change up

Yo, waiting for some good news
Funny, cause I already got the greatest
Can't nobody say they made us
The aim was not to be famous
Don't pay us no nevermind if we don't let the money change us
This what God told me
'Crae don't switch the style up
If they hate then let 'em hate
That's how they did my child, ooh kill 'em!
My team watchin' I'm runnin' the ball go get 'em
You silly you pleading that silly cars, you silly
You really should pay attention
You missing the mission
You too caught up in these titles and if I'm rapping religion
I'm just rapping my gift
I give to you if you want it
Aye, I ain't see you at my concert, guess you ain't on it
Guess you missing the moment, missing the point
Let me chill out
Y'all understand the words that are comin' out my midouth?
Cause ever since I been out, these people told me get out
You backwoods Holy Ghost hollering faith mental
You Holy Ghost right-wing judgmental, you get out
Huh, it's funny cause everyone 'gon be sent out, huh
But I ain't even tripping on the judge man
It's Sway in the Morning man and I ain't finna budge man",https://genius.com/Lecrae-5-fingers-of-death-freestyle-lyrics
Falling Down,Gravity,2012.0,"It’s goin’ down
It’s goin’ down
Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
It’s goin’ down
But can’t nobody escape Gravity
It’s goin’ down

Yes sir, it’s about to go down
It’s spiralin’ to the ground, but I don’t think it’s gon’ slow down
This fallen world is fallin’, this building’s ‘bout to blow down
We just goin’ in circles, we don’t get another go ‘round
(It’s goin’ down) What happens when your life is leveled, bro?
A storm is comin’, can’t nobody’s levees hold
It’s heavy, bro, but I gotta let you know
It’ll help you look beyond this world like a telescope
(It’d be easy) Yeah, you can stack your money in the air (Air)
‘Til it’s rainin’ hund’eds all around your atmosphere
(It’d be easy) You can build a mansion sky high
‘Til can’t nobody see the roof when they drive by
But death’ll hit you like a drive by
And to that stuff you acquired you gotta say “Bye, bye” (Peace)
I ain’t gon’ lie, you might go down in history
But everything will go down eventually
Everything is falling (Down)

Going down
I hear the Lord calling
It’s goin’ down
It’s goin’ down
It’s goin’ down

It’s goin’ down, rather comin’ down wit’ it
Cold world, condition is sin, here is the illness
It’s sickenin’, affliction so erotic, sickness so hypnotic
Desirin’ this virus even though we know it’s toxic
Godless, hallowin’ the gods that is counterfeit
We live from ‘de party o’ ‘de dearly departed
The darkness is flowing from my nostrils
We’re so psychotic, we still partyin’ like we not sick
YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, let’s put on another mask
Another bundle o’ cash, another shorty to bag
Same thing e’eryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up cuz I don’t wanna hear the truth
‘Bout the things I’m living fo is dead and I’m the living proof
Shoot, the sky’s fallin’, ain’t no need to panic
Unless we party ‘til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin’
Coming down

Everything is falling down, down, down
Everything is falling down, down, down
Everything is falling down, down, down

Going down
I hear the Lord calling
It’s goin’ down
It’s goin’ down
It’s goin’ down

You scared, I’m not
There’s a time for everything
A time to be born and a time to die
There’s a time when the world as we know it will end
When that is, I don’t know
But it is goin’ down

Listen, it’s goin’ down, down, down holla’ “Mayday!”
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain’t playin’ Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain’t a war fair?
Scales never even, but they be triple beamin’
They keep them fiends fienin’, the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin’, but ain’t no hope here
Ain’t no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here
Oh yeah! Them Christians in Christian Audigier
Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say?
‘Cause everything is fallen, it can happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain’t no way to get away
You ain’t never gon’ say you ain’t hear it from Lecrae
If I die before I wake I pray to the Lord your soul He'll take
All these drunken nights are empty like the bottles that we break
And you can't get high enough to escape
It's going down!

War, pain, violence should stop
Violence should stop, violence should stop
Violence should stop, violence should stop
Viole-violence should stop, violence should stop
Violence should stop, violence should stop

4-fever, 9 millimeter
‘Dem a want a heater ‘cause the streets is finna heat up
Six million ways to die, choose 10
And if he don't die then he probably do ‘em again
From passionate catastrophe, to genocidal blasphemy
No respect for humanity, they resort to insanity
Head bang on the glass, call it window pane
Jumping out the window tryna’ get my frame through the frame
Close range; when he point, I just blank-out
Felt my heart sank when that bang thang rang out
Now you got yo thang out, you take life, you give it
You took his life away, but you gave yours up to system
No wanna listen, no reason for livin’
We bought the lie we can't be forgiven for all our sinnin’
Killin’ is the religion, services in the prison
Ignorance got a slave and our name in the mentions

War, pain, violence should stop
War, pain, violence should stop
War, pain, violence should stop
Violence should stop, violence should stop

Bad man, bad man, gun man, bad man
Squeeze bullet, pow-pow
Body bag, man
No bother with no war, no bother with no violence
No bother with the six feet rest-in-peace silence

Grew up under 2Pac, bible verse and two Glocks
Say we ready to die, see a ghetto in the sky
Couldn't be more wrong than right shoes on the left feet
Highway to hell and we fighting for the best seat
No heart, bullet’s got no name
Little boys wanna bang but ‘dem barely got a brain
‘Dem barely got aim, but they shooting for nothin’
They rob a sister of her brother for a couple a hund’ed
They thinkin’ that life is cheap but it's expensive as ever
They'll be sentenced to forever for them heartless endeavors
I try to tell ‘em (Simmer down brethren), but they like whateva’
Too scared of being broke to think about being betta’
Plus, we get bombarded by all these images of bravado
You ain't really a man if you don't follow these models
But the weakest ones follow, the strong reconsider
You can forgive much if you understand you forgiven

War, pain, violence should stop
War, pain, violence should stop
War, pain, violence should stop
Violence should stop, violence should stop

Bad man, bad man, gun man, bad man
Squeeze bullet, pow-pow

No bother with no war, no bother with no violence

Fuego,Gravity,2012.0,"Look, I’m all in it
Preach Jesus till I’m short-winded
Come God-sippin' pouring up living water in lyrics
This ain’t rap this bartending
And I’m back in the back snapback to the back
With a pack full of cats that’ll strap with the fact
Christ when he ask to revive in the tracks
Turn their life into maps with the gospel we pack
Look I’m of one life
But for Him I spend every cent though
I know this life it comes with pain
But it’s through our pain we win doe
Could be made like Him so
Treat these streets like flint bro
Cause our God can spark up the dark
In the hearts of the hardest departed let’s go

Treat every night like it’s the last night
Like it’s the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let’s set ablaze the sky
Passions are fire bright and we’ll be burning forever
(Light up the night) Set the world on fire, let’s set the world on fire (4x)

Never been here before
Left foot tell the right foot to go
See the whole world coming through the door
Footloose don’t nobody care no more
Come on go hard til the end don’t quit it
Sky too close now go head get it
World’s the same it’s all a game
Look at a stranger go change a thang
Get up! The sky gon burn tonight
Ye know ya’ll going to learn tonight
Feed the hungry and touch the sick
We gon help the homeless and love the kids
We gon move to a place where it’s hard to live
And folks die young and they learn to kill
Light the sky up change your bio
Live for something more than things you buy up
Serve and save learn and change
Trust in the king who can turn this thang
Yeah they ain’t ever seen a shine like this
Look up they never see the sky like this
I’m on and this little light I got
I'mma let it shine til the day I drop
Heart quit pumping only way I stop
Til then I’m a light post on your block

Treat every night like it’s the last night
Like it’s the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let’s set ablaze the sky
Passions are fire bright and we’ll be burning forever
(Light up the night) Set the world on fire, let’s set the world on fire (4x)

See I don’t want no regrets
No turning back I'mma go and impress
Even if I lead the whole world in press
That ain’t going to put my soul to rest
Keep the name keep the fame
World too cold so I keep the flame
Ever seen a child ain’t eat for days
Promise you ain’t ever gon leave the same
Hands and feet, it seems to me
The world is a mess gon sweep the streets
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDs
Make a brother wanna stay on tour for days
When I get home and things are wrong
There’s two shot dead right around my zone
Ya I pray but faith is dead
If I don’t get up and go work my legs
Torches high light the sky
116 no shame tonight
Ya they ain’t ever seen a shine like this

And everything else is irrelevant
What's your contribution to the world when you stagnant
You feel that mission in your stomach, you sittin' absent
Why you lookin' in the branches for what's found in roots
If you ain't workin' in them trenches, why you buy them boots?
Spotlight, limelight, it ain't light work, it's hard work
The way the lights work is you grind hard in them dark times and let the Light work
High life ain't the highlight since the hustle that's behind it
Get your mind right when you struggle through the dark you shinin' brightest

Don Cannon
]
Ayy, yo Cannon man
What's up homie?
You know what I've come to realize is
What's that?
Everybody wanna put me in a box
Nah!
They tryna figure out what category I belong in man
There ain’t no category for this!
So I figure, let me help them out a little bit, you know what I'm saying?
I think it's about that time

I am so authentic, I'm so authentic
They try to figure me out, but this is not a gimmick
Hi Hip Hop, don’t act like you don’t know me
We got the same momma, don’t you try to disown me
I am so authentic, I'm so authentic
They try to figure me out, but this is not a gimmick
Hi Hip Hop, don’t act like you don’t know me
We got the same momma don’t you try to disown me

I'm just a mixed breed, call me a daywalker
'Cause I walk in the sun but at night I’m a stalker
If you’re looking for blood, come run in my lane
The vein never runs dry, it's plenty of it mayne
I speak an ancient language, they don’t understand me
It’s called the truth, I break it down, they try to reprimand me
Ms. Lauryn, she spoke it, they tried to revoke her
They drove her crazy like Morgan Freeman did to Miss Daisy
I am not insane, product of the culture
I'm what happens when Outkast meets the writings of Moses
The views are opposing, but they correlate
And me and Christ don’t match, but we coordinate
If Wu-Tang can spit five percent gems
I can talk about Him who died for my sins
I’m not a gospel rapper, not a holy roller
I’m just a product of grace, spreading hope to the hopeless

See, they trying to put me in the box my whole life. But you know, I stand tall. And it seems like that box is a little too small for me. Church clothes

Feels like I'm *bacbacbac ratatatat*, letting off that truth in here
That caged, untamed, strange man, let it loose in here
You may have came here sane maine, with your brain in your main frame
But if you can’t hang man, you can lose it here
And let’s be clear, I don’t want your approval
And I don’t thirst for the worthless my verses will prove it
All these empty executives, a lame pursuit
And you can tell they are just a shell from their vain pursuits
They say they love my music, boy they telling tales
They want me sign on a dotted line, but I’m not for sale
They want that Jay (I know), they want that Yeezy
They want that Lupe, they ain't hearing what you say
I beg to differ, I think they do
They’re listening, cause it’s different, and some of them confused
So I’m leaving clues, I give directions
I hope they stop at the light before the intersection

The anticipation is over, here it is. Changing lives one by one. Another classic for you all to ride to. I go by the name of Don Cannon, The One Man Army, back to back with the homie Lecrae",https://genius.com/Lecrae-co-sign-lyrics

I let my lust done bring destruction, no discussion with the God who gave me grace
5:46 in the morning, mind still turning, God had to bring me back
I ain't even really want to rap no more
Wheels up with the seats back let's go
Wow, people having dreams about me they was right, I was losing sight
Then I clicked my heels and then He lift the wheels and we above the clouds, there's no rain tonight
And I, I'm finally seeing with a clearer vision I believe
God is greater than all of this trouble that I see
Trapped under the sea I wait to see what swallow me
I'm finally free, yeah

And for one second all my problems
Fade to gray like no one saw 'em
I get a God's eye view on everything
Lookin' out my window pane'
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats back (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Some days I can't believe how far we made it
I thank God for the fans and pray for patience
At twenty-thousand feet, we climbing straight up
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats

Wheels up with the seats back
Some days I can't believe how far we made it
I thank God for the fans and pray for patience

Been tryna walk it out I keep ended up a stretcha’
Problems in life‘ll stretch ya’, ain't got it all together
They say the change comin’, but it’s feelin’ like forever
Oh, I’m on mission, they probably think I'm missin’
Some screws, but it’s these three nails that keep me drivin’
If God ain’t with me, I know that I'm gon’ fail
And ain’t a wish in the well that can wish ya’ boy well
Cells eaten by cancer got me lookin’ for answers
Doctors say my daughter
Won't grow up to be a dancer
Just walked out that funeral, I’m right back in
My cubicle
Lord, I'm ready for heaven; I'm just waitin’ on the cue to go
Feel like givin’ up and just blamin’ it on my daddy
He never meant to have me, and problems keep comin’ at me
I wanna walk with Jesus, but my legs too heavy
I'm hopin’ prayer works ‘cause the walls can't hear me
Come on!

So I drop to my knees and I scream with my might
I’m know that these walls can’t hear me
I say, “Lord, please won’t you hear my cry?”
I know that these walls can’t hear me
Maybe if I plead and I sing out loud
I know that these walls can’t hear me
Jesus come walk, come walk with me now
‘Cause I know that these walls can’t hear me
Can't hear me

Oh, D Wade died first, now my Uncle Skip gone
Then I lost my grandpa, and that's when it hit home
That people keep leavin’ me, this world keep deceiving me
They sellin’ me false hope, and I keep believing it
Come on!
I promise I think I'm going insane
Come on!
And gravity pullin’ me down the drain
Come on!
My boys in Afghanistan goin’ crazy
Staring at them pictures of they babies
Bullets flyin’ everywhere, prayin’ they gon’ make it home Lord
Give ‘em Hope
Without it, what else they bankin’ on?
Everything is fallin’ all around me, put yo’ arms around me
Sinkin’ in my sorrows got me drowning
Tempted to empty bottles and throw ‘em off in wind
Devils lurkin’ ‘round the corner, just waitin’ for me to sin
I pray that you sustain me and keep me from givin’ in
Ain't gotta get me out;
Just get me through to the end!!!
Lord Jesus, come on!

Non-Fiction,UnKnown,2014.0,"Yeah, it's all fact no fiction
It's my interpretation
Wanna know how it went down?
I'll tell ya
Yo, Biz turn me up a little bit in the headphones man
Yeah

Check it, uh
I guess I take it back to graduation
Got my degree but writin' songs was my fascination
I got a job installin' cable then I got promoted
Moved out my momma house but still this music was the motive
Around this time I'm bumpin' Tunnel Rats and CMR
But Lil' Jon was on the radio and on the charts
I got creative took the money that I made
And bought a beat machine now it's me and T-Dot up late
And I volunteer at detention centers to be a leader
I got these young dudes lovin' the way I eat the beat up
I ain't wanna blow up just wanna give 'em Jesus
Then Ben startin' up Reach Records was all I needed
I hit the road on the weekends to do a show
Ain't ask for money but they still gave a lil' dough
Just a bunch of wild kids in the front row
Like ""You ain't Lil' Wayne, you a lame, man I got to go""
But I did it, and I was on a mission
And little by little a couple of 'em would get it
Was rappin' in the hood and folks broke down cryin'
That's when I knew this was bigger than me and bigger than rhyme

This is all fact, it's non-fiction
You wanna hear the truth, pay attention
And if I never got a mention
Still do it for the love and the mission

Non fiction
It's all fact, it's all fact, it's all fact

Fast forward just a year later
I done drop my first album and I'm feelin' like I made it
Goin' all around the world tryna tell them 'bout the Savior (what else?)
And I ain't trippin' we ain't really gettin' paper nah
Nah, I'm about to marry me a lady
I left my old job so I'm praying rap pay me
I drop my next album Jesus Muzik kinda major
I moved away to Memphis it was hot as the equator
And gunshots every night'll make ya wake up
Sleepin' on the floor hopin' you don't pick a stray up
Soup campbell took me in and got my weight up
Then I flew back to Cali started workin' on Rebel
Uh, we had a feelin' it would be a problem
It's like the Lord wrote the whole thing
But at home I was havin' problems
Married life was like a bad dream
Now we fightin' every day
My travel gettin' heavy two babies one baby momma
I'm arrogant and self-righteous helpin' everybody but my wife through the drama

This is all fact, it's not fiction
You wanna hear the truth, pay attention

I need a new place new grace new city new state
Now we all headed to Atlanta
I'm stressed out tryna lead Imma bleed myself burnin' out I can see the pattern
I'm just writin' my pain over beats and I'm guessing Rehab was the outcome
I wrote Background at the kitchen table, I thought it wouldn't make the album
Shortly after I got a hold of Tim Keller's books, man I promise you it's like my whole life changed
Andy Crouch wrote a book about culture-makin', and after that I had to make a slight change
Ask the homies I ain't do it for the money man
Nah, I made Church Clothes out of love
And me and Street workin' day and night
Wait a minute, now Gravity is blowin' up
I won a Grammy, and I ain't even trippin' on it
I got a mission that I'm fightin' for, I'm writin' songs tryin' to give ya substance
Yeah, I'm writin' songs fightin' for ya soul

Haters hate
P-people change
Lost the family, f-face the pain
Before death take my breath away
I just want the finer things

Look, You want a piece of chain? I want a peace of mind
I had money in the bank while pops is dying
I can get more money can't buy no time, huh
In a room trying not to cry
Spent quality time so I'm good
Could've been out waxing that hood
Of my foreign car, like some sort of star
Stead of giving my time like I should, huh
You wanna know what's cool?
A daddy dropping his kids off at school
And when his kids is grown with kids of they own
And say my daddy ain't raise no fool
Sometimes, I sit on a plane full of pain
Care less about a grammy or the fame
I just want to see my kids change
And give up my art for their heart
That's gain
Mayne, so tell me what you making?
Money or a difference
You was made for that or get paid for that
What's yo' excuse and yo' mission?
When nobody remembers my name
Or the clothes I wore to that thing
I still rest in peace with my sanity
For them lives I got to help change
Finer things


Okay, I been there, done it to
Seen it all, no birthday suit
Red carpet in my armani suit
Sitting V.I.P. with ya' favorite group
Bad chicks, actress
R&B diva catch a fever while I'm leaving out the back quick
Now, tell me that won't boost your arrogance
Exactly
From Dallas to a palace
In Dubai, to the Maasai tactics
In Africa, I'm not bragging
Just explaining that I ain't lying when I'm saying that I've had it all
Dawg, enough bucks under my mattress
So buy what I want
No more lifting like it's practice
Nope, that's just racks on racks, and bracket
Fast life, race with me
Gassed right? this pace isn't
That life, we should stay living
It'll make it last, we chase feelings

Don't know the truth about you
So I hopping that they hear me uh um
Hear Ye, Hear Ye all of the above
What could warm a blacken heart and fill it full of love?
It feels like just the other day when every thing was hopeless
Up hell's creek without a paddle and a boat
I wasn't really living, I was living for the moment
And now I only live to see clear, so help me focus
It lies all around me
My partners cars cloudy
He just wanna escape the cesspool that got em drowning
Your spirit surround me
Can't nobody see it though
Every once in a while somebody tell me they can see a glow
I quit getting high, and not because I'm better then
But your spirit working in me making me a better man
Know you got a better plan and all this ghetto living
This drug dealing, pimping, exploiting all of these women
My family still in prison I thought that I escaped it
For years I was chained to sin following Satan
The only way to make it, for me was take a plea
I gave my life to the king who died on a tree
And he ain't make me richer
He ain't make me taller
He ain't give new legs to my cousins little daughter
He gave me something greater than anything I done seen
He gave himself to me, he live in me boy I'm clean

Mundane, killa’ bang, sell cane for the gain, pump vanity in your veins
Know they hopin’ I quit, bet they hoping I die, know they hopin' I'm plain insane

And I got some riders behind me, and they mean what they sayin'
Knock-knock, open up, we at yo’ door, hope you prepared now
And I think it's clear now, partner we here now
And don't plan on goin' nowhere, consider yourself invested
And these strains all up in your veins, consider yourself infected
And what we say we live out, fo' we give in we give out
And when we die we come back, tell death he’ll never win out
They ain't never stop us, pop us, drop us, watch us pop right back up
And we never gon' die, that’s why we ride and rise like Pac got back up
Go'n back up, call back up
Everybody go home, just pack up
We plugged into the Highest power, that why we ain't gotta act tough
No poker faces, just smokin' aces, my house is full
My temple is a dwelling place, my master’s masterful
You just full of yourself, you just food on the shelf
Eatin' for breakfast, talking reckless, boy, I know the chef
You don’t want what he’s cooking, it’s not easy to stomach
And your words will be eaten, folks’ll be reading yo’ vomit

I am a felon, I tell no lie
Hand on the Bible, hand to the sky
I wanna live, I ain't wanna die
When they rolled upon me and let them bullets fly

They like ""Man, where the old 'Crae? You crazy, you can't fool me
I would party so hard that the law was tryna find me

Look up in the rear view and they're right behind me
Roll down my window- ""Boy what's your name?
Cause you was doing 85 in the passing lane with no traffic, man""
Then I gave them my ID, and guess what they say
""This boy here crazy, naw that's just Crae""
Man I was psycho, wild as the hundreds
I do like the Chi, doing whatever I wanted
Until I was confronted, heard about Jesus and I changed
They like ""man what you do? Something 'bout you just ain't the same""

Sucked the life out of my mother, just to get the stuff I wanted

Pride's got its crooked fingers twisted all inside in me
Fools walk the path I'm on, never to be seen again

So give me lil' credit 'fore you give me edits
People see my faith in the cross as a loss
But I can't see me dying, bein' superstitious, yeah
And I ain't the picture of perfection
I lost my direction, I was smokin' and drinkin'
But I ain't forgot the resurrection
Only source of hope for a man in my position

I've been up all night
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
'Cause I've been up too high
I'm, tryna make it alright, alright now
I just need some time
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to hide

Uh, imagine you don't got nowhere to place faith
You just livin' life takin' up space
I can't see me livin' for nothin' at all
If ain't no God, what's the point of each day? Huh
What's the purpose of us wakin' up?
We just some cells on a cellphone?
Just a bunch of atoms hangin' in the attic?
Just some molecules in the mailroom?
Nah, I know I got purpose, I know I got passion
He purposed the package, I'm on a home team
Never good enough to get the love of Christ
But He good enough to get the love of me
I tried runnin' from 'em but His love track me down
Like a hound, ain't no other way around it
You either choose love or you choose death
I chose to let the love of God drown me

I've been up all night
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
'Cause I've been up too high
I'm, tryna make it alright, alright now
I just need some time
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to hide

Yeah, uh, now maybe this the end of a long run
Can't believe they let us make it this far
If you ask me how I did it, I'd be lyin' to you if I gave you any other answer but God
And I ain't deserve a day, ha
Matter of fact I missed a lot of plays
Matter of fact I dropped the ball way too many times and they still wonderin' how we won the game
Offense, drugs, divorce, addiction
Those the things you mention and you come up missin'
Tell me what's the mission if it ain't forgiveness?
Only two responses to sin: forgive and repentance
But we love to beat each other up
Instead of prayin' and workin' to heal each other, huh?
And I ain't finger pointin' at anybody but
If the shoe fits, go ahead and wear it, bruh

I've been up all night
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
'Cause I've been up too high
I'm, tryna make it alright, alright now
I just need some time
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right

Seasons change the colors so quickly
It's hard to keep up with the leaves
'Cause everybody leaves
On my birthday, Kobe, Gigi and seven souls remind me
That the tree of life is so uncertain
And tomorrow has unpredictabilities as colorful as the smiles that took off that day
May that Sunday morning resonate past trophies and trinkets and the ongoing pursuit of more
To sober us but the humbling truth
My life and your life, is just a vapor
And if what you see is all you see
Then you do not see all there is to be seen
Quickly

Run up on you and your crew and tell ya’ll Jesus is the truth
Open air evangelists, relationships, we do it all
Backpack still full of tracts with a Johnny Mac
Hats to the back and our backs to the wall
Plus I got some homies out there who gon’ rep the rock
If you wanna make them stop, you gon’ have to bring a choppa
If they get martyred, then we gon’ go harder
Share the gospel on death row and let ‘em know that they been pardoned
You don’t wanna get it started, this is what we do, who we are
1-1-6 to the day we die, ain’t tryin to be no superstars

I get every thinking body you gon have to pardon me
Wanna know the truth brought a partner this here was stallin me
Real talk, real talk, before it was the real talk
I was in community just trying to have a real walk
Looking for direction but at times that I would feel lost
What's accountability? Your boy was prone to be alone
Folk making war within the stars; Han Solo
God used somebody to wake me minus the NoDoz

Find us hiding behind him all prepared to fight, very tight
Fighting trying to share the cross. He spared of life
We’re living by the blood like we’re parasites, get it right
My team carries bunch of high beam blaring lights
Might seem scary but we nice, see we carry life
Light is seen clearly man we’re glaring very bright
Check the fleet man we deep so we might seem Barry White
Ever since we heard about the murder how they buried Christ
Eyes upon the cross even though that is a scary sight
But that was the merger we converted now we very tight
He died for His bride homie, How you like the married life?
Christ the name we calling on
Can't wait until He calls us home
You know we be falling often we can't walk it all alone
My crew's always rhyming like some stalkers we ain't stalkin' homes
Started with the cross and we continue with the cross alone

Know they thinkin' I'm blind, but I just pay them no mind

They like what you think you doin' putting hope in your rhymes?
You would think I'm shooting folk or putting coke in my rhymes
I just give them bass for free and push the dopest of lines

Crossed the ocean, 'til we made it
And my DNA tested said the Westside of the motherland is where they take us from
Um, never met my daddy's side so I couldn't tell y'all if I'm Zulu or Xhosa
Couldn't tell y'all how I be courtside
Or made it this far without a cosign
Of course, I struggled a lot and stayed prayed, prayin'
Unforgettable, Swae Lee, Swae Lee, demons Achilles, KD, KD

And when it get real I can feel Christ

You ain't gonna be nothin', your daddy wasn't, you ain't gonna be

My little cousin was hittin' me up, man, I changed all my numbers I never knew
Crazy how digits were causing division, can't nobody get at the revenue
Seven numbers on a smartphone
Equal cash app the lights on
I get royalties, but I got loyalties, so send a bill, I'll go half on it
Half black, half unknown
Are we Cherokee or Seminole?
I got PTSD runnin' through me from my kinfolk
Stress had me going AWOL
Sin got me actin' Adolf
I'm like ""Aye y'all, I need days off, I'm depressed, having brain fog""
It's obvious, I'm highly blessed
I finally get to understand what a man is when he at his godliest
To get there I was highly stretched and I was highly stressed

Down

Can't fight these battles alone, they after my home
They after my mind, they after my time
You said, ""I'm an heir"" they after the throne
I thought I was running from demons, but maybe I'm running from me and my tether is roamin', running from clones
We talking 'bout running the city, but most of us running from home
Running from trauma and poverty, I hit the lottery, I thought they'd leave me alone

Or hit me with venom, I don't have opinions
All I got is patience and a couple pennies
I ain't independent, leanin' on the spirit
I know we gon' win it, so go hang the pennants

Had the doctors on the line

Come too far to shut my eyes

But without the King, what does it really mean
Cup full of lean, got a sweet for the green
Wake up, boy this ain't a dream
Welcome to H-Town

Fell in love with a harsh road at my auntie house
Dipping with my kin folks, them spoke, okay I
Candy paint, sexy as we tipping from the city lights
Got them boys flexing, baby, every time we pimp the ride
Gripping wood grain, always sipping good, man
I was down for whatever, wished somebody would mayne
Enticing with them vices, yeah mayne, looking pretty like a bad yellow bone
While I'm dipping through the city. Th-Th-Throwed in the game it's going down, I'm yelling mayday!
It's like the world stood still when we bought them gray tapes
Ch-chop chopped screwed, outchea act a fool
It's got me wondering what's next, baby, when this life is through

I was born in H-Town, starched down way back
When the slabs in the city beat that screw off in the back
Poking eye, keep them spinners, eating Frenchy's chicken dinner
Family came from 3rd Ward Scott Street on up to Ennis
Hanging out on Sunnyside with my cousin Corel
They was on that purple Sprite,
 
I was still sipping 40s
Keke's
 still pimping stories as I'm passing by Yates next
Stop and wonder if I'll enter heaven's gates
I told my cousin D at TSU
 ""I smoke trees
I think the Lord is calling me, both of us agree""
And, man, I love the city of my birth, that's why I plea
That God will change the H the same way He's changing me!
Cause all I cared about was riding clean
A pocket full of green, and find a bad yellow
I can put up on my team
My bros riding dirty, know your soul ain't clean
And gon' let the Lord intervene!

Welcome to H-Town, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa
I'm praying for H-Town, yeah yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa, yeah

I had a dream on the plane that I was sitting in the slabs
Seat back, bass up, 
chunking deuce and giving dap
Talking to my partners 'bout these plans that I have
When I told them ""Oklahoma"" made them boys just laugh, like
""Where there at, folk? "" ""man, stop the joking"" ""yeah, you hood, but you ain't dat dope""
It's like they couldn't understand me having that hope, trying to serve God
They want me serving things with that dope, but that's when we flat broke
Pass the kill. And as I got higher, death is what I started to feel ""dog, we smokin' kill""
I backed away from the killer, He picked up my life and my vision got clearer
Destiny is screamin' it's faint, but I hear that things are bad right now
But the man in the mirror is trying to make a change,
 rearrange some things
H-Town, I still love you, hold up, man

In the start, hearts dark, but we found the light
Now it’s soundin' right
So it’s all to the good
We done found new life, 'cause the Gospel is good
In the past, I don’t think y'all understood
Now y'all done messed up, let us all in your hood
We got the windows down, and when we finna cruise
We tryna glorify the Lord with what we listen to
We bump that Cross Movement
We bump that Lamp Mode
We 'bout that Jesus music
Get up yo' hands, bro
It might be screwed and chopped
It might be East coast
Either way, this Jesus muzik's hot
Bump this in your speakers, bro
The Lord ain’t pleased with that money and weed
So if you hear them subs, and you see us up in your streets
I might be—

You like music from rap to gospel
But you prolly never heard nobody rap the Gospel
Different sound, but the Truth’s the same
With no choirs, no bands, but the Truth remains
We got fam and the clique, set the booth aflame
St. Louis up to Philly, like Duce and FLAME
If you lost in the flow, don’t lose the name
It’s Jesus Christ, the King of the Jews, my man
This ain’t entertainment, dog, it’s timeless Truth
Would you rather hear a song about shiny coupes?
Nope
Non-fat, non-gat, non-killa rap
A hundred percent Christ, the blood, spill-a-rap
Y'all feelin' that?
Rap wrapped up with the Gospel Truth, aye Trip, yo, reel it back
Y'all feelin' that?
Rap wrapped up with the Gospel Truth, aye Trip, dog, reel it back

Yeah, if in our car you hear that boom-bap
And you hear some dudes rap
It ain’t them folks that boast, it’s folks that tell you where the Truth’s at
We don’t wanna hear about dimes and dope
We don’t wanna hear about knives and smoke
We don’t wanna hear about movin' packs and foolish cats who lie and boast
We do wanna hear about Christ, the King
Do wanna hear how lives have changed
We do wanna hear how God is pleased and theology out the Bible, man
This Jesus muzik turn heads, so turn it up and let 'em know
In all we do, He’s first, and this Jesus muzik’s better, bro, yeah

Lord Have Mercy,Gravity,2012.0,"Lord have mercy, and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become

Dark Past full of evil endeavors
Heart clean never black and ugly as ever
However, I seen my family die from them rocks
Them fiends on blocks including my own pops
Homie I seen two much to drink them two cups
Can't lean on the lean, already way too screwed up
Was way too gone, I was way too cold
Fifty yard Hail Mary I was way too thrown
I was Tarzan, raised by gorillas and the beasts
High on them trees When I gorilla the beats
Then that truth came hit me, took me outa' my grave
All my partners say I'm changed, how I'm going stay the same, huh?!

Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

Killa, tryina murder it chasing ladies down for fun
Saying, ""Come with me,"" Hail Mary but then kill her son
However, I seen them boys man, take that bar and wait for God say?
Beastie boy, he still took three the hard way
Toss me up, Hardaway, crucifix no jewelry
These wooden beams he took from me
Took them up to Calvary
 
while I was a DGK
Wylin out to UGK, runnin from the HPD
Huffin puffin mary jane, no Rick James mayne
I was looking for a super freak
Nasty, cameo, candy, super sweet
But now your boy turnt up free from all them chains
Volume on ten, you can call it unashamed

Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

Now I'm turnt up daily, I'm on my one-eighty
They thought I'd water it down, I'm like boy y'all crazy
On my J.O. My Oj Mayo, I'm on my Grizzly
Jesus turned me around me so fast that you would swear I was dizzy
Now they askin, ""who is he?"" Now they wonderin' my name
I run in my own lane Screaming ""Jesus is King!""
Till my heart stop pumpin, no more blood in my veins
Watch me turn up everyday, Homeboy I'm so unashamed!

Turn up boy turn up boy
Turn up boy turn up

New whip, ain't got no blinkers cause I ain't never switching lanes
It's One Sixteen tatted on the team, boy, you know we unashamed
My day ones know it's real with me, I ain't gotta say they names
And I ain't gotta shout them out on IG cause they ain't lookin' for no fame, boy, they swear I'm playing games
I just tell 'em what they need to do
I'm just goin' where they never go
I'm just sayin' what they need to know
Always in the trenches, 2017 I came up
Same rebel on a different level
Yeah, you know I never change up

Buttons,Gravity,2012.0,"For better or for worse
Make it work
I ain’t goin nowhere

Yeah, I messed up, but you hurt me
Blew it like it’s yo’ birthday
And you love it baby on Wednesday
But I make you sick on Thursday
And I know I'm wrong and you shutin’ down
And I touch down like “What now?”
Why we going through all this?
Why things gotta be rough now?
But, you had so many break-ups, you can't believe
You go and break my heart that I forgive and I ain't leave
Don't define you by your faults
Ain't gon’ push your buttons either
Everyday we startin’ fresh, this is how it's s’posed to be
Never try to take advantage, you respect me as a man
But every once ‘a while you get to popping off and
Say stuff you shouldn't be sayin’
But I'm witchu, I ain't playin’, if it's thick or if it's thin
Both the times and your figure, girl, this is who I am
I love you baby, that's real talk
And this life we live is a real walk
I ain't goin’ nowhere
Tell your girlfriends that it's still on
I love you baby, that’s real talk
This life we live is a real walk
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, tell your friends that it’s on

For better or for worse
Sometimes I make you sick
And you get on my nerves
Make it work
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, and I give you my word
I will be right here
So though you push my buttons (I ain’t leavin’)
You can keep on pushin’ (I ain’t leavin’)

I be makin’ you mad, girl
But you said you'll never leave me lonely
So I had to put a ring up on it
‘cause our commitment ain't no game
Yeah we laugh, but we ain't playin’
I’mma always be yo’ mane
And I know sometimes I upset you
Be pushin’ all o’ you buttons
We be fussin’, fighting over nothin’
You can try to leave, but I’m comin’
We gon’ work it out with no runnin’
Pushin’ ,shovin’
I know sometimes that I'm selfish
But I jump in front of yo’ bullet
Cause you everything that prayed fo’
Plus a little bit extra
Even when you getchu an attitude and you act a little bit extra
Listen, you make better, babe
You make better, babe
You got my heart and you can have it for forever, baby
And though we’ll never break up
I hate it when we mad
But love it when we get to make up
No lines that I could make up
To let you know how much I got you covered, girl
And I only be pushin’ yo’ buttons because I love you, girl

For better or for worse
Sometimes I make you sick
And you get on my nerves
Make it work
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, and I give you my word
I will be right here
So though you push my buttons (I ain’t leavin’)
You can keep on pushin’ (I ain’t leavin’)

We can go through fire, but it won't
Make us leave each other, no
Coz this love is stronger even though
You push my buttons boy

For better or for worse
Sometimes I make you sick
And you get on my nerves
Make it work
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, and I give you my word
I will be right here
So though you push my buttons (I ain’t leavin’)
You can keep on pushin’ (I ain’t leavin’)

Beautiful Feet,Rebel,2008.0,"Carlos was born in killa cali was walking down an alley
And caught a bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly
He lost everything at that moment except his life
He lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight
He laid there in a coma but man nobody cared
The Gospel preached in his neighborhood? Nobody dared
But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear
A missionary shared the gospel to his open ears
He got saved got trained got discipled
Back to hood you could find em preaching the bible
He led a homie to Christ from his same hood
Part of Church plant come on now ain't his name good
This is a blessing, I’m stressing, but this is not the norm
We need leaders and believers to help carry it on
But who would minister in a sinister part of town
I pray if Jesus is calling you, you would be found

Eric used to go to bible study as a kid
He got older and started doing what the hood did
A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life
But the jammed up so them beat him nice
He woke up in the hospital singing bible songs
Praise God he had a place to learn the bible from
But then he gets saved and wanna preach Christ
They make him change his whole culture and way of life
He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie
Go to seminary by then all of his boys will die
Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth
And used a couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous
The feet are beautiful if only they'd go
If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?
Eric is better used taught trues in his context
Somebody please plant a church in his projects

In Luke 4:16 on down to 21
Jesus says he's messiah says hes the chosen one
But more than that he quotes Isaiah
That shows our savior targets oppressed captive blind and the broke I'm saying
Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low
And 1st John 2:6 is way we should go
In Deuteronomy even tho they under the law
The tithes every third year the poor got em all
I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs
I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting
Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word and
Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him
We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets
I pray that more would be burdened to have beautiful feet
You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach
I pray to God you'd be burdened to those beautiful feet
Go, go, go
 (run with those beautiful feet)
Go, go, go
You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world
They can't believe in something they ain't never heard
Go, go, go and run with those beautiful feet",https://genius.com/Lecrae-beautiful-feet-lyrics
BET Cypher,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You probably watching like man I never heard of him
I murder him
The nerve of him
Rocking with Pre-Premier that’s so absurd of him
Wait until he spit a couple verbs at them
If you really wanna hate wait, he got the Word with him
I heard em holla “Jesus the Notorious” no
The most glorious homie
So laborious
Boring us with these choruses
Horrible at it’s core
It’s just killing us, call the coroner
Unimpressive ain't flooring us
Hey this what happen when hip-hop let the saints in
Tailored to snatch the mic swiftly like Ye did
But them awards can’t follow you to the grave
You living for them whips and chains then you a slave
Uh, prayer don’t stop time, it kills hours
They looking for a savior, but we killed ours

Darkest Hour,Church Clothes,2012.0,"Ok, yes, uh huh, No Malice and Lecrae

Lord, have mercy and pity on Your Son
From what I once was, to what I have become
Forgive me for my past and the noses left numb
As I'm led down this path to the beat of a different drum
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'm conquering my giants
And all by my lonesome I'm conquering Goliath
I cut it on the buyers, now I trade in the triple beams
I'm Tebow to the game and I done traded teams
The slate is clean and ever since, I've been delivered
My flow got 'em guessing like rock-paper-scissors
Before the feds came, we were already prisoners
32 years made us all reconsider
The Holy Ghost in us, so whoever got a gripe
Prove the Devil's alive and well, Tyler got it right
How long can you live with your hands up in the white?
Jesus or the Judge? They both offer you life

I fall on my knees when I rise
Thank him for my breath, opening my eyes
When I leave my home, if I meet my demise
Even the darkest day will see the sun rise
I fall on my knees when I rise
Thank him for my breath, opening my eyes
When I leave my home, if I meet my demise
Even the darkest day will see the sun rise

Come as you are is what they told me, so I paid attention
And I ain't wore a suit to church since Jordan was a Wizard
Father forgive 'em, they betrayed us with a kiss (Mwah)
Hate what they can't understand, I'm so ambiguous
I spazzed on the pharaoh, the pathway is narrow
Eye of the bull on my back, looking for an arrow
Lying like I wasn't tempted by that double barrel
If gangstas don't dance, why you tappin' with the Devil?
My two left feet won't let me dance to his beat
Sick of livin' in Hell and I'm allergic to the heat (It's cold)
And imperative you listen to my narrative
They sellin' false hope like a sedative
I don't think the world is aware of it
Maybe they don't care a bit
They think we all fam but it's relative
Try to think my flow is irrelevant but they don't know a thing
Crucify me next to thieves, I'm still gon' rise a king ('Crae)

I fall on my knees when I rise
Thank him for my breath, opening my eyes
When I leave my home, if I meet my demise
Even the darkest day will see the sun rise
I fall on my knees when I rise
Thank him for my breath, opening my eyes
When I leave my home, if I meet my demise
Even the darkest day will see the sun rise",https://genius.com/Lecrae-darkest-hour-lyrics

Cross my heart and hope to live
To make you
Smile
Cause I don't deserve you
For all the times you held me
Down
Listen to me now, I love you girl

You know I had to do a love song
And let the whole world know bout my love y'all
Love sick is what I told the
Doctor
We could be more like Sho Baraka
But we are Moore's and we been that
And when I said I do, I meant that
It's a trip that you let me lead you
Cause I’m a mess and sometimes I need you
And I need you, to understand
That
(
I'm dying everyday trying to be a better man)
I put that on my momma
I love the way you play your part through my drama
Long nights, long flights
Trips out of town
You keep my head up when it was hanging down
Down like four flats on a lack
I let you down and you still keep coming back


Out here trying to save the world
Can't forget about my baby girl
And baby girl, you so tight it's true to me
Sometimes I wonder why you fool
With me
Cause foolishly I’m prone to hurt you
Call you grace cause I don’t deserve you
I recall cold nights, no lights, low dough nights
You ain’t fussing you was there through the whole night
Saying it's alright
So faithful, far as beef yeah we done had a plateful
But we ate it up and we made it up
Cause our view of the Lord wasn’t great enough
No divorce cause what God put together
We will never tear apart, we gonna fight and never let up
And when I get up I'm back down on my knees
Thank God my rib's the best part of me


All the fellas out there in the world
If your lady love God and you got a good girl
Stay wit her, pray wit her, take her on a date
Tell her you appreciate
How she love me how she cares
And how she's every woman everywhere
And baby I'm sorry for all the days
I let you down but I got something to say

You know that I love you girl

Molested, abused, abandoned, arrested, accused, and stranded

'Til years later it show up, life is starting to blow up

Gone too far to turn back, he said, ""Boy, you tellin' lies""

Shoes, check!

He live in the gym and his hair stay faded
Late model car so they think he made it
He's Christian, he gave his life
But he still ain't satisfied in the Savior Christ
Still finds his identity in looks and cars
If he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard
If he looked in God, it may seem odd
But he'd be so satisfied, he can leave it all, yeah

Why do I say I'm blessed?
Huh?
Is it the car that I drive?
Or the place that I rest?
Or the way that I dress?
Now, now
Is the cause of my pride
The stage and the set?
Or my face in the press?
Now, now
It's the applause that dies
When the praise is less
If my face is depressed
Then, then
It's 'cause my value and worth's in the volume of the work I produce in the booth, in the booth
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the Truth is through, is through
Man, I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more, ha
'Cause they don't like me, like they did in '04, '04, '04
So I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in Him
He's got peace, God's priest, I'm in
In His presence, weak is strength
Meet His kin
We His brethren
Read this list
Me forgiven
He's dismissed
Guilt and my sin and then I find my worth 'cause I'm Jesus' friend

I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no
I'm not the job I work
You, you can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

Got her hair done, toes, nails
Is that Her? Well, it's hard to tell
'Cause she's so caked up in all that make up
It's like she tryna make up for what she ain't, but
She's a saint, but so confused
'Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes
That tell her on a scale of ten, she's a two
But that ain't true
If she only knew
In Christ she is loved, she's secure and accepted
Never be rejected by God who's elected her
Her beauty is her godliness
And she ain't gotta flaunt it 'cause it's obvious
Identity is found in the God we trust
Any other identity will self destruct
Identity is found in the God we trust
Any other identity will self destruct

It's you I Glorify cause you don't want my sacrifice
You want me broken and contrite trusting in the Christ
I confess to you my sin and you show me mercy
I turn away from it demonstrating that you are worthy
Over lust, over pride
Over all sin
Is my affection for Jesus who died for all them
I was lost now I'm found I was toss to the ground
My sin weighed on me heavy but I am no longer bound
As sure as Christ wear the crown I know that grace will abound
And even when I feel lost I know in You I am found

I'd rather die a free man then live on Earth a slave
I'm fighting for people they put in chains
They stripped our heritage, they took our names
Put our women to shame
Whipped us and beat us, mislead us
But they can't take our passion
Take my body but my soul won't fit inside your casket

Forget what I said, forget what I did
I did what I had to do and I'd do it all again
And if you're going through hell
Keep it going, my baby promise that Heaven is near

I've come a long way
From a very hard place
It's been a hard race
But somehow I found my way home
I've walked a long road
To where only God knows
But when the trumpet blows you know
I did it all on my own

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh

Taken from Africa
Treated like animals
Culturally denigrated
Broke up our families
Prison of false religion, the same God you lied on
The same God I rely on, I'ma strive on
Alone just a small tribe
Fought for truth for y'all, died
Martyrs live forever so
Out the depths we all rise
Die for a freedom that I'll never see
I pray y'all live it to the fullest for my legacy
Let's go

Forget what I said, forget what I did
I did what I had to do and I'd do it all again
And if you're going through hell
Keep it going, my baby promise that Heaven is near

I've come a long way
From a very hard place
It's been a hard race
But somehow I found my way home
I've walked a long road
To where only God knows
But when the trumpet blows you know
I did it all on my own

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh
I did it all on my own

Anger Management,Rehab: The Overdose,2011.0,"Aye, what if
What if we all need anger management?
Why don't we just
Treat this song like a, an anger management class?
You feel me?

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm busting, I'm poppin'
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving
Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something
I'm angry

Been up all night, Got me feeling weak
No sleep on the first day of a long week
I guess I'm still in school,These people testing me
But disrespecting me I will respond aggressively
A long day short fuse in the worst mood
My temper red hot I will get these boys blues
Hard livin got me feelin very selfish
Crab in a bucket tryin' crush these other shellfish
Forget the chip upon my shoulder man I carry boulders
I don't know how to control them when they get to rollin'
When people pop off at the mouth I try to keep the cool
But all I wanna do is fix 'em, troubleshoot
Yeah they say I'm wrong if this carries on
The faith I claim to have I'll probably never own
Empty waiting pool running out of patience
This is anger management get me another agent


I'm angry every morning before I get up off the bed
This dog keep on barkin I'mma bust em in the head
Uncle keep on trippin if he want to he can get it too
Anybody say another word I'mma act the fool
I hit the dough, push my fitted to the side
Heart full of pride, anger in my eyes
Been this way since the day I seen my homie die
Now I'm mad at the world and I hate that I'm alive
Really hate to say it cos it's killing me inside
All I wanna be is loved and it's eating me alive
Don't nobody love me man my momma and my daddy don't
My uncle ain't my uncle cos I'm living in a foster home
I say I'm saved but I'm scared of the truth
Cus I read Galatians 5 and I didn't see the fruit
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
So I hit my knees and pray, God take this thing away

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving
Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something
I'm angry

I would die for my respect
But I got no humility
And Jesus paid my debt while
I reject him willingly
Man I got some nerve
Holding anger in my heart
The Father could have come serve me that beef up A La Carte
Not to mention torture, Jesus took all my misfortune
I’ve been freed from the Law, but I'm serving these court orders
Unforgiveness is my pedigree
, you say you’re sorry better be
Better bein' mad at you, than try'na be a better me
Ain't nothin' in my workin' tryna demonstrate His worth
And though He show me plenty grace, I don't extend to other persons
And that anger led to murder
When you pull up on that murder scene
It's Jesus nailed upon that cross, yeah the murderer was me

1 Peter 2:23 man, when they used to hurl insults at Jesus, He didn't retaliate
He entrusted Himself to the One that judges justly. The gospel manages our anger, ya feel me? The solution is to gain a heart that's thankful for grace in Jesus Christ!",https://genius.com/Lecrae-anger-management-lyrics
Chase That (Ambition),Rehab: The Overdose,2011.0,"Started with hanging posters on my bedroom walls
To battle rapping for status up in the school halls.
Just call me double sushi, thought I was too raw
And hip hop was my home, I had my shoes off
6’3” in high school, skip a hoop dream
If I don’t blow up then maybe, I’ll try the school thing
I went to college
 
to do my family a favor
But I couldn’t pick a major cause I wanted to be major
I tried sellin work, but it didn’t work
So I worked, shopping center clerk, finna go berserk
Lunch break , see my writing 16’s over Micky D’s
Skipping class, making beats over 60 keys
And I love that, that even though I’m just chasin'
Selfish ambition couldn’t tell your boy nothin'
Watch out all you rappers’ cause they 'finna le' ‘Crae in
But I was sleeping on the Son like the Days Inn

Ay you can have the money
And you can have the fame
But me I want the Glory
I’m living for the Name
See life is just a picture
I see outside the frame
I'm living for a kingdom that I ain't never seen

And I'mma chase that
Glory I'mma I'mma chase that
Found the key to life and best believe that I'mma play that
Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that
Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that

I remember chasing the green feeling blue
Only check I’m counting is the mic check, one, two
All I wanted was the money and the fame and the new
Somebody on my arm when I walk inside the room
All I wanted was doom
The same kind Alexander the Great felt
When the Earth ran out of room
He conquered all he could, but yet he’s feelin' consumed
By this never ending quest for glory he couldn’t fuel
Like a typical fool, I would go hard
Shootin' for the moon
But there only one son, no co-star
Chasin' glory I shouldn’t own
Instead of livin' to make His name known
I’m runnin' after his throne
I thought being on TV where everybody could see me
Was nothing short of the easiest way I could see to please me
I’ll never be who I used to desperately want to be
I’m too worried 'bout the Lord getting credit instead of me

Ay you can have the money
And you can have the fame
But me I want the Glory
I’m living for the Name
See life is just a picture
I see outside the frame
I'm living for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen

And I'mma chase that
Glory I'mma I'mma chase that
Found the key to life and best believe that I'mma play that
Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that
Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that

I use to wanna do it big
When you’re only focused on yourself that’s small
And they, they use to tell me as a kid
That I could do anything that I want except fall
And now that I recall
I was chasing my goals
And every time I caught em they multiplied into mo’
I never even thought about whether the Lord approved
Call it selfish ambition
I call it, I'm making moves
But history repeats itself
Evil’s what it is
Cause Lucifer 
was cast away for doing what I did
Created by the God who spoke the Earth into existence
Instead of chasing the Father’s glory he was chasing his
He lies to us all
Told Adam he could ball
“Why you following God when you could go get it all?”
I’ll tell you what's better, or better yet worse
Chasing your own glory by doing the Lord’s work
So holla if it hurts
But we were made for greater
Our greatest satisfaction is making His Name famous
So if we’re never named among the greatest
They don’t critically acclaim us
Ain't nothing to be ashamed of
We gave it up for the Savior

I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that
And the Lord’s goodness
You should-you should taste that
And you ain't living until you're living for his name
Yeah, Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that",https://genius.com/Lecrae-chase-that-ambition-lyrics
God is Enough,Rehab,2010.0,"(We so impressed)
With them ladies
Who be drivin' Mercedes
Who be drivin' them crazy
And we gotta be crazy
(We so impressed)
With them fellas
Who be makin' them jealous
Who be makin' them stellas
And we gotta be crazy
(I'm so impressed)
King who on the throne
Who left his heavenly home
Never did a thing wrong
They crucified him on
A tree,
 there he made
It was crazy how it set the stage
For his resurrection from the grave
That gets me amazed
(You can be) the flyest man
(With a) hundred grand in your hand
Swag right, sag tight
And a Gucci fan
(You can) be the richest, be the smartest, be the hardest, all of that
But I guarantee before I die they all are fallin' flat

Used to want a lotta things
All the stuff that's on TV
Education, cars, and clothes
Fashion lights and jewelry
(Focused on the wrong stuff)
Now I got my eyes on you
And now I know that
God is enough-nough
God is enough-nough
God is enough-nough
You are enough-nough
Never too much-uch
More than enough-nough
God is enough-nough
You are enough for me

Party like the fast life
, hurry this the last flight
Chasin' all your dreams, this right here could be your last night
And man you finally got your cash right
But it never seems to last right
You know you sick of lookin', you sick of chasin'
I think you know the truth, you just don't wanna face it
Your life is empty, though you havin' fun
You never satisfied, you never get enough
You go from thrill-seekin' to pill-poppin'
From heavy drinkin' to club-hoppin'
You just can't stop it, like you're a slave
And you chasin' nothin' all the way into the grave

Used to want a lotta things
All the stuff that's on TV
Education, cars, and clothes
Fashion lights and jewelry

You are enough for me

Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want
Takes away my fears, you restore my soul
Off into the sky, the dead in Christ arise
To be with you forever, see with the clearest eyes
Quench my inner thirst, there's something more in life
No money, cars, relationships compare to joy in Christ
Love that falls from selfish ones that like to flirt with self-destruct
No need to stut, know what I want, to keep it, but my God's enough

Used to want a lotta things
All the stuff that's on TV
Education, cars, and clothes
Fashion lights and jewelry
(Focused on the wrong stuff)
Now I got my eyes on you
And now I know that
God is enough-nough

Yea
I make this spazz
G-G-G-Good work, Charlie, hahahaha
Spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz
I make this spazz
Spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz

I make this spazz on 'em, knowing that they don’t know me
I may call up homies, 40 deep that's how we rollin'
We pull up on your block and we ain’t got no Glock 40's
No Nina millimeter, hope you never have to meet her
Put a quarter in the meter, this one right here’s a heater
Tryin’ to get off in my zone, watch me hit these wide receivers
If you ain’t a believer, I’m looking for conversion
My 16 is a sermon, get you hands up in this service
I know to bring that realness, so hard I got to kill this
They’re selling me, I’m sick, I already know I’ve got that illness
That 808 up heavy, my adrenaline got me sweaty
I don’t think these people ready, I’ma spazz if they let me
And someone come and get me, cause if they get me started
I’m Leo DiCaprio, I’m gone, departed
This ain't for the faint of heart, it may be for the heartless
The way I eat this beat, you'd think I was a starving artist

Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz

Boy, it’s hard to hold this back, it’s hard to keep this in
This spazzing feel so right, not to do it is a sin
Nah, I ain’t got to be wildin' and I ain’t got to be jumpin’
But you feel them walls humming, that's my people coming
Now they ain’t smoking that good, ain't finna do nothing bad
But they on that Jesus juice so they probably gonna spazz
Hollin
' 116, see it tatted on they wrist
Cause they ain’t ashamed of nothing mane they get it how they live
The 
old us is dead, the new us so legit
Got us spazzin' in the game, cause we know we about to win
And then I never said I was hot, but if fires in my bones
Got me sweatin’ in the winter, got me hotter than a stove
They probably think I done lost it, they probably thinkin' I'm gone
But truth be told I done found it, I'm Gucci, I'm gold
I’m better than I ever been that truth that hit me settled in
I’m spazzin' on these people they don’t want it, but they getting it!

Indwelling Sin,Rebel,2008,"Aye look what's good man it's me again
The one you used to call your friend
I know you ain't forgot me?
Oh yeah, you always get me caught in sin
Here you go with that again
You act like we ain't cool or something
Lets go smoke a Kool or something
Talk and sip a brew or something

Nah man I ain't trusting you
Ain't nothing but lust in you
Thanks be to God I obeyed the teaching I was entrusted to
Cause when you pass by you just want your boy to backslide
Have me feeling sick like I'm coming down off a crack high

Man that's a flat lie
You act like I'm the bad guy
You know when me and you get together we have a grand time
Lets take it back, all the way to like the 6th grade
Last thing on your mind back in the day was trying to live saved
Remember house parties, kissing in the dark?
Man that was innocent fun come on-

Now don't start
See dog I live by the Spirit so I don't gratify
All them old sinful desires that never satsify

Aye come on kill that
Look me in my face and tell me I'm a lie
You ain't feeling chasing women, getting drunk, and getting high
Stacking money, staying fly, living up the playas life
We was having fun now you gon' try to be religious

Ayo man first of all lower your voice
Who you talkin' to?
Handcuffed in August '02 I got caught with you
Truck flipped over on 35 that was all from you
I'll mess around and lose my life, man tryna walk in you
I'm standing on these stages and got these people believing me
What I look like trying to gratify this disease in me

So now I'm a disease? Man please, I got yo back dog
I ain't saying drop the Jesus and be a rap star
All Im saying is when it's you and me lets be real folk
We ain't gotta be selling drugs and tryna kill folk
Maybe just a lil-

What? A lil this, a lil that
A lil BET late at night, that's like a lil crack
See you ain't gone lie to me, I see how you be tryna be
BET tonight becomes addiction to pornography
That's in no way honoring the God who's ruling sovereignly

Man you know you miss them old days

Yeah you right possibly
But after that I sober up, think of Jesus holding up
His skin up on the cross for all them drunken nights I'm throwing up
Every thought of blowin' up is captured in his flowing blood
I start thinking Philippians 4:8 and then you showing up

You know I ain't gon' quit right?

Yeah I know but I'm dead to you
And one day I'll be present with Jesus who died and bled from you
Colossians 1:15 thats the God that I trust in

Rise,Church Clothes,2012.0,"I know it’s difficult but...
You know, the odds really are in our favor, man

Things just ain’t the same for gangsters
The whole world's changed, everybody’s a stranger
These young dudes running around, saying they're bangers
Click their little bangers, they click and bang ya
And I done seen too many teens chasing a dream
End up blood stream contaminated and fiending
And now they leaning on words that he said or she said, we said
Look at him, he dead
See, we ain’t never know Martin Luther the King
Most of us probably couldn’t tell you much about a dream
We like Malcolm X, cause Spike made the movie
And we saw him strapped up with the AKs and Uzis
So excuse me, I'm trying to connect to you, a whole generation is raised by gangsters
Who probably never knew pops, we had 2Pac
An old boom box, chilling in our tube socks
And plus Dre taught us how to roll a 64
And Snoop Dogg taught us how to roll a sticky dro
So if they wanna reach us with Jesus
They gotta do better than some screaming preachers
Cause homie, we don’t believe ya
We’ve seen grandmas ride by these cold thieves with heaters
So we skeptical, it’s easier to believe that there is a heaven for a thug then to mess with you
It’s hard to rise

Hey, shout out to 9th Wonder
No you ain't gotta ask
We both on the same page like a paragraph
And our music ain't the target of discussion
But it seems the radio has got a problem playing substance
Listen partner, they lying to us
They selling pies to us
They teach us how to be gangbangers and nine shooters
I been where you been, seen what you seen
Grew up with Old Dog looking mean on the screen
When Nas was street dreaming
 
and Biggie was still breathing
And cash ruled everything around me, creaming
Folks trying to make the hood life the good life
While they in the burbs wishing us a good night
And some rappers teach us how chin-check them
But I still haven’t heard a song about being movie directors
We in your hood, man, we’ve been where you’ve been
Been stabbed, been shot, been pinned in the pen
Difference now is when we pick up the pen
We articulate about how God has made us all better men
I’m a college graduate,
 got some God fearing role models
With daughters who do not aspire to be pole models
You are not what the media impose on you
God made you and He rose for you
So you rise!",https://genius.com/Lecrae-rise-lyrics
Gotta Know,Rehab,2010.0,"(You just gotta know)
You ever feel like life just comin’ at ya a million miles an hour?
(You just gotta know)
You just gotta know
Somebody’s holdin’ it all together

Life is like an elevator, a lot of ups and downs
People pushin’ your buttons and gettin’ jerked around
I used to lurk around town tryin’ to work around
Workin’ so that I could hit the ground with the perfect sound
Even perfect sound sounds like work
When you spend your time flirtin’ with the crown in the perp
I was bound for Berzerk with a layover in Crazy
A lazy Jay-Z hopin’ rock-a-fellas paid me
Or rockin’ ladies were caught me a Mercedes
But that whole dream was in ‘80′s baby
Missed that shot like the cop that’s crooked
TV goes off, third eye still lookin’
Mom still cookin’, I can always go home
Even though I’m five years past grown (five years past grown)
Here I go again, I’m still chasin’ the wind, I can’t win
When it gets hot, it boils down to sin
If Heaven ain’t a gift, then I ain’t getting’ in (man)

I can’t even find the words for the way I feel
So I paint a picture, I paint a picture
I’ve been goin’ down this road, seen some crazy things
So I paint a picture, you gots to see it
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know

(Yeah) I sit and hear the guitars play
Wonder if they could, what would stars say or Venus and Mars say
Or say that we want it our way
Stars so desperate to shine that they go on livin’ the hard way
The intellect to travel to Mars but so blind
We worship Venus but she don’t even know who we are
And she never cared why, cuz she wasn’t there
When I was tryin’ to drown my sorrows in a pool of despair
I ain’t perfect, sometimes I feel worthless
Worth less than that is the image that I’da purchased
Man, from the shades to the shirt to the shoes
Just another fool tryin’ to cover he’s confused, that ain’t cool
Sometimes I hate the man in the mirror
Cuz I know he’s a liar and a cheater and a killer
People say they love him but they love what he can give ‘em
But deep inside he knows that there’s a reason for him livin’

I can’t even find the words for the way I feel
So I paint a picture, I paint a picture
I’ve been goin’ down this road, seen some crazy things
So I paint a picture, you gots to see it
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know

(Uh) You know I need you like aqua
Day without ya got me so nauseous
If I ain’t cautious, I’m gonna self-inflict my sickness
You know it’s true, you as my witness
At how you witness my inconsistence
Yes, the ovation when I need your assistance
And I just gotta know that even though I’m a misfit
I’m still worth more than calamity’s French kiss
Yes I’m loved, and I’m pursued
And though I can’t feel it, still I know that it’s true
Somebody woke me up, and yeah, I know it was you
And yet I keep tryin’ to steer clear of your view
Cuz if you get me, I know that you got me
But I’m so insecure I can’t believe that you want me
But then I heard you went out of your way to adopt me
Well you can have my all if you swear you won’t drop me
Cuz I gotta know (yeah)

But I won't be a slave to acceptance
I got my co-sign from the master, so Maranatha

Nah, I'm sure that they'll reject it, but that's what they supposed to do

My snap back fitted, the choir robe didn't
And I don't play church, partna, this is what I'm living
Hey Bun call from Texas, told me ""Crae, I get it
You are no impostor, you spit it how you live it""
Them inmates tellin me keep spittin 'n don't quit it
Cause when that music play they ain't worried about the sentence

So tell Sing Sing, the king is coming back to get 'em
I'm so reckless with my message I don't care tho
Call me a weirdo, but I'm an heir though
And if I say it, then I mean what I say
Boy I live for the truth and I die for The Way
And when that inspiration hit me I write it, while try to fight it
If I'm thinking too hard, don't try it, they'll never buy it
And if they don't buy it, they don't buy it, okay, I get it
They want inherited wealth, so I'm giving them the business
You are not your momma, your daddy, whatever happened
You are not the product of all of your life's misshappnins
That is just a lie that you tell yourself when it's tragic
But I believe in miracles, I don't believe in magic
Made in His image, most of y'all don't hear me
Looking for identity in the things that you givin
The gift, not the giver mayne it's cold in the winter
When you base your life's existence on looking like you's a winner
That S class Mercedes, Bugatti, and that Bentley
Won't fit up in my coffin when I die, can't take em with me
But still I let em tempt me, they show me what I'm worth
But none of then can solve my problems or my hurt
Reject me

This is not the first time I'm far from just gettin my feet wet
And this is won't be the last time
I tell the world about your love and they tell me I'm a reject
Yeah, they look at me like a reject
Go and treat me like a reject

Say all I wanna be is a reject",https://genius.com/Lecrae-rejects-lyrics

You lost in your low so you're high everyday
And everything you crave only makes you a slave
And Christ is the only way you ever gonna 'scape
If it's one hitta, quitta, get it
In your mind that your time's gon' pass
And if you gon' get it, spit it, lick it
You got one life and it ain't gon' last
You ain't stimulated, you manipulated by a hater
And he hate it when you rehabilitated
If smoke is the evidence, you takin' His benevolent gift
And telling him split while you're in hell in yo hit , so get up

Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low
Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know
That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try
I know your lighters up but I'mma blow your high (Eyyy!)
I'mma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'mma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive

Wait a minute ya'll
Let me take it down a river while they rolling down the hedonism boulevard
Anything that got em' feeling, maybe money or the Lamborghini in the magazine about the sports car
Everybody wanting satisfaction
But there's no regard for The One who has it
And everybody wantin' grabbin'
But you gotta get it from above where they stash it
You can try to get high
You can feel alive
But the reality, your soul dry
You gotta find anybody with a better high
You ain't fillin' half of the $20 bag full of weed that provides it
Gotta make a U-turn cause if you turn
You can see The One who turns
But if we never make that turn
You will never be content with the high you've earned
You will never be happy
Running with the love of kush
For the love of kush, I promise
You can either be a slave to an object
Or rather be a slave to the God who's honest
They ain't never seen a high like I got
But they fallin' in the puddle like a raindrop
Steady running from the top of the balcony
Looking over the Hollywood valleys falling from the rooftop

Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low
Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know
That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try
I know your lighters up but I'mma blow your high (Eyyy!)
I'mma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'mma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive

The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
Who by the unrighteousness suppress the truth
For although they knew God, they did not honor Him or give thanks to Him
They became futal in their thinking
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie
And worshipped and served the creature instead of the Creator who is blessed Forever
Amen",https://genius.com/Lecrae-blow-your-high-lyrics
Cold World,Church Clothes,2012.0,"Gunnin', gunnin', gunnin'
Everybody want something for their nothing

We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world

These folks is killin' for less money than they can borrow
Create annual sorrow for families left feeling hollow
Then the son of a gun victim flushin' out his anger
Colorin' cartoons of strangers who getting strangled
And a daughter let a stranger, the school call him a counselor
Do some dirty things, but he promise that he will counsel her
Baby momma can't identify the man that killed him
It's the same low down dealer that she always get her pills from
And the son is gettin' older, streets is makin' him colder
But his momma's out cold, 'cause she ain't never quite sober
His sister fifteen, but you probably think that she grown up
'Cause she was with some men, acting way too grown up
And don't nobody care though, the schools ain't teaching
McDonald's selling poison, got people workin' for cheap and
The military, drugs, or prison the only way to eat, man
It's cold in the streets, let the track bring the heat in

We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world

This world's cold like no clothes and snow blowin'
Like when the devil take the breath out of a baby's nose
And the people won't hear more metaphors and word-play
My sister's sick of strippin', she need hope up in my words, mayne
She pull up to the mall and she valet her lil' Mercedes
Wishin' she had some romance, healthy family, couple babies
And the gentleman she love, he already got a wife
So she's acceptin' her plight, she's the lady of the night
And she saw him in the park with his daughter, they holdin' hands
Arm around his woman's shoulder, he ain't give her not a glance
She accepts her sad reality, she doesn't stand a chance
One woman gets the man, the other woman gets the dance
It's a cold world, real cold world
Jermaine called that thing, man, where is we gon' turn?
A lot of people thinkin' I'm on an hopeless endeavor, nah
I know Someone who can change the weather forever, ever

We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world

Tell 'em bring their guns out
Send my city up in flames
And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
But my hope still remains
Whether dead or alive, this is do or die
When Christ is the gain
So raise your torches up high
Tonight we fight for our King

I was Tailored to snatch the mic' Swiftly like Ye' did
And lay it down for the king like a sleigh bed
And they can kill us now, go get the yellow tape
Hey put me 6 feet in the ground and watch a great escape
I promise, ain't a 6 shooter that can keep me down
My God's so official, that's a technical foul
Was engineered in my mother's womb for Gods' glory
Plenty faith in the persecution is inventory
I been spit in the face, still exhibiting grace
Kicked out many a place, just for sharing my faith
My belt tight, shoes laced, plus a breastplate
My war helmet on now I got my head straight
The battle's on but the war is over when Jesus reigns
And fo' His name I withstand the pressure and take the pain
And if they drop us, this promise, we'll take it to the grave
That tonight we may die, but to die is our gain!

Tell 'em bring their guns out
Send my city up in flames
And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
But my hope still remains
Whether dead or alive, this is do or die
When Christ is the gain
So raise your torches up high
Tonight we fight for our King


Bout to be a riot, guns and fire, Somebody's dyin'
But it won't be us, covered in His blood, spillin' our guts
But even if it was, let our dust blow in the wind, we win when it's done
Christ puttin' out thunder-raps with the nuns
So I am taking no prisoners, not-a-one
None, and no I'm not The One
I just run solar in the power of The Son
My God's a m-m-monsta
Treads on Black mambas defeats and conquers

Tell 'em bring their guns out
Send my city up in flames
And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
But my hope still remains
Whether dead or alive, this is do or die
When Christ is the gain
So raise your torches up high
Tonight we fight for our King

Yeah, 
ready to die, notorious
 for our martyrs man
We die daily and wake up and do it all again
Either we certain or we certainly insane
Bullets riddlin' our frame, still we don't deny the Name
Maybe we lost it, we vuelvo loco
Cause Heaven is my home homie I ain't local
I'm so vocal
Chords of a chorus say we tied to the Lord like cords
Of course
Hey what a course, if I get to goin' in
I'm going off like ""kill me"" I'm still goin' in
God, by all means possible
Give me the faith to live and die for the gospel

Tell 'em bring their guns out
Send my city up in flames
And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
But my hope still remains
Whether dead or alive, this is do or die

But them stems still peak up under the concrete yeah
Bleak is around looking life but them never seen a flower
Grow under the moonlight
Mama had me readin Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice
I was looking for identity they stole mine twice
So I turn to the rude boy gangsters first
But the bad man withers and returns to the earth
Now it's ashes to ashes dirt to dirt
A black rose without a chance to grasp her worth

There's blood up on them ceilings why there's pan di floor
No one to keep and care us our fathers too embarrassed
To show us he's a failure so mama's a single parent
Them children grow without the fertilizer that they needed
And the black rose grows in a garden fulla weeds and needles and evil
But God sent people who reflect the light of the sun they get it done
The rose grows cold wind blows through the streets
And the ice on the leaves so heavy she gets weak
And there's not a helping hand upon the scene to be seen
And when all seems lost the Gardener intervenes
He handles her with care
And he show her she a queen
And then thorns are a defense mechanism she'll never need

All I need is a second, yeah
Gimme a second, uh

Aye, listen, Cole talk that college talk, Wayne talks gangs
Jay be talkin' money, man, and 'Ye talk fame
And people say I talk about the same ol' thing
Reason that I sound the same 'cause the Truth don't change
Look, people get it twisted like a lemon in a spirit
If I ain't talkin' killin', I must be talkin' 'bout healin'
And I ain't talking 'bout how Jesus gon' make me a million
With my hands to the ceilin', I got that spiritual feelin'
Head bowed down, knees to the floor
You a Christian and you rap? That must be the way you flow—no
I talk reality like momma on her death bed
The birth of a child, a soldier losin' his left leg
Who gon' write songs to give him hope in his chair?
Addicted to pain killers, wife left last year
Your favorite rapper was prolly tryna make his next hit
Talkin' look at what I got, who I shot, and who I tipped
Couldn't be more common if them boys made sense
Couldn't be more common if Serena was they chick
And this is not a diss, this how reality sound
Let it off my mind, this how my mentality sound
Yeah!

Everything I do, I do it for you
I don't want a single thing, I don't want a single thing
Ain't got no kind of angle, I ain't tryna play
You ain't gotta know my name, you ain't gotta know my name
But in my short time on this Earth
I done died, been rebirthed and I know this sounds strange to you
So give me a lil' time, let me spit a couple lines and I promise—
It might just change you too, change you too

I sound like the mad rapper 'cause I'm crazy
The radio be like, ""We love you,"" but they never play me
And I be doin' shows like, ""You ain't even gotta pay me""
I just wanna spread the same message that done saved me
You see, I prolly grew up just like you
Tellin' my heroes, ""Man, I wanna be just like you""
I got in trouble, went to court
Judge showed me couple inmates and he told me, ""Man, they started off just like you""
I never rolled around strapped, I was busy chasin' girls and money
I played ball and smoked weed, thought the world was funny
I went to church a few times, with my head on a swivel
And I was lookin' for the bad ones that sat in the middle
I couldn't remember a sermon, I never caught the Spirit
And if Christians was tryna rap, man, I'm not tryna hear it
I never would've imagined that I'd be rhymin'
About the same God that I couldn't confide in
Never planned to get married, raise a family, help kids grow up
Visit people in prison, I was busy tryna blow up
But see, now I'm unimpressed with the way these folks dress
Or the engine in they trunk, all I want is soul rest
And I'm so blessed, look at what He did to me
How could I keep this to myself? Somebody bled for me
Nah, you just gon' have to hate this
'Cause God's the only reason that I'm able to say this
So play this

Everything I do, I do it for you
I don't want a single thing, I don't want a single thing
Ain't got no kind of angle, I ain't tryna play
You ain't gotta know my name, you ain't gotta know my name

I hear em talkin' to me tryin' to keep my head right
Red light, hit the brakes before I hit the headlights
A fifth of liquor got me feelin' like the man, right
I'm out here running through the streets, cold feet
And I can hear the voices callin' me and sayin' we should meet
Be discreet, but my inheritance, too arrogant
I guess I should be meek
Verily, verily I tell you the truth
Boy the money make you feel like you the realest one to do it
Them dollas showin signs of my sickness, God is my witness
Turn a sucka to a star, misery to a mistress, Lord
Our Father, hallowed by thy name, keep me from lovin' fame
Actin' thirsty like a lame, trying to change before the change change me
In the Range tryin' to tell myself that I'm the same me
Blame me, not the money

Yea, though I walk through the valley, Lord be with me
I'm the streets and the game gettin' at me
So please don't leave me
Tryin' to stay prayed up, still feel hundred
Goin' to live right, but I'm still chasin' money
If temptation didn't feel so good, I would never have a problem

Lord be with me

But I know some Ashley's and Madison's
I met a few in Texas, met a few in Cali

I coulda made some choices that'd hurt my family
The grace of God kept me outta death valley

See these people cryin', pacify 'em with some pretty clothes
Zero comma zero zero comma zero comma comma
Sign that dotted line and you'll be rich (just give me your soul)
No, no, no don't do it though I'm feelin' kinda foolish
Just another lamb walkin' to the slaughter
Sittin' in a Lamb' with somebody daughter
Boy ya better cool it, hey skip that new addition
I been on a mission, see that devil fishin'
If he baitin' I ain't bitin' I ain't hookin' on his pimpin'
Stay with me Lord


Please stand by your word and don't forget me

I’m a Saint,Rebel,2008.0,"Kadosh—Old Testament
Hagios—New Testament
Inherently, the Word means to holy, we know in not holy in our own terms, but Christ Who loved makes us holy. So because we satisfied the wrath of God, the beef has been crushed, now we got a new identity, called a saint

Yup!
Hey, hey
Used to be where I could only trust me and myself
And in that heavy metal Devil that would send me straight to Hell wit' it
Thought it was no helping it
Selfishness was celibate
I'd sell a bit, but I'd make sure I don't sit up in that cell a bit
Yell a bit only when hurt came for certain
Illiterate, ain't know that the Word came
Then that Word hit me and unblinded me
Jesus paid a price for me
That's how I gained the right to be the son of God I'd like to be
Changed my heart, gave me a desire for His work, man
Kill me if you want, but I'm gon' get back out that dirt, man
Not yet what I'm gonna be, but not what I used to be
I bless His name forever Who would chose me and start using me
Used to love my sinning full of greed, full of hate
I might say that I loved Jesus but that talk was really fake
I'd be lusting for ya cousin if it wasn't for His Grace
Yeah, he took me outta nothing and He made ya boy a saint

Yeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't

I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)

You got to understand Jesus agreed back in eternity
To sign a bloody covenant and take a deadly turn for me
He ain't just agreed, fulfilled it to the death of Him
Took that bloody cup that's meant for us straight to the neck and yeah
Swallowed all that bitterness, pain, and affliction
Ain't a soul in Hell with pain comparable to this one
Brought me to repentance, homie, I'm blood purchased
Daily I'm conformed to His holiness so I worship
Jesus finished the work, He resurrected on high
That means that He beat death, and best believe so will I
See some believe they can fly, but I believe I can die
Resurrect, leave the Earth, and live forever with God
He will march through the sky while the stars sing His praises
Planets dance around while the universe is amazed and
Me I get to gaze upon His beauty for days, man
If I could be anything, baby, I'd be a saint

Yeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't

1 Corinthians Chapter 1, Paul calls one of the worst churches in the New Testament saints. Not because of man's choosing, but clearly becuase of God's choosing through the Lord, Jesus Christ

Now, now you might think I'm crazy like some kinda urban misfit
But first I hated church, I'd only pray to get my wish list
I'd be just like you, ""doin'-my-dance-up-in-the- club"" folk
I promise I ain't choose it, I was chosen to loved on
Eyes low, blowin' dro, that's the life I used to know
But Jesus chopped me up and slowed me down just like that Houston flow
A dead man 'til somebody hit me with the hardest facts
The Gospel hit my heart, I guess that's what you call a heart attack
I'm looking at Ephesians 2 like, ""What did Jesus see in you?""
It's nothin' by His grace He chose to love on folk like me and you
And I don't understand it, homie, I never planned it
I was chasing money and fast women and, man, then
I met the great I am, Son of Man or the Lamb
Snatched ya boy up outta Hell and got me workin' for His plans
Used think I was the man 'til I met Him
All that arrogance and pride, I dead 'em and fo'get 'em, I'm a saint

Children of the Light,Rehab,2010.0,"We are children of the light
Royal rulers of the day
Saints, no prisoners of the night
Trust and love will lead the way
We are free

Yeah, I notice when people notice me
My exterior's the only way they know it’s me
I’m full of holes and scars, my skin’s marked up
But qualified to light up a world of darkness
A day walker, I love walkin’ in the sunlight
I look dirty but I’ve been cleaned on the inside
It’s revolutionary, he’s coming now for fellas and they can look at us strange
But ain’t nothing that they can tell us, cause


Yeah, I’m free to rock this mic to walk right in a dark night lighted by the sun (we are free)
I’m so free that I can fly while ya’ll can’t even crawl into a ball of freedom
In my life I count the cost I take lost accused of treason
And I could die for this cause and you might just be the reason
And in order to if I must die it’s denial of self
And if you claim to be the way that means there ain’t no one else
I trust it, done, there ain’t no room for discussion
So if you just don’t get it then let the just come with it
I know that much more is required of all that I’ve been given
But if ya’ll claim to be alive then you gotta start livin
You know why


And him the only one to take me out of Babylon
And him create me right and wrong
And him create me script and song
And that’s why we stand firm upon the rock on which salvation, man
And so we love the prospect and hope to put our helmet on
And that is why we build upon for each and every chosen one
Respectful to the elder-men who give guidance and correction
So don’t you quench the Spirit man

Tryna get lil' momma in the car-ar-ar
I heard a gun pop like ""pa-pa-pa,""
Someone hit us with a choppa like ""ra-ta-ta""
An average night for a couple of no goods
Up in college but yet we still actin' so hood
Never makin' it to church, man we drinkin' till it hurts
If we could do it tomorrow yeah we sure would
When you're sittin' in your room and you're feelin' like a fool
Cause you got a couple STDs
See your partners on the news cause he thought that he was cool
Now they 'bout to put him six feet deep
When I'm really at my lowest and I'm feelin' kinda hopeless
Everybody gotta hate on me
Shame on me cause the blame's on me
But hallelujah the Lord showed his grace on me
He saved me, was on my way to hell with a full tank
I don't care what them boys think
Cause what I'm on is a sure thing
Stackin' they money up like it's Legos
Tienes hambre para all of the pesos
They'll never be satisfied, man I tried, it's a lie
The only hope you got is turning to Jesús
I'm not here to impress, I'm here to impact
I won't settle for less, got my cross on my back
I was out my mind, my head was screwed up
But Jesus saved me, hallelujah!

Turn up my level, still a Rebel, screaming hallelujah!
Me and my partners on your block, we holla hallelujah!
Was out my mind, my head was screwed up
But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!!
Hey what you say? Hallelujah!!
Hey what you say? Hallelujah!!
Hey what you say? Hallelujah!!
Hey what you say? Hallelujah!!
My soul was empty, my life was foolish
But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!!

Follow me, follow me, I'm a phenomenon
Not because of what I do or the music I'm on
Smokin' with shooters and gettin' caught up in too much
I found the Lord was the truest and now I follow the Son
Enemy of the King like Sauron, he shoulda smashed ya boy, I was a moron
Runnin' from the truth, full of 40 Proof
Half-naked looks, lies that I only wanted more of
Knew in my heart I was opposed to you
Knew I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do
Made in your image but I was more like a menace
And by your grace I repented and now I'm close to you
I tell the world but when I tell 'em they don't listen
""How you rappin' but you Christian?"" They don't get it so they diss it
But they shot Pac and they popped Biggie
I pray my killer gets saved when he done with me
First put me on a plane, headed to the rap game
Let me tell the whole world how the Lord did it
Go and put me in line with all the worst sinners
Only difference is I'm tall and a little thinner
But if you ask who's forgiven, see my hand hit the ceiling
I been changed like weather after a cold winter
They can say what they wanna, I ain't scared of these people
Lord is my shepherd, I fear no evil
My soul was empty, my life was foolish
But Jesus saved me, hallelujah!

Turn up my level, still a Rebel, screaming hallelujah!
Me and my partners on your block, we holla hallelujah!
Was out my mind, my head was screwed up

Bun B Speaks,Church Clothes 2,2013.0,"Yo, Lecrae, what's up?
It's the OG Bun B
You know everything you see should always be about the truth, man
I've always told people, man, don't fake, you know, who you are or try to create a character because everything comes to the light
So just be who you are, be true to yourself
If they see your true struggle people will relate to you
And that's what I got to say to you, man
Just be true to who you are, people will recognize your struggle, and they'll walk with you as you walk your walk, know what I'm saying?",https://genius.com/Lecrae-bun-b-speaks-lyrics

Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, I–I–I wake up, I–I tha-thank the Lord, tha-thank the Lord for shalo–shalom

Aye, I wake up before I throw a beater on
I thank the Lord for peace or you can say shalom
I’m on and I’m gone, out the door, I’m gon’ rep my home
New Jerusalem, yeah, you know where we belong
Got the Word in my heart, when the day start then the darkness wanna get us sparked up
So I keep a guard up, 'cause sin in me wanna get the best of me and have me all scarred up
And I know I’m marked up by the Spirit Who's still in me, fillin' me up with everything I need (okay)
Yeah, they got that cheese, but I don’t need a piece, I just need peace, please
This life ain’t easy, matter fact it's opposite
And I got the test results (what), I’m very positive (okay)
That’s why I’m on this track with PRo because I’m 'posed to give Some potent portions of potion proportionate to poster kids
Of pain and sufferin' whose daddys never loved on them
And wouldn’t know the peace of God if it was placed in from of them
And I was one of them, I don’t take my life for granted
So I'ma use this day tryna share my faith and pray that seeds are planted

I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, I–I–I wake up, I–I tha-thank the Lord, tha-thank the Lord for shalo–shalom

Yeah! Uh!
Early in the mornin', A.M., you know that I thank Him
’Cause He still call me clean regardless of the mess I lay in
My vision on the throne, clearer than Patrón, yes sir, I am gone
In my zone, thinking ’bout the way my Father put me on
It’s nothing but grace how He still give me faith and He died for the ultimate villain
I still disobey, but regardless, I’m chained when I should have been dead, but I’m livin'
See I know when I’m wrong He won’t leave me alone that’s the beauty of God and His mercy
So I’m singing this song about Him on the cross and my heart was the item of purchase
Why live on props? So worthless
Say they wrestle and fight, but I merk it
Whether live or die, I'm dedicated to Christ, yes sir, I'ma stand on my purpose
Put my faith in Him 'cause He perfect, insurance like Geico
'Cause if I do not have His love I’m Norman Bates, psycho
I go hard, I still rebel with Lecrae
Give my whole life for the King, don’t Trip, just let Him Invade
I Sho Baraka Obama this peace is more than just worth it
So call Tedashii, tell him Identity Crisis averted, hey!

I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, I–I–I wake up, I–I tha-thank the Lord, tha-thank the Lord for shalo-shalom

Aye, aye, 24/7 all the time, yeah, I’m on my grind
Dyin’ everyday, I’m tryin’ rhyme, hope to save they lives
Peace – what I got, I feel released from the knots
Sin bound me in, but Jesus had the keys to the locks
This life is boot camp, yeah, I know the drill, flesh kill
But His will, it's with His peace that I’m filled and it’s real (aye)
Earth is not my home while I roam in Rome
Got the Lord up on my dome, restin’ in that new shalom
See it goes C-H-R-I-S-T, G-O-D, His spirit inside of me
And without His L-O-V-E I’m another lost soul, so obviously
When I drink the Livin’ Water that’s nothing more than a product of the grace through faith that I found in Him
The love He gives could accursed of sin
Why should I ever give in?
So chase that money, get your wrist cold as refrigerators
I will be an outcast ’til He raise me up, elevators
Me and you (y'all)
Yo momma, yo cousin, my brother, pray we never sell our soul for a chance to be stuntin’
’Cause everything that’s good in me, the Lord, He done it, run it!

I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on

I seen it with my own two
There's no way I can show you
A perfectly poverty stricken people with no view
And I bet you can't believe this
They never heard of Jesus
Heard of Young Buck, Lil' Wayne, and Young Jeezy
No one's signing up to go on missions this summer
Rather sit at home and watch X-zibit pimpin' a Hummer
While a nine year old is shot down
No one's screaming 'stop now!'
No bridge illustrations for criminals who on lock down
People deep in Africa
Looking for an answer bruh'
In China man
They're dying man
Until they know who died for sins
So look what grace did
Not for us to stay hid
Inside our comfort zones
At home in mama's basement
Get out on the grind y'all
Ain't no better time dawg
I know y'all read the Great Commission
Let me just remind y'all:
Make disciples of the nations
Teach 'em to obey the Lord
Hate to never lead someone to Christ before? Raise the sword!

Hey! After 1,000 years in the West and the church is
Get'n bigger daily
Without understand'n worship. (say what?)
Some regenerated but a lot ain't saved
You walk outside and be surprised 'cause the block ain't changed
And the numbers they be get'n me
Something just ain't hit'n them
America ain't Christian they just practice'n the ritual
That's why we should be missional
Hey, what you think I'm spit'n for?
United States is dyin'
And the East is looking pitiful
Some places if they catch you
They'll arrest you and
They'll serve you
But they still need the Word too
The Gospel should be heard too
We claim we ain't ashamed
But we still ain't hit the block up
We in our Christian bubble
While our brotha's get'n locked up
Lord I wanna stock up
Pack a bag and walk up
In a country where sharin' my
Faith may get me shot up
Anywhere I go, whether my city, Lord, or far abroad
I just wanna show' em Jesus Christ the risen, holy God

I know they're dyin' in the streets over in the Middle East
Some kids seekin' peace
Others hold'n up a piece
If the violence doesn't cease
Then at least the deceased
Might know Jesus as their Savior as their bodies hit the streets
And I know this is a graphic view
I pray that it's attack'n you
Attractin' you to act and do
What you see in the back illusion
Matthew twenty-four and fourteen
We should read it twice
Before we think that life is just a battle
See we free in Christ!
Look dawg! Life is more than church work and football!
What if you were dead and seen that Christians overlooked y'all!
This is why we leave the couch
And leave the comforts of our house
To show a dyin' world a God they'll probably never read about

The great commission says make disciples of all nations
Have we even made them in our own nation?
Come on Christians!
Missions exist because worship doesn't
People don't worship the god that made them
We're ambassadors

Hopeless!
I can spell it
I can smell it in the air
Lotta people wonder if you still care
And are you still there
Cuz I dun lost it all
I keep calling your name
But do you hear my call
And are you still involved
Or am I left alone
I wander the streets
Cuz I no longer have a home
My brothers all GONE
My sisters all GONE
My families and my friends ain't gonna be here in the Mornin
Ya see me hear mourning
They say you feel my pain
They say you went through it
Say to die is to gain
But I ain't gain nothing
I lost everybody
Now Im losing my mind
And my faith is all Im counting
Im still holding on
Thats why Im still pray
Feelin empty inside
I can't make it through today
I dont know what else to do
I dont know what else to say
Im talking to ya now
But I promise you feel so far


Dear hope: Been waitin on ya for a while now
Been cut so deep that I ain't sure if I can smile now
Look at this devastation
Look at the pain and sorrow
Somebody fed me lies and promised me a bright tomorrow
I know the God I follow
Is bigger than disaster
Big enough to handle
Any evil that harasses us
But I feel like he passed us
Pain overtook us
Buildings tumble over head
As the ground shook us
God have you forsook us
Lord you still with me
I know you save souls
I trust you to forgive me
Relief can you hear me
Hey Rest can you get me
Hey Peace can you see me
Hey love can you heal me
I dont know what to do
I ain't looking for answers
I just need you to hold my hand
Through this cancer
Tell me you never left
Even in the midst of death
Breathe on me I'll do anything to feel your Breath


For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence
For my hope is from him
He only is my rock and my salvation
My fortress; I shall not be shaken
On God rests my salvation and my glory;
My mighty rock, my refuge is God
Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him;
God is a refuge for us

I feel like running in the middle of the campus with the Gammas dropping hammers waving banners saying Jesus saves
Bringing together the bretheren in a circle in a cipher on the corner yelling pass the phrase
Taking heirs of the kingdom to the field of missions so they can spill vision to the children missing
Telling the men in prison about the Peace-Be-Stiller
Mr. Rise & Walk and Mr. Heal Your Vision
Mr. Jesus of Nazareth
Bloodied and beaten and we was the reason for the massacare
For the sin I commit, and even when I slip, His love is there to grab us up, so as for us
We hood just like Cadillacs, and like James in the Cackalacky, do things that will make Him happy, He asks and we do them gladly
He changed us from acting crappy, we came here as Satan's lacky's, but through Christ I call Him Daddy, 
now I'm just a pilgrim passing
I learned that I don't belong, got new game, new life, new song
Don't fit in, theres nothing wrong, anti-culture's what I'm on
Royal Priesthood, a chosen one
Rep Him well until He comes
Proposing to people about the propitiation, pre-paid, when Christ died, and decided it was done
Preaching to the pushed aside prostitute, destitute, working the block, just to feed her son

We don't trap, we ain't strapped, we don't smoke that dro
We ain't pimpin, we ain't trippin, if we 
tippin on some fours
Then you'll probably hear dat Jesus Muzik comin' out our doors (comin' out our doors)
We ain't ashamed
, 
you can call us lame
But everybody gotta die and stand in front of the King

We unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, we unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
We unashamed

Watch this so you can really know what time it is
God is resurrected and I'm here to glorify Him, kid
Ma Jesus, Jesus, ma Jesus might make a great tune
But we gotta lead em dip sets to the weight room
I gotta date soon, but it ain't soon enough
Father keep pruning us, cause its proven we known for screwing up
I can't front cause the pressure is still thick
And when sin look like the pressure, I'm havin to turn quick
A sin sick, so merk it like John Owen
You know when Jesus the Christ you can pay him, but still owe him
We shoulda died and been buried for our wrong actions
Instead Christ died and carried them on his own back (What?)
This is a known fact, but some say that it's fiction
This is our lifestyle, no it's not a religion
See I survived death back in 2002
And religion is not at all what got your boy through
Yea your boy Crayola, I don't do payola
No flows full of baking soda, just Jehovah
I get played to the left more than I get paid to write
So I ain't worried about eating dog, tryin to display the Christ

We unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, we unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
We unashamed

You see me on the block, the ????
We look the same, but we different
We bring God to this thang
While being vocal by the Lord and not a piece or a chain
But don't get it twisted, it's reasons these boys unashamed
How bout 39 lashes of beatings, they laughing and teasing
These blasphemous heathens reject the passion of Jesus
He fasted from speaking even with nails bashed in His feat, and the cross
He gasping and wheezing, His lungs collapse as He's breathing
The chief priest stone in the court of this chief
My Prince of Peace minus the pipe who bought my grief so no more chiefin
But like the rims that hit the curb (curb) we call em shoulder blades
We got our crosses on our back like our shoulder blades
This is death and resurrection that 
turned about my direction
Stepping toward perfection had nothing to do with me (do with me)
But the gospel is the power and power bend men to bow out
We 
poundin' the pavement
 takin the message to the streets

We unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, we unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed

Yeah money, power, possessions

I ain't ashamed

A band of misfits
Who get sick at the
State of the world
So we hit strips and spit
Christ Jesus
Who scooped us out of the dirt
And cleaned us
We were slaves to sinful ways
But Christ freed us
Believe us
Because of the Bible that supersedes us
Not due to intellectual thesis
They say we believe in a fool's faith
Cause kids can grasp it
And salvation's granted
To those who ask it
But even if you don't know
Systematic Theology
Or Eschatology
You know Jesus is Who you ought to seek
We ought to be
Sowing seeds and teaching truth
Discipling groups
Of young soldiers
And reaping fruit
Oh yeah
It's a part of our lifestyle
Might sound good on wax
But we living it right now
I wish you would
Catch me on tapes and CD's
But never see me
In the streets
In 3D

While killers squeeze
Triggers and hammers clap

Cop a dame
Cop 22's on the Range
Want to cop
Big fortune and fame
And they claiming that
They the reason why the cops get trained
Stop the game
I came here to drop a name
Jesus
The same One that blocked the pain
How many thugs you know
Hard enough to stop the flames
It's like
Standing on the tracks
Tryna block a train
Got the game
Messed up
Stop and change
Mind trapped
All wrapped up in locks and chains
The same God you pray to
Before you sleep at night
The same God you disrespect
When you creep at night
Seek the light
Ain't no tryna plead for life
Talking bout
I'm sorry God
He like
Leave my sight
The key to life
Is none other than Jesus Christ
If you a slave to your ways
Be free tonight

Rebel vs. Gravity,UnKnown,2013.0,"This is a duel — a showdown
Mr. Rebel vs. Mr. Gravity
What up Mr. Gravity? I just got some words for you

Dear Mr. Gravity, what up, I see you took off
Now you bigger than ever but to
Me it's like you took off
Clocked out, no longer a witness to the nations
Are you playing the background or really fame chasing
You sold out, used to
Be souled out
Now you just tweeting 'bout how your concert was sold out
Dudes be making songs talking bout that they all worry bout you
I'mma keep it real, my stomach turns at your current route
Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't mean so much to me
Your music changed me, now it's just disgusting me
And I assume it's the fame and the money, power and influence
You just tryna be accepted, headed to your ruin
And me? I'm just doing what you was known for doing
Bringing the truth hard
Hoping that it gets through
Somebody had to say it, might as well be me
And P.S. please don't corrupt KB

Wow, that's how you feel Mr. Rebel?
I mean.. it's all love in grace but let me just talk to you

Ay look, dear Mr. Rebel
Young brother I understand
You feel like I let you
Down, like I'm misguiding all these fans
Truth is I feel arrogant and even self consumed
Explaining my motives to all
Of these people who've assumed
It's not about the money and trust me, I hate fame
Made some interesting moves while playing this chess game
And honestly did change, but never for the change
Maturity's given me liberties that I wouldn't claim
Some of the very things I used to call abomination
Are things I couldn't handle but thank the Lord for His grace
I ask you to be gracious, people ain't always shaky
Some have different convictions and others gon' make mistakes
I'm a little bit of both and I ain't mad or offended
You can forgive much when you understand you forgiven
I done a lot of living, misjudged many people
Quicker to call 'em evil before
I knew 'em as people
I'm less self righteous, not seeker sensitive
The truth is we all deserved to die the way that Jesus did
I don't wanna make every song into a sermon
Go listen to your pastor, that's where you should be learning
I love you, I'm sorry that I'm not the man you think I am
But it was never me anyway, it's the great I Am

Ay man, I still believe everything I wrote on Rebel, you know what I mean?
Me bragging about where I been or what kinda mission trips I'm doing
And who I'm discipling and so on and so forth in every song doesn't make me more holy
And me not talking about it doesn't make me less holy
It's all grace baby, I hope we can have graces with me as the Lord has been gracious to us all
I love you",https://genius.com/Lecrae-rebel-vs-gravity-lyrics
Used To Do It Too,Rehab,2010.0,"Hey, KB, man, you know we don’t brag on our past
We just relate
Some folks think they mistakes
Gonna keep them out the gates
It ain’t about what you do, it’s about what you did
Let’s go!

I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
But I’m changed, now I’m something different (Aye)
I’m changed, I love the way I’m living (Aye)
I’m changed, saved me from my own sin (Aye)
I’m changed, I learned how to live again (Aye)

Ah man you name it bra, I promise I done done it all
So busy doin me that I ain't care at all (I’m changed)
I know I ain't the person that I used to be
I look the same but I promise this a newer me
See what I used to be was selfish and conceited
I was living for myself and telling Jesus he could beat it
At the time I couldn’t see it, all I saw was havin fun
Went to church to look for ladies, not to look upon the Son
I was a hedonist, now Jesus is my pleasure
I was a narcissist but now I’m lookin better
But I ain’t fix myself, ain't turn myself around
I gave it up and told the Lord that he can have it now

I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
But I’m changed, now I’m something different (Aye)
I’m changed, I love the way I’m living (Aye)
I’m changed, saved me from my own sin (Aye)
I’m changed, I learned how to live again (Aye)

I was tryin to figure what's a goon to a goblin
That's nonsense tell me this though what's a goon to the God-Head
I gotta seed sown from the Regal
Then He deboed all my evil and my ego
Now I devote, all of me bro, to the King so
We know that he redeems souls
Got that right homie I'm different
At times I don't be feelin it
Salvation ain't a feelin lil homie it's a positionin
Great sinners sin is great but the Great Savior is omnipotent
And you quit dissin Him you ain't got no sins that He can't forgive

I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
But I’m changed, now I’m something different (Aye)
I’m changed, I love the way I’m living (Aye)
I’m changed, saved me from my own sin (Aye)
I’m changed, I learned how to live again (Aye)

You see Satan uses guilt to strip away our hope
He shows us our mistakes and tells us we're a joke
I used to sit and mope like what's the point in all
If I'm a Christian how come everyday I seem to fall
But I ain't know that all my sins were nailed upon the cross
I found this out in chapter 2 in the Book of Colossians
See the devil's a liar, yeah he's an accuser
He tells me I'm worthless, he says I'm a loser
But now I refuse to let him lead me wrong
Reading the Word in the morn got me feeling strong
I found my worth in Christ and I'm pursuing truth
A living testimony so you can do it too

I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
I used to do it too, I used to do it too
I used to do it, used to do it, used to do it too
But I’m changed, now I’m something different (Aye)
I’m changed, I love the way I’m living (Aye)
I’m changed, saved me from my own sin (Aye)
I’m changed, I learned how to live again (Aye)",https://genius.com/Lecrae-used-to-do-it-too-lyrics

As they reaching for the cats that's stepping into hell
While they flossing new shoes
Packing gats and they flossing new coupes
Slacking hoodrats, doing the do
Acting a fool, but it's jigga the figure pulling the trigger with vigor
Can make him bigger, need to get in with the cops, straight living
But you live a life sin, the wage of Jesus' death
If you living by the gun, that's the way into debt
But if you living the life, and living it right, put your fist in the sky, with all of your might, till you way out of breath
Chest pumping all hard due to heavy palpitations
Thirsting for the Lord with heavy salivation

Higher,Gravity,2012.0,"Lead me higher
Lead me higher
And lift my eyes up
To the light where
I can see all the pain coming to an end
Lead me higher into Your fire
Burn away all other desires
And let my heart beat again

I feel myself rising high above my yesterdays
Yes, it pays just to pray standing in your rays
Sun shining, reminding me that you rose, reminding me that I'm Yours
And wrapped in righteousness robes
Closer that I get to you, the higher that I feel
It's like my spirit's been lifted outside the stratosphere
When death is powerless and pain will never lay acclaim
And all the world will proclaim your name forever reigns
Put desire inside the fire inside my bones
Earth groans to see you return to take us home
Soul longs, for so long, I'm sewed on
You on the throne, my life no longer my own, lead me high

Lead me higher
Lead me higher
And lift my eyes up
To the light where
I can see all the pain coming to an end
Lead me higher into Your fire
Burn away all other desires
And let my heartbeat again

And lift my eyes up

It's Friday morning
I'm up too early, I'm up too high, 
the sky below me
Like I'm sitting in a plane
, feeling strange
Can't explain how I get to experience these things
Been to plenty cities, spent pretty pennies and ate plentiful
Do a show, I come home and feel empty? No
It's never me
, 
I'm glad to say
I've been changed like presidential campaigns
Use to wake up in the morning pursuing the wrong things
Now I wake up in the morning pursuing the Lord's name
Take me higher than the highest, You're my hope and desire, lifting me up high
Despite of this gravity, lead me higher
   

Lead me higher
Lead me higher
And lift my eyes up
To the light where
I can see all the pain coming to an end
Lead me higher into Your fire
Burn away all other desires
And let my heartbeat again",https://genius.com/Lecrae-higher-lyrics
Breathing to Death,Rebel,2008.0,"It's like I'm tired of life Lord I'm wrong why I can't get right
And when it's dark why I can't get light eh why it can't be light
It's so heavy why my sin won't let me see the end come get me
Please come get me my thoughts my mind my ways all evil
I'm supposed to be your people I'm sposed to see your sequel
I said I'll never leave you But I'm so left
I ain't right Lord I'm sleeping with death
Man, I'm cheating with death am I deaf Its like I don't hear you
I say that I'm a Christian but it's like I don't fear you
I'm on a selfish island and I am no where near you
God I really need you even tho I don't appear to
I'm drinking out a broken cistern
That could never hold water and I'm gonna get burned
Tho I try I never satisfy or quench this yearn
I hear you calling but it's like a fight for me to just turn
Lord I deserve to burn

Help me Lord before there's no time left
I ain't living I'm just breathing to death
Your ways are perfect and they lead me to rest
Mine are evil and they lead me to death (2x)

I'm feelin' schizophrenic maybe I ain't saved
Cause I gotta get high just to block out all the pain
Seen death, seen hurt, seen a whole lotta thangs
Instead of running from it I'm running away from change
It's like I'm outside in the ice cold weather
The rains coming down and I keep getting wetter
I know I'm getting sick and I could die any second
But still I refuse to let your truths make me better
I'd rather eat flies and maggots instead of bread
And it's killing me slow but I can't get it through my head
You were stabbed you were murdered and for me is why you bled
But I spit on your bloody face as If I never cared
And Lord how dare I compare my pain
Your father turned his back and you were left to hang
I don't know why you did it that I can't explain
How can you love this sinner whose desecrated your name?
Lord I deserve the flames

Help me Lord before there's no time left
I ain't living I'm just breathing to death
Your ways are perfect and they lead me to rest
Mine are evil and they lead me to death (2x)

I know I tell lies I know I do dirt
Apart from you I'm nothing but you can give me worth
I don't know if I know you But still I know I should
I know the days are evil and only you are Good
I've come to this conclusion I would like to change
Cause all the worlds money and fame cannot sustain
I know that I should turn but thats the hardest thang
Cause do I really feel that havin' Jesus is my gain
The world is so tempting Satan is a beast
He hypnotizes my eyes to say the least
But Jesus be my treasure to know you is to live
And I am here dying trying everything there is
All I need here is you help me turn away from sin
Lord give me grace to turn away and the fear not to give in
I know that I'm not perfect but if I could rest in Him
I know I don't deserve it but still I'll take your hand
Lord let me take your hand",https://genius.com/Lecrae-breathing-to-death-lyrics
Got Paper,Rebel,2008.0,"These brothas passin' me and they all rollin' fly coups
They throw some D's on but they still ain't got the truth
They blow they cheese on it then they die and what's the use
I'm so secure in Jesus all I want in life is fruit
I don't need no fast money NOPE don't need a fast car
Yeah the faith is a race but i't ain't a nascar
Homie you and God got beef
Cause you keep chasin' money like them hundreds got feet
Buddy wanna be rich but even 50 done said
That he still feel hungry even tho he got bread
Make em throw away they life got em runnin' from feds
Love of money's like crack both of em will leave you dead
When you die and face God ain't nothing left to be said
Instead of chasing the truth you take a lie to the head
And homie all I can do tell you is what Jesus said
Repent and turn from your sin cause the kingdom of God's at hand

Got money, got paper
So what who cares?
Got money, got paper
I got Jesus baby!

People they want cheese American mozzarella
The enemies rat trap might snap any second
I'm like that dude in Matthew who after finding a treasure
Gave all he had to get it that's a real go getta
People dying over wood grain, chrome, and some leather
They got expensive tastes but the faith tastes better
I know the ice wet but the living water wetter
But don't believe me read the 13 letters
Or you can Torah the gospel and all the prophets
But homie I promise you'll never profit chasing profit
Now look at 1 Timothy 6 it's so clear
You chase the money and wind up in a snare
Now a vow of poverty no it's not there
But you pursue God the rest he takes care
You don't step on his back in order to get rich
If you do then you're in sin and ordered to repent
You come to Christ for God You come to Daddy for worship
He ain't take that Cross to fund your vanity purchase
Even though we all agree that death is certain
It seems we believe there's banks beyond earth (That's crazy)

Got money, got paper
So what who cares?
Got money, got paper
I got Jesus baby!

Money dough cash paper
If it was a woman I promise I used to date her
Now that we broke up she be callin' ya boy a hater
Cause all I do is use her for glorifying my maker
My treasures in heaven Christ is my satisfaction
If I was broke I'd be richer than folk who never had em
God is the Gospel not a new Bentley
Was empty and he gave us life and that's plenty
Get me...homie I could spend six centuries
Simply saying I'm satisfied in the sensei
And it's sickening, that knowing God ain't enough
We gotta tell em they can get rich quickly
Now this is heresy, false it's not true
2nd Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 2
Read that and please believe that
Forget c-note man they pockets was E-flat
They still had joy

Got money, got paper
So what who cares?
Got money, got paper
I got Jesus baby!",https://genius.com/Lecrae-got-paper-lyrics
Divine Intervention,Rehab,2010.0,"You know in intervention they tell you that you’re hurting somebody who loves you, and divine intervention’s no different, yea, the moment is now

Here is my moment, here is my lifetime
All that I have I will give to You
In this moment, ’cause nothing really matters at all

God created days, weeks, summer, spring, winter, fall
Yet became weak so You could free us from the fall
You hold the earth in Your palm with Your great power
You're always out of time the way You transcend hours
Wind and the waves tsunami is ’round
But You walk on top of them both
They humbly bow (bow down)
Before I work I need a couple tools
You spoke the earth into existence, no auto tune
More than auto tune, more than minor key
‘Cause I’ve been missing all the notes
In the minor keys and the major ones
And the key to life is coming to the end of it
And embracing Christ


I holla empty me
So hollow be my name
You’re so immense
But condescend and dwell inside my frame
You restrain the waves
And tame fierce lions
I mean fierce liars, crush empires
We all hanging by a thread cutting at the wires
Ignorant that all the sin lead to hellfire
And when I yell fire, they tell me false alarm
‘Cause they don’t smell the smoke and they don’t sense the harm
Something worse than the black plague’s coming
And nothing under the sun can save us from it
There’s no hope but divine intervention
And Christ saves victims who are dying from addiction


They say in God we trust
But what’s the bigger sin
That we don’t trust in Him
But trust the stuff on which its written (that’s money)
‘Cause we all dying and we all trying
To stay alive but the truth we ain’t all buying
Those of us who buy it, We’re never bought from
We gon’ live free forever
We are gonna live forever in the Savior’s arms
It’s all needles in arms full of life’s drugs
Lust, pride, hate, death running through our blood
Need a blood donor, need a transfusion
He’s over hanging on the cross for your substitution
So in conclusion, only one solution
Trust divine intervention as your resolution",https://genius.com/Lecrae-divine-intervention-lyrics
After the Music Stops,After the Music Stops,2006.0,"I got a question
After the show
After the set
After the music stops
What's next?
Are we just writing songs?
Or are we concerned with
Uniting a people
To follow the Great Commission of Christ

Back in the day I was a lunch line rapper
After that I guess I was a punchline rapper
Then I got saved 
and sometime after
Ya boy came back as a frontline rapper
And when I say the frontlines
That's not a front line
I’m out here preaching Christ on the frontlines
And, no it ain't about rocking stages
Cause some of my engagements are out on the pavement
I'm out to take the Bible
Create disciples
Who make disciples
Disciple cycles
That's why I want the beats to knock
So after the music stops
You can meet the Rock
I pray
That you would know Him well
This is like show-and-tell
It's more than a show
I'm showing you Emmanuel
So yeah I’m hoping that you're liking the flow
But it's only so you could know the God I’m writing it for
Let's go

After the show
After the set
After the music stops
What's next?
Will there be fellowship?
Prayer
Disciples
Will you open your Bibles?
After the music stops
After it’s over
After it ends
After the music stops
What then?
Will you understand that Christ is King?
Or will you just like the words we sing?
After the music stops

I recorded a couple songs
Some fast, some slow
So the listeners would know
The importance of the show
The importance of the show's
Not to excite these folks
But make God's truth relevant
Ignite these folks
Discipleship is our call
But we make disciples
This is not a suggestion
Create disciples
The teaching is a process
It's not overnight
And it’s not a stage and a mic
Nah it's life on life
Christ walked with twelve
Ate with twelve
Talked to twelve
Shaped the twelve
Invested in 'em well
You could say that He made the twelve
Who made many more
Who made plenty more
Now it's on you and me
If there's anymore
One teach, two teach
Three teach, four teach
Five teach, six teach
Seven teach, more
This is what we've been commissioned
It's the reason why I write
So that you could hear the truth
Not so you can say I’m tight

After the show
After the set
After the music stops
What's next?
Will there be fellowship?
Prayer
Disciples
Will you open your Bibles?
After the music stops
After it’s over
After it ends
After the music stops
What then?
Will you understand that Christ is King?
Or will you just like the words we sing?
After the music stops

So we write this for the right to speak on what's righteous
And then we might check for a culture who likes the hypeness
Some say we keep it krunk
Some say we hype man
We just wanna pump the resurrection of the Christ man
We in the 'burbs, in the hoods that's hostile
We share a common view like Synoptic Gospels
And you know we keep a couple young dudes around us
And teach 'em the same truths God used to ground us
This is a lifestyle, so when the mic's down
I pray people follow Christ, when they turn the lights down
I pray that everybody playing this song
Will be challenged by everything I had to say in this song
I don’t do this for the money, I don’t do this for fame
I don’t do this so the industry can know my name
I do this in hopes to glorify Yeshua the King
If you’re feeling me you know you should be doing the same

After the show
After the set
After the music stops
What's next?
Will there be fellowship?
Prayer
Disciples
Will you open your Bibles?
After the music stops
After it’s over
After it ends
After the music stops
What then?
Will you understand that Christ is King?
Or will you just like the words we sing?

I Did It for You,After the Music Stops,2006.0,"I did it for you
I did it for you
I did it for you
That's why I did it y'all
For all the listeners
Whoever be hearing this
That's why I do what I do
I did it for you
I did it for you
I did it for you

Single mother low income riding the bus
Big momma making a fuss saying in God she trusts
My uncles 20, I'm 10 taking gulps of gin
He don't realize that we all are engulfed in sin
Gang bangers on the corner got me wanna be down
Take a bullet for some city on government ground
By 25 everybody locked or dead
Too busy playing around never looking ahead
Every funeral, cats get upset and cry
Turn their heads towards the sky trying to ask God why
But they never looked up till then
Every other day they concerned with the world and consumed in sin
Not Christ just heaven they want
They think clean means not trying to sling things out of their trunk
Nobody ever told'em heaven was spotless and we all dirty
That's why we need a Holy God to wash us

I did it for you
I opened up my life and shared my life
So that you can see we all need Christ
I did it for you
If you can understand my pain
Maybe you can see we all need change
I did it for you
Gave you my life, my pain, my hurt
Man I hope this work
I did it for you
Since Christ died for sin
I never be the same again
I did it for you

Young dude, I remember coming home after school
Changing channels from videos back to cartoons
Up late talking on the phone under my bed
So momma couldn't hear some of the things I said
And it wasn't all bad but it wasn't all good
Even though momma was doing the best she could
I was a latchkey home alone for hours
Entertaining my sin And my soul devour
Pick up by the cops at the age of 12
And not because my momma didn't raise me well
I was a drug baby big momma drug me to church
Hated every minute of it but she prayed it would work
I ain't never met my daddy, so I feel all empty
Like why he never call or why don't he come get me
And momma under legalistic teachings and lies
So she beat me and she tell me it was to keep me alive
A typical youth I mean atypical youth
16 agnostic and looking for truth
I lived for myself, No one ever told me the plan
God had to bring redemption to a fallible man
Good news really wasn't good news to me
Cause I never new the condemnation due to me
And I wish somebody would of told me then
What it meant to know Christ and to be born again

I did it for you
I opened up my life and shared my life
So that you can see we all need Christ
I did it for you
If you can understand my pain
Maybe you can see we all need change
I did it for you
Gave you my life, my pain, my hurt
Man I hope this work
I did it for you
Since Christ died for sin
I never be the same again
I did it for you

They say Mac got saved and X is a Christian
Well I don't really know 'em but I pray they're both listening
It's hard trying to grow up in a sinful land
And you don't have an example of a Godly man
Well hold on; just keep your eyes on Christ
When we enter in the world, man our lives alright
They say heaven has a ghetto but that ain't true
And if God has a standard then that ain't you and that ain't me
That's what I learned late one night
When a man named James White changed my life
He told me that Christ paid the price for sin
Every lie I ever told, Christ died for them
See, I never knew I offended God
I just knew I really wasn't trying to live for God
And my sins all cost me, Yeah pretty costly
I couldn't blame the hood for the death sin bought me
All that I could do was blame myself and realize there was no way I could change myself
So I trusted Christ with my lustful life
And he saved me that's why I am trying to touch the mic
Yeah so if you ask who I am spitting this to, that's right y'all I did it for you
And if you ask who I have written this to, that's right I did it for you

I did it for you
I opened up and shared my life
So that you can see we all need Christ
I did it for you
If you can understand my pain
Maybe you can see we all need change
I did it for you
Gave you my life, my pain, my hurt
Man I hope this work
I did it for you
Since Christ died for sin
I never be the same again
I did it for you

I did it for you, I did it for you
So I could show you that his grace is right here for you
I did it for you, I did it for you
So I could show you that his grace is right here for you
I did it for you",https://genius.com/Lecrae-i-did-it-for-you-lyrics
Fall Back,Rebel,2008,"I know you might of seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me...you might wanna fall back

Lies in them songs lies on the television
No telling what lies on the television
Learned sarcasm, sexism, racism
Learned to worship money cars
Learned to hate Christians
All the Christians in the movies so typical
Alcoholic, child molesting, hypocritic and mystical
They say since everybody's doing it it's normal
But Jesus said be transformed and don't let them conform you
You ain't thin enough you need a new diet
You need a psychic everybody does it you should try it
Spring break hit the beach what you supposed to do
Be careful what the media impose on you
You learn how to find peace from a TV show
You learn how to ride clean from them videos
In 30 seconds a commercial have you mixed up
(call now we can have your whole life fixed up)

I know you might of seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me...you might wanna fall back
The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the word of God to lead me
And I ain't eating everything they feed me
Tryna deceive me...so I gotta fall back

Ay these days if you watch the, box you should block your
Mind in these times and them lies that could lock you
They telling girls in our world to be hot stuff
And telling dudes link with crews on the block tough
Plus I'm feeling like they mock us
They say that God is old school like a box cut
But I'm sure that His flock's tough
And we can judge what is bug, and live pleasing in His sight when the clock's up
I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes
So we can defend what it is when we get they lies
Its on that cash that they fix they mind
They always sayin cheese like its picture time (be easy)
Tell em cool it with the mind games
I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame
Removed from them tired games
Say my life it ain't mine man
We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change

I know you might of seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me...you might wanna fall back
The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the word of God to lead me
And I ain't eating everything they feed me
Tryna deceive me...so I gotta fall back

Be a rebel let the word of God lead you
Cause Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you
And he'll lead ya and leach ya and leave ya
So be careful as you navigate through media
Take heed for gravity get the best of you
And you will find a concrete bench press on you
Use the word of God to help you filter all that
Before you fall into the trap you better fall back

You know what I call that? I call that maturity
Learnin how to fall back so you can live in purity
Learnin how to walk that and saying you ain't luring me
The media is feeding us with lies but He's curing me (be easy)
I know guys trying to hype you
But cling to the Lord's Word, flee from them vipers
We spitting aiming at your heart like snipers
We'd like for you to desire God like Piper

I know you might of seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me...you might wanna fall back
The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the word of God to lead me

Long Time Coming,Church Clothes,2012.0,"I've been treating this part of life like a dance floor
Side stepping all the things I've made plans for
And I ain't acting when I'm taking on a man's role
Chance to enhance the fam can be a handful
I rather have my hands full than be empty-handed
Travel all around the planets till I have it planted
Firm roots like great grand pap, married 65 years, 20 kids, same family
Strong as an ox and I'm from the same stock
So I won't be hanging out 'till I see the sun-o'clock
It's been a long time coming but I'm coming at a decent hour
Everything I have is ours start the wedding shower
Teeball games in the summer ballet in the winter
And I ain't scrolling through my twitter while we having dinner
Time to grow up, done drinkin I throw up
Neglected little man from my plans, try'n to blow up
Some people are so focused on the road to success
They don't see their whole family laying dead on the tracks
I rather cease to have my lyrics read over tracks
And put some family photos on the walls instead of plaques

It's been a long time coming, but we're here now
Unashamed

Look
I remember watching videos by Hype Will
Thinking I could do that if I had a nice deal
But the precedent is MC's dead believe
They take the same exit that Mason Betha did
Cause when you're talking steal then ya sound hard
But they let you out ya deal when you found God
Back to watching Hype Will, think about how I feel
Wishin spitting Christian wasn't God's will
It's been a long time running, long time wondering
Long time humming stupid songs that I hated
From a rapper that I felt was overrated
Cause I knew that he was faking but he everybody's favorite
Coming with that same hi hat and 808 hit
Bricks that they weight lift, chicks that is naked
I'm in my house studyin' the scripts that is sacred
If this a success recipe I ain't gonna make it
So many reasons not to
I only graduated high school
I'm from a small little city that they fly through but never fly to
Just a plain town tryin' to be fly too
Ak-town rapper, we backed down never
So I'm finna to take my hood up like Trayvon
Finna hold my hood down like your favorite mob
Finna mix some hood nouns with the Pharaoh Monch
Walking with the King, boy, watch the Pharaoh march
Red Sea is my favorite part
The Lord opened up a new avenue
Industry got the wrong awards and we passin through
Church clothes on the mic spitting what your pastor do
Looking at the world through our Master's view
Offer you the optic codes, keep this glasses, too
On fire for the king, but we're cold rappers, dude
It's been a long time coming",https://genius.com/Lecrae-long-time-coming-lyrics

I know he look better than most men
But without Christ
Looks are no reason for bragging and boasting
You got your heart on him
Now you can't depart from him
You knew from the beginning not to even start on him
Compromising your faith for sex
Hurting yourself and God
Cause you outside of marital context
What's next?
Mami show respect for your body
Instead of getting naked and naughty
Like sex is a hobby
You know what you supposed to do
Let him loose and cling to the God
That wants to get close to you
You've been blessed as the chosen few

If your God's on the sidelines
You won't be happy I promise
Until you understand that God is the lifeline
He ain't pleased with lust
So even if it feels right. remember
He ain't pleased with us, when we
Let our emotions loose without a ring on the finger
It's only gonna come back to sting ya
Don't let the singers sing you sweet lullabies

Give up his life just to love you forever

You keep deceiving your mind
Saying that this is part of God's design
Knowing he treating you good
Know his ways is nice
But he can't love you like he should
He's not engaged to Christ
And you know this ain't the man for you
But you hold on like God ain't got better plans for you
The whole worlds says you should be dating
God says you should be serving Him while you patiently waiting
Everybody rushin and racing
Hugging and kissing and holding hands
All before the days end
I know it's hard, but trust
I wouldn't waste my breath on this song if it wasn't a must
The same God that made you
The same God that died for your sins and saved you
He ain't trying to play you

I'ma keep it short simple and plain • I used to fiend for the pimp game but got with Christ and switched my aim • flipped my pain to a burden • to grab Hip-Hop His name and merge it • with His word as the plate then serve it • cats like who you serve kid? • man it's gotta be Him • who wiped my sin • slate clean like Oxy-10 • I rock Christ from PA to Dallas • R-Swift and Lecrae walk in the Spirit till our feet ache with callous • nah I'm buggin but for real my point is • without Christ life is pointless • this joint is • for the prisoners trapped on the block • we're blasting shots • cause cats to drop like temperatures • without Christ and His restoration • your chance of making it is slimmer than Blacks getting reparation • Jesus Christ man the Ancient of Days • get with Him for eternal life and pass the phrase

The Bride,Rebel,2008.0,"A building of beings being constructed
Christ is the cornerstone, foundation build on another and you's a goner holmes
She' built on em, supported by him, conformed to him, now she's a body of bodies who transform through him
A temple that breathes we are the halls
We are the floor board or more we are the walls
Manifold wisdom of God no longer a mystery
The church is the pinnacle of our salvific history
One flesh union homie
The Tri-union is glorified through our corporatized communion
Still the present reality is she was born a casualty though she's made alive
She's affected by depravity
Once lived in sin and enslaved by her lust and
Folks catch her slippin and they turn away disgusted
She's a work in progress Christ is the head of her
And He wash her clean with the words that he done said to her
She's already pretty but she's really not dressed and sometimes she look silly but she's far from a mess
Yes, please so don't be dissin cause Jesus done paid grip an
And if you didn't then should caller her Misses. I'm talking bout the church

Yeah she may look gritty
When her man come back she gone look so pretty - She the Church
You might see her acting crazy, be patient with her tho cause she still God's baby - She the Church
Before you dis her get to know her, Jesus got a thing fo her and died just to show her - She the Church
She ain't bricks and buildings
She all of God's people Men women and children

Her name is ecclesia meaning the the assembly
Bows to (the Trinity) No other Divinity
A body family and community she is all one
But on earth you see her in congregational small ones
A microcosm or a small scale example
But yes it is the church even though it's just a sample
Invisible spiritual
Physical visible
Not a brick temple never that simple
This a not a building
She is not bricks
She's a world changer but ain't bout getting rich
Perpetrating fakes cause a lot of folks to hate
Plus her hands get dirty and her feet get scraped
And sometimes her body parts start acting outa place
Legs tryna be arms
Arms thinking they the face
But she'll never be replaced with a one man band or a small Taliban with no body in command

Yeah she may look gritty
When her man come back she gone look so pretty - She the Church
You might see her acting crazy, be patient with her tho cause she still God's baby - She the Church
Before you dis her get to know her, Jesus got a thing fo her and died just to show her - She the Church
She ain't bricks and buildings
She all of God's people Men women and children

Some don't get it so they hate
They say she's on a paper chase they say she's really fake
So they go start a ministry so they can do the work
But they don't understand how Jesus feel about His church
And yeah they make disciples
They got plenty conversions
They take care of the widows and the orphans they be workin
But none of them are churchin
No church structure
No elders and no discipline
They don't have a conductor
And they so they don't submit
But quite a few of them baptize
People how I pray that you'd look at this thing from God's eyes
Take responsibility inside the whole council not just the area where you might have a mouthful
Who should folks submit to
Who will conduct the discipline
If excommunicated what body will they be missing then
Look at Ephesians 4 where Paul gets practical
1st Timothy and Titus if you thinking I'm irrational
Homie that's the church

Yeah she may look gritty
When her man come back she gone look so pretty - She the Church
You might see her acting crazy, be patient with her tho cause she still God's baby - She the Church
Before you dis her get to know her, Jesus got a thing fo her and died just to show her - She the Church
She ain't bricks and buildings
She all of God's people Men women and children",https://genius.com/Lecrae-the-bride-lyrics
Tha Church,Real Talk,2004.0,"Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to interrupt this album
With a little bit of real talk
We bout to represent the priesthood of believers
It's your boy Sho Biz and Lecrae
Yo let's do this dawg

It goes one for the Father, two for the Son
Three for the Spirit through Whom work is done
Before He cracks the sky and our feet leave the dirt
Let's go ahead and represent tha Church
Wake up in the morning, and I hit my knees early
Face to the floor, thinking I'm not worthy
I'll do that Luke 9 thing, gotta bear my cross
Team up with Lecrae, we gotta reach the lost
I'm getting pounds from the church saying, Sho you've grown
But don't get too proud, cause Sho is prone
To lie and conceit while the spirit lies in defeat
Gotta beat the flesh daily, cause dawg gotta eat
Cause God's wrath is something we all gotta meet
It don't matter if you Black, White, Jew or Greek
The only way to avoid the doom and despair is if
God asks Christ is He with you and He say (yeah)
But on the contreezy my neezy it may sound easy
But this living it out thing is hard, word to God
(It's tha Church baby) not pews and steeples
But those who shun evil, those Acts 2 people
Not talking bout church mothers in funny hats
But in the streets, even in the alley schooling cats
Quoting many facts, death, burial, resurrection
Get to know His atonement, He's coming back
Forget 5 mics, I want 5 saved souls
With self-control, taking the gospel across the globe
(Say word Sho) that's word to the deacon, the pastor
The building fund, and the choir's singing
That's real talk, we do it all in His Name
So how bout it, let's be a Church without blame
A Church without vain, a Church without shame
Ayo but who murdered Christ?
In that we take claim

We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life ya'll
And He did it for us
And why He do it ya'll
And He did it because
We're tha Church
We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life ya'll
And He did it for us
And why He do it ya'll
And He did it because
We're tha Church

It goes one for the Father, two for the Son
Three for the Spirit through Whom work is done
Before Christ come back to reign on earth
Let's go ahead and represent tha Church
I pick up the phone, it's Sho, talking bout it's a show
I'm like, I can't go cause my dough on low
But at a, quarter to four I got a knock at the door
He got my ticket in his hands like you ready to roll?
I'm like (yeah), it's so good to my system mayne
It feel good to be a Christian mayne
We got the same Spirit working within us
We get excited when we think about the Lord
Coming back to get us
And what's, mine is yours, I know what's yours is mine
Food, money, time or sixteen bars of rhyme
It's like Acts 4:32, yeah Crae dirty too
But tha Church keep Crae from looking like a worldly dude
And I ain't talking bout the buildings and bricks
I'm talking bout the men and women who be getting strict
It's tha Church

We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life ya'll
And He did it for us
And why He do it ya'll
And He did it because
We're tha Church
We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life ya'll
And He did it for us
And why He do it ya'll
And He did it because
We're tha Church

I was your everyday sinner, up in the club
Sipping on (huh?) smoking on (what?)
Straight from the suburbs but faking like a thug
Don't mean to glorify it, it just is what it was
Yeah you know me too, I was the same dude hustling
The same one that clubbed for fun and loved lusting em
The same little thief off of Scott street, ya watched me
Probably hoped the cops would come and box me
Till the Gospel offended me, gave me an identity
A man with a hole, losing grip of his soul
I was introduced to the Scriptures and Him who died
I never saw a man cry, till he met Christ
For me in '98 Christ became more than a name
Conviction hit my frame, my heart was changed
Like somebody hit the light switch inside of my brain
And when I hit my knees to pray, it wasn't in vain
I've been doing a lot of thinking and I had to invest
In my soul, and all I had to do was say yes
And ever since then I've been eternally secure
And placed in tha Church all glory to the Lord

We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life ya'll
And He did it for us
And why He do it ya'll
And He did it because
We're tha Church
We love the Lord for
What He is, what He was
We praise Him because
What He did, what He does
He gave His life ya'll
And He did it for us
And why He do it ya'll
And He did it because
We're tha Church
It's the church baby
We the church
It's the church baby
We the church
It's the church baby
We the church
It's the church baby
We the church
It's the church baby
We the church

Em' that Overdose

I'm feelin' good, forget my feeling tho

See him let me know cause if you did you probably seen a ghost
Fire in my bones, I'm spittin' flames
Boy that Word of God get at you like a Twitter name
Truth up in my veins, everyday I need it
But you don't hear me tho, you used to different speakers
They speak death and they stories ain't at all the truth
They like to think they ballers, they just some foul shooters
I'm so real 100 percent authentic
I know how fake feel i dropped him off at the clinic
Told em he need rehabilitation (gone take him) get him clean
Met that Triune Light (what's that?) triple beam

Gone check him in, before they close the door
You got that Rehab, this is the overdose
I'm on that overdose (3 times)
Old me comatose

They think I'm churchy, they think ya boy a lame
Yeah I live for Jesus, I'm unashamed
They talkin' reckless what you spectin' from the walkin' dead
You try to give em life, they want that death instead
But 1st John make it clear what they wanna hear
Hear go that overdose, go stick it in they ear

Eat His Flesh drink His Blood, Holy Communion
I know the Truth is hitting home like Barry Bonds
Yeah my God run the streets like a marathon
Yes! I'mma believer Yes! I rep the Kingdom
They ask me where to find the Lord they ain't never seen Him

Push up, push up, come on, work it out cousin
I run from the flesh, it be tryin' to rise
And I'm done with living gettin' drunk and high
I'm a son of El Shaddai, the most High, who most def want me to do more then get by
I look in the sky and I'm so inspired, to sprint for a God whose my soul's desire
My sole's desire to run for Jesus
And give Him all the credit like I run for visa
I'm done with pieces, I found my dime
I run to the wife that the Lord provided
And we decided that we would run together for God's glory alone homie we ain't lying
I run to the Word cause my soul is thirsty
No runnin from affliction though they may hurt me
I do preach wrath but I speak on mercy
And grace by faith, you can call me churchy

My feet don't hurt and my legs ain't heavy
I'm still in the marathon, I keep the pace steady
Temptation is quick/but the Spirit stay ready
My eyes on the prize yeah, they fixed on Christ
Hydrated in the Word but the joints are tight
That's why I get with a coach, who can stretch your boy
Who can push, pull, train me and test your boy
And look up, look up yeah you heard the gun
That means run off the blocks, run!
The Son is where I stay focused
Avoiding sin and I pass the baton to the faithful men
And we never run in vain or for finite prizes
So when the race is done there will be no surprises
The world says quit, we ain't tryin' to hear it
Cause to quench our sin's thirst is to quench the Spirit

Run, this is your race, boy. Run, don't stop
Run till your blood vessels bust like a Glock

They tempting you to puff, puff, pass, you best run
Keep ya kicks laced, get your grip straight, before you quit, you kick, this is the big race
Forget a medal man it's bigger than that
Forget a 4.2 40 man you're quicker than that

The Holy Spirit got the breath you breathe
So if the cramps kick in, it's the all the breath you need
Wait on the Lord to renew you man
Don't stop, keep going, you can do this man
Keep the Word in your grip, keep the Word on your lips, keep a tight-knit Christlike crew for fellowship
And before you see the end and the race is done

The King,After the Music Stops,2006.0,"Yeah ok see uh it's a lot of cats goin' around talkin' 'bout they the king, ya know what I'm sayin'? The king of this the king of that. Well I think we need to get this straight, there's only one true king, ay Flame come help ya boy out man let's get into this one man yeah

He was raised up in Nazareth and raised on the thizzerd
Never got drunk, got high, or sipped sizzurp
Prophesied King, Isaiah 9, that's the wizzerd
He's the real king, and it don't matter what you hizzerd
A king's a real shepherd dawg
Acts in peoples' favor ya'll
Not a self seekin' player all about the paper dawg
Call 'em the Messiah, the Annointed One
 
the Savior
Caught Him on the humble but you'll see Him reign later
These self-proclaimed kings braggin' cause they on chrome
But twenty-six inches is a pretty low throne
Like kids playin' in they daddy's clothes when he's gone
The clothes don't fit and daddy's comin' back home
Really this is foolish mane
You don't wanna do this mane
The King of kings is comin' back
The theocratic ruler mane
What if you should pass away and see Him on the last of days
There ain't no making deals so really what is there you have to say

Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (He the King, Jesus Christ rule this thing)
Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (Jesus Christ run it mane)

We talkin' 'bout the Sovereign Ruler dawg. Hey Flame man, why don't you enlighten us to who the King is dawg? Let's get it

Oh how excellent is his essence we reverence His name
While silly peasants we presently tryna steal His fame
You carry .45s, AKs, king of the tools
But you can't make a day
You can't take away from the King of the Jews
See what about the major day
When you face to face with yes you know who
We wanna be a king with bling and do major things
But He supremely rules
You must be jokin', you smokin', plus you buyin' that Buddha
Why defy him when you can rely on the Lion of Judah?
Supreme ruler shinin' brighter than Jacob the jeweler's
Jewelry, cause it's true indeed he's savin' us through the
Cross of Christ and that's true
Follow him lose ya life and that's true
Gain new life, ya got to let loose
Of your own throne and follow Jesus
Rollin' big whips don't make you no king
Rollin' them spliffs don't make you no king
Pretty mixed screens don't make you no king
Smokin' those ki's don't make you no king
See you can run a trap own a house and smoke black and milds
You'll be a king when you can do things like roll back the clouds


Yeah we talkin bout absolute sovereignty, who rules over the earth and it's entirety, who will be back to reign! Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess Jesus Christ is king of the kings, yeah, respect it",https://genius.com/Lecrae-the-king-lyrics
Death Story,After the Music Stops,2006.0,"I'm blackin' out
On my last leg
Takin' final breaths
Overheard the Doctor say
I ain't gonna make it
Final steps
In the zone
Half panickin'
Half feelin' gone
""Hang on homie!""
My boys yellin' tryna keep me goin'
Little sister in the distance
I see her tears flowin'
Where mommy at?
She on the ground past out cold
Aw man this is how it ends
Death came quick
My God
I'll do anything just let me live
I wanna pray
But I can't pray, I never really done it
I don't know if I should call Christ
Buddha, or Mohammed
Gettin' blunted earlier this evenin' now seems wrong
And my brain is searchin' hard for any scripture or song
I'm havin' flashbacks
Now I remember, it was December
I was standing on the corner
Pitching rocks in the Winter
Young dude ran up on me, thought he was a winner
But he started tryna convince me all the ways I'm a sinner

Man, you never understood before man
You've lied before right? Okay right
You've stolen before right?
Well man you've already broken two of the ten commandments, man
That qualifies you as, a lawbreaker
That's, that's sin, man
That offends the holy and perfect and righteous God, man
That's sin, you need a savior because of the sin, man
I'm just tryna break it down for you

{gasps} Havin' a hard time breathin'
But I ain't leavin' until I know what I believe in
Wait, maybe it was Ak on the block
Who was tellin' me Mohammed was the rock
Nah, stop!
(You know man, you know Mohammed was the truth. You know what I'm sayin'? Islam is the way to go yo.)
But ain't Mohammed die?
Yeah, dawg and they buried him
That's scary then cause I don't know if Allah really carries men
Let's get back to Jesus {cough}
Coughin' and wheezin'
This worlds full of lies man
Everything's misleadin'
They told me don't be scared to die
But dawg that's ridiculous
Cause I don't know what happens to me next in this predicament
It's sickenin'
God, give me answers
Give me clues
Help me understand

What's the rest of that verse?
Think fast, can't remember
Help me nurse!
""What's John 3:16, nurse?
""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son..""
Gave up His only son

So whoever believes in Him
Wait? Who turned out the lights?
I'm dyin'! I'm dead!
No my eyes went closed
I can't feel my feet no mo'
And my sides is cold
God, please I'm sorry for all the wrong that I've done
I know I've, been a terrible father and a horrible son
I see it now, I wish that I could change some things
In my life, I really never took the blame for things
Like lyin' and stealin'
And hurtin' and dealin'
I'll quit it all if you're willin'
And let me walk out this buildin'
I wronged You, I see that

Strung Out,Rehab: The Overdose,2011,"How could I love you
When all you ever did was wrong
How could I trust you
You lied to me all along
You strung me out

I'm goin' through withdrawals
The shakes and all
You did me dirty
I almost died dawg
I let you play me
And plus you gave me
All the filthy things I wanted, all my sinful cravings
But I see you
Yeah you're see-through
Somebody opened up my eyes and I don't need you
I gotta leave you
Before you take my life
I used to date you then I went ahead and made you wifey, yeah
You had me feenin for the stuff you offer
You such a scoffer I know that you want me in my coffin
But girl you already lost it
Your ways are perished
Thank you god for your salvation this is what I cherish

You strung me out 

Uh, I'm out your grip
I'm out your grasp
You had me mesmerized
You had me in your hands
Luster the eyes
The pride of life
You offered me the world
You made it look so nice
You took me high
But left me down and out
I run right back to you thinkin' that you would help me out
You never satisfied
You only gratified
You just a bad illusion
To every passerby
And I don't want you round
You only bring me down
So glad I quit you I don't miss you cause you had me down
So get gone
Get gone 


Do not love the world
Or the things in the world
If anybody loves the world
The love of God is not in 'em

Whoever does the will of God
Will live forever

Lord, You've done so much for us
Look at the faith, You entrust to us and plus
You're benevolent

You're the giver of the life that we're cherishing
You walk on winds majestic flawless
You saved the lost, redeemed the lawless
I thank You for letting me know You
Fortunate that I should even get to behold You
Lord, I'm lowly
You chose me
To witness Your glory by being made Holy
You know me, my ins and outs
You calm all of my anxieties and end my doubts
Thank you to the Holy Spirit living within me
Though times I may grieve You, the Son has cleansed me
No longer fear the terrors of night
If 10,000 fall on my right, I'll call on Your might

Lord, I'm grateful for all that You are to me
I'll walk with you daily, but still it amazes me
How You never change, never change, never change
Your love, it stays the same, stays the same, stays the same

Goodness, gracious, Lord
Anybody in the hood ever taste this before?
Been chased by the Lord, been embraced by the Lord
Got me sittin back just givin' thanks to the Lord
But even in the midst of that there's plenty of little things I forget to add
All these little things I will miss so bad
So let me take a second and mention that
I appreciate the things You do
And worship is more than just trying to sing to You but still
You know we're gonna sing to You
And say thanks for some other little things You do
Thanks for the mornings that You open my eyes
And I don't see 20/20 but I see alright
Thank You, Lord, yeah, I can see that sky
You created with the sun, yeah I can see that rise
Thank You

How You never change, never change, never change
Your love, it stays the same, stays the same, stays the same

Thank God I can rest in You
You're perfect, my life I invest in You
Your mercy endures, Your Grace is sufficient
You're holy and pure You gave me vision and
Some say they wanna touch the sky
But I'd rather touch the God who can justify
The ocean, the mountains, the clouds amaze me
I can't believe I know the God that made these
Sometimes I can be that guy who takes for granted the breathe I breath inside
Yes, I'm fearfully and wonderfully made
These are gifts that you've given even to the depraved
And if your boy wasn't saved you would still deserve praise, you're the God of ages
I'm glad I can open your pages
And see with amazement all your wonderful ways
I'm grateful

Lord, I'm grateful for all that You are to me
I'll walk with you daily, but still it amazes me
How You never change, never change, never change
Your love, it stays the same, stays the same, stays the same

Why you let em treat you like that
Why you let em stone cold play you

That's a no, no, no, no

I heard he drive you crazy
But come on girl let's face it
He got your heart deceived
And you ain't thinking straight when
God love ya lady, you'll always be His baby
But you using your body, to go out and disgrace Him
You need to leave him shawty, and you should leave him shortly
After this message I'm guessing you think you need him shorty
No but you need God
Your heart to please God
It to be your satisfaction
Live to please God
He'll never lie to you
You know He's perfect, love
You know He died for you
He's got the perfect love
So gone let him go, go
Stickin with him is a no,no,no,no


Hey, you know satan like to play you girl
Biting after the killings, trying to shake you girl
He's so pragmatic, so he's back at it
That's why you gotta flea temptation, tell him ""you can have it""
He's a trickster, loves to tell you that you need sin
Make you think you still a slave when you a free men
Always scheming but don't be ignorant
And fall prey to the liar and the lion's den
If you wait till you're alone on a date night
To figure out what's wrong in the late night
It too late right
You got caught up again, and now you back in sin
Feel like you can't ever win
But that's the lie again
You gotta raise up
Knowing God is the only one who can save us
Satan played us
It shouldn't amaze us
Crafty, takin' advantage of the way we crave lust

Ladies, if Song of Solomon had never been written
And you never saw how men were supposed to cherish their women
And look at Ephesians 5, where they nourish their wives
Is he really that type of guy or are you rationalizing
Our God deserves glory
Greatest of love stories
More than movies and TV believe me He knows your needs
He provided His only son
When we ain't deserve it
He loves you on your worst days
You know He's perfect
So hold on, wait, be content
You got the greatest
You single, give it away cause your life was made for the maker
But you got it, it's a gift don't waste that
Temptation be looking good don't taste that

Heaven or Hell,Real Talk,2004.0,"Real talk
The word of God says that every man is appointed one time that he should die and then face judgment, think about it, where will you spend your eternity, up in heaven, or in hell?

They tell me Crae
Murk the track
Hurt the rap
Naw dawg
Let me pose a question to you
Have you heard of my Dad?
He purchased us back
Putting man's curse on His back
I worship for that
It's my whole purpose in fact
Purple and black
Is how He looked
I'm certain of that
And man I cry
When I think of how the curtain was cracked
But He rose in 3 days
That's a pertinent fact
And since He created and saved me
I serve Him for that
I read His Word all the time
So He stay on my mind
Flesh rise all the time
So I stay on the grind
When it's time to go to heaven
I don't pray I'm in line
I'm 100% positive
I'm waiting for mine
Ain't no if's, and's or but's
Who's or what's
You walking away from Christ man
You losing touch
Take away
You add some man
You doing too much
The world's feet rushing to evil
Pursuing their lusts

I hope that y'all listening well
It's only two places to dwell
(Heaven or hell)
And if you representing the first
I pray you representing it well
(Heaven or hell)
I hope that y'all listening well
It's only two places to dwell
(Heaven or hell)
And if you representing the first
I pray you representing it well

Some of y'all got it twisted
Hell, why risk it?
Life, can be fixed through Christ, I'm a witness
And I don't care about 5 mics or a hit list
I'm getting kinda used to getting dissed as a Christian dawg
Let's get one thing straight, out the gate
I'm the type of dude that'll put a slab of truth on your plate
And I don't care if ya heard it twice
I ain't tripping if ya just left church
You heard of Christ?
Let me tell you what was told to me
6 hours on a cross while His holy blood flowed for me
What you know about a sacrifice?
Would you step off the throne
For the same one that snatched your life?
Let me tell you dawg, Christ is real
Without Him you got nothing
You're living off of life's appeal
Make Him Lord and your life is sealed
Cause y'all on death row
Talking bout you kinda like the deal

I hope that y'all listening well
It's only two places to dwell
(Heaven or hell)
And if you representing the first
I pray you representing it well
(Heaven or hell)
I hope that y'all listening well
It's only two places to dwell
(Heaven or hell)
And if you representing the first
I pray you representing it well
(Heaven or hell)

Because of our sin we're separated from God, and that's why we deserve hell, but Christ said if you trust in Him for eternal life, you shall receive heaven

Aye yo, I might have to bleed for this
I'm not ashamed of Christ
It's Romans 1:16 for this
And I don't care if I'm blinded dawg
Every time I trip and fall
I just be reminded dawg
And you call yourself grinding dawg?
You can serve more birds than Church's
But you still dying dawg
I don't care what city you from
Whether from the suburbs or from the slums
Christ still gon come
Matter of fact if He come now
You can be a 6'8
Heavy-weight
But your knees gon bow
Ain't no telling Him to ease on down
When that trump sound and (blow)
Everybody see that ground
And I don't care about fame or wealth
Put my God on a shelf?
Naw dawg, I rather hang myself
Forgive me if I can't contain myself
Cause if you died and you didn't hear the Gospel
I'd blame myself

I hope that y'all listening well
It's only two places to dwell
(Heaven or hell)
And if you representing the first
I pray you representing it well
(Heaven or hell)
I hope that y'all listening well
It's only two places to dwell

New Reality,Rehab,2010.0,"Dear you, Yeah you
The person listenin'
It's God usin' me, tryna' get your attention, yeah
See, He remembers the first day that He made you
Moldin' your lungs for the breath that He gave you
Not to mention the day He saved you
Or when He opened your eyes by the Spirit, Christ was raised through
Did I mention that He forgave you?
And had His flesh ripped off for the sin you was a slave to?
Now it seems you're too far gone
You wanna turn back, but you're not sure if you'll be welcome home
So you figure you'll just leave it alone
But you're addicted to yourself, we both know you can't see it alone
This is an intervention, Jesus intervened
He intercedes on behalf of a sinner's deeds
This is an intervention, because the Lord hurts
Before it gets worse, stomach another verse

Most times I'm paying no attention
Lose my direction
All I chase is vanity
I forget I've been forgiven
Your love I've been given
Your grace on me lavishly
You were born on earth
On my cross You died for me (cross you died)
Forgive my depravity
Lord You are my reality
Yeah

Cold water we drink
Hot water we cook
But lukewarm does nothin' it just sits and it looks
And that's you,
 imagine these as the words of Christ
I remember you love Me, I remember your light
It used to shine bright, but now it's so dim
It used to be about Us, but now its 'bout them
You can't win playin' heart games
But I love you even when your lights off in your dark shame
When you lay down and profane Me
Or when your bloodstream contains the things that would defain me
When nobody knows that you claim Me
Or when you mess your life up, get mad, and wanna blame Me
I still want you back
I won't punish you
I took that on the cross because I wanted you
I might discipline and chastise
But if you got what you deserve you'd be in hell with other bad guys


You made it this far
And thats a big move
But your addiction is hurtin' your other friends too
Some of 'em miss you
Some of 'em dissed you
But they was hurtin', strugglin' to forgive you
And they hated how addiction got the best of you
Chose a lie when God promised the best for you
If you realize you livin' in sin
Just confess and realize you're forgiven of sin",https://genius.com/Lecrae-new-reality-lyrics
The Good Life,Rehab: The Overdose,2011.0,"We can live it

Yeah, so we can live it
Yeah, that good life
That good life
Now, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, good life

What he need God for? He got money to the Heavens
Never pulled a 187, but he preach it like a reverend
Never satisfied with second
Except for second home, second car
Second woman his own, second bottle from the bar
Good life, even though he got it, he don't get it
Cause he living for the moment, but this moment has an ending
Matter fact, it's been a minute, all he see is pretty women
Big lights big names, in a minute that'll change... BANG!
Caught up in an all-consuming flame
All alone, still rejecting Jesus' Name
Even if he could change he would never do it
Grandma told him 'bout living water, he prefer the sewage
He don't know why he do it, desire just enslaved him
Addicted to himself, do whatever just to praise him
Give himself the money, pleasure and treasure that'll rust
When he traded his eternity for 20 years of lust

Where the bottles go pop, models go shop
Everyone knows who you are
But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off
You see it all was false
But that's the good life
Lights, camera, action
Where is the satisfaction?
Good life...
Black diamonds and gold
Living highest when you live on the low

I take the narrow route, that speedway's a monster
It's all good, I go to sleep without a guilty conscience
For that they call me conscious,
 but I'm very conscious
Of what I'm missing, I ain't tripping on the girls in VIP
Fronting for each other
They actin' like they something that they not, they undercover
Trying to get under covers, but one day they'll discover
They gave parts of themselves away that they'll never recover
A part time lover, took a full-time pay
God please show her mercy, her affliction's here to stay
She just found out she pregnant and the child has been infected
 (my Lord)
What's worse is that, she'll never meet the guy that she rejected
The one that can protect her, comfort her to the grave
And resurrect her body to live with Jesus who saves
Can't say that God ain't love her, she wanted to be a slave
This is a crew master, leaving 'em full of pain
But hey this is the good life....


50 years from now, he may be full of gray hair, beard long
And even closer to a home that he's never known
Right now his home facing 25-to life
Sitting in the county jail, court appointed lawyer like
If this case is Tina Turner, homie, I am not Ike
Got his momma crying daily but she praying every night
Only 20 but there's plenty that he's paying with his rights
Thought he got a life sentence but he really got life
He done read that bible twice
Been in plenty fights, sleepless nights
But when he trusted Christ you could see that change overnight
Knew he'd die in prison but was living for another life
Every time his lights out he closer to the other side
Partners on the outside think he found religion as a
Coping mechanism when he say the Lord's risen
Now he lay awake in prison, praying for his homies in the streets
Cause truth is, he's free-er than they gon' ever be....


We can live it, that good life
Yeah, so we can live it
Yeah, that good life
That good life
Now, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, good life",https://genius.com/Lecrae-the-good-life-lyrics

But I ain't got no excuse (no)
It's time to play my part
Yeah, so better get up (yeah)
It's time to hit the road (let's go)
Been rehabilitated
Rest for my weary soul
Cause yeah my life control
Death had my life on hold
A strong addiction to myself is all that's been unfolded
I would live for me
I made myself an altar
I sacrificed myself
For lust I was a martyr
For pride I gave my heart up
Now my heart's been changed
Made a deep incision
You made a heart exchange
Tore down all my idols
Now help me fight to live
Moment after moment
My life is yours to give
Able to forgive
Your love is my only hope
Without it I'm left empty
Looking for ways to cope
Was doped up, coped up, now I woke up
I used to date destruction
But now we broke up
And I get choked up
I'm drowning in your grace
Who would have thought that red cross would rehabilitate? (yeah)

I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
I'm coming home tonight
I'm coming home tonight

Yeah (Because) I was living my life away (away)
Not knowing that I was making my home a grave
(I was) Killing myself
(Slowly) wasting away
(Just) moments from death
Taking lust in my vein
But I stopped living my life today (today)
Cause I found a sponsor who can show me His way
(So I'm) packing my bags
(And I'm) hitting the road
(Putting my) foot on the gas
You know I'm coming, coming home",https://genius.com/Lecrae-release-date-lyrics

It’s Your World,After the Music Stops,2006.0,"I know I'm not fit or deserving to do this
But I'm foolish
If I don't spit to give you Godly influence
Like a student
Practice and prudence will you walk with me through this
As I give my feeble attempt at glorifying Yeshua
Cause He
Is the beginning everything came into being
By His being the being who created all other beings
We're MCing
Due to His benevolent freeing, decreeing
He's the almighty creator of everything that we're seeing
There is none like Him
If you don't like Him then He'll use the liking of liking Himself to acquire just to delight Him
That's why I write Hymns
My right hand used to write sin, battlin' Tim like I was shai linne
And now despite sin
I give praise the God who made sunny days
To white lightening
It's quite frightening
To sing ""Whose world is this"" without proper enlightenment

He use intelligent design
Like eloquence confined
Life elements assigned by
Elohim my God
He left his fingerprints
You thinking that our origins are coincidence
Our symmetry alone makes evolution look ridiculous
And since our complexity is more than irreducible
The fact our design had a designer is irrefutable
I use a science tool to make a statement like this
The existence of an atheist proves God exists
He's the owner
Holding the throne
Potent and strong
He smote any foe approaching Him on bolens alone
But since he up-rose he told us to go on this road
Shown my a knowledge foretold
Spoken by prophets of old
The total opposite role
Chosen by populace goes
Down to the hottest abode
Total apocalypse bro
That's why we're rocking it yo
Hand these sounds to the proudest man
God has brought you in this world and he can sure take you out of it

You should already know who's running it
Brotha you don't want it
He made it in six but he'll only take one to crumble it
The earth rumbles at the sound of his mumbling
He flooded it once but with Noah he made a covenant
So the next time he's gonna be coming with flames
His antagonists don't know what they're up against
The tongue of The Last Adam who's rapping will smash men
Now holds together every last atom
And that ain't even the sum of it
Matter of fact you could handle the half I'm only giving you some of it
But it's still enough of it for you to come to grips
With the fact that it's His planet you own none of it
So please consider how dumb it is
To take comfort in the momentary status you have and the stuff you get
He'll blaze it up in the end you can trust it kid
But we ain't bugging cause there's another one coming you dig

The earth was so impressed with His defeat of the grave
The ground did the Harlem shake the ocean did the wave
No longer enslaved now that I see the Lord
And God is so deep He causes hurricanes when He brainstorms
I switched teams me and Crae got traded on the same night
Same conference same sermon by James White
The light of Christ is a blazing one
I'm evidence that His Grace is amazing son
Man continues to overvalue his worth
Spends most of his time trying to conquer the earth
That kind of action only leaves you empty or hurt
Then you see your true value when you return to the dirt
$5000 casket, $500 clothes
6 months for the grieving 1 year to decompose
I've yet to find a human who can outlive the curse
While God sits in the Heaven, place his feet on the earth",https://genius.com/Lecrae-its-your-world-lyrics

Fear cheers hears to the ears you can count
Or the ones that you can't though
Unashamed of the faith that i bank on

Only one God: Father, Son, and the Sprit
Father made plans and His Son came and did that
Born of a virgin and died on a Pilate

Im headed to party where the lights at

2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards Spoken Word Performance,UnKnown,2016.0,"They tellin' us make “America Great Again”
I'm like hol' up, when was America great again?
Was it when they took us from our native land?
Or maybe it was when they took the natives’ land?
Let me be quiet, nah
'Cause being silent is pitiful
It's something I never do
After Philando, man, I'm wondering where was you?
They ask for your opinion
All you thinking is revenue, never do
I pray to God He make you a better you
Now, I know
Some of us we don’t know who we are
We’re too content with the gold and the cars
We got low self-esteem chasing dreams
With a goal in our heart
But society then drove us apart
Look at us from sellin' dope to our own kind
To a dope rhyme
Radio then played it more times
Paid in more dimes to some industry exec
Getting checks from a private prison
With the rap money he invest
Now, I know you’re like is this rap or is this gospel
Look, all you need to know is that I was blind
Now I’m not though
Real recognize real
If they don’t love me like 'Pac
They gon' respect how I'm moving
And then I'm never gonna stop
'Cause we was taken from Africa
Sold and treated like animals
Culturally denigrated and separated from families

Business unfinished plus my ending's got an appendix
Menace to your society, lyrics full of sobriety
Body me if you don't like these policies that I be lobbying
Sick of seeing them hollow hearted get swallowed by Audemars and automatics
I manually give them the manual and I know they panic
When I say Jesus or Emmanuel
Partna I was a cannibalistic fallible animal
People looking for change and they fooled us into thinking it was Franklin
You only get one shot and you drank it
The lost art of thinking coupled with our depravity
Got me praying he'll free us from this Gravity
Now on a lighter note I hope that they bring back 'The Wire'

Wish It Wasn’t True,Rehab: Deluxe Edition,2011.0,"Uhh, you I, umm
I know I just got out of rehab, but uh
I actually need to be checked back in. Yeah
I didn't think this was gonna happen to me... man...
Feel like I'm back in that dark place
Somewhere in between a rock and a hard place
And I ain't doin nothin' bad, I'm just doin' bad
Feelin' empty when I got more than I done ever had
So I'ma do what I do best when I feel depressed
Go ahead and let my pen bleed out the stress
In the margins, me and wifey arguin'
I don't remember why, but basically I ain't washin' her in Ephesians 5
She get out of line, I don't show her grace
I get a pen and I trace her
Now we need an eraser
I'm like, God, give me a sermon or a verse
Anything to break the curse; I feel like it's getting worse
But it's like for every step up in the right direction
Come with two swift punches to my midsection
I get discouraged and I question is it really worth it
Maybe tryin' to change the world isn't really my purpose
I wish it wasn't true
But it is, though
Now the kids know
I'm not a hero, but I know somebody who is, though
I wish it wasn't true
But it's very true
And if it's scaring you
Look in the mirror, see my reflection instead of you
I can settle and be suburban, put down the Spurgeon
Be concerned with keepin' my home furnished
Now my fire burns only for my own advancement
Forget a passion for the pastors in Sudan
The kids in Afghanistan, who be losin' their dads
They took a stand, saying that Christ is more than a man
Man, I got the blues
I ain't got a clue how to get 'em another hue
All I wanna do is escape with a cold brew
Go to sleep and wake up and pretend that it's all cool
I wish it wasn't true
But ain't no quick fix on the wish list
Trials make you better while they make you sick, yeah
I was dyin' to try
Now I'm dying from trying
Now I'm trying to die
To the lies I'm buying
I wish it wasn't true
But it is, though
Now the kids know
I'm not a hero, but I know somebody who is, though
I wish it wasn't true
But it's very true
And if it's scaring you
Look in the mirror, see my reflection instead of you
How come I wait till I'm downcast and gray
Before I think, Lecrae, you may wanna pray
You may wanna walk in that library
Get one of them commentaries
See what them old dudes got to say
But it's easy to push play on the YouTube video or the Vimeo
Escape from the menial, letting all these subliminal messages
Wash me, watch me as I watch these
People tell me what I can purchase just to wash these
Blues away, functional savior, I'm getting mine
It's $19.99 for a limited time
Besides, after that I'm sure that I'll be feeling fine
- Ok, I'm lying. Really I'm just dying to try
And for the 55th time times 9
I'm disappointed looking for anything but the divine
Save me from what I'm feelin' inside, it's like a crime
How I end up in the same place every single time

I don't understand it all, but I know who oversees
I'm in the sky lookin' down at the Pacific Ocean
Hopin' the Father's arms are open for the broke and hopeless
Touch down, all around is the evidence
His power takes precedence over all of these elements
Blue seas, cool breeze under palm trees
Spirit calls me as I'm readin' through Psalm 3
We don't know much 'bout the place we hope we'll all be
All we, heard about heaven is it's beyond dreams
Set your heart on above, that's what the Word say
But we don't know a thing about it except our hearsay
Hear-say, clear lay, I play with word form
But with the Word I ain't playin' like some benchwarmers
Revelation 21 and Psalm 11:4
And Luke 20:36, gon' get it for 'em

I ain't gotta get myself together cause He already fixed me up
And I'm going in, I'm going in
No I don't have to pack no bags, fill up on gas
He's already got my pass, yeah, yeah
And I'm going in

Yeah, I'm going in, I promise ain't nothin' stoppin' me
Biblical prophecy shaping up my theology
And I don't live for the money, give it all away
Hey where I'm goin' I know it can't follow anyway
I'm tryin' to live in the image I was created in
Earth was perfect, He said it'll be that way again
Then, we'll be really dancing with the stars
I might just hang out on the Moon, take a trip to Mars
Ours, will be a new Heaven, new Earth
A new life inherited through a new birth
It's new mountains, new sky, and some new seas
A new body where I can do plenty new things
The deaf hear, and the blind see a new scene
And everyone is in the presence of the true King
No fears, no tears, just cheers
For the Father, Son, and Spirit, you can hear us getting near


(I'm cool y'alll I got my pass) I'm going in and
Swoope is chucking deuces, peace to this life of Hell
I get peace through the gates of Heaven
I'm too geeked, I get life as well
As soon as I get home my faith is evince
I know it was Your plan to carry me
Through this World it's cold man, you garried me
I'm dead to the old man, I buried me
The bridegroom now holds hands and marries me
I'm sick of this single life
The weight weighs, over time
I'm sick of regina knights
Sick of just walking blind
Sick of the shingles life
Livin' in the shades
When the burden I need is light
The burden you give is life
Ready to move on up, lookin' for Weezie's life
Where I'm livin' is prison, I'm sick of the wheezy life
In jail with no pen pals

Leap of Faith,UnKnown,2006.0,"Uh-Oh! Whoa-Oh! Yeah!
Check this out y'all
This for all my faith leaders
All of y'all who are stepping out on faith
Sharing Christ with the world
You better step out too man
Let me explain to you what faith means
Check this out y'all

It's the assurance of things hoped for. Noah built a boat for
Jesus took a beatin' and his whole body was broke for
Spoke for. Through it we know who the Word was wrote for
Abraham had it, matter fact that's what he's known for
Faith, y'all, through it we were saved by grace
If you got it, we can see it by the way you run the races
That means we can see it on your face
If the faith don't act, then it really ain't faith
And that really ain't the case cause faith ain't fake
It'll have you trying to act out the Word every day
Every Christian has faith, it's a gift; we should use it
Some distort the view of it and others just abuse it
It can be irrational and make you give your life up
This is for the cause of Christ and not to get a nice truck
Righteous, when you know you gotta trust God
When it seems hard, man, faith is a must, dog

You gotta leap y'all (Leap with it!)
You gotta leap y'all (Leap with it!)
Take a leap of faith
You gotta leap y'all (Leap with it!)

Before you heard ""Breath In"", ""Represent! Get Krunk! ""
I was tested in my faith, and I didn't know if I could jump
I was at my 9-to-5 try'na make a couple dimes
But something in my soul was saying that I had to rhyme
I was rappin every saturday, teachin on Sunday
8 A.M. again I'm back to work another Monday
Man I was hating it, I wasn't even fakin it
And then came opportunity, but me, I wasn't taking it
Show after show came; a couple folks came
But leaving work to rap was risky like the dope game
My mama mad at me, she say that it was bad for me
To spend my time in school just to rap, what a tragedy
Alot of free shows, but I had to pay bills
Lord, you know I wanna go, but can you show me what you will
I wasn't chasing rap dreams, wasn't try'na stack green
God had my back against a wall like a flat screen
Urging me to trust, Lord I wanna, but I'm scared to
Lord, I'm prepared to be broke, just to share you
So I followed Abraham. I told the Lord to take my hand
I took a leap of faith, and I ain't never been the same again


Move around with it. Get krunk with it
Go ahead everybody, just jump with it
Jump for me now, jump for me now
Jump jump

Jump for me now

I wouldn't trade it for nothin the long nights long flights for nothin
I mean I'm sittin in the airport writin cousin
No I never woulda thought in all my wildest dreams
I'da seen all of the things I seen
I mean I seen Katrina she came through hungry
Took anotha city where desire is from ye
Cuz only 2 yrs back we came 2 share that
Glorious gospel seen em holdin they tears back
Now we got New Orleans in our backyard God is good
Cuz a few whoadies got saved since dey been in my hood
And we got 2 show em love wit our time & money
But for me, yea it was more time than money
But if time is money then I must be broke
Cuz i love 2 get it in wit people after the show
We talk dispensations and covenants why for the love of it
Me me yeah I'm lovin it we should be lovin it
Feel the power when ya reach the unreachable (the unreachable Lord)
But there's more here than just the physical (just the physical God)
The best when ya complete with the impossible
Make me invisible, you're visible
Lord erase me if I ever turned and lived for myself
Cuz your glory's infinitely greater than my personal health
And Lord I know I'm not worthless you give me my worth
But I know I'm not perfect to lolly the earth
And can't nobody do it like the way u do
Usin me and my whole crew to reach the world for you
And it's true they watchin everything that we do
Yeah its true that we're an illustration of you
I look at verse 26 in Genesis chapter 1
It says I'm lookin like my daddy the more i follow the son
And the more i follow the son all my days look brighter
Cuz he placed a hope within me got me feelin all excited
Got me feelin like a writer like B on the train (whatup BJ)
Standin up and tellin everybody Christ is King (Jesus)
If ya see me on the TV or the world wide web
Know that I be givin Christ da cred
I know why some people see me but I don't trip
I pray the Lord will keep me focused on a missional tip
And use this music as a tool to get Christ inside of your dome
I can't just say it on the mic I gotta do it at home
Feel the power when ya reach the unreachable (the unreachable Lord)
But there's more here than just the physical (just the physical God)
The best when ya complete with the impossible
Make me invisible, you're visible
Your boy ain't a rap star, I'm nothin like Jay-Z or Game
I got a funny soundin name and I don't wanna be famous
I don't make a lotta change, my heart has been changed
I just wanna know Jesus mayn, to make it plain
It's like I got a message penetratin my soul
It's the wisdom the Father gives regeneratin my soul
I'm sold on being soled that the glory is his
I'm trippin that he would even make me 1 of his kids
Get credit for so much but the credit ain't ours
My God how can I tell em this in sixteen bars
Prepare a phrase tear a page share a stage
But no I could never fully communicate your glory alone
And at home i pray we'd all be some regular dudes
Find a ministry we can share in while speakin these truths
I'm grateful that you know me if you send me i'll go
Lord I'm dyin to serve and I'm livin to know you
Feel the power when ya reach the unreachable (the unreachable Lord)
But there's more here than just the physical (just the physical God)
The best when ya complete with the impossible
Make me invisible, you're visible
You're visible...",https://genius.com/Lecrae-invisible-lyrics
The Truth [After the Music Stops],After the Music Stops,2006.0,"This life is it with no skins and thicks and no sense of Patrone
We got Jesus when they see us they think we drunk, dawg
All o' because we be wildin' and jumpin', screamin' now Represent
Get crunk, throw it up. What's up? Jesus! You know we reppin' Him
We were called and chosen but our hearts were frozen rollin' with satan, mayne
Tryin to trust in the lust in the flesh and our eyes our pride was hatin', mayne
But our God is rich in mercy, Mercy! - great in Love
We were dead in sin but Christ bled for sin and that's how He raised us up
Now our life looks bright in the sight of the Almighty Christ paid the price
It's all right, see He gave His life that we-all-might be saved from our plight
And we don't have to guess what's next when death comes right up at our door
We'll be excited to go, It's the delight of our soul
That's why I'm pressin' ya'll, Don't-be-second guessin', ya'll
Every breath we breathe this side of heaven is a blessin', ya'll
So I ain't stressin' ya'll. This is confession, ya'll
Jesus is the Truth! That's why me and my crew be reppin', ya'll

This is the Church; you need to jump back (Jump Back!)
We got the Truth you know you want that (Want That!)

We reppin' Jesus 'til He come back (Come Back!)

We reppin' Jesus 'til He come back (Come Back!)
Until he come back (Come back)

Right back in the club ' What's Up? ' I'm still goin' plead my case ta' God!
Christ is the Saviour by Who sin has been erased for ya'll
Okay I'm chasin ya'll but-don't-think I'm crazy, braw!
Cause there's an abundance of grace I'd like to explain to ya'll!
Look! Don't trip!
What to eat what to drink cause you know God got this
See once you know Him you're adopted in
At this point God is your Father, call Him Abba, Pappa, Faja (Faja?) Faja
Come on now! We're collected and chosen' predestined just to behold Him
Now I've got joy From my shoulders on down to my Achilles'
I don't need money for-ever Get self eternal inheritance
Spiritual rags ta' riches like Beverly Hillbillies'... So I'
Spend a coupla' days and been amazed me tryin ta' figure out the jist of this!
God saved and forgave me I ain't have ta' work a lick for this?!
And you might just trip on this'. aside from these benefits
You know the God who made us from dust and plus He'll make the change in this

This is the Church; you need to jump back (Jump Back!)
We got the Truth you know you want that (Want That!)
All that confusion you can dump that (Dump That!)
We reppin' Jesus 'til He come back (Come Back!)

We reppin' Jesus 'til He come back (Come Back!)
Until he come back (Come back)

What an honor' despite the drama life has to offer
We follow the Father not flirty mommas and dirty dollars
So keep the karma cause really we don't believe in that
Psychic folks and horoscopes: no! we won't be needing that
Hey, dawg, where Jesus at? Cause I been fiendin', black!
Ta' see His face at the Second Coming, I’m meaning that
It's cause I'm heeding' that call that He gave me to
Learn His ways and turn and pass it on to a faithful few
That's why I'm lovin'-the-life that-I'm-livin'so I can preach the Truth
Teach the youth and I pray to God this is reaching you
I'm seeking to explain things that may seem Greek to you
God desires our satisfaction to be in Jesus, dude
Believe me, you or believe you me just believe in this
A life reflecting the glory of God you needing this
In-a-moment in-a'second in-a twinkling of-an-eye
All the dead gonna arise and we gonna fly!

Nothin’,Real Talk,2004.0,"I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spitting on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spitting on the mic tonight

Ayo, I'll probably never be the type to spend two bucks on Von Dutch
But I wanna touch hearts to help the man up scene
I come to do what the Lord say
Got my lifestyle flipped to fit His forte
I'm up early, like moms and grits
Getting fed, daily bread, till my mind is Script
And my rhymes' intent
Is the point straight at the cross
Without using clever lines and hints
I know you'd probably be impressed if I cleverly used my melodies
To share Christ without using His name heavily
But I'd rather be
Saying His name so much, you could never get me confused or discredit me
Cause I don't wanna do this, I used to be a Judas
It's only Christ in me that got me tryin' to make it through this
I'm giving up time, giving a rhyme
Cause it ain't about me getting mine
Dawg, I'm nothing

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spitting on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spitting on the mic tonight

Ain't nothing sweet about me, dawg, but Christ within
Prior to that, your boy lived a life of sin
If you catch me giving up money, so folks can eat
It's really God working through me, dawg, I'm not that sweet
And it ain't a bone in my body that's naturally good
And, without the fruit of the Spirit, I'm actually hood
Basically, it ain't nothing great in me
But graciously, my God likes replacing me
With His own, characteristics, traits and things
The wages earned from sin, He erased them things
And gave me a new family tree
Now the Creator of creation Himself, related to me
So, if it seem like I shine bright in the limelight
Or I might think I'm tight man, it's a lie right
I'm gritty like J-Silas, guess my worth
Man without Christ Jesus, I'm less than dirt
I'm nothing

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spitting on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spitting on the mic tonight

Cats say they're gonna change the game
This is Christian rap
Why are they barely using the Savior's name?
Got flows, saying they rhyme is tight
Christ gave us breath to spit
God gave us the mind to write
We don't deserve to shine
Nah, we're just clay
I came to lift up Christ, and not what's my name?
When I drop this, flow might sound ridiculous
With Christ smack dab in the middle, so conspicuous, homie
Clever wordplay is not what the Word say
Christ and Him crucified, all day, e'ry day
But have it your way and blab your name
In Christ's eyes, you just trying to grab the fame
It's nothing but sound bites, nothing but loud pipes
Speaking in vain main, we're nothing without Christ
We should use our last breath to rep for King Jesus
You shouldn't have to know our name after we leave ya

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spitting on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things

I Am Restored,UnKnown,2020.0,"It's like
It's like the Devil tryna scare you
And then the angels come in and the angels
They let you know who's in charge

I tried living apart from God
At times I was feeling so far from God
My faith in these people done left me scarred
The hatred and hurt was so bizarre
I thought that he would always ride for me
I cried, but nobody replied to me
I questioned the truth inside of me
And right about then, was when the Devil had lied to me
Like: ""Hold up, God got you, He don't ever show up
All His people acting like they know you
Tell you that you do it for the money, fame, power, tryna blow up
Why you playing games? Time to grow up
You've been reading Bibles and leading studies and helping your little buddies
But tell me: what it's really doing for you?
They gon' still tell you're faking and phony inside
Assuming your every motive, so what's the point of tryna keep it loyal?
Stuff you had faith in, you're starting to race bait
Can't even take dates, you hoping to save faith
Trying to go mainstream in order to reach folk
Ain't nobody rocking with you, especially these folks""
I lost it, why I'm drinking liquor in my closet?
I used to pray in here, but now I'm saucy
I'm losing money, I'm a lost prophet
I'm making bad decisions, every time I get exhausted
Lord, I don't even really know the real me now
Demons got me tripping, tryna kill me now
Satan tryna figure who can help get delivered
Send an angel in a Uber, come and heal me now
Evil, you ain't got no control of me
I'm never too far from the blood to flow from me
I lost a lot, but got too much to gain, I'll prolly never be the same

King Intro,After the Music Stops,2006.0,"Lets establish that He's Israel's King
So in Matthew 1:1 and on to 1:17
We see His lineage and trace way back into time
That legally He was fine in the Davidic line
And genealogically He's still King of the Jews
Cause the Book of Luke exposes genetical clues
See a true King
Though He didn't do it in the physical
He brought a new covenant to free em in the spiritual
And after sometime
Wise men from the East came
Looking for the new born King in the streets
I know some of you dudes may cruise a 4Runner
But Christ had a dude to use as a forerunner
No promotor don't cut it like John the Baptist
You need publicity stunts so you dating an actress
A real King got somebody bringing the news
That His kingdom's ahead and they ain't fit to lace up His shoes
So tell me who's anointing all these so called kings?
They all self-proclaimed and mayne
That's a dangerous thing",https://genius.com/Lecrae-king-intro-lyrics

I only got one life to live and I'mma live it
I only got one life to live and I'mma live it
I only got one life to live and I'mma live it
Filled with the spirit of God theres no limit
So I dream
I Dream(7x)
I wanna be used by Christ in some way
Maybe it's to change a life someday
I Dream(8x)

Dream Big
One Life
One Lord
One Christ
One summer
It may not be your last one
But what you gonna do
To make it better then the last one
I used to think I was nothing in the Lord's eyes
I ain't know enough to be one of the Lord's guys
(at all)
Knew a little bible
Knew a little verses
Never made disciples
I was so observant
Other people who seemed to be doing big things
For the Lord, I guess that he gave them big dreams
A man will remind
Im feeling so behind
They say the young will see visions
But man Im feeling so blind
But then I heard of David
Taking down Goliath
Small thing to a giant
But he stilled tried it
What if I can fight it?
What if I can find it?
The heart to trust in God and dream in strength that he provided
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
So I tried
Took a step
Went left - right - left - right - left (right - left)
It's unbelievable a God worked through me
And all I had to do was to dream that he can use me
Whatcha dreaming?
Whatcha dreaming?
Whatcha dreaming about?
Dream Bigger
You don't know what God can bring about
Dream of being the player
That will lead a team to Christ
Dream of being a doctor
Who leads a team to life
Dream of Muslim nations
Turn to worship Jesus
Dream of shattered families
Stop pick up the pieces
Dream of God
Using you up in the glass holes
And share the truth of Christ
Before they see they last fall
Dream Big
Dream Large
Dream Hard
Dream God
He will do it, he can
And he said he will
Ask me how I know (how you know?)
Because I read his will

Finally Free,Rehab: Deluxe Edition,2011.0,"Lord I pray
You wash away
All these things
I’ve got on me Cause
I’m afraid to walk away
From the man
I used to be
So break away all these chains
So I can finally be free I’m finally free (2x)
They go platinum around the world
I go wood in the hood Still good if
I can’t be what they think I should Shoot
I used to work security that was my night job
Hating every minute of it hoping
We got robbed Mad at my bosses
Taking plenty losses
Sick of seeing these drug dealers riding by flossing
What I go to school for? Just to pay these school loans?
Plotting on the hustle but I’m knowing that ain’t cool though
One of my friends got sentenced for years
I ain’t right enough I was being selfish it’s clear Yo E if you listening I apologize I was running from the old me
Tryna follow Christ You was with me in them streets
You took them blows for me
The least I could done was try to hold you down my G
I got love for you hoping you see what happened in time
We both guilty I just been acquitted of mine
I’m free
Lord I pray
You wash away
All these things
I’ve got on me Cause
I’m afraid to walk away
From the man

So break away
All these chains
So I can finally be free

Hey yo this verse is for my siblings
Wish that we was closer
Momma said she think that it will happen
When we older But truth be told
We would prolly be close
If the old me was still here but now
He’s a ghost I know
I was the catalyzer starting all the trouble And now my life changed and I'm steady on the hustle
Be wanting to call more but I don't know what to say
But your name is on my lips every night that I pray
Know you thinking I'm a preacher man
I'm just tryna live in the light of the son who's so faithful to forgive
Wasn't first to get married but I'm first to have kids
Let me be first to apologize for anything I did
It's hard to walk away from the only life that you know
The closer I get to God the more I learn and I grow
Hope you seeing my life you know I been changed
I ain't do this on my own man God intervened I'm free
Lord I pray
You wash away

From the man

So I can finally be free
I’m finally free (2x)
Lastly to every lady that I dated or manipulated
I hate to say it but my commitment was overrated
I was dedicated to being free
I thought that I could find it somewhere between you and me
But I was wrong I kept moving on treating you like an object
But you know that I've grown
I finally found the freedom unlike any I had known
You were never the problem it was me all along
And now I thank my wife for dealing with my past
Our covenant's 'til the death promised that we would last
If that was the old me the first sign of trouble I'd flee
Thank God I'm finally free that's real
Lord I pray
You wash away

I’ve got on me Cause
I’m afraid to walk away
From the man

The Earth is the footstool of God above
Check Isaiah 66 and face it bruh
We only significant because he raised us up

Propaganda Spittin’ Truth,Church Clothes,2012.0,"Ok, let me clear a couple things up for you...
And it might get weird
I know how this sounds
But we are not gospel rappers
We don't do Christian hip-hop
There is no such thing
Let me answer your facial expression with a question:
Is it possible for me to act black?
Is it possible for me to not act black?
Last time I checked my ""black"" don't come off
Homie, everything I say and do is black by default
And this might be confusing, a change-up
Just don't let your brain hang up
Our faith says our Savior came for people, not objects
You can love a car, you can nickname a teddy bear
But you know it's not alive, right?
You know it don't love you back
There's no such thing as Buddhist doughnuts
Christian napkins, or Muslim tennis shoes
Objects don't make statements of faith
I'm confused, isn't that obvious?
As obvious as we are clearly Christians
But rap ain't our ministry nor our calling
Whoa, we got the same call every Christian got
Whether a mailman, janitor, DJ, teacher
There's an endless possibility of vehicles you can drive down that straight and narrow path
Ain't one better than the other
And a vehicle is useless if there's no foot pressing the pedal
With a clear understanding of the destination
And a mastery of how to drive
Know what you believe, but don't write a rap 'til you won a couple battles
Respect the vehicle, respect the art
We are not gospel rappers
Did you ever hear Black On Both Sides?
The state of hip-hop is the state of its participants
Its life, its voice, its philosophy comes from the voices that give it life
Every rapper got a worldview that it brings to the table
We just throwing ours in the pot
And if God turns off our mics, then our rhymes come in sign language
Saying the same thing in the same vein of the construction worker
That pulled me to the side and said, ""God's got a plan for you""
It may seem like semantics
We know it's more to help the web hosts know how to file our albums
But if you minimize your worldview to a genre or vocation
You do God and the art a disservice and probably suck at both
Let me answer your question with a question:
Is the paper porn printed on unholy?
Do you magically become Mexican when you eat posolé?
I know, you think that's semantics
But them nuances matter
Like moving the decimal point on payroll checks
That tiny little dot packs a huge punch
It's the difference between rent money and lunch money
Tell me that ain't a big deal
I am not a gospel rapper
There is no such thing
I know how that sounds
But would it be absurd to say that a couch has a philosophy?
And the day I stop rapping is the day I stop believing in sovereignty
We are on our Dead Prez
Our faith, what it bigger than?
Our gospel is not a genre
It informs my every decision
This is who I am
Hip-hop is my culture
I am not a gospel rapper
I am a gospel liver",https://genius.com/Lecrae-propaganda-spittin-truth-lyrics

I was at my 9-to-5 try'na make a couple dimes
But somethin in my soul was sayin that I had to rhyme
I was rappin every saturday, teachin on Sunday
8 A.M. again I'm back to work another Monday
Man I was hatin it, I wasn't even fakin it
And then came opportunity, but me, I wasn't takin it
Show after show came; a couple folks came
But leavin work to rap was risky like the dope game
And mama mad at me, she say that it was bad for me
To spend my time in school just to rap, what a tragedy
Alot of free shows, but I had to pay bills
Lord, you know I wanna go, but can you show me what you will
I wasn't chasin rap dreams, wasn't try'na stack green
God had my back against a wall like a flat screen
Urgin me to trust, Lord I wanna, but I'm scared to
Lord, I'm prepared to be broke, just to share you
So I followed Abraham. I told the Lord to take my hand
I took a leap of faith, and I ain't never been the same agin
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap wit it!)
You gotta leap ya'll (Leap wit it!)
Take a leap of faith

The sinners love me 'cause I'm helping 'em heal

It’s Yours,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, 2 Timothy
When I think about the book, man, I think about legacy
And our legacy as Christians is the truth of God
God has entrusted us with His truth
Wants us to pass it down from generation to generation
And that's what Paul was doing to young Timothy
Expected Timothy to continue the movement
Passin the truth of God down
My time on earth is short, I know I've seen my final days
I thank the Lord above and for you every night I pray
I remember your tears - you bring me plenty joy
Your faith was real ever since you was a younger boy
So keep the movement going - you gotta stand firm
Don't be ashamed of the truth, and let your flame burn
They got me locked down, but we'll never stop now
Not now - look at all this truth that was brought down
And you've been taught now - you gotta pass it on
Invest your life into others so this'll last long
I'll be livin' through you, you'll be livin' through them
They'll continue to do what you taught til the end
And everything I taught to you, teach to faithful men
And make sure they're faithful, otherwise they won't teach again
And everything I taught to you, teach to faithful men
And make sure that they're faithful, otherwise they may not teach again
Now, I've been runnin' this race for some time
Now I hand it off to you 'cuz it's the end of my life
I'm prayin' that, oh, wherever you roam
Know you'll never walk alone, oh no
Keep your faith in the Word of the Lord
Teachin' men to worship Christ is what we live for
Then give it back like I'm givin' to you
The time is yours, it's yours
You're a soldier - follow your orders to fight
Don't get caught up in wordly ways, you're on a mission for Christ
Be an athlete - that means you're runnin' to win
You gotta train and follow rules to finish well at the end
And like a farmer, know the soils of man's souls
So when you're sowin' their hearts, you know what seeds to sow
And like a workman, you're not ashamed of your life
'Cuz you rightly divided truth before you reigned with the Christ
And like a bondslave, you have no will of your own
Just follow the will of God until you kneel at the throne
These are the last days for men, the lovers of pleasure
They don't seek God's treasure and they change with the weather
But you know my life, you know my faith
You walked in my shoes, you looked in my face
Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, too
I was beaten down 'cuz this is the truth, this is the truth
Now, I've been runnin' this race for some time
Now I hand it off to you 'cuz it's the end of my life
I'm prayin' that, oh, wherever you roam
Know you'll never walk alone, oh no
Keep your faith in the Word of the Lord
Teachin' men to worship Christ is what we live for
Then give it back like I'm givin' to you
The time is yours, it's yours
These are my last words, this is my last phrase
These are my last thoughts, these are my last days
My life's invested in you, just as Jesus did for me
And through you, I live also - continue on with this legacy
Your prayer for me - carry out the evidence of this love
And let the truth you learned in youth that you're convinced
Yes sir - God inspired these words to teach you (teach you)
So you'll know the truth and it could reach you (reach you)
Then it reproves you and it beats you
Corrects you and straightens you up just where it needs to
Then it instructs you, it disciplines and trains you
In righteousness, so you're equipped to be who God has made you
And what I gave you is more than my words
It's my life transferred since the day we conferred
So preach the Word, in and out of season - the reason
Is Jesus - believe that I seen Him, they need Him
Now, I've been runnin' this race for some time
Now I hand it off to you 'cuz it's the end of my life
I'm prayin' that, oh, wherever you roam
Know you'll never walk alone, oh no
Keep your faith in the Word of the Lord
Teachin' men to worship Christ is what we live for
Then give it back like I'm givin' to you

I'm riding round and I’m getting’ it; they riding round pretendin’
I been had it, I been done, I promise that it's all empty
They say they ridin’ Bugatti's, man
Put some babies through college
Quit tryna’ act like the trap is cool
‘Cause we tired hearin’ that garbage
Hey, bags of white, pints of lean
I been on dope boys since a teen
But this ain't what we meant to be
And y'all don't make no sense to me
You pump fakin’, ain't shootin’, ain't killin, ain't doin’
Half them thangs you say you doin’, but 116 we stay true an’
Ain't dope dealin’, ain't Po pimpin’, talkin’ ‘bout my own folk killin’
We on that Jesus soul healin’, so serious, gorillas
Wild ain’t we, can't tame us, been changed, can’t change us
1:16 – You can’t shame us. Live that truth; you can't blame us

I heard him say he bought the block (Fakin!)
In his song he say he gansta’ but he not (Fakin!)
Say he makin’ money, cashin’ big checks (Fakin!)
While his chain leavin’ green on his neck (Fakin!)
I’m not impressed
So I guess that make you, yes that make you
That make you a faker!(x4)

If you catch me in a bar where the wild things are
With my pastor and an entourage who loves God
Please don't think that it's odd, we kick it 'round broken hearts
Fishing for men, surrounded by sin but ain't taking part
I talk about Jesus, all the Christians love me
I walk like Jesus now they wanna judge me, ain't it funny?
I'm duckin' stones thrown from the Pharisees
Gospel of peace up on my feet like a pair of cleats
Walkin' with the Paraclete, that's Greek for the Spirit
They say the wild things'll eat you up
Who shall I fear when God is walking with me
If I die that's a win, that's the seed of the church plus I get to be with Him
And we so undefeated like Hanes made our sneakers
I had beef with Jesus and my sin it got deleted
So I gotta go and speak it to those who really need it
Let the Gospel off the leash, go and be where the beasts at


Real recognize real; introduce ya’ self
Careful with that cannon boy; you might just shoot ya’ self
Somebody wake em’, tell em’ to stop fakin’
Before they end up lyin’ in the woods buck naked
These killas fulla’ them demons, while you pretendin’ you Scarface
You ain't really no ghetto boy, why you fakin’ that hard face?
That just made him furious; somebody call Fishburne
Tell these boys in the hood 40 cal hits burn
And hell burns hotter, I turn to the Father
I prayin’, “Lord forgive em’ ‘cause they lyin’ like Mufasa
They got these eight’ graders with they eyes on a choppa
I pray the Lord save ‘em ‘fo He drop ‘em and make ‘em stop it",https://genius.com/Lecrae-fakin-bird-lyrics

If nights start getting cold would you stay around?
When life starts getting hard could you fly above the fire?
Or would you rather take an easy road to get to where we are?

Hope, a four letter word, seldom heard
Yes plenty we can use but this ones sorta preferred
And everybody want it but for many it won't occur
'Cause they hoping they can see it but most of they vision blurred
People hopin happy hour will get 'em talking in slurrs
'Cause tonight is Friday night and on Monday is back to work
Baby sister got a job and she hoping to lose hers
'Cause she deal with losers who hopin to use her
Drop her back off at the club, treat her like whose her
She just workin and then she hopin to pay for her school search
I guess hopin in the dope but they hopeless abusers
Hope is what you do when you can't see into the future
See my hope is not a verb, my hope is found in a noun
Mommas think that cap and gowns is the greatest hope to be found
Daddy's hope is in his zero, that's preceded by some commas
My cousins is marijuana, he hope to escape the drama-need

I see people flat out starving just hopin' to get a meal
People prostitute they music they hopin' for record deals
I'm hopin in what I know and they hopin in what they feel
But they feeling is never real it's belief
Nothing more than opinion, maybe something you think
Quicker than you could blink, hopin no hope at all
Soon as you get to flying you hopin that you don't fall
Your hope don't last forever, now you done hit a wall
But maybe something more but you hopin no hope at all
And now you are confused, cause you been paying dues
That cross more than you got, because that's in you got to lose
And you ain't gotta clue that you ain't got hope
You got a boat full of wishin' that won't float
And even when it does, it's only for a second I'm reckon
That's prolly why you listenin to this message, because you need hope

Acting a fool, but it's jigga the figure pulling the trigger with vigor
Can make him bigger, need to get in with the cops, straight living
But you live a life sin, the wage of Jesus' death
If you living by the gun, that's the way into debt
But if you living the life, and living it right, put your fist in the sky, with all of your might, till you way out of breath
Chest pumping all hard due to heavy palpitations
Thirsting for the Lord with heavy salivation

Right up under your nose you might see a sex slave being traded
And will do anything for the money
Boy, a momma might sell her babies
Sell porn sell pills anything to pay the bills
Anything to bring that pay
Gotta scratch that itch gotta scratch them ticks
Ain't rich but I might be
And I'mma shoot these flicks I'mma turn these tricks anything for a slight fee
Yea made in America
Momma told me that I belong here
Had to earn our stripes had to learn all rights had to fight for a home here
But I wouldn't know a thing about that
All I know is drugs and rap
I probably could have been some kinda doctor
Instead of holding guns and crack
I was born in the mainland
Great-grandpa from a strange land
He was stripped away and given bricks to lay
I guess you could say he a slave hand
But I was made in America
So I don't know a thing about that
All I know is uncle Sam look-in for me working on his corner so I know I gotta pay tax
Gettin' paid in America
I was raised in America

Looking out for a threat in own land

Taking out them buildings
People getting killed in America
And I'm still in America
Though America ain't feeling me
I went to war for this country
Turn around came home and you rid of me
When y'all free here saying you don't wanna be here
Well you probably couldn't breathe here if I didn't load a couple magazines here
Y'all just complain in America
I'm jumping out of military planes for America
Aye I was made in America
That's why I'm out here saving America
I got a brother in the cemetery now

Naw I ain't gettin money
Go to bed hungry but I make some exports for y'all

That's gon' rust and fade when you cease

Let's just say I saw the light,
Let's just say I heard the TRUTH,
Let's just say I ain't' the same no more,
I'm out here looking new,
Let's just say I left the game,
Take my jersey, I retired,
Let's just say I'm at the game,
Put me in I'm on fire",https://genius.com/Lecrae-my-whole-life-changed-bryson-price-annotated
