Wild Wild West,How Ya Like Me Now,1987,"The wild wild west

The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

I used to live downtown, 129th Street
Convent, everything's upbeat
Parties, ball in the park
Nothing, but girls after dark
We chill, nobody gets ill
In the place we call the hill
But if you try 'em
That's when they will
Get wild, but they don't fight, they kill
At the...

The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

I remember parties out in the park
With the girlies, rubbing up in the dark
I was smooth, until someone pulled a gun
It was over, they spoiled my fun
I was flying, just like a track star
Dying, nah, I ran through the back yard
Trying to get into my building
Saying ""Why in the heck won't somebody kill them?""
One day the fellas got together
They vowed that no one would ever
Come on our block, and terrorize us
The gangs that used to do it, now they idolize us
Guns, we don't like to use them
Unless, our enemies choose them
We prefer to fight you on like a man
And beat you down with our hands and bodyslam you at the...

The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

We don't start trouble, but boy do we end it
Our time, we like to spend it
Snapping, boy do we heat up
But we'll take time out to beat up
A sucker, if he wants static
Beatdown, yeah we got it
Good, and we'll accommodate you
Thanks to us, a lot of brothers hate to
Come back, to this very day
'Cause losing's one thing we don't play
If you're ever in a fight and you're beating one of us
Break out, before you get bumrushed

I'm talking about Nappy Red, Theo, Tony and Milton
Mike Mike Sluggo and Mike Chillion
D.O.B., Reggie B, and Sidney
Dano B, Derrick B, Sean B, and don't forget
Big Hank, Don Ice and Sire Rock
God bless Peter Wax, Chuck Chuck, and Pork Chop
El Dorado George way back in the day
Had all the brothers on the hill talking this way
They said, ""God, have mercy L.A
Sunshine"" and my DJ
Easy Lee, are from around the way
Jock Jock, Philly Phil, Don D always
But they're chillin', Keith Keith, KV
Steve O, Ross Ross and A Fi
Beroni, Toss Toss and Hung Hunk
We fight with our hands and nobody's a punk!

I Go to Work,Knowledge is King,1989.0,"I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic, you got to like
The way I operate, I make miracles happen
Just from rappin', I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin' and explodin'
On the scene mean, I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills, then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill as I build a guild
For all the rappers of skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang 'em in effigy
If he's a sucker, hang 'em to the left of me
'Cause my right-hand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keepin' at a steady pace
Ain't no reason to rush, it ain't no race
I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head into
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya
Runnin' around, holdin' ya head
Asking your homeboy ""Yo man, you heard what he said?""
Another funky rhythm, look at your man and give him
A high five 'cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it, I go to work

I go to work
I go to work

I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter, it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation
Of rappers and after I came off vacation
I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone, Daddy's home
So open the door, playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and who's the ace
Start the race, I'm coming in first
With each verse, I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
And after I have ya, I have to slap ya
Senseless with endless rhymes, don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous, and when this
Rhyme is done, your mind will become
So trapped in the rap, you'll lust another one
But you gotta wait, it takes time
I don't write, I build a rhyme
Draw the plans, draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work

I go to work
I go to work

I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch, my rhyme rocks ya
Sometimes it knocks ya so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks, so power packed
Before you can react, you're flat on your back
Down for the count, get up and dismount
'Cause I'm coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch, but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote, 
I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil's
Writing a rhyme in its highest form
And I'ma drop it on ya like a bomb
And when it explodes, I'll blow up
A few casualties, but so what?
If you're slow, you blow; you know you go
I flow I throw all-pro, I go to work


To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation?
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-i-go-to-work-lyrics
How Ya Like Me Now,How Ya Like Me Now,1987.0,"I throw my tape on then, I watch ya
Three seconds later, I got ya
Shakin' your head, dancin' instead of sittin'
The rhymes kick, the beats hittin' you
Just like a home run, 
slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC get paid
Usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that, you can't forget that
You took my style, I'm takin' it back
Comin' back, like ""Return of the Jedi""
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds
But never rock records, how ya like me now?

How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

Now brothers are riding me like a pony
I'm no phony, I'm the only real mic-aroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks, you all shoulda stayed
Out of the business, what is this
Amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage, I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped inside a cage
I'm the real king, rap is a jungle
I never understood, how could one go
To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me
Become a rapper, then try to rock me
Schemin' like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school, I used to see men
Die for less, but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin'
And let the music play

How ya like me now?

Rap is an art and I'm like Picasso
But of course, why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic, I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again, respect, I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of perfect
Vernacular's pure and I can ensure
Life or death with my breath, my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say, ""Ow""
And she's jockin', now how ya like me now?

How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

It irked my nerve when I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test? I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothing but a toy
Don't ya know that I'll serve that boy?
Just like a waiter, hit 'em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he pay the bill
And leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refill
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dreams
Make him feel the wrath, beat him down, and laugh
And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him
""Who is the best?"" And if he don't say, ""Moe Dee""
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did, how could you beat me?
You're so petrified, you're scared to even meet me
My word's the law, that's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment, just like a child
Never touch another mic, how ya like me now?

How ya like me now?

I could continue, there's more on the menu
But I'll relax 'cause I'm so far in you
You had enough, I know you're overstuffed
And if I keep going, you'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day
When you used to come to my parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rock me and this I vow
So all I wanna say is how ya like me now?

How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-how-ya-like-me-now-lyrics
Go See the Doctor,Kool Moe Dee,1986.0,"But three days later, go see the doctor...
I was walking down the street, rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neat and petite
She was so sweet, yes I wanted to meet
So I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk, and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished, I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said ""Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it""
They said ""Did you get it?"" I said ""Yeah,"" they said ""How was it?""
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor
I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right
She felt so good, hugged me so tight
I said ""Good night""
Three days later...
Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said ""Mama mia!""
I'ma kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got the more I reminisce
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldn't wait to rock her world
I said ""Hey good looking, what you got cooking?""
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs. Microwave
'Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way, stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor
I went to the doctor's office, I said ""What have I got?""
He said ""Turn around boy and take this shot""
I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said ""What?
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt""
He turned and said in a real deep voice
""Have it your way if that's your choice
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
But don't blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do
Would just kick her, so go take karate""
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said ""Next time I'll use some protection""
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
'Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-go-see-the-doctor-lyrics
Let’s Go,Knowledge is King,1989,"So, tell me, how do you feel about ""Jack the Ripper?""

(Get him!)

Want me to get him? Well, I got him
My mouth is an Uzi and I shot him
With the hundreds of rhymes and rhythm designed to make him rewind
This time I draw the line
He's mine, just chill
Don't nobody touch him 'cause I'ma get ill
The boy's phony as a three-dollar bill
And this time, I shoot to kill
Just like a sucker, you took the bait
Now you're like a dead fish on my dish, too late
So party people kick your feet up, I'm about to heat up
You're hungry for a battle, now it's time to eat up
Boy, I'm gonna chew you, 'cause I knew you
Was talkin' that junk, punk, now I'ma do you
The way you should be done, call you my son
Make you say, ""Daddy, I don't want none""
I've had enough of you actin' tough
You huff, puff, grab your stuff, you cream puff bluff
Talk about a battle, but you don't wanna do it
You got yourself into it, you blew it
You egomaniac, I'm a brainiac
You came back with a stone cold plain attack
Your rhymes are weak-wack, how can you speak that?
You need to sneak back to the drawing board Jack
The Ripper, down with my zipper
You get paid to be a Moe Dee tipster
Trying to knock the way I rock, get off my jock
I'ma knock you out the box, let's go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Put up or shut up, get up, yeah, what up?
Huh, get on the microphone and get cut up
Talk about how your records went double platinum
With those lyrics? Huh, I laugh at them
So, you got paid, take the money you've made
Bet it on yourself, are you afraid?
Money talks, B.S. walks
When I stalk like a hawk, a victory is chalked
So put your money where your mouth is, you don't know about this
Battlin's for real men, and I doubt if
You can even hang or give a run for the money
You're just a sucker, and it's funny
How you never ever had a drop of juice in New York
And now you go on tour and try to talk that talk
You try to act like you're a big man, but you're a big fan
Stridin' and hidin' while ridin' my big man
You ain't got a chance in the world
Your records were smokin', but you sound like a girl
(How you like me now? I'm gettin' busier
I'm double platinum)
 
Hold up, is he a
Man or a girl? What in the world?
You sound like Cheryl the Pearl
And you wanna battle me on the microphone?
Leave that crack alone
Let's go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
I said let's go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Come on, boy, let's go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Better than me?

Picture that with a Kodak
I don't take no shorts and you know that
I roll hard, run the rap yard, put up your guard
I don't get even, I get odd,
 
Todd
Always one up on ya
And I tried to warn ya
You slept, you took a back step
Ruined your rep and wept, you should've kept
Your mouth shut, you know what?
You gotta say you're sorry (I'm sorry) So what?
You call me a punk, you wanna see who's soft?
Put the microphone down, let's square-off
You need a hand, you got hands for
Tryna be me, now LL stands for
Lower Level, Lack Luster
Last Least, Limp Lover
Lousy Lame, Late Lethargic
Lazy Lemon, Little Logic
Lucky Leech, Liver Lipped
Laborious Louse on a Loser's Lips
Live in Limbo, Lyrical Lapse
Low Life with the loud raps, boy
You can't win, huh, I don't bend
Look what you got yourself in
Just usin' your name, I took those L's
Hung 'em on your head
 
and rocked your bells
Now, here we go, blow for blow, let's throw
Rhyme for rhyme, yours and mine, and yo
When it's time to battle rhyme, I know
How to make it flow, so let's go
To the ring, rapper's sing and swing
Words and verse, see who deserves to be king
Serve a blow to that ego
As if you didn't know, let's go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Let's go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

How can you say you're the best?
Get put to the test in front of a million and fess
Tried to withdraw because you saw
The juice I gots not like before
Huh, I'm formidable, unforgettable
You're submittable, you look pitiful
Yeah you're headstrong, but you're dead wrong
Wanna survive? Stick with the love songs
Take off your shirt, flex and flirt
And leave the real hard rhymes to the hard rhyme experts
If you don't, boy you'll get hurt
Feel like dirt and have to revert
To comin' on stage butt-naked
To make up for what you can't do on record
Open your eyes twice the size and realize
I'm on the rise and you're on the demise
Ostracized by my reprise
Step in my face and watch how that head flies
I mean business and I'm serious
I ain't sellin' out and now here he is
Frontin' and fakin' and talkin' about makin'
The money from money, now don't you know they can
Use your support 'cause you got caught
Signed, sealed, delivered, sold and bought
A puppet on a string with no heart
A fool and his money will always part
You used to be a rapper, turned into a businessman
Loafin' on the job and cheatin' the fans
I'm too potent, powerful and spiritual
Mental, emotional, physical and lyrical
You wanna beat me? It's gonna take a miracle
You've got a lock on my jock like a pitbull",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-lets-go-lyrics
Death Blow,Funke Funke Wisdom,1991.0,"""To the break of dawn, to the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the...""
Time's up punk
Yeah, yeah, time to settle the score
""To da break of dawn,"" another dumb move
Ha, ha, ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you, head to head, let's go

Here we go, beat down round two
Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you, face to face, head to head
Mic to mic, I like the weak shit you said
(To the break of dawn) Beats, nitro
Lyrics, weak, say goodnight yo
""Star Trek shades,"" man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pit bull
Victor before you pull it off, you thought Mr. Pitiful
Here's some mouthwash, G
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-
A-U-S-E you're riding me
T-O-D-D, junior Moe Dee
Stop biting, chewing, swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing?
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it? (Yeah) finished? (Burp)
Now let a real man go to work
'Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sick ya like a dog, dropping lyrics with rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause you're nothing but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets with ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb?
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you with a death blow

(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
I'll hit ya wit a death blow
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)

My lyrical beat down will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man, brother let go
No apologies, tears or violins
Get your black suits cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is passed, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your game plan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came with a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, your mama won't know ya
Cause I'ma rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read, ""He had no win""
So R-I-P, Rest in peace, ripped 'em
D-I-D, dead indeed, did 'em
An H-I-T, hitman (so whatcha hit him with?)
A rhyme silencer, I hit him with a death blow

(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
I'll hit ya wit a death blow
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (scratch) knew it
I'ma send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marley Marl can't save you from fallin'
Cause as soon as you came back what did you do?
(To the break of dawn) Another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
(I'm that type of guy) Oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marley hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lackadaisical, listless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps languid latent lurking
Languish, language, local logo
Light, laboring, limited, loco
Now LL's a laughing stock
Cause I lit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
Your records ain't hot and your shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, (Hard as hell)
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, who's your daddy?

Kill 'em, kill 'em
(Make you say ""Daddy I don't wan't none)
I did 'em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the, get him out of here

Yeah
So for all those hip hop fans out there that really know what time it is
Anybody that wants to see us get this thing going on, head-to-head, Kool Moe Dee versus LL
Put a little pressure on him 'cause the boy ain't got no heart
'Cause he knows what time it is
And anybody out there that don't know what time it is, remember
I never said the brother couldn't make a good record
But when it comes to a battle, we gotta go head-to-head on them lyric tip
And when it come to lyrics, he can't hang",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-death-blow-lyrics
"Battle w/Busy Bee (Harlem World, 1981)",Pioneers Of Hip-Hop - Volume One,1981.0,"One for the treble, two for the bass
C’mon Easy Lee and let’s rock the place!
One, two, one, two
Do what you do, now!
Hold on, Busy Bee, I don’t mean to be bold
But put that “ba-ditty-ba” bullshit on hold
We gonna get right down to the nitty-grit
Gonna tell you little somethin’ why you ain’t shit
It ain’t a emcee's jock that you don’t hug
You even bit your name from the 
“Lovebug”
And now to bite a nigga’s name, that’s some low-down shit
If you was money, man, you’d be counterfeit
I gotta give it you, though, you can rock
But everybody know you’re on the Furious' jock
And I remember, Busy, from the olden-times
When my man, Spoonie G, used to sell you rhymes
Remember that rhyme called, “Ditty-Ba-Ditty”?
Man, goddamn, that shit was a pity!
Too hot to trot, here to rock a spot
Spoonie G rocked it whether you like it or not
He begged for the rhyme, asks for it twice
He says, “Spoonie G, I’ll buy at any price!”
When Spoonie finally sold it, oh, what a relief
Busy B stole it like a fuckin’ thief
Came out rockin’, the party hard
Got everybody thinkin’ that shit-sound's yours!
Every time I hear it, I throw a fit
Party after party – the same old shit!
Record after record, rhyme after rhyme
Always want to know your zodiac sign
He changed the shit to the favorite jeans
C’mon, Busy Bee, tell me what that means
Hold on, brother man, don’t you say nothing
I’m not finished yet, I gotta tell you something
Too hot to trot, I’m here to rock the spot
I’m gonna rock your ass whether you like it or not
I’ll take the title right here on the spot
How can I take a title you ain’t got?
You’re not number one, you’re not even the best
And you can’t win no real emcee contest
Celebrity clubs and bullshit like those
Those the kind of shows everybody knows
Celebrity clubs, those are the kind you can win
They’re all set up before he comes in
But in a battle like this, you’d know you’d lose
Between me and you, who do you think they’ll choose?
Well, if you think it’s you, I got bad news
‘Cause when you hear your name, you’re gonna hear some boos
‘Cause you’re fakin’ the funk, ‘cause you’re fakin’ the funk
And at the end of this rock, you can call me unc-le
Mo Dee rock shock the house
Call me unc-le
Rock the house, y’all
Like this y’all, a-like this y’all
Like this-a-this, it’s like this y’all

Now you popcorn-peanut-toy emcees
Never ever ever heard no rhymes likes these
‘cause my intent, from the time I sent
Is to say those rhymes that I invent
And for your pleasure, a rhyme you’ll treasure
Please don’t try ‘cause you can’t measure
The length of time can’t touch the rhyme
Hip hop don’t stop, ‘cause you know I’m
An MC supreme and I’m one-of-a-kind
And if you search real hard, I’m sure you’ll find
Ain’t another MC who can rhyme like this
Not your mother or your father, aunt, brother, or your sis
Sit back and enjoy, don’t try to fight
‘cause it’s very hard to say any rhyme I write
But do it like this, do it like that
Concentrate real hard and get the rhyme down pat
And no matter how hard you try, you’ll see
You’ll get your mind into mine and can’t say it like me
But you wanna be – Busy wanna-be!
'Cause you know he wanna be another Kool Moe Dee
So let’s all chant, because you know you can’t
Everybody salute to the new MC champ
It’s like this y’all, like this y’all
Like this-a-this, it’s like this y’all

Now that “ba-ditty-ba-da-dang-da-dang-dang”
Sound pretty good, but it ain’t no thang
I’m the super scooper, party pooper
Man with all the super-duper
Disco breaks, have what it takes
A man who never makes mistakes
Can rap it low, I’m not a bore
Baddest man you ever saw
Money-makin’, earthquakin’
Man-who-gets-the-party-shakin’

No complication, stimulation
Man-who’s-gonna-rock-the-nation
Rhyme, rhyme, battle time
My opponent: he’s all mine
I’m not the baddest, not the maddest
When I win I am the gladdest
No beginner, not a sinner
On the mic I'm just a winner

Very, very, very, very
Every time I bust a cherry
Oh my god, it's fame and glory
Thought I’d never tell this story
Only time I'm from the mic
Because it’s something that I like
To reassure, the rhymes are low
I always keep some sex in store

The baddest bad, superbad
Never sad, always glad
Rhymer that you'd rather have
If you  you never had
Sleek, sleek so unique
Guaranteed to move your feet
So ladies, I'm without  a doubt
Guaranteed to turn it out

Remember me, MC Moe Dee
The man that’s at the T-O-P
And ladies’ dream the way it seems
When they see me, their eyes are gleamin’
I’m so shocking when I’m rocking
Bound to get your fingers popping
Have no doubt, I turn it out
‘Cause that’s a party’s all about

 right on through it
I don't need no disco fluid

Ball-playing, girl-laying
On the mic, a rhyme-saying
MC who rock viciously
Satisfaction guaranteed
Or you get your money back
Believe me, girl, it's not the whack
Treach-er-ous Three, as you can see
Special K, Sunshine, and I'm Kool Moe Dee
Signing off y'all, signing off y'all
From the South to the West to the East to the North
Busy Bee, my man, you know I went off!
A-Chill out, chill-a-chill out, chill on out
Chill out, chill-a-chill out, chill on out
Busy Bee!
Busy Bee, Busy Bee
Busy Bee Starski, I'm Kool Moe Dee
The best MC and that's my trophy!
Chill out, chill-a-chill out, chill on out
Chill out, chill-a-chill out, chill on out

And I just want all of y'all to know
That's why I'm on his dick!
That's why I'm on Moe Dee's dick!",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-battle-w-busy-bee-harlem-world-1981-lyrics
Do You Know What Time it Is?,Kool Moe Dee,1986,"Do you know what time it is?
Girlies are partying, touching my body and
Talking to me like I'm a kindergartian
Today she's on mine, tomorrow she's on his
But don't worry about me, because I know what time it is
Time to get mine while you try to get yours
I'll get mine pause in those silky drawers
Take you to the cleaners and I got a trick
Cause all you're ever going to get is a piece of my dee-dee-duh
Didn't you know that my girlie, my toe
It's easy to come, but harder to go
Hope you got a good heart and you're a good sport
Cause I'm a treat you like Beaver on a basketball court
I'm gonna run you around, take you up and down
Take you out and leave you in the lost and found
So if you wanna be down, miss listen to this
Before you deal with me, you'd better know what time it is
Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)
Some girlies are pretty, some girlies are fine
But most girlie girlies like to play with your mind
They like sporting new gold and riding in cars
And most of them, they don't care who you are
They're materialistic and unrealistic
And to most of them you're nothing but another statistic
Whoever's got the money, they're all on his
Y'all can save it for David, cause I know what time it is
Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)
Check the clock!
Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time, and let's rock
Girls for me come a dime a dozen
And that's why I never never was a
Situation where I could get jerked
Like a mechanic, all I do is bodywork
Want my money?  You must be a fool
Cause like Billy Idol said, I'm gigalo cool
Moe Dee, that's me, introduce yourself, miss
But don't try to be slick, cause I know what time it is
Time to make sure that the girlies stay poised
String 'em out so they will always want more
Don't come around here and try to get richer
Don't ask me for no money, 
cause baby baby baby
Betcha don't
 know me from a can of paint
And I bet you think I'm fronting but I tell you I ain't
And I bet you think you know, but I'll tell you like this:
I'll be you don't know (Know what?) What time it is
Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 4x)
It's time to get money, time to get paid
It's time to have fun, it's time to get laid
Like to front like I'm poor, I don't drive, instead
I be chilling in a Jetta with my man that be red
Riding all around the city and half the world
And after talking from girl to girl
All you ladies seem to sing the same old song
Makes it hard for me when a real girl comes along
Now I'm a veteran, a girl all-pro
And as many as I've had, I still don't know
So I made a little system so I can tell
Doesn't always work, but what the hell?
Don't ask me for nothing, and don't give me nothing
And keep it like that for about a whole month and
Half and I'll laugh and maybe one day miss
Maybe you can be down, maybe you can be down
Maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is
Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)
Check the clock!

Rise ‘n’ Shine,Funke Funke Wisdom,1991,"And yes y'all, the sounds that you hear is gonna be so real
You'll have no fear cause three live brothers are here
We got KRS-One from Boogie Down Productionsn, 
special shout to Melodie
We got my man Chuck D in the house from Public Enemy
And I am Kool Moe Dee
So are you ready?

Are you ready, to elevate
As I rhyme on time you'll illuminate
Hard as diamond, knowledge shinin'
It's that time and it's all in the timin'
Four hundred years, blood, sweat and tears
The rain is over, and the sun is here
Yeah, bright and clear, countdown to the year
No fear, cause I'm in there
Holding my mic like the staff of Ra
Bringing true light after dark
Brothers are live, but still unborn
It's almost morn and it's time to mourn
See the light like a crack of dawn
The comatose and the cracked are reborn
Regurgitating the garbage we're fed
Cause this time dawn is dawn of the dead

Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Rise and shine
Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Get up

I rise and shine like the sun on the one
We dance together, we overcome
A wake-up call to wake up all
Stand up tall, get up and get up, y'all
Clap your hands in jubilation, meditation
Recreation, procreation of the mind
If you seek, we'll find
Born two times, but still one of a kind
Learn your past, find your path
The truth is infinite, like math
Countdown to the year two thousand
The thought alone is arousin'
When we sing I'll wake with the third eye
Rise with the sun and think with a bird's-eye
View, as I watch our exodus
When the higher conscience connects it's just


The microphone is my funk receptor
When I speak on beat I'm trying to connect us
To what's left us messed up
Egos dressed up, got us effed up
You see onto instead of into
You see what you want to, instead of what you been through
You can take the rhyme I say
Read it, hear them, see them three ways
Combine the rhyme to any one of nine
For some still the light won't shine
You can take a shot in the dark, but keep missin'
You aim with one eye, you just don't listen
Cause see, in the dark you need all three
Your eyes are ears when you hear what you see
The five senses are all correlated
The sixth and seventh is how you elevate it


Ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
This a K-R-S with a different something
What, come in a dance and we come down for sing
This a KRS me say, go!
'Nuff slaveships come from Africa
Full of Africans, sold in America
Now you want me to call myself American
Even though America kill the African
Check it, white man is European
And black man is African
White man never say Euro-American
So why should the black man say Afro-American?
If the black man is American with a afro
Then the white man is American with a long nose
It should be Long-Nose-American for the white man, and
Jump around and move your bottom, what


Make no mistake, we don't shake or stutter
So heed the word of the brothers
Who makes a boy into a man
It's the job of another man
Who knows his role as a father
He bothers to give his son his soul
And pass it on, to never flunk
Cause papa don't raise no punks
Got to make it known and to pass it down
Yeah, sounds like a job for the brother man now
Got to help a mother for me, uh
Each one teach one, if you can't find one
Talk to the little ones
And you'll see they'll listen
To fill the missin'

Knowledge is King,Knowledge is King,1989,"I'm not goin', I'm gone
Up up up and away and I'm on
A higher plane with a brain with a flame
Feel the fire, desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom and understanding
Possessed by gods, transferred to man in
A script of a book or a scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing, inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong subliminal
Message divesting all men from criminal
Acts of the Devil, revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
Read the Holy Koran or the Bible
Because it's liable to be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power, knowledge is king

Now who wants some? Come get it
A battle is a test of wits and I'm witted
Hard beats a torch and I lit it
Set the world on fire, I did it
Now that it feels good, I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge and can't get enough
'Cause knowledge is infinite, suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss and they're kin to it
They party and dance and don't ever glance
At a book or look for their mind to advance
Caught in a rut chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar or a nut
Evil feeds off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind and of course you have to be
Less than a man, more like a thing
No knowledge you're nothing, knowledge is king

My knowledge comes from a spiritual force
Stronger than any earthly source
Propaganda, hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
, I understand the
Media dictates the mind and rotates
The way you think and syncopates slow pace
Brains can't maintain
Ascertain insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame traditions
All praise fame positions
Want to be a star, drive a big car
Live bourgeois and won't know who you are
Lost in the source and praising the dollar
Whether your faith is Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God will teach one thing
The dollar is moot, knowledge is king

My rhymes make a weak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang so eject it
I've selected rhymes for records
To affect the effect of the rhyme that left it
Hangin' like a pound that can't come down
But you're hanging in the brain so your brain is hell-bound
Lost and found by the serpent sound
What you don't know can't hurt, that's profound
Absurd is a better word
An ignorant fool is a real cool nerd
Your pockets are fat with an empty head
Got a little bit fame and a name and you're brain dead
You count dollars so ya think ya in
You know how to count but you don't know when
Ask history today and it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes 'cause the brain ain't acute
You need knowledge to understand the concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand so we have to fight
War, killing people we never saw before
Some don't even know what they're killing for
Following rulers instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya but the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled 'cause it's a spiritual thing
But you got to have knowledge, knowledge is king
Knowledge is king

The Best,Kool Moe Dee,1986,"(The best)
Like other music rap is an art
And if you wanna get the feeling, got to feel it in your heart
You need brain power, dictation
Vocabulary, articulation
Creativity and originality
Execution of a feud formality
Versatility and a voice that's loud
With the ability to take a crowd
To its apogee, and always has a
Feeling like you're havin a mental orgasm
Makin all minds come to one conclusion
You are the best and it's not an illusion
(The best)
(Rockin my beat)
(The best)
For instance
If this record was an atom, I'd be the nucleus
The center of attention, Kool Moe Dee and I'm just
Like the core of an apple, the priest of the chapel
With the mic in my hand I'm like a surgeon with a scalpel
Ready to operate the rhymes that I create
Sounds like music to your ears cause I can combinate
Bass and treble to create a level
Of highs and lows of sounds that goes
With syncopated concrete-created
Beats that meet the standard of a street credit
Gotta critique a rhyme if it's weak
You won't wanna speak if your rhymes not peak
With verbs and nouns and adjectives
Combined to make a phrase
That'll play with a beat
Stop and start, slow it down at a part
And totally amaze
The whole crowd, leave em in a state of awe
Cause I'm as perfect as a diamond without a flaw
And yes, I'm legendary, also very, very
Educated, proficient and extraordinary
In my field the other rappers yield
A knight in shining armor and the mic is my shield
In rap I'm vital, the other rappers' idol
The best mc and Moe Dee's my title
But you can call me Kool
Now when I rock instead of just average I'm better
Than the average man and that's why I can
Make a real human feel like a mannequin
I mean a cold-heart dummy, from the time I walk in
I'll shock ya and amaze ya, hit ya, then I'll daze ya
Either way I'm gonna phase ya cause I'm sharp as a razor
When I'm rhymin to the cut, you know what?
I'm the best MC, many imitate me
They never would admit it ,they just can't get it
I rhyme like the rest, but the juice I possess
Always seems to be more, I'm a rhyme connoisseur
My taste for the beat is also elite
I'm the best hip-hopper from off the street
Cause when I'm rhymin on the mic I always take control
Can't another rapper touch me with a ten-foot pole
I rhyme a 100 miles an hour with lightning-speedin power
Make the sweetest of the sweet MC's look sour
Timber as they tower, because I devour
Any other rapper and I can prove it now or
A little bit later, cause I'm a graduator
From a rhymin' alma mater, but some say alma mata
Like you say patata, I say potato
Tomato, tomata, my data's up to data
Cause somethin is the matter with those of you say dada
Could mean opposite of mama, like the kids at Wonderama
I'm very good at actin, I'm very good at drama
I confuse you with a period, colon, and a coma
Cause when I'm rhymin' and I take a pause
You think the rhyme is over but when you and yours
Really check out what I'm doin, then you say ooh
When they say who's the best MC to you
You'll look at me, then you say ""I know who""

They Want Money,Knowledge is King,1989.0,"I'm drivin' Benz 190
2.5 and you know where to find me
Driving down the highway, girlies behind me
Jockin' blindly, no need to remind me
Who I am? I know you know me
Stop screamin' and pointin' and yellin', I'm low key
No I ain't got no time for a picture
But slide your number and I'll get with ya
You want a ride? You shouldn't have said that
You played yourself and I know where your head's at
Drive my car? Don't make me laugh
You better settle for an autograph
Or a hug and a kiss on the cheek, maybe
But I ain't trying to make no baby
Forget all the silly rumors you heard
Here's the deal so spread the word

No, I ain't got no girlfriend
No, I didn't buy no car
No, I don't have no babies
A lot of ladies? Nah, they want money

And I can see 'em a mile away
And when they push up, I just smile and say
Back up off me, smell the coffee
You're schemin' and plottin' and I'm killing you softly
Watchin' you melt from the second I kissed ya
Heard dollar signs in your careless whisper
I know the game it's old and lame
You're holdin' a flame for my name and my fame
Livin' like Givens schemin' on Tyson
But she got lucky cause he was a nice one
But I ain't nice and I don't play that
If it ain't tax I don't pay that
You think you're in cause you turn me on
Here one minute and the next you're gone
I made the rhymes, I made the cash
Why get married and you take half?

No, I ain't got no girlfriend
No, I didn't buy no car
No, I don't have no babies
A lot of ladies? Nah, they want money

The police, I'm givin' them fits
A young brother in a Benz legit
I don't sell no drugs and take no shhh
Park my ride and the ladies hit it
So many ladies the cops had a hint
They took me in cause they thought I pimped
Jetted from the station back in a flash
They had nothing on me but cold cold cash
Ladies they all wanna get with
The man with the money so they wanna sit with
The microphone master and ride shotgun
So people can see ya and think I got one
No, sorry, nothin's happenin'
Moe Dee's single while he's rappin'
If girls keep lyin' and crashin' my party
Ya'll gonna make me hurt somebody

No, I ain't got no girlfriend
No, I didn't buy no car
No, I don't have no babies

No Respect,How Ya Like Me Now,1987.0,"What you want, you ain't gon' get it
What you need, you won't admit it
It really don't matter how hard you try
Cause money can't buy respect
The material mind is enticed by the dollar bill
It makes some brothers fight, and some would even kill
Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think they'll get respect
Bought a big Mercedes, and you got about ten more cars
Now you impress the ladies, and you're a neighborhood star
Gold on your fingers and your neck
But you still get no respect
Your mind is weak, so when you speak
You're obsolete, your mental peak
Is in the street, your mouth's a beak
Big like a bird, and your future's bleak
Now you should seek some help decree
You're sellin crack and livin cheap
Bought a brand-new ride to go beep-beep
Playin music outside loud in your jeep
But you should know, unless you're slow
There comes an end to the sidewalk show
And up the river's where you'll go
Wearin stripes from head to toe
No fancy gold, no fancy car
And the brothers inside don't care who you are
A 7-foot brother doin life
300 pounds, says you're his wife
Walks in your cell and says: ""Fix it up""
Then you look up and say: ""Not the butt""
He says: ""Shut up"" ""But... but"" No 'but'
Now what you gonna do, freaky-deaky or what?
The money was good, the money was fast
No business mind and the money won't last
In the money rate you fell first to last
Now every night you fight for your ass
They say what goes up must come down
All hustlers know that sound
Cause you're here today, gone the next
And you'll find out the hard way: you get no respect

	Man, you must be crazy and bugged
	Whatcha mean I don't get no respect?
	You crazy?
You got to respect me
Cause I was the first millionaire off the streets, boy
	Ain't nobody ever had a hustle like mine
In '72, I was killin em, boy
	Man, go 'head, go 'head
I'm tellin ya, I was shittin on it
	Word up, I was the man
	And a car - these niggas ain't got no cars today, man
	My car was so pretty, I ride by, niggas' dicks get hard
	You dig what I'm sayin?
	Ha-ha, man, get outta here, go 'head
Caddy, boy, Grand Daddy Caddy
They used to call me Mackaroni Tony, boy
	Aw man, go 'head, shut yo broke ass up, man
Word, I spell it out, I'll yell it out
For those brothers that keep sellin out
Cause local clout is all you're about
A few bullshit bitches and hanging out
And every day's like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
I'd like to know what you're thinkin about
It sure ain't dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before it's too late
Or they'll be doing your make-up down at the coroner's place
And you will have lived just to die
And you'll die with no respect

	Yo man, what about hoes, what about hoes?
	Hoes?
Shit man, I had mo' bitches than muthafuckin Con-ed got switches, boy
I had hoes, loads of hoes, you know what I'm sayin
Hoes, hoes, you dig?
	You're just talkin shit
	I had all the money man, I was the man...
Where you goin Sam? Hold up, hold up
Yeah, yeah - well, I'm outta here
I don't wanna hear more of this shit
Wait, before you go - can I get a dollar, man?
Aw, go 'head, you broke ass, I ain't hearin no more of that shit
	What happened to all your money, boy?
Aw go 'head, nigga, I thought you said you had all the money...
	I got all the money man, that shit ain't happenin to me
	You just fucked up man, I know how to hustle
I got respect, you crazy, man
	I can go in any liquor store, anywhere, anytime 'the day
And get any bottle or anything for free, that's respect, boy!
	Aw go 'head with all that shit
	That's respect!
I got the dollar boy, I'm the man nowadays, you understand?
You was killin em in '72, I'm killin em in '87, man
That shit ain't happenin to me, I'm the man!

Monster Crack,Kool Moe Dee,1986,"(Monster Crack)
1986 - return of the horror flicks
More deadly than ""The Omen"", a killer and a showman
Like the devil in ""The Exorcist""
But this flick can cause a heart attack
Cause it's more than action-packed
It's alive and killing and the star is a villain
And his name is Monster Crack
The crack monster
He talks to ya like he's alive
And when he talks like bees to a hive
The people come running, the older and the young'in
The place he lives in is the house they hung in
He wants your money, only your money
He'll make you feel good for a real fast twenty
The bill is passed and the dollars go fast
The feeling is high but the high don't last
Long enough for you to even read a paper
But you still thirst and hunger for the vapor
Although he is inanimate, he'll make you feel
That he can breathe, think, talk and bleed for real
You should stay away cause all he's about
Is just making you broke and stringing you out
It only takes one kiss and a deep, deep breath
Then you're hooked for life cause it's the kiss of death
Like savoir-faire he's everywhere
He'll hook an innocent baby cause he don't care
He loves to eat, girls and boys, and he's nothing but poison
The biggest hit since Michael Jackson, he's making noise in
The streets he's notorious, to pushers he's glorious
To girls he's a pimp cause he turns em to the whoriest
Materialistic nymphomaniacs
That'll do anything for Monster Crack
Give away her body, steal from her brother
Fight her father or sell her mother
Cause when you're possessed by Crack, God bless
Your soul, cause he'll take the rest
The power of the mind should not be wasted
But the agony of defeat is always tasted
By those who chose to willingly oppose
Their mind like Toucan Sam instead they follow their nose
And the more you get, the more you want
You're killing your brain now, so later on it'll haunt
You you become insatiable, you can't get enough
When your money gets low, things really get rough
It's your only objective, you lose all perspective
On life, you're obsessed, possessed and defective
Losing weight and disappearing but still persevering
Your body tells you no, but all you're hearing
Is the crack talk
In South Africa many a brother died
Trying to fight back against apartheid
Bombs are flying, people are dying
Terrorists terrorizing and the whole world's trying
To prevent another war, but I got a surprise
There's already one right before your eyes
And we're nowhere near the end, this is only the beginning
Until this point the Crack has been winning
Weakening hearts, corrupting minds
A stone cold killer, very easy to find
And once he's caught by the law, he can't go to jail
Cause he's nothing but a little piece of matter for sale
Using people like pawns in the game of chess
And he is the king, more powerful than the rest

Desperately to hear a brother kick a rhyme like this
Don't settle for another, cause you know what time it is
Time to pick your feet up, put your body in the mode
And listen to a real rap veteran explode
Other sucker brothers always comin incomplete
Forget about the lyrics, cause they only want the beat
And other punk brothers put a curse in every verse
Frontin cause nobody taught em how to rhyme first
Frontin like you're hard, but it's only a facade
And now you're goin out like a sucker like Todd
But I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the
To the beat y'all)

Excercisin patterns, sowin up the rappin scene
Rockin for the people like a funky rap machine
Synchronize a party cause the party people watch
Only dancin when I tell em cause I rock round the clock
Masters of the ceremony's one and only one
Can rock it like a rocket, phoney homies better run
Cause I'm doin the damage and the damage will be done
Lyrics are the bullets, so I never need a gun
Just a microphone, speakers, tables and a plug
Sit back and watch the people cut themselves and slice a rug
And I'ma rock a party till it's time to bring it home
And when they pull a plug, then I'ma pack a microphone
Put it in my holster like a gun, and then I'm gone
Strapped, ready to rap and on and on and on
I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the
To the beat y'all)
And yes y'all
As we proceed to move on
'To Da Break Of Dawn'
He-he-he-he-he...
Takin you all the way back
The way we used to do it for you and yours
At the old school

In the house",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-to-the-beat-yall-lyrics
Here We Go,Funke Funke Wisdom,1991,"Here we go
Come on
Yeah, yeah
The word is out
Kool Moe Dee's in the house again
And here we go again
And word has it, the brother's esoteric knowledge
Is a little too deep for the fans
So he gon' come this time with a simplyfied rhyme
Check it out

Around and around and around we go
People comin to the jam to hear me flow
The live lyricist is here and it's so
I got a funky beat to let you know
Only real brothers wanna hear real rhymes
All the soft suckers want the nickel-and-dime
Candy-coated, sugar-coated bubblegum rap
Long as it's movin on a funky track
My vocabulary's over their head
They can't understand a word I said
So I gotta come with the watered-down sound
With mediocre adjectives, verbs and nouns
Party people in the party only wanna dance
It's hard to rock a party when you're lyrically advanced
I tone down the lyrics, supressed ego
Got a funky rhythm, now watch me go

Here we go
Come On
(Go go go go...)
(Here we go again)
(Yeah y'all come on)
(Here we go again)

Go with the flow? no, no, no
I am the brother that sets tempo
Intelligent, relevant, eloquent speakin
You do the dancin, I'll do the freakin
Some people wanna dance, some people wanna listen
Some people at the party only wanna hear the dissin
My versatile styles, I'm able to adapt
You know I'm talkin shit cause I'm all that
I drop science for the brothers on the street
Intellects get it, and others want the beat
The way they feel I could be erased
All they want is you to pump that bass
Rather than tryin to change the times
They would rather me change my rhymes
A positive brother? yeah, yeah, we know
But they would rather just watch me go


I am a brother, young, gifted and black
There's no need for the profane rap
I'm lyrically potent, very well versed
Some rappers can't rap and try to hide it with a curse
Money in the pocket, gold around the neck
Rings on every finger, boomin system in effect
Tryin to imitate, or better emulate
I can relate, but I rather innovate
Like the creator I love to create
Peace and love, conquerin hate
I got a date with faith
To be known as the great
So all you sissy-soft suckers gainin weight
Become irate, while the ladies girate
Infatuate, lust and mate
Mental state, compensate
If I get too deep, then you won't relate
So now I gotta tone down the sound
Cos I can pick the beat up and turn it around
Turn any jam to a political party
Raise your conscience and rock your body
If you can't relate, just clap your hands
Listen to the rhythm and do your dance
And I'll just party with the alter ego

Way Way Back,How Ya Like Me Now,1987,"Dip dip dive, so-socialize
Clean out your ears and open your eyes
We gonna rock with the bass, roll with the high's
Gonna say a funky rhyme and make you all come alive
Hip hop, the hippie - the hippie
To the hip hip-hop, and you don't stop the rock
First you rock the hip and then you rock the hop
Then you hippie the hop and don't stop
Going on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what the popcorn
Gonna rock the beat to the break of dawn
Gonna party, party, party 'til you're all going home

This is the way we used to rhyme
These are the rhymes that we used to say
This is the way we used to sound
Way, way back in the day

Clap your hands and stomp your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
Cause I am the man with the master plan
Going back and forth and forth and back
Three words for the wack: stay the hell back
If the wack may attack keep the wack back
This drum machine is guaranteed to cause a heart attack
Going up to the ceiling, down to the floor
Bounce around the balls and back out the door
Tried to come back in cause you want more
Those funky rhymes galore


Pepper to the salt, salt to the pepper
Don't come to the party if you're a half-stepper
Salt to the pepper, pepper to the salt
If you can't rock to this it ain't my fault
A lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I rock the rhyme in half the time
From a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
You know Moe Dee gets all the women
Put your feet on the rhythm, put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rhythm, put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rock


Al Capone on the microphone
The Clark Gable on the turntable
I'm the Jesse and James of the hip hop game
Put all the suckers, suckers, suckers, suckers to shame
I'm twice as nice skating on ice
I'm giving you a taste of the disco slice
Like 4-5-6 on Cee-lo Dice
And I get more sex than a cat chase mice
Rock and roll, and roll and rock
Let's rock to the rhythm of the rock, rock, rock
And roll and rhyme, and rock and roll
Come on, party people, let's get out of control
Now the people in the back and not the wack
To the people on the side, let's ride
To the people in the middle let me see you wiggle
And people on the top, don't stop
Jump up, jump up
Just like a disco duck
Go down, go down
Just like a disco clown
Go on, go on
To, to the break of dawn
Jump back, jump back
And I can rock it like this cause I got it like that
Now do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do, do it, do it
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if y'all wanna rock the house tonight
Somebody say ""oh yeah"" (oh yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Now I hear ya
Now I hear ya, hear ya, hear ya, hear ya, hear ya
Now I hear ya, hear ya

(D-d-du-du-dumb) (Dumb)
(Du-dumb) (Dumb)
(D-d-d-dumb) (Dumb)

Well, listen up, homeboys, I got somethin to say
About a homeboy from back in the day
His name was Richard, some called him Rick
But if you knew him like me, you'd call him Dick
When we were growin up, we stuck with each other
Like white on rice, he was kinda like a brother
We had a lotta fun when we were kids
We always overlooked the dumb things he did
But the fun was over when we got to high school
Cause it was time for gettin girlies, so we had to be cool
We had a lotta girlies, and our friends were impressed
One thing went wrong, Rick got obsessed
We wouldn't go to class, always think about ass
Not if he was gonna pass, if he would just last
Girls was all he was thinkin about
If the school was all boys, he'da been dropped out
When he did drop out, he felt no shame
And if you ask me, he had the right name
Cause he hated to go, but he loved to come
That's why I call him Dick, cause Dick is Dumb
Dick
(D-d-d-du-dumb) (Dumb)
(Dumb Dick)
(D-d-d-du-dumb)

He wouldn't go to school, but he had to survive
So he went out and got him a 9 to 5
Although he was lazy, he had to work
Cause he had a lot of girls, he needed money, the jerk
As fast as he made it, his money was spent
When it came to girls, he didn't care where he went
He'd hound em like a dog, so we used to say ""fetch!""
And it was no tellin what he would catch
He was in the doctor's office almost every week
He became so popular, everybody'd speak
When he walked in they'd say (Hi Rick)
And when he passed by, they'd say (Dumb Dick)
Really hard-headed, cause he said he had juice
But it was cause of his hard head, that he was so loose
He was in love with another girl every day
And when we asked him why, he'd only say
(I'm the kinda guy who likes to have fun
I need a lotta girls, can't have just one)
I can understand that, but this is kind of insane
Sometimes I wonder if his brain
Was his...
(D-d-d-du-du-dumb) (Dumb)
(Dumb Dick)			(2x)

He lost his girl when he lost his job
So to keep himself from livin like a no-good slob
He hustled on the streets, cause he had no choice
And every day you'd hear his voice
Sayin ""Jumbos! I got it good""
But he never made the money that a hustler could
Cause when he was standin out on the corner
If a girl walked by, he was right up on her
He was so hot, his heat couldn't be measured
To him his business was his pleasure
A one-track mind, and as a matter of fact
He changed his name to Daddy Mack
The people on the streets he was workin for
Cut him off, now he's just plain old poor
And all his girls left, because they never cared
The were leeches for a dollar, and they got their share
Homeboy disappeared like a magic trick
And everybody wanna know what happened to Dick
Well, he's still around, but now he's a bum
Chasin bag ladies, he's the same old Dumb

Suckers,How Ya Like Me Now,1987,"Suckers!
I'm not your average rapper so I can't half step
I gotta come off right, I got a Moe Dee rep
And I'ma live up to it, cause y'all can't do it
Other rappers have tried...but they blew it
There's a heavy demand for me
'Cause I am the man you see
On stage, and front page, newspapers and TV
Radio stations don't play me enough
But it makes no difference 'cause I'm so rough (I'm tough)
Either way you look at it, rappers wish that they had it
As good as Moe Dee that's why they try to be me
And what they've become is a facsimile​
Now people wanna see me, rappers wanna beat me
Making new comparisons, so why don't y'all just leave me alone
'Cause I own the microphone
And when it comes to rhymes, I'm bad to the bone
Suckers!
Now I ask you who's the best and everybody replied
But if you guess I'm not the best you're just as wrong as apartheid
Double up thoughts, think twice
But not about me bein' Kool 'cause I'm ice without a doubt
So predictable it's a shame
Although you can't predict the rhyme you can predict the aim
And before the rhyme is anywhere near through
You, just like the whole world, knew
That I'd rock, no shocks
Some rappers will jock, the way I rock
'Cause it's real and nothing phony
I can send the crowd into pandemonium
Lyrically equipped so I can be choosy
 and deadly just like an Uzi
I can be strapped just from rapped
Because it's super-high powered, not like you saps
Suckers!
It's been proven, history is made
The world gathered around to give me a parade
Records were set, dollars were bet
On me to emerge victorious, no sweat
Hustle or crime nor search to find
Ideas and words to put in a rhyme
 tell it by me but not for sale
Although there is a black market for biters, but to no avail
Some can't read it, the rest can't say it
You have no choice but to love it and play it
Rewrite it and discreetly bite it
Although you don't want to, you can't fight it
'Cause it's kinda like going to school fool
And since I am the teacher I make the rules
You're under my control and you're starting to bore me
I don't say it the best no more, you say it for me
Suckers!
You silly boys with your plastic toy
Rhymes sometimes really annoy
A vet like me 'cause y'all are rookie
When I was teaching rap class you played hooky
Now your records are fake from the dollars you make
It's hidden well like icing hides a no good cake
Since you're the cake, once the people get a taste
Of what you're really worth they'll see you were a waste
But the , the newspaper types your name in big letters
But I'll still fight  any of you rappers, and I mean any
In actuality it ain't but so many
That I could consider, a  spot hitter
You rhyme like babies and I am the sitter
Why don't you children play a man's game?
When they talk about the best, believe me your name
Is not ever mentioned, 'cause I get the attention
For being the baddest since the invention
Of rhyming on the microphone, alone
I own the floor, you clone, get off my  in the danger zone
You speak so weak your rhymes are 
You try to freak  and so you have to sneak
And say you're better, like a sucker instead of
Tellin' the truth, you'd rather let a
Knucklehead who's never heard a real rhyme
Think that you're great, the blind leading the blind
Now the young hip-hoppers don't know what it's about
'Cause when rappers was real they wasn't hanging out
Now they see you phony, a  pony
Sneaker-wearing,  one and only
Dark-skinned in leather, all of y'all together
Could team on up and battle me, y'all could never
Ever amount to what I am
'Cause I'm Kool Moe Dee, better known as the man
No matter how you suckers feel
I am the best, 'cause I'm for real
Suckers!

"Bad, Bad, Bad",Funke Funke Wisdom,1991,"Since the day I was born I was on a mission
Never played out of position or wishin or missin
I came out kissin, was no spankin the backside
Just ovulating nurses waitin for black eyes
I - I was talkin way before I could crawl or walk
And what the ladies heard, wasn't baby talk
I'd drop a line like a bomber would drop a bomb
Highly explosive, but notice, I was cool and calm
Ready for action, at the age of 1 the fun
Was just beginning, I was winning, the ladies would come
With arms open and hopin for a kiss and a hug
I stripped down, huh, and watched the ladies bug
I stood up for a while, then I started walkin
I heard the ladies say, ""Look who's talkin""
That's right, baby, you can leave me alone
Cause if you can't please me, don't tease me, cause I'm bad to the..

Bad, ba-ba-bad, bad
(Big bad..)	--] Run

As a teen I was on the scene cleaner than clean
Mean lean fighting machine with self-esteem
No dope, crack, coke, flat broke I'm not
Sell smoke, no, no, won't smoke the pot
Gettin high off life was more than enough
And peer pressure ain't pressure when a boy is tough
And I was tougher than tough, I'm from the darkside
And hangin out in the park and in the parkside
Play a brother in any game he wanted to play
For fun or money, for money if he wanted to pay
I wasn't diggin for niggas, so brother, dig deep
If one got over, it's over, I let the kid keep
A little change, it's strange, he want to bet it back
I took his claim to fame, he want to get it back
And when the night was over I took his girl home
I dimmed the lights and showed her that I was bad..

Now I'm in my 20s with plenty money and honey bunnies
20s and 10s, drive a Benz, you can't take nothin from me
Cause I came up on the streets, a straight up poor boy
But I beat the game, but it was war, boy
Because the streets entice you for the wrong things
I couldn't pay the price, I wrote a song theme
And from the moment I touched the microphone
It was known that I was bad to the bone
But weak rappers and a lack of promotion
Made the job hard, I had to throw some
Weak lyrics together, just to get paid
'Go See The Doctor', and I got played
The train continued to the 'Wild, Wild West'
I heard some brothers say, ""He ain't the best""
Huh, but check the records that ain't well known
And look around and see all my clones

By the time I'm in my 30s my worth be - I bet I'm dirty rich
Sittin on the top of the world with about 36
Million in my pocket and rockin it from the mountain top
Livin it at ease, cool breeze, because I'm countin top
Dollar, I'm a scholar seekin knowledge, I'm a truth-seeker
The baddest brother on a microphone and two speakers
On turntables I'm able to start a movement
And when I move the crowd, the ladies move with
Fire in the eyes, the eyes never lie
So feel the fire and desire, keep your eye on the prize
Ladies, listen to the man and watch me work
Fellas, keep your cool when she goes bezerk
Cause I touch em in places that most men don't
Don't get jealous, fellas, oh, that's all she wrote
Then when the night is over you'll be alone
Cause ladies love ya when a brother is bad to the bone",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-bad-bad-bad-lyrics
I’m Kool Moe Dee,Kool Moe Dee,1986,"What are you crazy, you know who I am
(Moe Dee!) yes, I'm the man
I am the flyest, cleanest, baddest, meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
I'll take you where I wanna go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if there's someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross, they'll say, 'don't you know?
Really, really, really don't you know?'
Cause I'm a real rap warrior, Elite Astoria
I'll take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And I'll prove that they're all ducks
Cause I don't care nothin 'bout your money and gold
Don't wanna hear about how many recrods you sold
Cause none of that don't mean nothin to me
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee
What are you senile, have you lost your mind?
I'm the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rapper's hall of fame, bein that it's all a game
I might not be down, because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin, that's why I'm tellin
You, when I go, homeboy, I'm gone
Cause I'm better but don't get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant, my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And we're all enemies on the court
But when the game is over I'll shake your hand
Give ya a pound, cause you're still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy, it's a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya, try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause I'm an intellect, ya
Bird brain rappers I call hip-happers
Not hip-hoppers, cause y'all just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins, soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But I'm perfect, I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but no Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee
Don't piss me, I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off? Don't diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers, beam em up, take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by mega-millions, you witness a burst
Of a new society, rappers with variety
So much prestige, flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
It's hard to believe but think about it, it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
There's no race no contest, I'll never have to jostle
They're small time, to them I am collossal
I'm a gladiator with the image of a god
I'm powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm, recite em as poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement, lo and behold
The Ice Man cometh, Kool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god, apex of the hip-hop cult
I'm the leader rhyme breeder, yes, I am the ult-
Imate idolized figure, there's not a name bigger
Than Kool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and that's cause I
Really feel that I'm the best, so I personify
Rap to the fullest, I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I don't stop rockin under no condition
I rock non-stop but don't ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion, some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion?
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if it's your brain, the answer's of course cause I'm a
Auto-hypnotic, reverse-pschotic
That'll make you feel, if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali

I’m Blowin’ Up,Knowledge is King,1989.0,"I'm T-N-T and I just can't lose
An E-M-C-E-E with a fuse
When it's lit I'm hit with the lyrical wit
Of a scientist, that's tryin' this
Sugar coated, rhyme loaded with gunpowder
Now see how the crowd will yell louder
Now the rhyme is dropped and you hear a pop
Think it's a shot but you just can't stop
Your heartbeat vibrates at my rate
So why wait, I hate to be irate
Anger causes rhyme combustion
Like a tornado the winds start gustin'
Rhymes unload, reload, and explode
Ride the same wave Malcolm X rode
On a higher level cause I left the rest
Outcast, outlast, F the press
When I hit, it's like a bulldozer
Boom and there goes ya
Whole world up in smoke
When I go I go for broke, I'm blowing up
I'm on the hype tip
I'm on the mic with
Tunnel vision
Cause I'm mic whipped
Strung from lung to tongue
I breathe rhymes that come from
A zone that's hidden and forbidden
If any man enters, good riddance
A mortal mind is just no contest
The rhyme zone is my conquest
The Twilight Zone will seem like child's play
Am I a genius? Heheh, I'll say
I'm so cool and yet so hyped
When I'm on the mic it's something like
Hiroshima, remember Pearl Harbor
Feel the fire but don't bother
To run for cover you don't escape
On record compact disc or tape
Once you play it the fuse is lit
An explosion, you getting hit
With rhythmic prophecies, visions I foresee
Me blowing up in your face now stop to see
Smoke fumes in the shape of a mushroom
Cloud the room because I went boom
I'll light the sky like a comet
When it comes to rap, I'm it, I'm blowing up

I'm blowin' up for the fans that crave
Hip hop with relevance I'm here to save
Rap from an early grave like god I gave
Life to the mic as I watch it enslave
All the sellouts who yell out
Obscenities and spell out
M-O-N-E-Y to propel out
Of the ghetto, but like Othello
You kill the mic, a cappella
You're in the cellar
You rap like
Rap is a dash for cash
You'll run out of gas
It's a marathon
How long can you last
With repetitious nothing
Renditions of something
You can't create
So you imitate the pumping
Only the strongest can last as long as
I last, my reign is the longest
In hip-hop history, check the book
Victory after victory, man look
Rapping is a science, the mic is an appliance
So I applied it to an alliance
Of words, put them in a rhyme song
Blew them up, like a time bomb
Other emcees caught the debris
Little bits and pieces of me
Put my ideas on a track you laid
Is like pulling my pin and I'm a grenade, I'm blowing up
Clap, your hands to that
Old track that brought back the man that raps
Much better than the next man, I'll take an ex-fan
And make them rock harder than any other brother can
Whoever didn't understand my game plan
Should feel ashamed like a lame cause I'm the same man
That ran the rap yard for years, worked hard for years
But never got paid and slaved and starved for years
Then other rappers came off with rhymes that are soft
I went with the flow and you said I fell off, hah
Don't be bogus, where's your focus?
I did what I had to, now notice
The dollars are rolling, no more holding
Back the rap attack I'm back on top controlling
The whole rap game again, like I did way back when
Def Jam was a dream, I was slaying men
Whoever thinks he wants some, he don't want none
He's got to be insane or just plain dumb
But if you think you got something to prove
Jump, make your move
But come in a tank and ten suits of armor
I won't whip ya, I'll bomb ya
And when you're on fire it still ain't enough
Cause I don't just burn you boy, I blow ya up",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-im-blowin-up-lyrics

We can throw

Huh! When I get busy, the crowd gets dizzy
And when I'm on the stage, the party people say, ""Is he
Really human or is he a robot?""
Because when I'm on the microphone nobod-
Y does the things that I do
My voice will guide you
Once you hear it, it stays inside you
Hypnotizing and mesmerizing
The cerebral cortex, but without realizing
You become confused and so enthused
Cause the rhymes I use can make you lose
Total control, and if I choose
To call you the paperboy you'll spread the news
Like Paul Revere: ""A real rapper is here!""
Yeah, ""Moe Dee is coming, Moe Dee is coming""
And teeth will chatter, plagiarists will scatter
Nothing is the matter, you're just looking at a
Real rap trooper with a power so super
After battlin' me, I guarantee you won't recouper-
Ate cause I am great, I can make you hate
To ever look in the mirror and affiliate
Yourself with anything but an average person
Lovin' my success but envious and cursin'
You want my autograph, don't act like a sucker
Just gimme a pound 
'cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

I put a hurtin' on rappers, egos are crushed
Pride is swallowed, asses are bust
Hearts are taken, souls cremated
Lips are sealed and they hate it
Overrated rappers made it
On a wing and a prayer with old beats updated
But I'm not like you bitin' barbarics
Rappers with the fresh beats and weak lyrics
I'm cyanide, deadly and lethal
I never run out, I got an automatic refill
I never get cold, I only get lukewarm
When I wanna get hot, I have a real brainstorm
Ideas start flowin', my talents start showin'
And if the music stops, Moe Dee keeps goin'
I'm bigger than life and deeper than death
The world of rap is like a kitchen and I am the chef
Boy, are these MCs really startin to irk me
Make it to the top, then try to jerk me
Ask 'em who's the best, their shoulders start shruggin'
Like they don't know, they must be buggin'
But I like the controversy, it makes me bloodthirsty
And one day I'll make them all beg for mercy
So remember that if you wanna act like a sucker
Don't ever make me mad cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)

I'm the kinda rapper that a dummy won't dig
My IQ's too high, my words are too big
My voice too clear and my rhymes are ample
Some things I won't do and here's an example
I won't make a ""La-Di-Da-Di"", an ""Oh! Veronica""
A ""Dear Yvette"" or a ""La-Latoya""
I'm not tryin' to diss the rappers that made these cuts
As a matter of fact I like them, but
Records like that are for the average MC
Not for the highly rated Moe Dee
I have a formula, I'm like a scientist
And I must put words together like this:
My voice is auriferous, coming out an orifice
Expressing hyperbole, verbally or if it's
Mental or symmetric that makes me so electric
By spontaneous combustion an explosion is expected
A walking time bomb that can't be disconnected
I'm a rhymer with a timer, I'm a English dialectic
My ideas are impeccable, rhymes are paragon
My soliloquy will affect ya like Farrakhan
Love me or hate me, agree or debate me
Watchin' suckers gather 'round, bow down and fellate me
'Cause what I do orally is something so morally
Stimulating, emulating heat that's 
My mind is both flexible and resilient
Pugnacious, tenacious, vivacious, I'm brilliant
Through rigorous training, it's self-explaining
Why I'm standing on the top and that's where I'm remaining
My brain rocks like Mr. Spock's
And any other MC's are knocked out the box
So you know where to kiss, so line up and pucker
Sucker MC's, I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad mutha-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Now I was never solo, I was always in a group
So now you new jacks are a little too souped
So if you think you could take mine
Then come on and 
make my
Day
, you idiot, you knew from the giddy-up
You didn't have a chance
But if you want drop the pants
I spank that ass so fast that the next time you glance
Everyone will be laughing and you'll be the stock
Cause that's what's good about havin' you MC's on the jock
I could go on and on and on and on for days
But every time I speak I get unwanted protégés
If you've been lucky so far, don't press your luck
Cause you don't really want none cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-bad-mutha-lyrics
Pump Your Fist,Knowledge is King,1989.0,"Can you feel it
Tension in the air
Racism
Violence everywhere
Davis, Howard Beach
Bumpers and Brawley
It appalls me
Now it's there
Really racial justice
It's time that we discussed this
I'm disgusted
I don't trust it
What's this
About
New evidence brings doubt
On who took King out
Must have had clout
Took the Kennedy route
Witness
Stories contradict and
Confliction make Black men
Say it had to end
It won't happen again

Hittin' home

Is the danger zone
Liars and bigots
And hypocrites start to panic
They get frantic
Power
Generated by the truth
Time to educate the youth
The lust for money
Is out of control
Here's proof
Drugs
Always a tragic ending
And at the risk of spending
Time in jail
Caught on a bum sale
They persist
Knowin' death's a risk
Ignorance is bliss
Chump their face
Kill their race
They deserved to get dissed

From what happened in the past
Has made us walk a path
Made by slavery
Though bravery
We lost
Our unity our source
Of power and we lost
All race pride
In our Holocaust
Now it's my creed
I'm from a stronger breed
My ancestors indeed had to bleed
Whipped 'till they were freed
And now
I look back and say wow
How did we allow
Physical slavery
I just don't ever again
See it now I vow
Pump your fist (3x)

In actuality
Let's talk reality
Can't you see
The slave mentality
It's a sickness
That eats you up like cancer
And money's not the answer
Won't advance ya
Don't take a chance ya
Lame
Selling drugs for fame
That's the weak man's game
It's a shame
You got the chains on your brain
You're givin'
Drugs to kids and livin'
Half your life in prison
God's for givin'

All Night Long,Knowledge is King,1989.0,"It's about time
For some action
I'm hot as a tamale on fire
I need more than
A physical attraction
Cause lust is a weak desire
A woman without a good
Head on her shoulders
Is nothing but a piece of meat
For that I'll go to the butcher store
Cause I'm choosy about what I eat
The body is a mere appetizer
And the mind is the real main course
The personality is the icing on the cake
The real magnetic force
The completion of any kind of coffee
Makes my percolator perk
And once I taste the coffee
So get ready to work
All night long
How many ladies
Are deep enough
To handle a man
Like me
I mean mentally
Emotionally and physically
I like my women deep
I like 'em
Hot blooded by nature
But not promiscuous
A women who can relate to
Being spontaneous
And yet I like 'em old-fashioned
Updated with a modern day twist
A women that's a slave to passion
But know when to resist
I like a woman
That's not so public
Cause no one needs to know
And if you can respect my privacy
The forever we're good to go
All night long
Scintillating, sultry, stimulating, sexy
Super, subtle, smart, and seductive
Sensitive, serious, succulent, sensuous
Softly saying she loves this
Kind of
Mental stimulation
That's causing body heat
Visually anticipating
Making love between the sheets
Now I can't stand a groupie
But I'll always love a true fan
Someone ready to do me right
Once she knows the man
I admit I love it in public
Cause it's cool being Kool Moe Dee
But behind closed doors
I get the applause
For just being plain old me
All night long
I never like to make the first move
I'mma rapper but I don't rap
Cause when it comes to the ladies
I'm too smooth for that
I love a women with a good sense of humor
For me that is essential
Uninhibited and very deep
Someone I can really get into
And once I get into ya
I can feel if you're for real
And right is how I'll do ya
I'll give you something you can feel
It's like a romance
Right out of a storybook
Without the
Wine and candles
An encounter
You'll never forget
But don't try it
If you can't handle

How Kool Can One Blackman Be,Funke Funke Wisdom,1991.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ice water, watch your daughter
Your mother and your sisters, aunts
Nieces and your wife's ought to
Know, ain't nobody safe when I'm in the place
I'm dropping more bass when face-to-face
Erase haste with the taste of a steady pace
Ain't no time to waste and it ain't no race
You state your case and work your weights
Without a trace... and just wait
For double-black to double back and make that move
Break it to ya, I'ma do ya, and I ain't that cool
Enough to take you plus I ain't just
Here to bust, so you know what: it ain't just
Another brother or another joke with money
Cause I'm giving you something to work with honey
You can feel the heat but it ain't no pressure
When I turn the heat on, the cool breeze'll refresh ya

How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

Put it in flow-motion, ice cool with a nice cool breeze
Native-sung native tongue for the young ladies
Dropping rhymes, rocking minds and concubines
Treat it like a king of this hip hop thing that rhymes
Manifest as a vehicle, and see a full
Picture I'm wit'cha, I'll hit'cha with mixtures
And become a fixture inside your heart
Make you feel the pulse of my beat even miles apart
Ain't no mountain high enough, or a valley low
To stop Kool Moe, I got a cosmic flow
I glow like a moon, it dictates your mood
But cool ain't a mood, it's an attitude dude
It's a tone, it's a tempo, a mindset, a rhythm
A lifestyle, religion, it's just how you're livin'
I'm righteously cool while here and hereafter
I'm so cool that I have to ask ya

How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

Easy does it, not because it's easy
Turn the heat on and it still won't freeze me
Internal climate control controls the climate
That's why I rhyme at the temperatures I'm at
Usually freeze competitive emcees
And breaks them down in threes, and lights them up like Christmas trees
Fortified with tranquility, to deal with the trilogy
I got the ability for upward mobility
Break calm, genetically athletically mental
Exercising thoughts cause I went through
Party like a trooper, complete mind fighter
And now I'm known, a super elite rhyme writer
Now there's women and millions in dollars and loads
Fly gear to wear as the stage explodes
Role model for the people cause I keep a level head
When I look into the mirror the reflection said

How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

I never lose my composure cause I ain't supposed to
I rose for the occasion, thoughts never froze, I chose
A pattering pattern that patterned to the battle zone
You can get rattled home, so don't even travel, roam
Or drift or wander into my vicinity
I'll respond and conk with no affinity
Identity scrape, broken down on tape
And it ain't no escape, and you gets no breaks
I make few mistakes cause I strive for perfection
Head for the hills if I shoot in your direction
Protection's limited, heroic images
Are broken down, hell-bound from the minute its
Image is amplified, I'll be damned if I
Believe the hype of stereotypes, I plan to die
Like a warrior, fight until I'm free
How cool Can One Black man Be?

How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

Wisdom

Money - the root of all evil
Follow the dollar, and where will it lead to?
Pseudo science, material math
6 degrees of knowledge, brother, you don't know the half
Symbolizin symbolism, excercisin exorcism
Make a little money, now you wanna tell me how you're livin
Suckers sellin what you're sellin, now you're sellin out
The devil sold a dream and you bought it without thinkin 'bout
How the beast will decrease the brain wave
With material thoughts from the crib to the grave
Slaves, got you livin just to die
For the money, lookin sweet, slick and sly
Long as you're ridin and your system's fly
You don't give a damn if your homeboys die
So we gotta find a way to get paid in this system
With or without money - with funke funke wisdom
Funke, funke, funke
Funke, funke, funke...

Women - very significant
Power is what she represents
Contrary to what many brothers believe
Learn the metaphysical meaning of Eve
When you get funke wisdom, then you'll understand
The woman is the driving force for any powerful man
]From birth to earth and earth to re-birth
It ain't a curse, put your thought in reverse
Disperse rehearse your medium, verse first
And understand it ain't a purse that can quench your thirst
For love connections and spiritual conceptions
Not a act of x-rated sex, any
Man without a woman is incomplete
And vice versa she's obsolete
So I make sure within a part of my system
I got funke funke wisdom
Funke, funke, funke
Funke, funke, funke...

Mathematically it all adds up
All people are equal, but equal in what?
Once you understand that there's a spiritual math
Add soul to the science and subtract the riff-raff
24-7-365
Cause 9 to 5 ain't live
We're in overdrive
Take the 1st power, elevate to the 3rd
Manifest the power of the spoken word
360 degrees are subliminal
Fortified with a 144 minerals
4 elements and 4 seasons
4 corners of the world, it's all even
Mother nature and father time
Aligned with the 9 planets and combined
To influence the mind and control the whole system
Knowledge ain't enough, you need funke funke wisdom

That's right, baby, I run the yard
Got the bass for your bottom, if you feel it in your butt
Do your dance, and I tell you what
When this party is over, there'll be no more rappin
You and I can spread out, and anything can happen
If the party's not enough, and you still think you're ready
You ain't gotta clap your hands and dance, but we can still rock steady
Rock steady

If the party's not enough, and you still wanna rock, say...
Rock (rock) steady (steady)
Come on, rock (rock)

Am I a trooper? I'm a super scooper
I enlist girls like I was a recruiter
Gettin ready for an all-out war
I'm a lover, that's out to score
I wanna see you at the party, we can dance a bit first
And if you really rock your body, we ain't even gotta converse
After the party, all I wanna do is come over
And tell you that I want you
And if you don't wanna go, just listen to the drums
Feel the beat - and it'll make you come
And don't try to front, cause I'll call your bluff
Don't kick me no bass, cause I got enough
Just let the music keep flowin, watch your head start goin
Up and down, suggestin 'yes' without ever knowin
You'll be soaken wet and drenched, sweaty and ready
But not to clap your hands and dance, but you can still rock steady

Come over here and get some of this real di-
Different kind of lovin that I call rockin
Oh boy, can I rock? All night long
Cause my rap is strong
I betcha I'll rock your socks
Cause I'm a super lover, undercover
Watch your sister and your mother
Scream, dream, cream, kick, bite and fight each other
I make em drool, cause I'm so cool
I got the tool to rule, and I guarantee you'll
Encounter a night like never before
If you ever walk through my party doors
You come over and over, again and again
And next time you'll bring a friend
Because at my party you gotta be ready
Cause I'm takin no shorts, baby doll, I'ma make you rock steady

Where you been, man?
What's up with the new sound?
I ain't heard from you in a while, man
What you been doin, man?
Some of my homies don't even know you
What's up with that?
What's up with that?)
Let us begin with a funky in-tro
My name is Kool Moe Dee, what up, what up - yo
And for those of you who just don't know
Or might no recognize me from the funky - flow
I am the brother from the Wild Wild - West
But I'm not comin on the new wild - quest
Because I can't get with the new - sound
Because I don't like the way it's goin - down
Brothers always say they wanna keep it - real
But how many brothers really kick the - skill
So what you got a little street - appeal
So you promote genocide, for what? A - deal?
Well, I was never with that - scene
Because the ends could never justify the - means
And if it's all about gettin that - green
I been there, I done that, I mean
I'm doin my thing, kid
(Yo, what kinda flavor is that, man?
I want the new stuff, man)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(The hardcore, gimme the hardcore stuff, man
Come on)
I'm doin my thing, kid
(I hear you, but the brothers ain't with the positive stuff
Won't you kill a rhyme?)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(Shoot somebody in the next verse, aight?
Kill somebody)
Brothers say they wanna be hard-core
So in their own communities they start - war
You really don't care because you say you got - yours
But think about it for a second, stop, pause
If all you wanna do is get - paid
Then you ain't nothin but a paid - slave
The Uncle Tom of the New - Age
Cause sellin out ain't nothin new - wait
Cause you can pull a trigger on a nigga well
You think you're bigger, nigga, stop and think you sell
Ain't nothin hard about committin homicide
Cause genocide is really suicide - right?
Well, think about it on a higher - level
You sold your soul and you got hired by a - devil
To reek havoc in the ghetto, y'all go head on
Keep runnin with God like a runnin rebel
Doin my thing, kid
(What's all this rhymin about God
What you're tryin to do, man?)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(You a reverend or something?
Tryin to be a preacher or what?)
I'm doin my thing, kid
(Give it up with the preachin God
Just rhyme, just rhyme)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(Alright then, flip the flow, change your flow
Be like somebody else)
I'm true to the game, so I keep inventin
Hype rhymes for the times and I'm representin
Kick flavor while I'm eatin up the best of em
Then put em in the pile with the rest of em
When I flip it and hit it, some brothers don't get it
They want me to kick it like others - forget it
I tailor-made a style for the microphone
You can search the rap files but it's mine alone
I won't get in to fit in the flow, it's won't simulate
Now bein one of the best causes them to hate
The freestyle master cause I'm a outcast
You ever stop and ask yourself how to outlast
All those before me and the many that came after
The critics who dissed this I dimiss with laughter
Ain't no puzzle, put a muzzle on their face
And watch the hype crowd sing
I'm doin my thing, kid
(Man..
Alright, I see what you're doin
I can get with that)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(I kinda like that, yo
Go ahead and do yo thing, kid)
I'm doin my thing, kid
(Yeah, yeah, I dig it, I dig it
Go ahead, do your thing)
Hey yo, I'm doin  my thing, kid
(Hit me with one more and let em know where it's comin from)
I worked with Sugarhill Gang, Run and Heavy D
Eric B., Big Daddy Kane and Public Enemy
]From '79 to '94, now that's longevity
You got a problem with the flow, here's a remedy
Just sit back, relax, in fact, try to hear it
Cause I'm comin back to back, you gotta wear it
Ain't no sense goin against the grain
Get yourself a surf, dude, ride the wave
Cause this ain't the regular style, ain't no competators, I'll
Take out the negative while just like a predator I'll
Prey and on play on and stay on the airwaves
You heard I'm fallin or fell, chalk it as hear-say
Ain't no defense mechanism or criticism
Capable of doin no nothings here, that's how I'm livin
You can bring whatever you got to bring

Look at me, cool as I wanna be
Fly as they come, Messiah to some, born to be
One of the chosen few, chosen to go into
Rhymes that change in time, as it grows into
Riches, hitting switches, your whole lifestyle
You're in the spotlight, overnight flight miles
Away, today I'm flying high
So I give thanks to the Man in the sky
I remember a time whenever a rhyme
Left your lips, it only could get nickels and dimes
But nickels and dimes wasn't enough to eat
So I guess you could say I was saved by the beat
On the street, surrounded by sin
I never sell out, and I wouldn't give in

See your skin, you're my kin
And I made you Funke""

Save the children, that's my job
Working overtime, going over rhyme

Gentlemen and ladies
Adults teenagers adolescents and babies
No if's and's but's or maybe's
I want the whole world to rock today
Because I said I was and always was
The baddest rapper on the mic and I proved it does
Make a difference
On the way you think you syn-
Cronize the wise tries
To overcome the dumb the drum
Beats a pattern that turns into
A catalyst that'll just
Grab your ear you had to hear
A rhyme's contents
Beyond nonsense
If you're not convinced
Get tense and wince
Cause I'll make a skeptic
Look epileptic
Shake and brake like the Holy Ghost connected
His body and soul
I control
His mind is mine cause my
Rhyme holds
Minds in limbo
You resemble
A clone of Jim Jones as them bones tremble
Shakin' like a leaf in disbelief
No chatterin' teeth
Can cease pity or grief
I got you flipping like a burger
Head spinning like a top
Weak at the knees
And you're about to drop
You can't find your heart
You need a warrant to search
Get off your knees
Boy this ain't church
You can pray if you wanna pray
Say what you wanna say
Did you forget you was ambiguous
You're gonna pay
For doubting my rhyme
You better freeze your thought
Cause I read minds
If you got caught
I taught
Lessons for second-guessing
Reroute doubt
I reprogram and deprogram about
Two million fans
Through rhytmic hypnosis
Left in a state
Of cataclysmic neurosis
Neurotic from a narcotic
Known as rhyme
Addicted to rap
And you're a fiend for mine
For my rap info
You're a nympho
I'll raise the conscience
And then hit them so hard with the rhyme
I'mma leave you scarred
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
I weave the bob
To do the job
Set you up with the left
As the right writes hard
Lyrics stick and move
Behind the groove
As the beat gets better
The rhyme improves
Adversaries prepare for a telling loss
Bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
My rhyme is more
Than a fight or a bout
You ain't goin' down
Boy you're goin' out
No count necessary
Cause you ain't gettin' up
Bad mouthin' ends very
Very very abrupt
Thought patterns converted
Through overt overtures
Prepared your mind
Much better for metaphors
More rap classics
Believe me there's no man
Not Bach Brahms Beethoven or Chopin
Polonaise would ever faze ya
Like I faze ya I amaze ya
Ali and Fraizer I
Get deja vu from listening to
The rhymes that cut like an uppercut
And rings a bell too
I come out smoking
Hard from the first round
Stinging like a bee
And the bell is the worst sound
Cause I don't wanna let up
If you can get up
I'm fed up
The rhymes are sped up
To mess your head up
When the rhyme is over
They tally the scorecard
I get more points
Cause you hit the floor hard
The very last thing
That you remember
Is a rhyme in your face
And the crowd yell ""timber""
Then you fall in a dopefiend nod
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
When I rain
It's more like a hurricane
You wanna dis
Then think of another name
Cause I go to work
And my rhymes slam
Put me to the test
You'll fail the exam
Cause that's the kind of test
You just can't study for
You're guaranteed
To end up bloody or
Broken twisted
Fractured blistered
Decapitated mutilated
Violated it's the
Kind of defeat
That you just can't live with
Try to compete
But you just can't get with
The Mental Master
Hard-ryhme supremist
My words have ya
Mixed like a chemist
My rhymes flow like

Cleaned with chlorine
To make green so
The rhyme is purified
You can't drink it
Biters and suckers
Don't even think it
The green I made
Is a money shade
When the rhyme evaporates
I get paid
Then it's time to rain
With the rhyme I know
And like plants
Watch my people grow
I heal sick minds
Like Christ himself
Touch the soul
Like no one else
There's only one
President Pope and one God
There's only one rapper

Get the Picture,Knowledge is King,1989.0,"Yo
I had to go for mine
From the bottom to the top is a hard climb
But hard rhymes beat hard times
Gimme a spotlight and I'll shine
Brighter than the brightest star
No matter who you are
You're outdone, I won
And for the coup de grâce
Competition turns into fans
Like a politician
My competition spans
From country to country
It's never too far cause I'll take 'em all
From the Shah to the Czar
The Fu Man Chu
The Prime Minister too
The King and the Queen
My rhymes are so mean I'll do
A number on the country
Like never before
Is it a contest
Or the threat of world war
Choose your weapon no half-steppin'
And let's go
But if ya steppin' watch ya step
And step slow
Take your time change your mind
Cause steppin' to my rhyme is like
Steppin' on a land mine
Blowing you to kingdom come
This ain't Vietnam
A brother thinks he's ready for war brings him on
A perilous journey
You catch a hernia
Trying to burn me
Cause like an attorney I'll
Cross-examine
Your rhymes of my design
And I'm styill standing
Tall
As the competition falls
In actuality ain't no competition y'all
Cause I'm rollin' over
Rappers like a U.S. tank
Meanwhile laughin' all the way to the bank

Suckers
Tried to put me down
Said rap was crap
And wouldn't be around
Any longer than two years
But eight years later
I'm still here
Fully paid
Because the rhymes I made
Made dollars and cents
I wasn't dense
I stayed
Away from drugs
I never touched a pipe
When I wanna get high
I smoke the mic
I never did white lines
I only write lines
And I ain't sniffin' nothing but
The vapors from hype rhymes
As I start to float
On the rhymes I wrote
Ascending to a level with the gods and I tote
Loads and mounds of people
As they reach new heights
A half-a-mile from heaven is the party site
And I'm the attraction
The Gods will be packed in
Coming out of their pockets for me to rock it
And acting
Like they've never ever ever been entertained
They try to act godly but they can't maintain
Aphrodite would freak
As her knees get weak
And Venus would peak
Off every word I speak
Zeus would get loose
Fully induced
I'll make Apollo's ryhmes sound like
Mother Goose
By night's end
Mercury is so hyped
He'd spread the word
That there's a god on the mic
Captivating all the other gods
By the masses
Described as a dark-skinned brother in glasses
But unlike the other gods
I ain't a myth
You wanna rif
I suggest you take the fifth

Knowledge
Is the source of my success
History is the course
And life's the test
For those who don't know
History's repetitive
Lack of knowledge
Serves as a sedative
Makes you relax and max
The lack of facts
Holds you back
The odds are stacked
Against a weak mind
Makes a meek mind
But mine ain't weak
I got a piece and I'ma speak mine
Telling you the truth
I raise the roof
With rhymes so hard
I'm bulletproof
One slip of the lip
Could sink your ship
You wanna get hip
Let's take a trip
All aboard
This is the last call
I ain't a mandate cause
I'll only ask y'all
Once and only once
To purchase a ticket
Get on the rap train
Watch me kick it
From state to state
And every little hick town
They'll all be down
With the new hip sound
Treating me like more
Than just a star of the sport
But more like the judge in a court
Y'all rise
And raise your hands in the air
Pump your fists
And solemnly swear
To rock the truth
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth
Not only the youth
Cause the young and the old
Are all alike
It makes no difference
When I'm on the mic
For those who can't
Visualize what their eyes can't see

Designed to back you up
I back it up with the spectacular
You're just a fraction of my perpendicular
With no particular linear structures
I'm giving you ruptures
As I erupt into your cerebellum
I tried to tell 'em, I open a vortex
Your cerebral cortex sends a reaction
That has 'em like a spasm
Upon further review, you see it was lyrical orgasm
How did it happen? You can't even describe the vibe
What was the essence of god's presence felt inside
Bestowed upon you from the moment I dropped it on you
I strike like a thief in the night and can't nobody warn you
I'm on you, I got that truly godlike
Metaphysical, Neolithical
Ask what you see in me, lyrical deity
Hip hop's pantheon, one step beyond so I stand beyond

I lights 'em up like neon, locks 'em down like Dion
Reclaim my title three times like Ali when he beat Leon

Awake and achin', takin' Codeine

Pain relievers won't relieve ya
Suicide won't do it either
Even after I cremate you
I'm a reincarnate you
Bring you back for another round
Just to put you back in the ground

This is a flurry, a fist of fury
A rhyme so fast that it has to blurry
Your vision, don't wink, blink or stop to think
Or you might miss the next rhyme
Ink flows from the brain to the pen
And comes alive when the thought transcends
From the pen to the paper and paper to tape, and
A tape to the wax and back to the tape
Another hit which you can't get with
A brainiac'll react, but a nitwit
Can't relate, he can't hold the weight
The rhyme's too deep and he sleeps awake
The comatose need a double dose
'Cause Kool Moe Dee don't rhyme like most
Simplified rhymes or out of the norm
But I simplify if I'm to perform
Records for the pop/rock playlists
The pop jocks don't play this
In an intent to hold rap back
They stop the hard (hard) and play the wack (wack)
They play the weak 'cause the weak won't speak

And usually can't grow afros

The relevance of the beat of the drum
And where it's coming from
For those of you who just don't listen
Here's the second boat you're missin'
Just like Noah had you swimming
Rap's a warning of an ending
Of an era, a reign of terror
Over like a nova, never ever
Try to amplify the lie
The truth won't die, and that's why I
A versatile child of the Nile
Speak with a ghetto style, and meanwhile
The reason I relate to the youth
Is pure souls can feel the truth
The poisoned souls have tried to stop it
But just stop it, 'cause hip-hop is
From our roots, and you can't touch this

Once again it's the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame, watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Ain't it a shame? (rap is goin crazy)
The lyrical skills (are gettin kinda lazy)
The gift they're shootin (couldn't even graze me)
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play, G
Now who drops rhymes for the mind, only a handful
Only the deaf, dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness, flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet, I'm tired of hearin this

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties, and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasn't
Nothin lyrical, hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters, nothin against your
Fake lifestyle, but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive, cause it's inedited you think it's better with
Explicit illicit lyrics - but like a sedative
The rhymes ain't hype, so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brother's flow's like
So here come the flow, the lovable, huggable, colorful flow
The brother that glows, in the dark, cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows, I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe, the highs and lows
It's up and down and out you go
So back up, re-group, slow down and check the cut
And if you still ain't down, get up on these...

I always wondered how a rapper never could wreck shop
But if he had a funky track and a fat hook, he'd get props
Treated like some kind of hero, most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one, I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one, I'm second to none
I come in the circumference 360, as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High, you know the rhyme's most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene, I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets, I sinks the ships
So one shot, aye captain, I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin they're mackin, so I pimp-slap em
Showin em who's large in charge, runnin em up outta dodge

Can U Feel It,Greatest Hits ,1993.0,"When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?

Sitting on the corner trying to elevate my mind
I try to rise to seven levels just to drop the nine
Tick-tock-tick as the clock clicks, I'm
Tryna figure out how to move you with a rhyme
The hip-hop scene is flipping so I'm flipping with the scene
I try to write the rhymes so you see it on the screen
And get the verbal picture so I can hit you like a flick
Booming in the jeeps on the wreck-shop tip
Hard as any force yet smooth-n-butter song
Don’t ever try to battle ‘cause you’re guaranteed a loss
I’m like a hurricane, tenacious, mundane
A devastating force, a threat to the game
I balance the imbalanced and I challenge the un-challenged
I’ve never been defeated but the efforts have been gallant
So open up your chakra, so I can really rock ya
So when I say I feel it, then you got to ‘cause I got ya

When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?

Sitting on the park watching brothers play ball
I was in the nothing but the yes-yes-y’all
Never made no money but I had to pay dues
I rock around the block and rock the neighborhood crews
No ganging and no banging and no hanging, I refuse
I never sold paper but I spread the news
I never carried guns ‘cause I refuse to lose
I had to choose a weapon so I chose to chew
The microphone, the hyper tone is like I own the park
And I can throw a show and flow like Noah's flowing Ark
For forty days and forty nights, partied in the dark
While stepping till the A.M. total mayhem, ripped apart
Rumors liven fallacies and rap was just a fad
Unless a form of music use ‘cause that was all we had
But out of the oppression rises yet another leader
And this is just the vehicle to feel it when I feed ya

When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?

On the journey, the excellent trying to put it in a rhyme
I try to drop the funky lyrics in my travel time
Drop esoteric knowledge with an esoteric sign
I’m the Son of Man, but who was Mankind?
The highest form of nature's Afro-Asiatic base
So when it comes to music then I got to drop bass
So check the vibe as I rectify
I’ll connect advantage and the rhyme that amplifies
Radiates and animates and activates on
Manifesting unquestioned powerful force
Energy is tapered when the vapors are caught
But I’ll do battle with myself like a sport
In tune with the universe, wicked with the pen
Lyrics got the elements and this is how I win
I flow like water, blow like wind
Grow like earth, so feel the fire within

When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it

Driving down the boulevard
Turn the corner
Like I wanna be chilin' hard
The screen is set
For me to get wet
Cause it wouldn't be right
If the ladies didn't sweat
Pull the seat back
To make contact
Eye to eye
You know I ain't living like that
I wear shades
And I get paid
And when it comes to girls
I can't get played
Fly girls that
Used to ignore me
Now I pull up
And let the car speak for me
(beep beep)
Enough said
Better hop in while the light's still red
Homeboys scatter
What's the matter?
(""Here come the cops"")
Oh yeah that again
Rather than
Beating them down
I just talk to the men
They don't understand how I've got my cash
Then I get mad and tell them to ask
Their daughter
I bet she bought a
Kool Moe Dee tape
For her recorder
We're not always
Thieves and thugs
And what law says
We gotta sell drugs?
I get paid
And I'm making a killin'
But when I come home
I just like chillin'

Avenue, a-avenue (4x)

That's where the stars go
On the weekend
It's like a car show
Ladies flock to jock
Cars go by them
If I'm walking and talking
They ask what ya driving
When I peep that
Same old weak rap
Ask her her language
Tell her I don't speak that
Pull out a ""G""
A car key and a Visa
Walk her to the car
Leave her there ""see ya""
She didn't want
Nothin' else but a payday
Now she's sinking
Hollering Mayday
I knew her con
Cause two days ago
I saw that same slick girl
In a broken-down Yugo
With a hustler
Layin' low
Couldn't drive his Benz
Cause the cops said so
His homeboy got shot
In front of his crack spot
He moved cause it got too hot
But not on that block
The cops are watching
Baiting and plotting
Setting you up
For the raid in the block and
When they come
Everybody's got to go
But not Kool Moe
Cause they all know
The knot I got
Is way over their knot
But I'm working
That's why they're not
After me
They're after you
Cause I'm just chillin'
On the avenue
Avenue, a-avenue (4x)
Homeboys on the block all wanna get paid
Well, we can do this
The right way
You get money and respect
Live large and correct
Then come back driving through the neighborhood
When you look good
We all look good
Cause it's all for one
And one for all
It's got to be a better way
To get the money y'all",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-the-avenue-lyrics

Boy, you’re going crazy, really getting lazy
Rhymes as weak as water, even shorter than the days be
So you on the pop charts, got off to a fast start
Now it’s slowing down, homie, show me where is your heart
I want you to battle me but all you do is saddle me
Ride on my bone, and you won’t ‘cause you know that’ll be
Your crucifixion, my resurrection
Here’s my prediction: you need protection
(“Rock you”) (“Rock you”) (“Rock you”)

On and on ‘til your rhymes are gone
We could battle head up without singing a song
We’ll just go rhyme for rhyme, you’ll run out in due time
And I’ll keep going while I’m blowing you, I’m showing you I’m
Your superior ‘cause you’re inferior
Jump out of line one more time and I’ll bury ya
Say something, I dare ya—matter fact, where are your homeboys?
Bring ‘em on, the more the merrier
I know how to put an end to all of this
Is battle, winner take the money and the loser’s gotta quit
(“Rock you”) (“Rock you”) (“Rock you”)

Like you’ve never been rocked before, I’ll make ya sore
Freeze up like an ice cube and never thaw
Until I turn the heat on and once the heat is felt
Like ice, you’ll burn twice, you’ll do more than melt
Because I’ll evaporate you, and consolidate you
With the air, you’ll disappear, I’ll annihilate you
You might still be living but you feel deceased
You oughta name your next record “Rest in Peace”

I got a rhythm to ride, I can feel it inside
Of my bones, I got a jones, I’m the microphone pride of New York
When I talk, other emcees walk
Street critics rave and the ladies hawk
Complements are given ‘cause my rhymes are driven
By a ego that prevents me to bite ‘cause I’m not living like that
I am authentic, like the Titanic
But I’m unsinkable, believe it and then accept that
It’s reality, you have no choice
No screaming or yelling, I got a real voice
I’m badder than bad, no reason to get mad
When I pick up the mic, the young boys are had
And I can say what I want ‘cause nothing can be done
‘Cause I don’t fear none ‘cause not near one of you
Pussycat candy rap, need to get a jap slap
For saying that bullcrap and trying to call it real rap
Sorry chap, you’re just a new jack
Line up at rhyme prison, get in the back
Because I am the leader, the rhyme breather
And, and, you know you need a real leader
To, to, to help you see the way to be the
Man that you really think you are, a superstar
You fall short of that status, and by far
Because supers call me super, and that means superb
Not a nerd using verbs, and I ain’t the herb
That’s gonna sit back and relax and backtrack while you wack
Boys get paid and parade around stage ‘cause you made
A few hits, now you get do shit like your hits
Forget it! I ain’t wit’ it
You know I’m the best so admit it
And any rappers out there that don’t like what I said
Step forward and I’ll put that head to bed

A to B to D
Cause you can't hit what your eyes can't see

For all ears to hear and prepare
To persevere from year to year, and get geared
So weak rappers'll have to self-destruct

I'm harder than times in '29
Hard enough to cut diamonds, rhymin I'm
Sharp as a razor, 
cuts like a laser
And my rhyme can graze ya, I'm able to raise ya
From a dead level, I ain't a rebel
I just don't dance with the devil
Unless we're dancing in the ring
And then my dance is an Ali thing
Cause I shuffle and flow, and showboat what I wrote
And sugarcoat the globe and collect sweet g-notes
Go for the throat and watch the wicked choke
From the words I spoke 
because the rhyming smoke
Provoked thoughts of hope, no dope to cope
Cocaine and propane, no pain and no gain
The white demon is powdered and cut
Taste the real rock; time's up


High performance is lying dormant
Your mentality is out of the ordi-
Nary structure, you ain't a sucker
Go get paid like a renegade buster
Lyrical format I put down
And when it rips, better skip town
Metaphysical spiritual conscience
Manifested in lyrical contents
An ancient rhetoric, Moe Dee better kick
Soulful social science, and let it get
My class needs to thinking straight
Cause with speeds of light they can't relate

Man doesn’t have to lie, unless he’s just an average guy
Lying to girls just to get ‘em in bed
If anybody’s confused, I’ll repeat what I said
I’m a full-fledged player, you better believe it
Now you know what time it is, you can take it or leave it
I’m a player
(“Ain’t no trick”) (“Ain’t no trick”) I’m a player
(“Ain’t no trick”) (“Ain’t no trick”)

You said that I dissed you from the way I speak
Well, I call ‘em as I see ‘em—freak
Wanna play miss prissy innocent with me
When I know what you were doing last week
Riding around all over town, in and out of cars
Now how that sound?
You got a hundred beeper numbers in one phone book
And been with every other guy in town
If a guy has a hundred girls, he’s a hero
A girl with a hundred guys is a zero
Don’t blame me that society made the rule
But I think they made it for me
Varieties are right for me, but ladies in the place
Don’t you even try to be
A player, that’s my J-O-B, and I’m playing it to the T
I’m nothin’ but a player
(“Ain’t no trick”) I’m nothin’ but a player
(“Ain’t no trick”) (“1, 2, 3, 4”)

What’s up, baby, we hanging out tonight or what?
No, you’ve got too many women
Yo, wait, wait, wait, whatever you wanna do
Whatever I wanna do? Alright, bust it
We goin’ out to the movies, take a little something to eat or whatever
And we go back to my zone and get busy
Oh, you ain’t wit’ it?
What you mean you don’t know me that well?
I met you an hour ago
Nah, nah, nah, I got it, I’ll tell you what
You ain’t wit’ it, forget about it
What’s your friend name?
Excuse me, excuse me, come here a second…",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-im-a-player-lyrics
Don’t Dance,How Ya Like Me Now,1987.0,"I get on the mic for one reason, that is to be heard
And when I’m on the microphone, I hope you don’t miss a word
I’m not saying do not enjoy yourself, don’t take a chance
To shake your head, pat your feet, clap your hands, but don’t dance
‘Cause if you’re up and dancing then you won’t really hear
The smoking rhyme that I design for you all to compare
With the other brother lovers of the hip-hop culture
Beat is working, rhymes are perking, and it’s gotta be felt
But don’t dance…don’t dance

They consider me epitome of rap and I know
Rappers wanna get rid of me ‘cause at a live show
I got a voice like Luther, I’m bulletproof-a
A rhyme that I design will always make you, the
People take notice on how I always show this
Funky style, forget the smile, your face’ll say, “Yo, this
Brother’s not playing, you know what I’m sayin’”
MC’s on your knees say “Please start praying”
Don’t dance…don’t dance

Attention, at ease, emcees
You pay too much attention to the rhymes like these
One took part of my name, others part of my fame
One took the rhythm, now the people think that we’re on the same
Level of intelligence, but that’s irrelevant
If we ever battle head up, you won’t do well against me
I’m the originator, the only real creator
Called time bomb with the end of my detonator
Ready to blow up and totally show up
A rapper I’ll slap and with a mean rhyme slow up
Huh, you wanna go up against me, then throw up
Your mic stand but make plans to get tore up
‘Cause I’m gonna rip ya, I would strip ya of the title
But I got it, so get off my tip
Ya wannabe me MC, ooh wee—I’m rocking me now
I know I’m rocking you ‘cause I could see your hand
High-fivin’ ‘cause I’m live and saying “you heard the man”
Don’t dance…don’t dance…don’t dance

I said my rhyme loud, proud, now, look at the crowd
Fellas “ho”, ladies “ow”, how
Could you take my style, smile while stealing
You should bow down, bend, and be kneeling
Praying to me like a god, go on
Just say my rhyme, you’re on mine subconsciously
You know that you can’t live up
To my rap status, drop your mic, give up
‘Cause I am relentless, that’s why I spit this
Time to make a fresh rhyme and invent this
Style that you’re hearing, year out and year in
But suckers keep stealing it, and then swearing to God
They didn’t take it, they know they didn’t make it
But you can’t lie to yourself, give me a break, it
Seemed to me, that I was your favorite
Hip-hop hero back in the days, it’s
Undoubtedly, obviously true
You wanted to be another Moe Dee when you
Started rhyming, you see you had to be to some degree
An imitation, variation of me
And now all of a sudden, you’re competition
So now you think you can change my position
Don’t be dumb, I’m still number one
When you hear me come, you better run and hide out
And enjoy yourself while you got the crowd fooled
Believing you’re the best ‘cause I’ma take you to school
And if you really think you’re better, I want proof
I’m calling you out, this is the moment of truth
Don’t dance…don’t dance…don’t dance",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-dont-dance-lyrics

Say it Loud (African Proud),African Pride EP,UnKnown,"(Ugh!)
(Ugh!)
Some say we got a lot of malice
Some say we got a lot of nerve
But I say we can't quit fighting
Until we get what we deserve
Just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair
Brother, we can't quit
Until we get our share
Come on

Say it loud!

Come on, say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
(Louder!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Now I worked on jobs
With my feet and my hands
And all the work I did
Was for the other man
We demand a chance
To do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our heads against the wall
And workin for someone else
Come on
Say it loud!

Everybody, say it loud!

And yes y'all
Rise and shine
Brothers and sisters, it's that time
As the modern day prophets speak in rhythm and rhyme
Under the influence of the benign
Our rise as the weakest decline
So stick together and keep a positive mind
And sing this song one more time
Come on
Say it loud!

Everybody say it loud!

Brothers and sisters, say it loud!

Beaten and scorned
We been treated bad

Than keep living on our knees

It's gonna be music to your ear
You have no fear
Cause God is here
As the righteous get it in gear
And the wicked step to the rear
You're outta here
Feel the power in the rhythm
As our souls move vocally
Come together in a montage
A collage of harmony
Spirits manifest in our voices
As our hearts provide the beat
For a source of inspiration
When we speak in unity
Though it seems like it's a dream
This is as real as it gets
Controlling your environment
Through chanting your concept
Breathing life into lyrics
You can hear it, loud and clear
You can almost see the spirit
From vibrations that you hear
I'm a brother of color descent
From the mother continent
And I been sent with the intent
To rectify the hell-bent
From the line of the divine
Of those way before my time
Like a star I'm chosen to shine
As the God of Rhythm and Rhyme
Comin strictly from an Afrocentric point of view
I talk to you in a tongue that relates to the young
And if you can't relate, it ain't meant for you
This is strictly for the restoration of pride and enterprise
Esoteric knowledge - essential to our rise

Gimme My Props,Greatest Hits ,1993.0,"Hooooo! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

This is of low guard, what you call a jack move
I'm taking your flow cards, whoever can't rap smooth
I'm calling your bluff, I've seen enough, what, what
Don't you say nothing until I'm finished, your mouth's shut
You're answering ""yeah, yeah,"" your heart is inside there
So what's all this I hear, there's no one that I fear
I'll tell you what I'mma do, by showing you what I did
Too clever to ever lose, I'm stepping so what up kid
Who wanna play hard, he who can't go
He who shivers as I deliver the death blow
I hit him with rhythm and leave him livin' in sub bass
A musical prison that's only givin' him someplace
To exercise thought, memorize taught
Lessons his eyes caught while stepping in my sport
And rapping and clapping and finger-snapping and drop-slapping
Crashing and scratching an iron asking I'm props-snatching

Just give it here (give it here), but don't say nothing!
Just give it here (give it here), but don't hold back! 

I'm taking you to the hole, I don't need a picket roll
Bass in your face anyplace, shoot bulletholes full of soul
Come down like an avalanche, and you'll never have a chance
Believe me, you gotta dance, forget about backup plans
Who wanna get some? Get live, get dumb
Come get it, get with it when I hit it, then you get numb
Cause you can't get with a seasoned vet, better yet
An act of hall-of-fame rap name legend, let's
Take it to the stage, the next phase, let's trade
Lyrics like bullets and I wouldn't get grazed
The gift you shoot couldn't hit me at point-blank range
Now how could I ease the pain
I'll damage an amateur, flow on an all-pro
Wreck a vet like a rookie, now y'all know
This ain't nothing new, it's old news, nothing stops
And after bum-rushing crews, I'm bum-rushing props


This is how I change my flow
When it's time, I got a rhyme to go
A take-out order and I'll take out
Any other rapper even thinking about
""I might be,"" or ""could be,"" or ""maybe,"" or ""should we""
No matter how good he may think he's a would-be
Superstar that never got a chance to go far
The buck stops here, bad move, it's ov-ar
Can't nobody kick enough relevant flavor
Braggadocious rhythm with intelligence save the
Lyrical madness for suckers who had this
Hype-talk-caused status, personified badness
That don't add to nothing but mad faces and hot air
Bring him to the front and let me see what we got here
I'll rock him like his daddy with the lyrics I drops
Rock him to his knees and make him gimme my props


Hoooooooooooo! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

Now name another rapper that's had a longer reign
I've been rocking the mic from Sugar Hill to Run to Kane
And any new jack, that do that, the new jack will gain
Fully prepared, fully aware of the name
K-O-O-L, M-O so well
Established and rap is the habits, the local
Wannabe upstarts, rappers trying to jumpstart
Careers but I've got years ripping up charts
Any attack you attack will be countered
Any diss that you diss, I'll dismount it
Cause I get off on a soft, ain't hardcore
Sucker who's paying no dues but he got more
Props than loot, 
my new group's a substitute
Back up court, backs back on the bench, recruit
No more six-man co-star title shots
The long-reigning king of the rap games taking props",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-gimme-my-props-lyrics

Fast women, fast cars
Fast money, movie stars
Lights, cameras, glitz and glamor
Action role and broken grammar
Gangster lean, threads are clean
Talking red, black and green
Gold and diamonds, ride shinin'
Tape playing, Moe Dee rhymin'
Living large, big mirage
Cops scheming, pay the sarge
Girls want him, Feds taunt him
Streets haunt him, spirits mourn him
Chasing ladies, making babies
Living shady, wild and crazy
Doing crime, doing time
Favorite line: This world is mine
City slicker, big nigga
More bodies than Adolf Hitler
Cold-blooded killer man
Executing a killer's plan

Ha-ha-ha-hardcore, encore
Drug war, blood pours
Watch your back, got a pack
Keep a gun, on the run
Think quick, move slick
Ladies' trick, take your pick
Money rollin', pockets swollen
Rep growin', know you're goin'
Work a show when fear is showin'
Money stolen, and who's holdin'
Paranoid, self-employed
Can't avoid homeboys
Work wit'cha, mic hit ya
Somebody's gonna get ya
Cops bust 'em, can't trust 'im
Didn't talk, got to dust 'im
You get him or he'll get you
Some police in on it too
Stand tall, take a fall
Last call, take 'em all


B-Bum rap, death trap
Backtrack, think back
Bad decision, blurry vision
Money missin', on a mission
Want position, steady wishin'
Never listen in hell's kitchen
When you're livin', do or die
The strong survive, sell or buy
Crackheads, living dead
Their problem, they'll solve 'em
No tears, who cares
Getting yours, taking theirs
Meanwhile, on trial
Evidence on file
Next stop, state pen
Bigshot kingpin
Scarface wannabe
Now you're gonna see
The light clear, too late
Sold your soul, shows your fate
Bad karma, time to pay
Got to go, judgment day
Sold out, now you're cursed
Life in jail, if they don't kill you first",https://genius.com/Kool-moe-dee-gangsta-boogie-lyrics

Intense and I'm tense and I gotta be smooth

Have brothers have stepped to you with conventional lines
Like ""Glad that we met,"" ""Don't I know ya, don't I know ya?""
Some brothers might win, and others might blow ya
Her kiss from an open fist, what a bliss
But I think hard cause I don't wannna miss
Cause this ain't a game and it ain't no joke

Ordain I just
Make a wish
It becomes a command
The rhyme family
Is my fans
My territory spans
From New York to Hollywood the whole country's
My neighborhood
I extort fans support
With rhymes that taught
Lessons and caught
The ears of listners
They enlist in the
Hip hop mob on the job
Stop dissin' us
No drugs at all
We don't steal or rob
We just get paid
In the Moe Dee mob
I demand fans family loyalty
Tour support and record royalties
Whenever a band tries to take my fans
I put out a hit understand
I'm The Don
Started out in parks
As a hit man killin'
With the rhymes that sparks a mic
Sparks of light
Turns dark to light
Freeze emcees
And they drop the mic
Hit the deck
You know what this is
Don't nobody move
And I mean biz
One dumb hero
Tried to step
I pulled out my mic
And rhymed him to death
Other emcees wouldn't
Put me on
So I took over
Now they're gone
I made the connections
Got paid protection
Fees from emcees
And no late collections
I take no shorts
Up front on the double
You ain't got it
You got trouble
I'll put out my mic
And a rhyme to bust
Huh
Another one bites the dust
With the ladies
I ain't just a Don
In fact I'm more
Like a Don Juan
Pull ladies
In bunches
Break my heart
I roll with the punches
Write 'em off like a tax
No respect
You ain't down
Next
Cause I'm like
A hard-core Casanova
Cross me once
Girlfriend you're over
Outta here quick as
A jet no sweat
There's no limit
To the girls I get
No time for games
Make no mistakes
Dis me you're done
That's the brakes
One conversation
Gets my point across
You don't like me
It's your loss
Spread the news
I get rave reviews
I'll make you
An offer you can't refuse
The Don
Takes control of the action
Without question
And who's askin'
A takeover
Now in effect
A world tour
To make my connect
The R&B radio
Family supports me
Put a hit on
On Top 40
The video familie's
B.E.T
Put a hit on
MTV
Store reports
And the Billboard charts
Work hand in hand
With the local jocks
As hit men for hire
Personal hit men
Makin' the hits
From the very first shipment
Red and Chuck
And the fans that love me
Mr. Magic and my man
Buggsy
The hottest D.J.'s in every town is down with the Don
A sucker emcee
In a second I'll dis
With a flick of the wrist
He'll kiss my fist
Tip his hat
And bend and bow
How ya like me now
The O.K. Corral
And the Wild Wild West
Is recreated when
Put to the test
Sparks will fly
Like the 4th of July
My name in flames
Will light the sky
Other rappers go down
Tryin' to confront me
You know where to find me
Whenever you want me
But think real hard
Before you step
And remember
I'm a vet
Runnin' the yard
Ever since grade school
Never played fool
But always stayed cool
Before you think about steppin'
I already saw ya
Step off boy

A little slip of the lip and the young'n is whipped
I want to let you know you
Got a lot to learn in this world
Actin' like the Duke of Earl
Sportin' your new stuff as everybody's old stuff
And you callin' that your girl?
Don't be stupid
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Remember when you were broke
And your pockets were no joke
When you asked her to hang out with you back then she laughed so hard she choked
But soon as you got your ride
She's under your arm at your side
She said remember what I said, I didn't like you before
I lied
She already done chucked your face
Now here's a typical case
Of a man whose world evolves around a girl
His brain below his waist
Now you remember how the homeboys did her
She's out for the highest bidder
She didn't want you when you had no money, you dummy
Now you're a 
Don't be stupid
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Then on the other hand
You got the greedy man
The one that makes the women say a man will be a man
'Cause he's got a girl that's loyal
And treats him like he's royal
Simply put, the hand in foot  have got him spoiled
'Cause he still has to mess around
With every other girl in town
And when your girl finds out what you're really about
She's heartbroke and let down
'Cause the love you had you ruined it
She's cryin' and boo-hooin' it
She's too sweet to cheat but she knows you cheat
What's to stop her from doin' it?
Don't be stupid
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Then ya got those saps
With the weak, weak raps
Nothin' to say, they'd rather pay
They just can't crack
You know how much they spend?
On one girlfriend?
So many dollars on so many girls they call him George Washington
You know what you've been given
Your girl and how she's livin'
Sweet though with a dollar bill
Now she can't stop sniffin'
You know how the story goes
And she's your girl who knows
She don't know her damn self
She just follows her nose
Don't be stupid
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!

Little Jon,Kool Moe Dee,1986,"Little Jon is on the streets late night on the ave
Lookin at the pretty girls and the things he'd love to have
Street life heroes don't mean zero, but that's not what he sees
Sidewalk stars and fancy cars makes him week at the knees

He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
Slipped away
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
End today
Hangin out in the midnight hour, comin home late at night
Nothing's in the kitchen but a can of beer, his father wants to fight
He's not ready, he's not ready for this, there's but so much he can take
He wants to get away but he doesn't wanna work, lookin for a easy break

Kids at school are really cruel, they tease him about his clothes
His shoes are worn, his coat is torn, he's hungry and it shows
He can't take it, he says, ""Forget about this, I know what I can do
I'll stand on the corner, make money and I'm gonna live better than all of you""

( *street scene: sirens, shots* )
Years have passed and at long, long last he's really lookin good
But he's not livin comfortable, he's foolin the neighborhood
Competition is jealous, the cops are hot, they all want him to fail
Now his only choice in life is to die or live in jail

( *street scene: sirens, car pulls up* )

Here We Go Again,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Here we go
Come on
Yeah, yeah
The word is out
Kool Moe Dee's in the house again
And here we go again
And word has it, the brother's esoteric knowledge
Is a little too deep for the fans
So he gon' come this time with a simplyfied rhyme
Check it out

Around and around and around we go
People comin to the jam to hear me flow
The live lyricist is here and it's so
I got a funky beat to let you know
Only real brothers wanna hear real rhymes
All the soft suckers want the nickel-and-dime
Candy-coated, sugar-coated bubblegum rap
Long as it's movin on a funky track
My vocabulary's over their head
They can't understand a word I said
So I gotta come with the watered-down sound
With mediocre adjectives, verbs and nouns
Party people in the party only wanna dance
It's hard to rock a party when you're lyrically advanced
I tone down the lyrics, supressed ego
Got a funky rhythm, now watch me go

Here we go
Come On
(Go go go go...)
(Here we go again)
(Yeah y'all come on)
(Here we go again)

Go with the flow? no, no, no
I am the brother that sets tempo
Intelligent, relevant, eloquent speakin
You do the dancin, I'll do the freakin
Some people wanna dance, some people wanna listen
Some people at the party only wanna hear the dissin
My versatile styles, I'm able to adapt
You know I'm talkin shit cause I'm all that
I drop science for the brothers on the street
Intellects get it, and others want the beat
The way they feel I could be erased
All they want is you to pump that bass
Rather than tryin to change the times
They would rather me change my rhymes
A positive brother? yeah, yeah, we know
But they would rather just watch me go


I am a brother, young, gifted and black
There's no need for the profane rap
I'm lyrically potent, very well versed
Some rappers can't rap and try to hide it with a curse
Money in the pocket, gold around the neck
Rings on every finger, boomin system in effect
Tryin to imitate, or better emulate
I can relate, but I rather innovate
Like the creator I love to create
Peace and love, conquerin hate
I got a date with faith
To be known as the great
So all you sissy-soft suckers gainin weight
Become irate, while the ladies girate
Infatuate, lust and mate
Mental state, compensate
If I get too deep, then you won't relate
So now I gotta tone down the sound
Cos I can pick the beat up and turn it around
Turn any jam to a political party
Raise your conscience and rock your body
If you can't relate, just clap your hands
Listen to the rhythm and do your dance
And I'll just party with the alter ego

Teachers tried to teach em, but I got em in the hall
Learnin funky lessons, testin, yes, I am the man
Suckers try to second-guess and question if I can
Flowin knowledge, wisdom, power, don't you understand?
I educate and radiate and motivate fam
Showin younger brothers what it is to be a man
By tearin up the party when the mic is in my hand
This is what you call a winter/spring/summer jam
Fall into the mood as the funky music slams
I know you got the rhythm, cause it runs in the fam
I gotta speak my piece, cause this ain't _Silence Of the Lambs_
I'm here to terrorize, energize, exercise, mesmerize
If some brothers say they beat me, them are lies
Whoever stepped to me and tried to do me got it fast
Homeboy was ancient history, a blast from the past
This is just a blast from the past

I said 'rock-rnock, y'all' and knocked-knocked all
The suckers out the box, as I dropped back-calls
For response they responded, the response was overwhelmin
]From brothers with cool tones, but rookies were yellin
They're sellin records by the millions, I was sellin tapes
Givin parties in the park, and we never made papes
Rhymin from dawn till dust till dawn
6 a.m. and we was just gettin warm
Heatin up and beatin up on some dead wrong
Brother on the mic who thought he had it goin on
Talk on the mic with no poetical style
He was doggin it like he's a pathetical child
To grab a microphone a brother had to have juice
If he couldn't produce, we said he couldn't get loose
Today we would say the brother just couldn't flow
And he would be like history, homeboy would have to go

I said peep-peep, y'all, a total recall
Drop the funky lyrics on ya like free-fall
Watch the 'Funky Drummer', dancin to the drummer's beat
Cuttin up 'Apache' while they're dancin in the street
And 'More Bounce To the Ounce' for the Funkadelic
'Tear the Roof Off the Muthasucker', let the party rip
The funky 'Breaking Bells' took you to the 'Mardi Gras'
A slice of 'Paradise', and it was off to 'Shangri-La'
A cut of 'Space Funk' made you come down to earth
And 'Life On Mars' was the beat that gave birth
Style I possess, the rhythm I test
The message that I stress, the topics I address
The yes to the yes to the y'all I profess
I'm more than a man, but never nothin less
Cause me and the mic is like Osiris and his calf
I'm droppin funky light with the blast from the past

Catch The Moe,Interlude,1994.0,"Just like a deadly venom
I got momentum and I'm
Seeping so deep up in'em
When I flow my flow will send them
To the bathroom, check your denim
Cause I got ya sweating in'em
It'll even change your linen
No need in need pretending
It's like an epidemic
Fear to the highest limit
It might just take forensics
To dicipher how I send this
Frenzy frantic, euphorical
Hyper panic, rhetorical
Wizard, is it historical
How you now, you sent oracles?
Sucker brothers who cover
And smother other's true lovers
A lover of a true brother
But not to dis a new comer, but
You know they just don't have it
They just can't seem to grab it
And those who thought they had it
Now know that they had got it
When you hear me now you know it
This is how your supposed to flow it
Don't try to catch the Moe, it's
Harder than you thought so go get
A couple a hundred thou-
Sand people and sit'em down
Sit back and watch me now
And I'm a show you how


I'm running and coming
Cause I can never run from them
I'm coming at them, I got them
And I'm so cunning Im stunning
I'm never humming and bumming
Get props and taking them from them
You taking it to them, I do them
And while I'm running right through them
I show them how to bo-bow
Another battle, who now
Who wants a flavor, new style
Bring on another cool child
I'll whip'em, flip'em and dip'em
Discipline'em and ship'em
Back to the drawing board
Hit'em just like a home and I get'em
Going, going, and he's gone
I'm flowing, flowing till dawn
I catch the Moe and it's on
The microphone will be torn
You wish you never were born
How could you ever perform
Because the level I'm on
Is higher than any norm
And we are just getting warm
And this is no quiet storm
I got the brain and the braun
I'm like the king, your the pawn
I'll take your queen and so long
I'll mow you down like a lawn
So if your coming, come on
And catch the Moe cause I'm gone
{Rasta Man ad lib]

It's like a fever, catch it
It's heating up, match it
To fire then attach it
To any groove and scratch it
Some funky zooga-zooga
And like a coat of sugar
No Sweet N Low, I took a
Sweet flow and made a hook up
I got the rhythm, baby
I got the style, baby
I gotcha looking crazy
You're feeling wild, take me
Just like a sugar pill
A dose of real deal
Swallow the mega real
Follow the mega feel
And once you got it in ya
You'll feel it rocking in ya
Don't you get dizzy when ya
Try to slow down and then ya

Then watch the Moe go (Flow!)
And as the vibes (Flow!)

No Respect (extended version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"What you want, you ain't gon' get it
What you need, you won't admit it
It really don't matter how hard you try
Cause money can't buy respect
The material mind is enticed by the dollar bill
It makes some brothers fight, and some would even kill
Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think they'll get respect
Bought a big Mercedes, and you got about ten more cars
Now you impress the ladies, and you're a neighborhood star
Gold on your fingers and your neck
But you still get no respect
Your mind is weak, so when you speak
You're obsolete, your mental peak
Is in the street, your mouth's a beak
Big like a bird, and your future's bleak
Now you should seek some help decree
You're sellin crack and livin cheap
Bought a brand-new ride to go beep-beep
Playin music outside loud in your jeep
But you should know, unless you're slow
There comes an end to the sidewalk show
And up the river's where you'll go
Wearin stripes from head to toe
No fancy gold, no fancy car
And the brothers inside don't care who you are
A 7-foot brother doin life
300 pounds, says you're his wife
Walks in your cell and says: ""Fix it up""
Then you look up and say: ""Not the butt""
He says: ""Shut up"" ""But... but"" No 'but'
Now what you gonna do, freaky-deaky or what?
The money was good, the money was fast
No business mind and the money won't last
In the money rate you fell first to last
Now every night you fight for your ass
They say what goes up must come down
All hustlers know that sound
Cause you're here today, gone the next
And you'll find out the hard way: you get no respect

Man, you must be crazy and bugged
Whatcha mean I don't get no respect?
You crazy?
You got to respect me
Cause I was the first millionaire off the streets, boy
Ain't nobody ever had a hustle like mine
In '72, I was killin em, boy

Man, go 'head, go 'head

I'm tellin ya, I was shittin on it
Word up, I was the man
And a car - these niggas ain't got no cars today, man
My car was so pretty, I ride by, niggas' dicks get hard
You dig what I'm sayin?

Ha-ha, man, get outta here, go 'head

Caddy, boy, Grand Daddy Caddy
They used to call me Mackaroni Tony, boy

Aw man, go 'head, shut yo broke ass up, man
Word, I spell it out, I'll yell it out
For those brothers that keep sellin out
Cause local clout is all you're about
A few bullshit bitches and hanging out
And every day's like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
I'd like to know what you're thinkin about
It sure ain't dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before it's too late
Or they'll be doing your make-up down at the coroner's place
And you will have lived just to die
And you'll die with no respect

Yo man, what about hoes, what about hoes?

Hoes?
Shit man, I had mo' bitches than muthafuckin Con-ed got switches, boy
I had hoes, loads of hoes, you know what I'm sayin
Hoes, hoes, you dig?

You're just talkin shit

I had all the money man, I was the man...
Where you goin Sam? Hold up, hold up

Yeah, yeah - well, I'm outta here
I don't wanna hear more of this shit

Wait, before you go - can I get a dollar, man?

Aw, go 'head, you broke ass, I ain't hearin no more of that shit
What happened to all your money, boy?

Aw go 'head, nigga, I thought you said you had all the money...

I got all the money man, that shit ain't happenin to me
You just fucked up man, I know how to hustle

I got respect, you crazy, man
I can go in any liquor store, anywhere, anytime 'the day
And get any bottle or anything for free, that's respect, boy!

Aw go 'head with all that shit

That's respect!

I got the dollar boy, I'm the man nowadays, you understand?
You was killin em in '72, I'm killin em in '87, man
