Ride wit Me,Country Grammar,2000.0,"Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Come on, now

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, tell it
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride with me

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my
Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done
Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon

If you want to go and take a ride with me

I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won’t believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why, why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, ""wishing you was"" niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Chrissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish,"" come on boo, gimme kiss, c'mon

Mmmmm, I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping Bud', getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs and it's
All because accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans fainting while I'm entertaining
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit!)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the 'cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I’m Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic, and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Frown niggas, talking that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana
Chi-Town, K.C., Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas, to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas with ""Country Grammar""

And there you go now throw it on me slow
And everytime I bust a rhyme, baby, ""Gimme Some Mo'""
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind and I'll be
Right back, yeah that's my very next line, I use it
Time after time, when I'm speakin' my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, ""Who that is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?""
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, hey

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

We can gamble to the break of dawn, nigga, money long, nigga
Pass up the skirt to talk to the thong, nigga
Some say I'm wrong, but fuck it I'm grown, nigga
If you ain't 'bout money then best be gone, nigga
I'm flashy (uh), double takes when you walk past me
Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me
I drive fastly, call me Jeff Gord-on in the Black SS with the naviga-tion
See the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on
I got a chick rollin' up, half black and Asi-an
Another one page-in, tellin' me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours, hey

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I

Ayo, I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky
Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin' icky. Let
Go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky
Start frontin' when the shows out, whatchu mean?!
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut, come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut, is you wit me?
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut, then I
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies. If
You compare me to your local grocery, then
You'll see I got more karats than Aldi
More bread than aisle G, then bag and scan me
Sure like Al B., meet the 'tics in Maui, hey

Grillz,Sweatsuit,2005.0,"Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom rosegold

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is... So So Def

Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)

I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball (Yeah)
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success (
That's right
)
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating (What)
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (
C'mon
)
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman 'cause I'm selling everybody grills

Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)

Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold

Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let you see my what)

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced
 and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

(Cause) I need two pairs

Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France; but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats - total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compurr this - my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range
You out of your brains, thinkin I'mma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin bitchin and cryin - suck it up as a loss
Cause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

Willin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn

What I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay
Or some, Internet access some, website chat line
Mad cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line
Ohh if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin askin, ""Yo where the party?""
Ohh lordy - will I continue to act naughty?

Taking nothin for granted blessin e'rything on my life
Trying to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak The Truth
I heat the booth - Nelly actin so uncouth
Top down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin the loot
With my family and friends, and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again if it means I'mma win

Long, long time since I seen you
Yes it has, girl
And I know I said some fucked-up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
(I'm sorry)
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you would believe it
(Would you believe it?)
Hey, girl, cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
(Oh girl) Come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)

(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)
You really like it, (I really, really like it)
(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)
Adore it, (so come let me enjoy it)
(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)
You really like it, (I really, really like it)

Uh uh, uh

Ayo ma, how you doin'? It's your son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of every time I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me?
Knowin' that everything that you said would never fail me
Like they got plans for ya, ain't nothin' I can do
When them laws get they hands on you, but I ain't listenin'
Even payin' attention, I'm just tryna get mine
Takin' advantage, you workin' two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin' about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both your cars, stole money from your drawers
Sold dope out your yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said you don't have to work no more
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause ya son will be there for you
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh

Now verse two, yeah that's for you boo
I send you props 'cause you the only one that stuck through
When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub (E-I!)
On your P's and Q's, on your Q's and P's
You hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin' me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason girl you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me
Livin' at your granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money? My boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to
That's why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you, no

Batter Up,Country Grammar,2001.0,"Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh-who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah, yeah, yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now.. please rise for the singing of our national anthem

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god livin; like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand, baby, what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today?
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
'Cause we's be in the big league

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eatin' Wheaties now
I'm stealin' second and third, lookin' home, gettin' greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles
Hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Well uhh this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah, I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows
Mur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'm a sixteen-year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
Money, money, money, money what's happenin'
I'm comin' up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with, you know how we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues

Maybe not 'cause I got somethin' hot
In the Navigator, waitin' in the parkin' lot
A Bad Boy, on a Ryde Ruff-er than The LOX
I keep 'em both cocked, Nina and Sabrina
Now tell me boys have ya seen her
Have you seen her, nine millimeter
Makin' niggas believers
Hop out the two-seater, in a Vokal wife beater
Levi's fresh from the cleaners
Heavy starch with the cuff
Like fuck it leave it to beaver
Catch me in the Galleria, Plaza of Chesterfield
Rollin' down Hanley Hills, in a black Sedan Deville

Maybe a bopper, I kept it proper
A non-stopper, around the clock-a

In the hole with me Fetty and Leezy gettin' swoll
Grabbin the Optimo, sharpin' up my flow
Practicin' for my shows, that's usually how it goes
We be ready to go, the chronic already rolled
Swingin through O'Fallon Sounds, knockin' out of control
Like a boom boom boom, who is it? It's Jackie Frost
The one who's gettin' where he at and he showed you who was the boss
I'm like a human hot sauce
Thinkin I'll burn your thoughts
Your information was false
I'll show you just what it costs

Call Louie he have you pissy
Mix with hen and crissy
Bumpin Tim and Missy
With Slim that used to diss me
In the 
red Expedition
That's okay though, she can ride just for the day though
Can't even be a house guest like Kato
I'm a dog, I said it woof, woof
Now call me Snoopy
Wouldn't have me in a hooptie
Now you see me in a coupie
In front of utopia, I'm hopin' ya
Come down here chirpin', may I'm toastin' ya
Thanksgiving round these parts yo we roastin' ya
And when the heat come down
Get ghostin' ya (god bless us)

You know who wearin' the crown

Let me lick you up and down
'Til you say stop (no, I never gon' stop, never gon' stop)
Let me play with your body, baby
Make you real hot (make you hot, make you hot, make you hot)
Let me do all the things that a nigga wan' do (that a nigga wan' do)
Tell me why
'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you

You, I know I know what you like
You, shawty, you ain't gotta hide it
Pull that to the side, and let me get inside

Let me lick you up and down
'Til you say stop (no, I never gon' stop, never gon' stop)
Let me play with your body, baby
Make you real hot (make you hot, make you hot, make you hot)
Let me do all the things that a nigga wan' do

Country Ass Nigga,O.E.MO (On Everything Mo),UnKnown,"You know what I found out?
Sometimes no matter what you do, they only look at you one way
At the end of the day

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga

Call me Mr. All That
All that
E'rything you have, I'm all that
Call me wack
You better call back
(Crawl back)
Or fall back before that black mack, bust all that
Old schoolin' that new thing
White V-neck with two chains
Like 2 Chainz, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
This is mine, I'ma spend it
If she's fine, I'll hit it right mayne
You hear that beat, that's Drumma Boy
When I see you, that's trouble, boy
Say the word and I'm in thurr
Name the time, and that when/where
I'ma two piece ya like swimwear

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers

Rubber bands on my cheddar knots
I'm super cool and I'm hella hot
A broad, a menage, I'mma let her eye
While I'm barrelin' out, and I'm yellin' out
Fuck you, bitch, I'm so stupid
I love no ho, ain't no Cupid
King of the south, thought you knew this
I screw her mouth then throw deuces
I'm wit' Nelly and 2 Chainz, and 2 Chainz give two shits
I'm A-Town, I'm West Side, Bankhead, Shawty I'm foolish
Old school car, new chick, don't lose your ho when I ride, fool
These millions don't mean shit, I was the man when I was in high school
All about survival where I come from
Young and dumb, Bible all a nigga run from
Ignorant
Belligerent
Can't wait to get a quarter key and get to gettin' it

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers

I'm a country nigga, and I keep it street
All I smoke is strong
Straight section eight
I got socks on with my house shoes
I got my baby mama name tattooed
I got another bitch with another bitch
Mad cause I fucked up her hairdo (Damn)
Hair weave killa
On a ""wanted"" poster
Dance on a white girl
Call it John Travolta
I'm a country nigga, I fuck her on the sofa
My whip white with the black top like Sammy Sosa
If you ain't got no money
You better have hustle
See when I got some money
All I did was add muscle
Tity 2 Chainz, and the two's never too much
Extension cord is when you put together 2 blunts

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers

Heart of a Champion,Sweat,2004.0,"{*Nelly exercising and breathing hard*}

I guess he's back 'urr derrty, STL derby
I'm like Magic to Kareem, mayne you tell me I ain't Worthy
I ain't speakin 'bout a jersey, I'm speakin 'bout income
DID YOU HEAR THAT ELIZABETH? HERE COME THE BIG ONE!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a General Custer
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Super Bowl with Julius Peppers
I got that can't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they can't stop, won't stop, screamin the name
NELLY! NELLY! Go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'mma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win
Up, or down ten, I'mma fight to the end
{*breathing hard*} Let's go

Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin
I'mma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a..) in me

I'm the first pick, the first round, signing bonus profound
Playin for his hometown, reppin for the home ground
And gettin bucks like Michael Redd, tell 'em again
I gets bucks like Michael Redd, heard what I said?
The MVP of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shootin out from my reign, with Peyton Manning-type aim
Can't stop me from scorin so they resort to just hackin
So there's, three of us now - me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been ravin' about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin or if I'm sittin and readin
Waitin for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a pick, man
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW


It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin
I've been dogfightin, scratchin and clawin on every hike
Tryin to make you remember me like you Remember the Titans
Cause I'm a WARR-IOR, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young, black, and rich
As good as it gets, and givin your point guard fits
He think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh...
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW

Walk Away,M.O.,2013.0,"Somebody said they saw you walkin' up out the salon
Switching up your hair, got your freaky dress on
Said that you were fresh, like you were 'bout to perform
And I’ma fucking mess I had you on my own
Wake up - you was gone, I can’t even blame you
Now you in the arms of a stranger
And now I’m all alone with this anger
You used to feel safe now I’m danger
So when you had to leave without a warning
Such a whirlwind, I want my girlfriend
Got me on ten, I can’t even pretend
You used to love me, but now you ain't here

And I hope you’re happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I no longer want it
I guess, I walk away
(Guess I got you to walk away, yeah)
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanting
All the things that you wanting
But the presence I’m holding
I guess I walk away
(Guess I got you to walk away)

Girl you got me all this stressing and this manic depressing
I’m switching up how I'm feeling and listening to suggestions
Hey your expression is new, thought you knows all up in her IQ
And I could write a book on how to
Ruin a good thing, living without you
Thought I paid for my wrongs ‘cause I ain’t have enough
Told me I’m living, I had to call you bluff
Now I’m calling your phone, but you ain’t picking up
I should have gave you love, I should have gave you trust
And now you moved on, and you’re forgetting us
I’m singing this sad song, but you don’t give a fuck


There’s nothing that hurts more than heartbreak
No one wants to take that fault
You’re thinking about her all day
Nothing else matters at all
And the only thing worse than her living
Is knowing it’s your fault
And now I’m going through hard times",https://genius.com/Nelly-walk-away-lyrics

Hey how you doing mama? I need to know your name
You givin me the eye-eye, I'm givin you the same
It just hit me right now, what we should do today
Go tell your friends bye-bye and let's go hop a plane
It's no mistaken, the attraction's ironic
I wanna make you someone more than just a bone in my closet
I wanna win that, type of relationship
Where you gon' wanna come hang when your man done tripped

Thicky Thick Girl,Country Grammar,2000.0,"See now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick

So basically I'm a joke right?
Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When I use that, shoes untied before you know it, method:
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's gettin' hectic, wreck it just like a hooptie with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles twistin' and pullin'
I'm like shorty help me (come on)
Help me (please) don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile...
So I take advantage
Kisses in gentle places tryin' to get myself established
I'm comfortable, wanna be in that moe with no control
Concentrating on my every lick her every blow
Yep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below
And how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know
IT'S ON, put my penis in accurate, just relax a bit
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-set

You're thicky thicky thicky thick

Now I comes first like the front porch, in a Polo Sport shirt
Skirts, there they are, gots to flirt cause I'm far
From Average Lame with that ""What's your name?"" game
I'm stormin' on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if you can, watch me wrap like Saran
All up in these sheets, now you on me like a tan
Leavin me like a van in reverse, that's the worse
Playa curse put up on me now, we spreadin' on my homies
Like a germ, watch me turn into captain kill a ho
Fill a ho strong watch me last long like a penny broke
Many motels I got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on futons, comin' out like Keyuan
I'm ill like ceramic in a hammock, goddamit
That's my words, ooh's and aah's slurred like a verb
Showin' action like an ass like a metaphor
Now I'm headed for the highways selling me by's sideways

You're thicky thicky thicky thick

I spit mo' shit off into they ears than dialtones and telephones
Just to get their ass back home
Come watch the Bed-rock like Flintstones
But son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa (y'know)
Drive me nuts like Planters, hawkin' a nigga like offalana (swish)
I ban ya from the smoke house, trick, who you think you fuckin with?
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show (grab hold) then I let go
(Flows) split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat, to hit any one of you niggas rattin'
Spit some game and get a bird, come watch us tag team like free bird
Say the word, I be at rest with all my partners
Straight loungin' with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin'
Go make the announcement, spark more Dynamite than ""Good Times""
Want both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs
Take pride in my stabbin', headboards you be grabbin'
Got 'em bangin' the walls so hard the neighbors callin'

Asking you, ""What happened? What's goin' on over there even?
Sounds like you guys are goin' crazy""

Stepped On My J’z,Brass Knuckles,2008.0,"Uhh... (ooooooh)
Uhh, ha ha (uh, uh, listen)
Y'all know what this is! (let's go)

We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall (mall)
Just so we could be the first ones with 'em on (c'mon)
Returned to school by lunchtime like, ""Nigga, what now?""
And today we in the club like, ""Nigga, what now?""
You better look down 'cause uhh, I know you see 'em (say what?)
I know you see 'em (say what?) I know you see 'em
I paid a thousand for the jeans, I paid 200 for the shoes
And uhh, fuck a shirt, I'mma rock these tattoos (and uh)
You see my fitted man,
 
I represent the crib
'Cause even at the crib, I represent the crib
I, might pop my grill in - and I, might let my chain hang
And I, might wrap my wrist dang (go on, derrty, do the damn thang)
I get 'em free (say what) but I pay
And if I want I rock a different year of J's every day (uhh)
A different style, different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's

Uhh, I-I-I got 'em all (got 'em all) but they don't get no run
Like them 13's, 7's, number fo' and the 1's
I like, how they look with Dickies, how do Levi lay on 'em?
If you ain't got 'em when you see me you definitely gon' want 'em
If they knew I gotta get 'em first, old as a copper box
Hook 'em with a shirt, and the matchin' color socks
I think the coldest was the black on black 11's with the red bottom
Or the number 9's, you shoulda seen me when I got 'em
I was in my house (in my house) dancin' in the mirror
Straight thinkin' 'bout gettin out and how I'm 'bout to kill 'em
When you know you got a pair that ain't nobody got (body got)
You can't hold 'em back, homie, you gotta rock (you gotta rock)
I'm a addict, a Jordan fanatic, little Mars Blackmon
I know when they comin'; number, color, everything that's happenin'
You know, a different style, a different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's

I-I-I, I see you lil' daddy you look sexy with them J's on
I pull up in the drop, and step out, with them things on
I got me the black and pink - patent leather with the grey
Matchin' with the skinny jeans - off with the shades
I know you see me (I know you see me) my jeans be never slippin' (slippin')
The paparazzi, I might stop and take a picture in 'em
Yeahhhhh, we be fresh every day
And if you lookin' for me lil' daddy you can find me in the A! A! A! A!

I got the Retro 1's, uhh
(Then I bought the) 2's (and the) 3's (and the) 4's (uhh)
I had to order these, you can't find them in the store (nope)
Called up my stylist like, ""Shorty, send more""
And if you would please send 'em to me out on tour
(Uh-uh, uh-uh) They be here in a minute, man
See, I got that connect where I can damn near get like anythang
Plus all my hoes on 'em, then I'mma stroll on 'em
I call my hook-up at the store like ""Put a hold on 'em""
Them Carolina number 9's matchin' patent leather wristbands
Patent leather number 11's, we call 'em Space Jams
You in my space man, I'mma make you jump man
I'll make you jump, the jump, the jump, jump man
See on my weekends, my J's play a part
I'm rockin' these to the club and these to the park
I'm puttin' these on now and these here tomorrow
A spare off in my car, just in case I catch a scar

Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)

In the pouring rain

And I know (and I know) that I can't (that I can't)
Ever tell you know enough
All I need (all I need) in this life (in this life)
Is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern Lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh yeah I could, baby
Die a happy man, baby
Yeah

Oh baby that red dress
Brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress shawty
Makes it hard to breath
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know (and I know) that I can't (that I can't)
Ever tell you enough
All I need (all I need) in this life (in this life)
Is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern Lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man

I don't need no vacation
No fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape, yeah
And we can stay at home
Listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Drive a sports car up the coast to California
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh yeah I could, baby
I'd die a happy man, baby

I could die, I could die a happy man
I'd die a happy man, baby

Fly Away,Sweatsuit,2005,"Free City
This is a shout out to every young brother ya know
Thats doin his thing right now
Keep ya head up..
He's walkin the yard wishin he had wings
Ya know so he could fly up out that joint
Man

If I could, fly away
Ooo and I wouldn't come back no more
I, I'd turn around
Just to see you for the last time
See, now I know
Hey, that it won't be easy
I done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far
I gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard

Man, it's the longest yard I ever had to get in my life
And see my life ain't right, if my wife don't write
My niggas can't eat if the fish don't bite
My raise the gross sales, like Mike and Ike
Now big brother almighty
I keep a gamma ray, I'mma G-5 G
Take a G-5 jeep, G-5 deep
Too some of their bare feet
And that jeep don't speak
Listen mayne they lock it down round herre
See body bag and gag and your found round herre
This as serious as it sound round herre
The guards guard the ground, 4 pounds round herre
And they ain't playin, they're just lettin you know
That anything they want to happen, make it happen real slow
Get the word from upstairs, put you in that hole
I can't take it, I'm just ready to go

If I could, fly away
Ooo and I wouldn't come back no more
I, I'd turn around
Just to see you for the last time
See, now I know
Hey, that it won't be easy
I done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far
I gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard
Yeah yeah, it's still the longest yard
Uh uh, it's still the longest yard
Um um, it's still the longest yard
I done fought in a battle and I done made it this far (this far)

I'm in my cell 20 hours a day
And doin push-ups ever hour a day
Cause im tryin to keep the cowards away
Thats why im markin off the calendar days
Tryin to get it out of the way
And im just tryin to keep a peace of mind
And im gonna shank a motherfucker with a piece of mine
Cause he tryin to take a piece of mine
So im gon slice his ass a piece at a time
But now that they close the door
Lock me in and cell 30 deep but its built for 10
Tell me what kind of world they got you in
When the barbed wire fences box you in
From now, til they turn off the lights
I'mma read everything in sight
Its kinda hard tryin to read at night
But I'mma change my life
And help another brother take this flight

If I could, fly away
Ooo and I wouldn't come back no more
I, I'd turn around
Just to see you for the last time
See, now I know
Hey, that it won't be easy
I done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far
I gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard
Yeah yeah, it's still the longest yard
Uh uh, it's still the longest yard
Um um, it's still the longest yard
I done fought in a battle and I done made it this far (this far)

(Oohh no) I gotta make it out this place some how
(Oohh no) Man I really believe that I done turned it around
(Oohh no) You see, all I need is that second chance to show
Since incarceration, my obligation of rehabilitation
(Oohh no) They can punch me high, and they can kick me low
(Oohh no) Spit on me its gonna take more than that for them to break my soul, I said
(Oohh no) Man its hard for people to understand what its like to be
Gated, incarcerated, I just can't take it
But I'mma make it man to see better days

If I could, fly away
Ooo and I wouldn't come back no more
I, I'd turn around
Just to see you for the last time
See, now I know
Hey, that it won't be easy
I done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far
I gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard
Yeah yeah, it's still the longest yard
Uh uh, it's still the longest yard

"Greed, Hate, Envy",Country Grammar,2000.0,"Right up in here, is the sweet spot
Stay right up in here, and don't bend under pre'sure
Is that what it is? The cake will do
Uhh, uhh uhh, the cake will do
Tell 'em, fuck the shame, tell 'em
Fuck the game, don't let the game fuck you
Check it out

I opened up shop at 13
Dimes, dubs, quarter sacks and O-Z's
From hand-held, digital to triple-beam
Now my pa-ger's an e-mail flip screen
Expanded my game off into amphetamines
Looked around and had a small Walgreens
Put the word out on the street don’t you fuck with my fiends
Them niggas around the corner then let the thing beam
Now they done let it burn out, phone a ching ching
Just another hustle to add to my schemes
Just another piece of the puzzle to my dreams
'Cause the house, the cars, and the coffee take cream
I might ride the Range with the Rollie on the rocks
Or push a 
candy-colored Cutlass with a matching G Shock
When the spot get hot don't stop, move shop
Find another block restock and take it from the top now

Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels

So you think you're the shit nigga Ya smell me
Shouts out to my nigga Nore
I'll never take another man's glory
Shit don't mix like Shaq and Kobe
Now you know me, I be low key
On these icey Rollie, dudes done showed me
And hoes ignored me, now they blow me
Them niggas that loaned me, now they owe me
Oh me, oh my, I can see tha greed and tha envy in yo eyes
Now call me a lie
While you five stand by I stand by the captain
Ho play now did somebody page Samson
I stay cheefin' higher than a hooker on the weekends
Seven days, a weekend man, I walk in yo church reekin
Aunt Esther called me, “A heathen, old fish-eyed fool”
Bitch had the nerve to repeat it, “Old fish-eyed fool”
 c'mon

Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you

One time out in the Range Rover
(Woop, woop, woop) Aww shit they pulled me over
What the hell y'all fuckin' wit' me fo'?
Speed limit 30 just doin' 34
""Yeah son, where the gun?"" It's at home wit the dope
""Oh you a smart ass, hah?"" Nah, that's my lil joke
""How 'bout I tow yo' truck in?"" Ain't no need to be provoked
Besides everything up in here done been smoked
I ain't got nothin' but tapes and CDs
Pocket full of G's and two tickets across seas
So me and my boo can lay under the palm trees
Ain't no more questions then hand me my ID
You could tell he was pissed
'Cause the black man in the Black Range
Doin' black things with his black change
Doin' the right thing, drivin' his ass insane
And if I wasn't in his face he probably be callin' me names

Nellyville,Nellyville,2002.0,"Welcome to Nellyville, where all newborns get a half-a-mill'
Sons, 
get sedan DeVilles,
 soon as they can reach the wheel
And daughters, get diamonds the size of their age - I'm talkin'
One year get one carat, two years get two carats
Three years get three carats, and so on into marriage
Nobody livin average, everybody jang-a-lang
Nobody livin savage, e'rybody got change
Even the paperboy deliver out the back of a Range
It's not a game, it's a beautiful thang
Imagine blocks and blocks of no cocaine, blocks with no gunplay
Ain't nobody shot, so ain't no news that day
Ain't nobody snitchin, they refuse to say
Every month - we take a vote on what the weather should be
And if we vote it rains - know how wet we want it to be
And if we vote it snow - know how deep we want it to get
But the sun gon' shine 99 percent, in Nellyville

There's no.. way.. I.. I could explaiiiiin..
The way I feel right now
There's no.. way.. I.. I could explaiiiiin..
The way I feel about livin in Nellyville

I got that good at e'ry gas station, pull on up
Give me a half a ounce of that shit, fill it up
We got straws for the bottles, outlaw the cups
And we gon' make it happen, ain't no need for no luck
Ain't no lotteries, no pick 3's or pick 2's
Keep the money in your family, gamble amongst your crew
Cause the dice gon' do what the dice gon' do
And if you take a life, you gon' lose yours too
Ain't no trials, it's automatic, you drop 'em right where it happen
You do unto others if you don't want it don't do the cappin
Think that's cool? 40 acres and a mule
Fuck that! Nellyville - 40 acres and a pool
Six bedrooms, full bath with a jacuzz'
Six-car garage, pavement smooth
Both front and back deck 'nough room to land a jet
And you ain't reached the city, that's just the projects

 Everybody, uh, now everybody say

Well I want to go, please let me go
I need to go - down to Nellyville
I need to see, what I can see
Won't you and me - go to Nellyville
I want to go, so bad
I just want to go and look
Won't you please take me on in
I just know I gotta be there

No unexpectancy, like teenage pregnancy
And physical mental attraction your only ecstasy
Your own destiny, create your own recipe
If you ain't livin accordin to dirty then you stressin me
""And who are you?"" Who me? I'm the mayor
And any problems you got, I live up thurr
""Where's that?"" The house on the hill, welcome mat of fur
When you pass by that thang, be polite and don't sturr


Yeah
There's no.. way.. yeah

Die for You,Suit,2004.0," (Nelly's daughter)
So yo, today your birthday? (Yea.. yeah!)
You sure? (Daddy!)
I don't think today your birthday (Then what you call me for?)
Oh, I don't know, I just called to see what you was doin
You sure.. what, what, what you turn today?
What you turn today, 19? (No, I'm turnin 10, Daddy)
Nah you turnin, what 32, 32, you 32 today (You have been away for a long time)

Don't you know I'll die for you? (die for you)
I'll lay down my life for you
I would, die for, you (die for, you)
 I love you Daddy

I remember 
February 27, 1994
Tryin to make it to the hospital through three inches of snow (hey)
Somethin's goin wrong, I can tell but I don't know
I got this feelin in my gut, this ain't how it's supposed to go
Three pounds, two ounces and two months premature
I tell the incubator, is she gon' make it? They ain't sure
Automatically I place the blame on my health
Hell, I'm her father mayne, I place the blame on myself
Was it somethin that I smoked, did I eat or did I drink it?
Or was it somethin I was doin that I did or did I think it?
Huh, watchin her breathe through her holes in her nose
What's this 
EKG machine
? What's this shit on her toes?
It's 94, I'm 85, so I'm spooked as can be (c'mon!)
I'm prayin and I'm askin, ""Why He do this to me?""
See, I used to hold you in the palm of my hand
And just to see you pull through - shit I knew you'd pull through


March 2-2nd, 1999
The year and the date I got my lil' man
I guess I felt how my father felt and his father felt
And his father musta felt to see hisself
It's like a lil' me in the flesh
He got my blood and my heart in his chest
Needless to say, man I love him to death
Teach him if he disrespect me I'mma love him to death
Left to go out of town right after he was born
I got a record deal, three months later Daddy was gone
It's like I'm tryin to raise him over the phone
He barely know my face when he see it but he know my tone
I'm hopin, I'm like - ""Do he know who his Daddy is?""
I'm real close to sayin fuck the showbiz
But when I hurr him call his Daddy now
And when I hurr him tell his friends, ""I'ma be just like my Daddy now""
Hope he forgive me for the sacrifice
So he can have a better life - than I had",https://genius.com/Nelly-die-for-you-lyrics
My Chick Better,M.O.,2013.0,"Your bitch bad, your bitch bad
Your bitch bad, but my bitch better
I said my bitch better, my bitch better
My bitch better, my bitch better than yours
You even get mad, that's just the way it is

You know she walk like that talk like that, dress like the shit
She 5'5 got brown eyes you damn right she thick
That daytime that night time man anytime she with
That's why that YSL and that Louboutin and that Gucci bag she get
I ride out she ride out, I'm somewhere she flyin' out
Quit me and she wilin' out, I click clack she fired out like (pow pow)
My 45 her 9's out like (pow pow)
Then stop, like timeout
No disrespect to your broad I know she might be your hard
But mine is more like my brain, without her man I'm insane
Got down bitch and a round ass
Shotgun in the ghost while I'm whipping up the coast
Passin  while I'm whipping up the dope
If she run for president I be the first nigga to vote

Your bitch bad, your bitch bad
Your bitch bad, but my bitch better
I said my bitch better, my bitch better
My bitch better, my bitch better than yours
You even get mad, that's just the way it is

I'm talking watch up grades, she get better with time
I write a song about her, probably better my rhymes
Throw down in the kitchen, might need better then moms
Wake me up with some head, ain't no better alarm
Move in by myself, a force when we together
I was sick of these niggas, of course she made me better
I put her in her position others never could be in
Couple racks for her shoes but she never been skiing
Kind you never be seeing, everything European
She look black, white, Spanish, and mixed with Korean
I say she the baddest, cause I don't know no better
I say she the baddest, and I don't know no better

Your bitch bad, your bitch bad
Your bitch bad, but my bitch better
I said my bitch better, my bitch better
My bitch better, my bitch better than yours
You even get mad, that's just the way it is

Uh, pulled up smellin' just like Marley
Spent all that bread on Givenchy
Your bitches more less be basic
My bitch fly private rock fly shit
That 911 she driving in it
Off shore she diving in it
Rolex match Rolex I hit the jeweler go buy some minutes
Lift weights I pound up in it
Hit the walls I climb up in it
Applause need a round up in it
Ever lost I get found up in it
I'm a boss and my lady floss when I take her down in rodeo
You would think they was on pay roll
They don't close the store till I say so
And the car I'm riding is payed for
She know I'm high when I'm going places you know I'm fly
When you step outside niggas know you fine but they know you mine

Your bitch bad, your bitch bad

Hold up, stop ma, let me get a look at'cha
Damn girl, I ain't seen you since prom
Come to think about it, can't believe it's been that long
I heard your man locked down now, how long he gone?
Oh that long? How the hell'd he get time like that
Three strikes with possession - aw he ain't coming back
He left you with two kids and bills all around
Plus you found out he had another chick 'cross town
It's always the darkest, ah-right before the sun rising
And you gotta stay strong, for the kids in they eyes and
And please don't despise, and go against all brothers
And have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
I hate to sound 2Pac-ish lil' mama, but keep ya head up
But you gon' make it, I promise - you keep your head up
And that that don't kill you only makes you stronger
And the will to succeed'll only feed the hunger, f'real

I was at the gas station when a man walked past
With a sign ""will work for food, clothes or cash""
And he asked if he could pump my gas - so I let him
Clean the windshield and throw out the trash - so I let him
Hey, I even asked the brother his name
Where he was from, got kids man and what's they age
He kinda sturred for a second, he kinda looked surprise
That anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said, ""Young brother dem the only wurrds, I done hurrd, in the last yurr
That wasn't low or get the fuck away from hurr""
How could something so simple as general conversation
Mean much more than general conversation? Hey
You could tell life had beaten him down
Like he was in a title fight and this might be his last round
Sometimes the easiest things we take for granted
Until they gone, to realize we even had it, f'real

I used to think that life had a plan for me
Until I realized, life had to be planned by me
See that's the key, I only deal with what I can see
'Cause over history, mystery brought us nutting but misery
Man mo' people done died, in the name of the Lord
Than in any natural disaster, disease or gang war
Before guns there was swords, and they was killing each other
Ain't much changed since the days, we still killing each other
Killing our brothers while another mother cries for help
Man, we need to help a brother find himself
Feed him, life, ah-one-twoooo, three

One and Only,Brass Knuckles,2008.0,"Yo... we cool, right?
Nah I mean, we go back
You know, back before the records
Before you went to college and became this person who you are
Oh, congratulations on that anyway too, so
But, for a long time it's been somethin I need to tell you
Uhh, uhh, uhh - listen

You see we been knowin each other since we were about this high
Same elementary, shared the same bus stop
Even as a youngster I knew you was so fly
Even back then I knew you were the one
I watched you grow, I watched your transformation
Right through school to your current occupation
It took this long for me to man up and have this conversation
But fuck it, here it go

I want you, to want me
Girl I need to know that, I can be your one and only
I need you, to need me
See you were my worst mistake girl, and that's why
It's hard to keep my cool when I see you with him
Cause I really wish that you were right here
Tell me what's it take to win just a - piece of your heart
My only kryptonite is you, that's why anything you say I'll do
So let me stop for a minute, take a second to say
Girl you take my breath away, awayyyy
Girl you take my breath away (awayyyy)
You take my breath away, you take my breath away, yeah

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
They say one man's trash is the next man's treasure
Where one finds pain the next might find pleasure
I don't pay attention to them haters, now or never
I don't give a damn who was before me (me)
All that matters is you're with me now
All I need to know is that you're down
Man it's somethin special about round-the-way ladies
Ride-or-die baby, girl


Yeah, on the real, let me tell you somethin..
Uhh, uhh, it's like I die a little every time I see you with this guy
Thinkin to myself, ""Now why the hell she with that guy""
While she ain't by my side, we would be so fly
We would live that life
The life you used to dream is all about rapp-in
Back when I used to pull my BMX up alongside of your Schwinn
See, and here we are again
Funny how fate brought my Phantom up alongside of your Benz
And still
 w/ ad libs

Yeah so, I mean, like I said
You know we been knowin each other for a long time
You seen me go through, I seen you go through
We here now and, I just thought I'd tell you that
So, you got my number, as you got my e-mail
You know everything
So I guess the next message I get from you
Will let me know what you think about this right here, aight?
Aight, get home safe",https://genius.com/Nelly-one-and-only-lyrics

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin
I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (what?) I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm ""Born to Mack"" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggas like Onyx

I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Wrap Sumden,Country Grammar,2000.0,"Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y

You see Biggie be like, ""What's Beef?""
Me I'm like what's weed?
Weed is actually a medicine for me, you know
Every 4 hours, like a prescription I'm smoking
And I'm thanking my reefer chief for making me choke
I'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love
Then after that roll cool ""J's"" I mean bud
'Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds
I spit residue smoke on my way to buy weed
Wrap Sumden, always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong
My best friend's a bong and my homies is smokers only
I know one day, I'm gone stop
But that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick
But on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget
Shit, I'm still stuck at point ""A"" ya dig
And my momma think that I should quit

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y

Yeah, I get high, you might see me stroll by
In the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye
I'm sick now, I think I'm catching glaucoma
Standing on the corner, looking for weed donors
You know how we do it kid. We get that good herb and swerve
Till the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd
That's my word, Wrap Sumden (Wrap Sumden)
Make a nigga clap something, get all mad and slap something
Yo, grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors
See I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers
Say dutch time, roll up it's clutch time
And I burn mine, don't you ever, ever touch mine
Fire it up, dog, but watch out for 5-0
Eyes low from plenty Henny and hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich
Go platinum and do some shows, and get blowed

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y

All I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo
If I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more
But since I don't some might consider me slow
Don't worry though
I keep the pants sag, bubble eye hands rag
Eyes glassed smoking fill from the hash
Choking after that but don't the blunt pass
""What we doin' today?"" Same shit we did last week
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up
Bag up and make some runs and roll up
5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up
Okay, made a left so continue to roll up
Don't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them
But guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y

For My,Country Grammar,2000.0,"Yo, uh, you didn't see this one comin', did ya?
All the way from the N.O to S.T.L
Nelly-Nel and Lil' Wayne

Now on the scale of one to ten, I been rated, a 12 (right!)
You know this and these cats hate it
I got nothin' outdated, if it is it's upgraded
S-Class with everything voice-activated
Chrome rim three-bladed, factory custom made it
Paid with big faces, if it's broke then replace it
Now it's like that, 
purple haze and cognac
On the beach in L.A. with dime bitches ridin' my back

I represent them street niggas
When they get hot, carry the heat niggas
Them sweet niggas off they feet niggas
You livin' on the edge Fleet nigga
That's why my clique we do or die and roll deep nigga
Ain't nothing sweet nigga, recognize the bloody clothes
Ready to represent the 'Grove with two Calico's
I carry 4's in my side pocket
While yours cockin' nigga mine poppin'
Walk through your house with my iron knockin'

I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face
I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face

I ain't bullshittin', I trick 'em and run up in their kitty
If she ain't a nine or better, my niggas then I'm splittin'
Get a code-red, hop in the Jag and fled
Bumpin' N.O.R.E number six, ""Bitch give me some head""
And for you niggas out there who be jacking the wrist
Got a new group for ya, Nina Ross and the Clips
And from the hip I shoot, if you wanna get loot
'Bout ta tell ya the truth
I'm more focused I'm born in the Lou'

I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face
I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face

I ain't no busta nigga
Came up out that Hollygrove dungeon, nigga
Flame up and toast let it get sparkin' up in here
You don't make it out alive very often up in here
I'ma speak on behalf of the C.M.B. partna
I'm a sweep off ya Ave if its any beef partna
I skeet off a bag of the dilly-D partna
Slip me on a mask hit the Benz wit three choppers
Weezy-Wee partna

Four karats in my earring, five around my knuckle
Six wrap the wrist, check the belt buckle
Leave them wit it look like Nelly I didn't know
If you was the Jackie Frost why didn't you say so
Somebody gotta shine my nigga why not me
Even my dentist told me floss 7 days a week
Freeza burnt out the piece Gucci and hat sweet
Butter soft leather seats for trash talkin' freaks

I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night

But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a juvenile (wha) cause I be about G's
Keep your women wizzy man, they say they have my babies

See the morning ain't up, so repeat
You gotta repeat

Me and five, six girl, body out of this world
Pretty pull strings to a lot of these girls
Take a hit of it, get high with me girl

You’re waving a white flag, I gotta declare war

Fuck what was, let me say what finna be

First day of practice I was thinking about this
Picture on the news, yeah they see about this
Even in the paper they gon' read about this
Cause all of my life
Training day and night
I’m preparing to fight
For everyone I believed in
I was going insane, they were screaming our name
While were spraying champagne
There’s nothing nobody can say

Cause today is the day
Is the day that I have always dreamed of forever
When you call me
You call me the champ of the world
I can raise my hands
I can scream I’m the best in the world
Whole world
All my blood, sweat and grind
Was all for this time

Lap after lap, mile after mile
Push up after push up
Everybody count it out
Everybody up, now we back down
All my pain and sweat was for this moment right now
All from different places well we came with each other
We came together as a team
But we’re leaving as brothers
Standing next to one another while we hold up our colors
I’m gon’ look in to the camera and tell my mama I love her",https://genius.com/Nelly-the-champ-lyrics

To get inside your brain
And give you my last name

Search yours, find out you really worth more
I change your esteem
You was made for a king

It's me and my derrty we just got back home
In the blue grey Bentley with the cellular phone
Callin' up the 'Tics (you know) it's time to get it jumpin'
Smoke comin' out the sunroof to let you know we're comin'
Everybody looking if you're jealous turn around
21 inches keep me further from the ground
I'm gettin good grip from the Dunlop Tires
The F1's bumpin' but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum Basement Beats hits son
Jay-E and Wally got it knocking (you wanna) dirty get some
I heard them haters talkin' but what am I to do?
I'm the man they love to hate the Bill Clinton of the Lou
Picked up some shorties on Skinker towards Wellston
Headed for the Castle lot moscato got me croachin
Bently kinda crowded the whole car was leanin' back
Shandra watchin' TV with two gurlies on their lap (man)
Martin Luther King the set is kind of dead
Made a left on Kingshighway Natural Bridge is just ahead
So fresh and so clean U City representin'
The St Lunatics on that Castle lot set

Show me another clique when more points scored
We walk around with criminals a bunch of big gorillas
My dirty Murphy Lee he's a teenage lady killer
Kyjuan is on my left side dancin' with this freak
The way she clap that ass make my knees get weak
JD is the white guy people think he's funny
Been down long time way before we had the money
But now we collectin' dollars from platinum to white gold
Swervin' in this Bentley and ain't got no place to go
Rollin' past Fairground what's up to the thugs
Shorties in their mini's wanna show a nigga love
But the dope man got em and they butts just drop
Shorties looked depressed cause that thing gon' stop
Headed back toward Union bust a Uie what the hell
Somebody shoutin' Nelly we're damn near out of L's
Baby girl blew me a kiss said ""you're number one""
Then looked over to me and I ain't gon tell you what she done
The closer we get the woozier I feel

Rolling Natural Bridge and we bumped in the store
Mobbing with the 'Tics is the only way to go
Four shorties by McDonald's was looking for a ride
We in the wide body so it's plenty room inside
We put two by the trunk, one on the hood
One on my lap, don't it feel good
Posse's getting deeper, we still looking for freaks
Ain't worried about them tripping cuz three got that heat
Now them shorties getting hungry and Jackie Frost treating
We stopped at Burger King for some royalty eating
But Burger King was closed, the girls started to hassle
Said ""man, go back the other way I want some White Castle""
Now this is the place where the dubs hang out
The new shits is cool but old schools get the clout
Posse's so damn big what the fuck you want to do
I'm getting dirty looks from those other rapper crews
Ali dropped a hundred, I tripped off what he done
Now should I pick it up? No, drop another one
Some nigga started tripping cuz his girl was in my face
I told Big B to chill cuz he ain't worth the case
And I ain't with the smacking and beating up on your girl
If your Pimp Juice is low, then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us (us) I seen him on the bus (bus)
He beating on the window and it damn near about to bust (man)
I got a tight clique, you got a bunch of dudes
Now you're broke cold crying them St. Louis Blues
We rolled off with your girl and now you all upset
She with that Country Grammer boy and them St. Lunatics (uhh)

And just the teach a lesson, I put one in ya shoulder
I told ya, 'Tics live for the street life
Eat right, fuck good, and reefer thru the Pipe
I'm gettin' head all night, and if it's some beef
I pumpin' lead on sight until they deceased
I took ya head off right, I live in the Beast
Nigga, where the feds, play Sheist, I still floss ice
Keep it tight errtime, call me the Black
Liberace when I'm playing mine, that's how I flow
I gotta get mine, partner, any way it go
Whether it be rapping or with the 4-4

Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough

My nigga, I can make a million blind-folded, with no shows
Using no flows, just Arm-n-Hammer and four O's
Gimmie low-do's and a connect, that is never closed
And watch me lock it down from North County to BenRos
Fuck some Mo-Mo's, gimme hundred spokes, all chrome
On the Navigata equipped to click and log on
I leave that, before its gone 'fore they even bring it home
Matter of fact, I'll tell you whats in the back, its all gone
Two holes in the roof, to let the sun come in
Match it leather car seat, in case my son get in
I spare one off in the back in case he brings his friend
PlayStation just in case a nigga think he can win

Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough

I gotta make a million
Gotta get myself a million
Gonna turn that into a billion
If not, then I just won't die

I say now, tho yo wrappers off in the air
But only if the ice on your wrist cause glurrs, I'm gettin'
Stares from dime bitches, is he alone, where's his Mrs
1-2-3-4-5 bottles of Cris's
On the Table, arms the strong rip off the Label
No more shows for free, I'm pay-per-view like Cable
They all screamin' my name, different shades and race
Take them all backstage and let 'em plead they case
Make a million like Jigga, standin' in one place
Sound Scan like Thrilla without changin' my face
They threw a weak plan B says who? (Says Mase)
Then what's plan A 'cause plan B about papes

Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough

I gotta make a million
Gotta get myself a million
Gonna turn that into a billion
If not, then I just won't die

Splurge,Nellyville,2002.0,"You see the magazines and
Me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really dont (You dont even know)
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell
You see the money and
The cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really dont (It really really dont)
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell

I think the time has come, for me to have some fun
I'm bout to peel back the top go on and let in the sun
What the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son
I went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one
I love my fans to death, until my last breath
Thats why when I perform I give until there's nothing left
No competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain
More complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same
Do they want the fame, and all that it can bring
If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes
I'm poppin collars from California to D.C
I'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey
I'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's
I'm flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens
I'm bout to spread my wings, tryin to fulfill my dreams
With anything that I want, if I don't I got the means


You think you know me but you really dont know
Peep I could walk through the club like everything be fo sho
And I'll get, one lil' girl, two lil' girls tryin yo get me to dance
I'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls pullin at my pants, damn
It feels good when errthing is okay
And its a beautiful site when errthing goes your way
And I could park in the mountains and I'll still get valet
Hop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's
I'm feeling good its only right I deserve
To spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge
And any nigga trippin now I leave him right by the curb
And I dont go to sleep mama so good night and good word
I'm on a mission and its sort a like a mystery
And I ain't stopping til' I go down in history
Now who ever said you knows, you dealing with a pimp fo sho
The N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go


You read the magazines, and heard I made a scene
Believe it or not, I swear I'm just a human being
I'm doing human things, cuz only humans change
They label me a role model cuz I appeal to teens
It really ain't that strange, now that I think about it
I came up in the game, changed everything about it
I'm feelin better then ever without that Lotto shit
I wake up early hit Cuda, like lets go by some shit
You dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips
We've got the baddest chicks, we with the whitest kicks
Donating money to family's caught in Bin Laden's shit
They screaming war, I'm like fuck it, go buy a battleship
And bring it up that Mississipi, if you really wanna come than get me
Tell them niggas that a, don't tempt me
Cuz I'll squeeze them shits til' empty
Throw shouts at nigga like frisbee
Who the juice? How the hell you gonna pimp me?

I'm the nigga, same nigga, thought was a lame nigga
Now I push a Range nigga, you know the name nigga
Peep the Iceberg jeans, the ice chain nigga
And if I got beef I let the whole world know it
So if you got beef let the whole world know it
Yaun take it to the streets let the whole world know it
It's the chance for your big career, don't blow it
Or get it blown from the top gun nigga
I ain't finished talkin 'bout it till ya top gone nigga
Dissin my crew you catch hot ones
I'm hot son, yo that's why I carry hot guns. I'm on a
Beach in L.A. fuckin' fly misses while you
Niggas at the crib tryna find misses, yo I'm gettin'
Head from the Mexican dime bitches, them niggas
Mad cause they riches ain't like my riches

Ayo, I'm Murphey Lee the
Schoolboy, the civilized jewel boy
I got not one, two, three, four, five, but six whores
For equality, Vokal, Cammy, and Wallabies
I smoke la like daa-da-dee, it got me boomin' like ba-da-bing
Rap, don't gotta sing cause I get my hum on
Actually I get hummed on, hoes tongues be on my dong dong
Gevity-long, head at night, head in the morn
Lunatic, five strong, king kong's are writin' songs
Cats be gettin' gone thinkin' they got it goin' on
Folks brought you a brawl, it all started in ya home
Check the background, St. Louis clown from the U-Town
Fourteen, pimp of the year like Dru Down
Same crew now, it's too damn quiet but too loud
Hoes be pretendin' always sayin' they too proud
If I ruled the world, I do now
Me and the 'Tics 'bout to rack 'em and move the crowd

Call the cops (why?) I see a robbery in progress
Lunatics about to steal the show
(Where you from?)
From the S-T-L, M-O, 3-1-4
Call the cops (why?) I see a robbery in progress
Lunatics about to steal the show
(Where you from?)
From the S-T-L, M-O, 3-1-4

I rip grass
And smash, with a .44 mag, this nigga jag
From the front to the back I heard it crash, nigga  hurt 'em bad
You heard him laugh, talkin trash 'bout whoopin' my ass
I never let a nigga do that, who that? Get his brains blew back with a new gat
Yellin', ""True that"", hollow tips is goin' clean through that
And I didn't have to get my whole team just to do that
In a blue hat, with a black baggy Karl Kani
An iced out ring just to score on your eye
Hard to die, like Bruce, Lee get a victory
Cats is sick like H-I-V if they feelin' weak
We be , Jackie Frost, 
Danny Terrio,  shows to the Motorola
Money hold up, whippin' the Rover, high roller dog
What you holdin'? I'm paid, so controllin' y'all
Yiggidy yes y'all like Das EFX, I's be next
To rep that Midwest, it's sets and projects

Now once Kyjuan say hit the safe, raise the stakes
'Tics in fifty states, might as well blaze the cake
I got moves to make, transactions to handshakes
Drugs for papes, now I'm sellin' CDs and tapes
Funerals and wakes caused by greed and hate
A snake is still a snake no matter the size or shape
Those that hate, anchored with weights, found in the lake
Come off the chain my main, you tied to the gate
First you caught a case, second you caught the babes
Third, you caught me with your date, that was no mistake
Good things come to those who wait
So if you waitin' on them 'Tics, huh, they gon' be late
In your house with your spouse I'm doin' the nasty
I'm a felon, ask Jay, I rob industries and ashtrays
Branson and hashy, 
And wrap somethin' and burn the place, ya heard me

Watch me load up the ammo, cock it back slow
In the back door, infrared low
Tell me somethin' that I don't already know
Like, which one of these closets contain cash flow
Got three little problems I just thought you should know
Peep, I'm addicted to ""yes"" and I'm allergic to ""no""
I'm obsessed with dough, money makin' and the hoes
Anything other than satisfaction gon' blow
Heard through the grapevine you lookin' for me
Couldn't be, cause if it was you would be bookin' from me
Shook when ya see Nelly rollin' in the GS-3
Hangin out the sunroof like ""bing, bing, bing""
Back the car up, pop the trunk now
Can ya hold ya breath cause I'ma flood this town
That ass scream, ""Nine-second-five right here""
Neighbors on the lawn like, ""Nelly, why right here""

Call the cops (why?) I see a robbery in progress
Lunatics about to steal the show
(Where you from?)
From the S-T-L, M-O, 3-1-4
Call the cops (why?) I see a robbery in progress
Lunatics about to steal the show
(Ayy, where are you guys from again?)
From the S-T-L, M-O, 3-1-4
Call the cops (why?) I see a robbery in progress
Lunatics about to steal the show

On the Grind,Nellyville,2002.0,"Uh, yeah, swing, Nel, my dirty Jacob, yeah, come on

Now if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll
If you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me
Were you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride
Get inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth
Then, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me, were you the one that's on the grind
Check it, was it you that was on the grind dirty

They acting like they really want it with me, trust me
They don't really want it, they just want to be seen
They want to disrupt my team with these publicity schemes
Trying to dismantle my panel with lies, rumours and scandals
But uh, I pull through it like I'm tugging a war
I tell you the situation like I've been here before
I'm still popping dirty, still smoking, point clicking
Watching the doors open, no joking, everything's remoting
No choking or bleeding, this ride is for free, no matter what
You got your dying for free, automatically
I'm focused like thirty five millimetres, all of the sudden
Like such and such wants to meet us, all of the sudden
Like such and such wants to greet us, the same, will you believe us
Now, they're all trying to cheat us, in real life, they can't beat us
Sometimes, they try to repeat us

Now if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll

Why is they stunting like they holding the keys, tell me
Them type of people don't be holding no heat, no
Then how the fuck they gon' be rolling with me, yeah
Dude, how the hell you ain't going to waste your time, wait your time
Your mouth's going to fuck around and going to waste your time, hey
I told them niggas' that ain't going to grind
When its peso time, come out and take your shine dirty
I'm the same nigga that's out of control, out of control
I put a little malinger out on the roll, hey, the bigger it just got
The calico, I been cocking and loading, I been popping them fours, yeah
Set that aside cause I've got to get those, got to get those
The finest shit than what you're proud of me for, tell me

Smoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now, you tell them
Watch me now, I'm spiffy now
Smoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now

Well, if I said it, I've done it, if I've done it, I did it
And if I, and if I want it, if I don't put it against it
The way that I should spend it to get just how I should
All money ain't good money but no money ain't good
I took the hood tactics and plot with musical talents
Trying to create a balance in between Minnesota and Dallas
Never matters when I'm speaking, if you're peeping, just let me know
I'm guaranteed to keep it cracking, just like eggs hitting the floor
I'm dotting, just want to be, I ask, clipping the wings
I want to fly ass, only Q and D Miles can look down on me
Maybe, I should bee bee in my head, I put it down, homie

Now if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll
If you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door

Uh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh

I went through, 8 different schools in, 12 different years
That's 30 different teachers, over ten thousand different peers
And I done fought in e'ryone, been suspended e'rytime
Besides a few a felony, done committed e'ry crime
But never braggin on, just want you to see me what I done done
I'm never proud of it, so I don't have to go back there again
And uhh, I used to go like house to house (man)
Sleepin on couch to couch (you know)
Walk around stickin out my hands, lookin for a handout
Only thing I handed out was more bills
Only thing pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills
Either that or go beat the block
Ain't no way you can beat the cops
Ain't no way I can beat the clock
Just a matter of time shut down your shop
Ohh, you stay up day and nights, livin this way of life
I was Young and Restless
All My Children came and then I had a Guiding Light (hey)
No more of that sittin mayne (c'mon) sittin and waitin
And thinkin somebody comin to take me up off them streets
But now I know..

Nobody told me that the road would be easy, yeah
I don't believe, I've made it this far
My whole life, man I've been workin so hard and I know
Nobody told me that the road would be easy (Whoaaaaaa, that the road)
I can't believe, I've made it this far (Whoo, yeahhh)
My whole life, man I've been workin so hard and I know

I can tell you right now, I'm sayin
I could sit here and count on one hand
How many people seen me graduate
I know a few that did but a bunch that ain't (hey)
Same folks showin up in swarms, waitin for me to go on
Wantin to see Ali perform, wasn't so po' before
I became this household name
I was playin them Little League games
Nobody curred if I go 0-for-3
Nobody out hurr rootin for me but my Momma
Supported me in e'rything, ""Why she get e'rything?""
Some people got the nerve to ask
Y'all can kiss my ass, and that's my Momma
Got a sister that need my help (hey) and I gave peace all with wealth
Give anything that I have, just to see her in perfect health
Now we out hurr complainin, ""I got work to do"" (ohh)
How bad you think you got it, somebody else got it worse than you (hey)
I done had them down and ups and, don't plan on comin back down (no)
Don't plan on leavin hurr no time soon, but I got too comfortable now
Wouldn't have no knowledge of wealth, without no knowledge of self
And I'ma keep walkin this road - my mind, body and soul
I know {*echoes*}


I didn't knowwwww
There'd be troubles along the way (I didn't know there'd be troubles)
Nobody told me nothin (nobody told me nothin)

Utha Side,Country Grammar,2000.0,"Uh, uh-uh uh
Yeah, uhh, yo
You wanna come go with me?
My nigga, that ain't no problem
My nigga, c'mon

I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

I said inhale, exhale
I heard your clientele is doin' well
I see you boomin' out the S-T-L
Pushin' a five hundred S-L
I heard you even got a child now (look at that)
A baby momma and a bow-wow
My nigga know you need to calm down
F-for County run up in your house
But you don't wanna hear that though, it's too late
Now the feds knocking at your door, you took the bait
They got taps on your mobile phone
They do surveillance all around your home
Now ya pawnin' everything ya own
Calling on your partners for a loan
No more slip and sliding on the chrome
Now your good days have come and gone
I tried to tell you

I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

Now baby girl, what's your name?
And tell me what's your claim to fame
Oh, I can tell you do your thing
Just by checking out your diamond ring
I see you at the mall every day
Buying Chanelle, Fendi, Donna K'
Plus I heard they took your job away
Ya got ya kids' shit on layaway
You got a 4-5 Infinity (you livin' large)
Like your last name was Kennedy (or El DeBarge)
Oh, I just can't believe
That you made that money righteously
The kids asking what they mommy do
And why she lock us in the bedroom
I think mommy getting paid to screw
'Cause every night it's a different dude
I tried to tell

I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

Little man how old are you (you can tell me)
And what you doin' skippin' school?
I see you running with your lil' crew
Out here fightin' over red and blue
So now you wanna claim gangs
Even heard you bought a thumper mayne, and that ain't it
You started out with chronic on the brain
Now you're smokin' on amphetamines
I ain't tryin' to sell your dreams, just trying to show you
That's it's other ways to getting cream (Take it from me)
Just go to school and make somethin' of
Your young life and watch it blow up
And you ain't gotta stop bein' cool, and you ain't even gotta
Stop flossin' fancy jewels (and fast cars)
Just keep it real with your game son
And don't forget where you came from
I'm tryin' to tell ya

I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell

Real smooth, yeah
Here we go again

They said a country boy, came through and then - changed the game
If you what you got ain't hot then - check your flame
If what you spittin ain't hittin then - check your aim
Your record sales start to slip and then - Nelly to blame
Now who you know come through first time on the scene
No set-ups, no guest appearances in between
Fire like a nigga drinkin gasoline
I keep it hot, like my dirty down in New Orleans
The Rams won the Superbowl, bought myself a ring
Whether you sparkle or you bling, don't matter same thing
Thug drinkin mo', but Don the King
I'm gettin pissy, with Tissy, Missy and Irene
Real close friends that like to try things
Me and my dirties we like to buy things
Fuck around and give me a license to fly things
Look up in the sky and have a Nelly sighting, like

Skurrrrt, oh! (Gon' break it down)
Oh Nelly! (Gon' change that game around)
And I bet (y'all really gon' hate him now)
Why don't you come ride with me?  Oooh-wee!

First name Nelly, last name Nel
First letter C, last letter L
Six hundred fly by, what the hell?
V-12 full detail, sittin on Sprewell's
Who in?  Can't tell, too much tint
But why the radio so loud?  Too much spent
Never be a Bush man, too Bill Clint'
Both country boys, and if the head right, E.I
Head for my residency, lovin my presidency
I do it like you never did see
Shady to them niggas that's shadin me
Givin back to the ones that gave to me
Bought a Caddy for the man that created me (who?)
My daddy, call him Big Nelly (ooh!)
Pimp juice flowin through that bloodline cuz
Huh, see what it does?  Yeah, you feel the buzz, like


One mo' time!  N, E, dash L-L-Y
If you didn't like me then, gon' hate me now

With the, suction doors, two bad-ass whores
Holla at Yo, cause I need that custom made
Waves
, fresh fade, 
brand new Band-Aid
Skurrrt, them boys ain't playin around
Unless it's her watch according to her face, hopscotch never
Never tic-tac-toe, there's too many of those
I need a Rocky Dennis face - uhh, know what I mean?
Then I'm good to roll; hey, out of control
New motto - never fuck the same ho!
Tryin to catch Wilt, four more to go
From the bed to the flo', jackrabbit too pro
Knock 'em out, wake baby girl to let her know
Yo - you can't even stay here tonight, f'real, I'm sorry


Y'know, cuz, my security they gon' be knockin on the door in a minute
And, if you ain't out ma it's, it's it's gon' be violence

Who am I you ask me, you know it's 'bout that grammar
From any state, it don't matter, from here to Montana
From white girls named Anna to old ladies named Nanna
They holding up their banners and running with their cameras
Can I get a flick, you're damn right, miss
""Can I take a hit"", ""Here, boo, like this""
Chronic's sticky like gum, I guess that's how it comes
Don't worry 'bout my funds, I play around it in one
When you've seen that Hummer but that was last summer
This year I'm more blunter, more up close and personal
It's just gon' get worse now, from Prada to Vokal
The Tics are too versatile, can't worry 'bout certain sounds
That come out these haters' mouths, I realize they can't help it
Just stay where you're bowing down some more
You can't get these pounds, unless you gon' smoke it now
If not, I suggest you pack your shit up and head out of town


They be like, ""Hold up, hold up, hold up, I know that ain't them, man""
Murp jersey on backwards with old school Tim's
And Kyjuan's got on so many colors just like a pimp
Nelly's chain's so long, got him walking with a limp
Ali is throwing money in the front row
And her body's screaming slow down but where the hell is Slo of course
We be them up, close, live, and in person
Might look like the type that be robbing them purses
But I ain't, I'm the young dude, I be rhyming them verses
Worked hard since ninety-three, that's how I got signed to Universal
Now the girlies take their thongs off
And it be crazy in the club when that Lunatic song go off
I be that 'pull up right beside you, beating bad' type of Tic
I'm a 'hold up traffic to touch her ass' type of Tic
Lunatic, that's what I am, that's what I said I am
I'm trying to be a millionaire, I bet I am, I bet I am

It's them boys' on them Porches in Air Forces reading Sources
My choice is old school's over them Rolls Royce's
Of course, this Tic shit live like EA Sports is
Dribble in the club, I lay up with two draft choices
Hit the center, touch the point guard, she hit the joint hard
Oh, wee, oh Lord, she don't want no more
Cutlass is four door, stash for the four-four
Smokes' one four-four's, what them oh's go for
Three-fifty's one more, three-fifty stick in the floor
Brand new Azure smashes, G's and C's all in my glasses
'Tics fantastic, we get booked more than matches
Imagine me without them two headbands
Them Vokal t-shirts with some eight class pants
Feeling dapper like Dan, yes, fresh like Mannie
Cutlass candies sit down, you know you can't stand me


Band Aids, Braids, Bald Heads, Fades, Locs
Stripey socks, rocks in the watch
Big shorts (shorts), headband to a cross-jersey back Ross (Ross)
That's that mid-west talk, I think your future boss' Batter Up
No, cough, and let you know Caprice Classic's on these hoes
For big shows, tell her, best be on they toes
Five Country Grammar boys in bandanas, platinum, no gold like oh
That's what they say when I pull up on d's in that old Dr J
Old 88, fat laces, this world is rat races
Heading back places but it still seems racist
Got locations so I haul off the wall off if you could fall off
Got a room at the Wada with a saw that'll take the wall off
Hit the mall off with a sag, hockey jersey, do rag
Fitted still, switching two different shoes, starchy with tags

See I'm tired of playing games
With niggas with money names
For real, money you lame
I put your money to shame
This ain't cynical
This ain't subliminal
I'm physical, financial, and mental to be a general
Why, lil mama case you want a (Soldier!)
Not the type be in a tank but in a (Rover!)
Yeah man you at the game ordering refreshments (where you at?)
I'm on the floor watching my investments
Buttoned up some call it grown up look
I like to call it having money that fold up look
That Don Perignon, Cristal cold up look

Never Let ’Em C U Sweat,Country Grammar,2000.0,"Yeah, gangsta
What, that gangsta
Yeah, that gangsta
Lunatics, E.I

I was forced to live in a crazy life
Y'all niggas don't understand what a day be like
Got a son, no, my Pop's didn't raise me right
When Hennedy don't pay me right, no baby wipes
Grip the 3-80 tight Mercedes-like
On a shady night, y'all niggas is ladylike
Roll with niggas that'll watch your arm
Run in your crib pop your mom
Like 'bitch where the stocks and bonds?'
In the studio a thug wanna lock your calm
Tell a nigga I'm like flex I drop the bomb
You come to war with a switchblade, get laid
Nigga I'ma spit the gauge at your rib cage
We thugged out, y'all niggas is bitch made
You pick Jay they North white the shit grade
Your customers mad ready to let the clips spray
Out of a week I stay in a lab for 6 days

I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat

I'm second to none nigga, yo this is lead in my gun
Pull this trigger shit off the window through the head of your son
I've been runnin' like 20 miles, I ain't sweatin' for fun
Yo it's hard to be a team when the second is one
'Cause I follow very, wanna wife like Halle Berry
Yeah I ain't tryna be locked up under consolitary
How you gon' stop a nigga unstoppable?
How you gon' pop a nigga that pop for you?
Hushed out in the drop top, aqua blue
Get the bitch screamin', ""please, please, not my boo""
My revolver shook like I deal with smart crook
You know the name, switch up the game like Garth Brooks
Like ten cars from Tahoe's to Windstars
I been hard through hell better sing God
Diminish, I'm a bulldog, breathing British
You ain't psycho 'cause you're nice, it is all about your image

I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat

What, sitting on the bricks of the river front in Cutlasses
Check the ashtray that hold the blunts, we hustling
I do the push ups and the sit ups nigga, get muscular
Just in case you let your lips slip up, I'm bustin' ya
Never let em see you sweat, yeah, that's my motto
Catch 'em in the club get wrecked with the bottle
The silence all behind his neck, the others follow
Show them you ain't bullshittin' and you ain't hollow
I saw you talkin' to that chick up over there
I heard you ask her why she is on my dick, yeah, yeah
I heard it all before you dig, next thing you tellin' me Nelly
I put that on my fuckin' kid, what you think this is?
I'm the reason they invented the whole navigational system
So niggas can't find them trucks and they women when I'm with 'em
Like I catch 'em in linen and then I flip 'em and run up in 'em
Send her back to him and go to his house and blow him with her

I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat

She said her name was Paradise
That's what she said to me

The finest women that I've ever did seen
And not to mention how she looked in them jeans
She said her name was Paradise
That's what she said to me
She said Paradise
That's what she said it would be
Cause she was
The definition of a ghetto queen
And you should see that apple bottom in jeans

I met her on a Sunday
One day she walkin down the runway
5'5"", so fine
What the fuck I'm 'gon say
And I just sit there patiently
Just wait and observe
Waitin for my perfect chance so I can spit out my words
I think she openly scopin me
Damn I hope she notice me
Hopefully she'd go for me
If so she on the boat wit me
And I'mma take her places she can never imagine
Like waterskiin in Costa Rica
Snowmobilin in Aspen
Does she prefer the cold of winter snow
Or do she like it tropical
Am I dreamin, let me know
You tell me is it possible
That I could be the one to end her search for a man
And she could be my one to end my search for woman
No time to slack now
Act now
Ooh I'm about to crack now
I put my rap down, mack down
Ain't no turnin back now
I got this feelin that she feelin the same
About to end these feelin games
And just ask her her name

She said her name was Paradise

So the next day, on Monday
I'm ridin down the freeway
Hit her on her 2Way
I'm like watchu doin Tuesday
She said that she be free anytime after three
And every second after that'll be reserved for me
I said that's good to know
This ain't no mo'
""I'll be there around four""
Around fo' that fo' do'
Phantom at your front door
We can take it for a ride
Kick it and conversate
Debate or disfate
Diner reservations at eight
And after diner
Champagne
Walks along the beaches
While that
Moonlight
Shines and your features
And I can't create the words
To explain my sudden nerves
The temptation to feel your body
Temptation to kiss the curves
Started one kiss
Two kiss
She all on my neck and I
Gimme that three kiss
Four kiss
I'm all on her neck
Now the, temperatures rise
And them hips and thighs
Got me hipnotized
Man I don't wanna stop

It feels like Paradise
That's what she said to me

I don't know... yo
It's like hate taking over but hold up, what is it over?
Suicide, man that's the devil trying to control us
They told us but we ain't notice the pain was sitting on they shoulders
The world is just too polar, they'd rather live in the solar
System got us hopeless, they focus on foreclosures
Wake up and smell the Folgers
Obama bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9/11 was bogus
Now we right back at him, save the world is our motive

But karma always finds a way
Stay strong (stay strong), hold on (hold on)
And don't let all your dreams fade away

Yeah, life can beat you down
What goes, it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground
It's how fast you get back up, and

Go! Keep going, sometimes it feel like I'm giving my life away
And it gets hard, and harder, the happiness is worth the wait
'Cause all I want is a better day
'Cause all I want is a better way, hey

A lot of mothers they just don't understand (they just don't understand)

Mm, see we can show 'em how to fire but they gotta teach theyself how to reload
'Cause, unemployment's higher than it's ever been
Sometimes it feels like I can't win

I'm stronger now than I was when I came in

Yeah, life can beat you down

Hey, hey
Rolling through the back streets like we got beef
A carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
They animalistic, that's why we call the cops beast
They on the hunt cause they hungry for the dark meat
I'm rapping to my heartbeat, the brain is the bass
The heart is the drum; give the drummer some
Promise of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, I'm trying to live

'Cause all I want is a better way, hey
If you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope (yeah)
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know
Get a grip on something real, and never let it GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Go! Keep going, sometimes it feel like I'm giving my life away

(Uh-huh, what about 'em?)
Well, I don't know if I told you or not but (hmm?)
Lil' shawty I was in the back seat with man, you know uhh (uhh, Naomi)
I ran into her on Rodeo Drive in L.A., and I was like

(She's so fly)
She's outrageous, I met her out in Vegas
She fresh off the pages of a magazine, I said
(She's so fly)
She like eye candy, I can't stop starin'
I'm like goddamn, I got to have you girl, because

Hey, hey, hey
Look at shorty hoppin' out that Maserati
In them Giuseppe Zanotti's and that bangin' ass body
In them low cut Frankie B's with the panties peekin' out 'em
With a booty that big, and her stomach rock solid
On Rodeo Drive, walkin' in her Roberto Cavalli
I should probably walk up to the register and say ""I got it""
Go and pick up what you want, it's nothin' ma, don't worry about it
That bag should be carried by somebody so exotic
And that dress should be worn when there's nothin' else up under
Just in case I run into you I can pull up to your bumper
She politely declined when I offered her my number
Then I asked her what's her name, said she'd rather make me wonder
So I paid and she laughed, carried out her bags outside
And I couldn't get her ass, I tried
As I watch her leave out the store
How one man wanted shorty ass and more, for sure

Shorty harder than Cialis
See my hand, got the money countin' careless
Couldn't find a bigger star than in Dallas
And the Pistons ain't the only one with rings in The Palace
Do your research, tell me your analysis
Take a jet and make you wonder where you land like Alice
Tell me shorty ain't the baddest
Tell me shorty don't deserve to rock the runway in Paris (woo!)
She deserve it all
I don't do the mall, I do it by catalog
La Perla panties and bras, fuck buyin' at the bar
I fuck around and buy this whole club by tomorrow
See, she's so nice
She can get whatever she likes
Don't let the price make you mad
I live a Fabolous life, shorty, 
Throw It in the Bag

What number she dial? That crazy girl wild


I really don't know her, I seen her on MySpace
Looked at her page, all I seen was my face
Her username read, ""Kyjuan fo' life""
With videos and pictures, set up so right
The only bad thing is she writes me all night
Sayin shit like, ""The 'Tics is so tight""
She ends with I love you, that starts the big fight
Baby, I can't control what she types

Oh! You can search in the gutter down low
You can even wait 'til the mountain comes down
And if you wanna wait 'til the river runs dry
But you'll never find another one
You can search around the whole damn globe
Search from in the North, to the East, Westside
I bet your bottom dime
No matter what you do, you'll never find another one

Hey yo this chronic got me to', I try to shake it and break it
Thinkin it won't go, I went to see the doctor
X-rays it won't show, I even wrapped myself up in blankets
Just like a cold cause I'm so sick-wid-it
It just happened on a song, I feel it in my eyes
My urrs and in my nose, my fingers and my toes
Translated into flows, man rap gon' need a facelift
I'm just so hungry I can taste it
Imagine me up in the sto', somewhere behind the counter
Pushin buttons on the drawer, like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Chk-chicka, here you go, please come another day
I waited a lot of winter days and summer nights to 
rock the mic
City locked down
, right before me and the other 'Tics went down
You fuckin right it went down
Fuckin right I drink Crown, fuckin right we move crowds
It's a Derty E-N-T thang
, want ya pretty sweet thang


I said I like the way you do that right thurr - uh
You just remember why you do that right thurr - uh
I made it tight to be country, they thought country was bummy
Until country start makin money, now they all in Kentucky
Oklahomas and Nashvilles, they givin out record deals
(They eventually had their shot) man they been had skills
But 
leave it up to Moses
, cause he gon' lead us out
I made the world accept on how we speak and how we shout
I started that whassup dirty, that dirty how ya doin
I let the dirty go up and now niggas runnin through it
Huh, that's why I did it - mayne, just don't forget it - mayne
The whole world know I killed it but I still get acquited - mayne
I'm a thoroughbred, with some thorough bread
I got a thorough chick waitin with some thorough head
I'mma pro model, I'm fitted for the new era ranks
I should move to Bel-Air the way I fill up banks


I take a pair of black nines and I'm - the man
I said a pair of black nines make 'em - jump man
I push your wig from the back to the - front man
Just cause I'm peaceful don't mistake me for no - punk man
Shit I'mma come clean, I should sleep on the triple beam
I'm too damn dope nigga to hang around fiends
Plus a team, playa, I never play the team
Cause even if I win, we all gettin rings
We all gon' bling whether I rap or sing
Matter of fact, I should hit a note now just for the hell of it
Ohhhhhhh-e-ohh, HOE, ohhhhhhh-oh, oh

Cut the check for some L.A. meals

Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants

You out of your brains, thinkin' I'ma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin' it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin', bitchin' and cryin', suck it up as a loss

Willin' to get in the driver's seat and willin' to turn
And not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say

Oh, if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now

Can't leave out the store, now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin' askin', ""Yo, where the party?""
Oh Lordy, I'd like to continue to act naughty
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin' fo' sho'

Taking nothin' for granted, blessin' everything on my life

Top down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin' the loot

Lil drink, tight heels when I pick her up
Me and Gotti keep it real, Shawty pink as fuck
But she still from the hood so she ratchet as fuck

Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector, so feel me when I bring it

Met some niggas from the - Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay
Met some girls from the - Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay
Lot of folks in the - Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay
And they all go - dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get - dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum

Ohh!

Uh, uh, uh
Aiyyo I represent that Derrty E-N-T all the way
But I'mma rip this shit up like I'm straight from the Bay
But no it ain't the Spiggity 1 from back in the day
It's the diggity-diggity Derrty one, they call him Nelly
Leanin' on his Cutlass with his cellular phone
You could tell that the St. Lou' was his home
More mail than the rest of them rappers
Cause they did more stompin than the cappers
And that's why Ice clique was it
First name St., last name 'Tics
Half-brothers and they name Murph' and Ky'
Slo had a mask, City and Ali
Old school rep, color cranberry
Up in the abyss with homie E-40
Orange juice, mix it with the Tang-and-a-ray
Hey, what can I say? (huh?)
I was out in the..


Who you think this is?
This ain't Short, this St. Louis
+Born to Mack+, ma that's my biz
Life's +Too Short+, baby catch my drift
I was told not long ago
""Nelly, don't stop that rap
If you do it well enough
She just might bring it back""
Then I yelled out BIATCH! I go on and on
Baby girl skills on the level of porn
A freaky tail that I met out on tour
Mama was bad like Lena Horne
$hort then said I got a dirty mouth
Sometimes that might be true
But I'm the CEO of Derrty mayne
So, I ain't trippin off you
I'm just out in the..


Rock a green fitted, with a yellow A
Yeah I'm from the Lou', but today I'm reppin Bay
Bring the yellow tape, he ain't gettin far
Mirror in my pocket so I practice lookin hard
And you don't wanna be around when them boys pullin out them thangs
All my niggas is pimps, man they all carryin canes
I met this girl up in the club, she told me call her Wassie
Red bone thick, with a bangin-ass body
Now is I, now is I, should I save her?
Think about it, no way, UGHH!
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
What's his crew name? Derrty E-N-T mayne!
I just wanna know (know) tell me when to go (go)
Price is on the Cavi', but I can get it low
Pocket full of fatty and sippin that hurricane
So just sprinkle me mayne

Whattup ma, the name H doe, I'm into pesos
V.I.P. and champagne by the caseloads
Doubles get you from that bar, and get you right
Or get you bent, whatever you like
I'm not into wifin' - no sir
I just wanna beat it up, hear the kitty-cat purr
The whip or the tail, whichever you prefer
The crib off limits, got wifey durr
Got a man home beast, then be easy ma
She don't know how to creep, I be teachin' ma
I got jars of that haze, yeah I'll show you how to twist
Get it tight but not too tight, it's all in the lick
I'll show you which end to burn, how to spot that trick
All you need is the will to learn
.. and some good trees to burn
Relax, you'll be straight like a perm, word

I need a man, who's up on his game
And can give me some affection, satisfy me many ways
Are you the one to do it for me playa?
(Are you the one to do it for me playa?)
Then maybe I can hook up witcha later

Babe girl you now rockin' with strength
Infamous Thugs it's nuttin' to slug
Anyone, they try to ruin our fun
I don't wanna scare you away, I'm sayin' whassup
Tell your friends come over here, and party with us
If y'all from the hood, y'all gon' love our ways
Cause we got money, and we still the same way
Go 'head, do that dance, and you can feel free
To be you and just do you, everything's great
Yeah tonight we gon' have a little too much to drink
Just leave your car in the lot, so you can feel safe
We gon' party 'til six then take it to my place
Then later on I'll have a car bring you back safe
I ain't into games, I'll give it to you straight
We can have a part time love, I just want it straight
Really though, I changed dough, not no dames
So however you wanna call it, it's okay

I need a man, who's up on his game
And can give me some affection, satisfy me many ways
Are you the one to do it for me playa?
(Are you the one to do it for me playa?)
Then maybe I can hook up witcha later

Uhh, uhh, aiy
Check it, check it, check it
Baby girl right here is where you need to be
You better duck 'cause the bottles pop easily
Go and get your other friends, 'cause you comin' with me
Derrty E-N-T with the M-O-B
See, no respect for the Country Grammar
So I kick the Dunn language, the response was better
We like, 'Dunn' did it, 'Dunn' hit it, 'Dunn' split it
Everything hon wanted, Dunn was with it
She like to see me doo-rag'd and me ball-cap'd
She like to see me tailored, Gator'd, slacked
In fact, I see you lookin' through the windshield wipers
As the rain hit the windows on the blue Dodge Viper
The sniper, not never but hit ya from long range
Check it, got haters like X had Brother Baines
Used to have quarter thangs but now I got quarter dames
Got a quarter of a new vehicle and quarter chains

I ain't even tryin' to lock you in
There's no need for us to pretend
I'd rather spend yo' dividends
You and me can be lover friends
I'd rather keep this between us two
Let me know when you wanna begin
And let me tell you what I want from you

I need a man, who's up on his game
And can give me some affection, satisfy me many ways

I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious
Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience
Lookin' for the right time to shoot my steam
Lookin' for the right time to flash them keys
Then, um, I'm leavin' please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check in, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, rooftop, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve, no teasin'
I need you to get up, up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose, and I feel like touchin' you
And can't nobody stop the juice, so baby, tell me, what's the use?

I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Oh, it's gettin' hot in here (So hot!)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out!)
Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sportscars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, I do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank-top on at this point
You're with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets, can't leave Cancun
So take it off like you're home alone
You know, dancin' in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, girl, I think my ass gettin' big
It's gettin' hot in here (So hot!)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in sasoons

All my soldiers and generals, errbody fall in
Stop stallin, pick up the phone and call in
Tell your boss you ain't gon make it to work in the mornin
And while you explainin go head and throw a cough in
And kindly explain that this won't happen often

I rage that niggas think that derrty don't need a cage
I should be put on display, for the display I'm displayin
Half you niggas is dyin and all the rest are decayin
I'm doin tracks in hotels steady rockin girls bells
Kinda like a young L residin in Nellyville

Clap at g's, smack 'em back on they knees
Drop on wack, simple facts that rap needs
And its always Christ-a-mas and wrap trees
And I got my game, I said I got my game from the OG's
Smokin reefer, moonshine pumpin OD's
Bought a old plain chain, yeah you know me
Shipped in from Cali got it home, cops'll know these
Yo we smashed the summer
We oughta recoup, call NASA to do the numbers
All the friendship on the vocals started fire in the booth
Got more whips and chains than amastad and russe

Ali I'm sicka ballin, unnecessary phone callin
Man down, pimp in distress I think I'm fallin
For anything but the okey doke
I'm old school like her and bones and nooky ropes
I can't stand no groupie folks
They want me to turn around like this is hokey poke
They wanna bring me down like Irv before I choked
I'm not a joke at all, I'm Quick-Draw-McGraw
And number 20 on the Lakers couldn't hold me yall
I'm climbin over yall, I'm still scorin
85 percenta yall awake but still snorin
Got knowledge of self and now my style is much older now
We Derrty Ent., We all we got we hold it down
I'm feelin cooler than cool, my wrist cold and wild
If theres a fashion king then I deserve the crown
I'm U-City, you dressin up I'm dressin down
And you keep messin up, me and your girl gon be messin
Around

Yo it be I man, fuckin it up for errbody
I can't lie man, they thought I was just gettin started
Peep the pie man, its the american dream
I'm just participatin, my participation is game

Ayo I'm fresh out the gate
From the Lou with a Grammy in my resi'
Nelly bought me a presi' with a diamond in the besi'
Tics taught me how to walk so when I run I be ready
Female fans sayin that I'm they baby daddy
Whoa more attention than Justin and Janet
How I Midwest Swang and how I St. Louis Ram it
Derrty Ent. damnit, got more bread than a samich
And my wrist got more nuggets than Carmelo and Camby
Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the Arch
So tourists look for me like an important part shoot
Find your talent, use your talent get your money
Or don't find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy
But that ain't on me cuz we built it from scratch
My neck shit is a house witha house in the back
Man I been wild since middle school, I was that little dude
That been around more waist lines than hula hoops",https://genius.com/Nelly-american-dream-lyrics
Stick Out Ya Wrist,Nellyville,2002.0,"Uh, uh-oh, uh, uh uh uh, hey, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, come on

Hey mister, stick out your wrist, how many's in this
Stick out your chest, are those baguettes
I need to see how deep them pockets get
Let me see if all that shit you're talking's really legit

Fifteen miles an hour, maybe so
You can make it straight from your seat to your front door
You can get a glimpse of the one that they call more
Mister 'Low-Pro', fans peeping like there he goes
Two lane now, put your bite on me
Y'all done waited too long, I got a tax ID
Right ID, proper registration, never thought I'd see
Full coverage on my feet
Hold up, slow it down and let me think about it
Froze up everything that you can see around me
My neck, wrist, arm, the whole nine
I done took you best shot, now dirty you hold mine
Got cats going to jail trying to do what I do
I got cats going through hell when the thing comes through
Two-oh-two, light grey blue
Stitched in the carpet, you know who

Hey mister, stick out your wrist, how many's in this
Stick out your chest, 
are those baguettes
I need to see how deep them pockets get
Let me see if all that shit you're talking's really legit

Okay, now, let me see you do it, baby
Don't be afraid, go now
Don't be ashamed of how you do it baby
Just go ahead and make your mama proud

Jack Frost, fuck it, what it cost
Who the boss, flossing is apple sauce
Dirty third grade, bought milk on Thursday
Now, I buy Escalades' on birthdays
Lex. and Mercedes on d's
Ease off these n-u-t's
I cough and sneeze for frost bit sleeves
It's not just me but really, my family
You want the run down, keep it popping 'til sun's down
Dirty, come now, I'm a show you who run the town
Your baby daddy is most hated, can't listen to my song
When he's at home, irritated when the video's on
I'm makinh ones with them niggers', see my ass in the club
Puffing the bud and spending a hundred for every dub
What he's got in his hand, I'm at it again
But I really can't stand a lunatic plan, work it

Hey mister, stick out your wrist, how many's in this
Stick out your chest, are those baguettes
I need to see how deep them pockets get
Let me see if all that shit you're talking's really legit

Okay, now, let me see you do it, baby
Don't be afraid, go now
Don't be ashamed of how you do it baby
Just go ahead and make your mama proud

You can call me what you want but call me a come up
Before you run up, make sure your funds up, why
I'm going to buy some shit out of here you ain't never seen
But probably wrist bands, more denim starched jeans
Diablo boots with the posher string
I'll take a Cream Team shirt with the Bentley sleeves
Four-door swoosh, made by Nike
Drop-top jump suit by Mike E
Got to like my player, I'm in it for the dough
I'm in it for show, matter fact, I'm in it to blow
When I wake up in the morning, I'll be in it some more
Guaranteed anytime, dial three-one-four
Do any S Cargo, got a S car to go
Zero to sixty, dirty, in four-point-oh
Second-ranking niggers' every where that I go
I got the same, got to have it, got to have it for show

Spida Man,Sweat,2004.0,"That motherfucker was horrific
Yes it was, yes it was
Okay, I was

Sittin on my hill, countin my dough
Million-two, million-three, million-four
Five million, six million, seven million more
Then I heard a knock knock, who's there?
It's yo' friendly neighborhood cat
Leaning in that Modena Spider, man
So beware, come take a look up in the sky
You can't lie, I know you feel it when it

I used to live in cellars, I used to coc' a sellah
Two hundred million fella, call me a fo'tune tella
Tryin to get over Eazy, like they was Jerry Heller
I never want to jail-ah, cause I'm too slick a fella
Seen me on wheels befo', man you should see me now
It might be hard though, because I sit too high
I sit up on the hill, but I'm still down to earth
I'm like the Rams man I'm at the best when on my turf
You watch your girl flirt, you watch your girl tease
You think your girl want cheese? Then check your girl knees
You need to check her needs, befo' I check 'em for ya
Cause once I check her needs, she won't be checkin for ya
You hear a KNOCK KNOCK, who is it that's, payin a visit
She's, goin ballistic while he's, sippin on her Mystic
Whoa, it's the exquisite one named Mo, or short for Moses
I think I'll go back to countin my money now


Say I don't come to the hood, what do the fuck they know?
Who else drivin that Bentley, out there in front of Wohl's
Sittin out in front of Tandy
, I got my phone handy
Give me the numbers I'mma call 'em, you been missin for 'em
I'm buyin bikes for tykes, the V some uniforms
While they just rap about we fo' sho' fo' kids and show 'em
At elementary schools, the day of show and tell
We didn't come to show, mo' like we came to tell
Tell 'em how to keep it strong, on how to keep it tight
To tell they right from wrong, to turn your wrong right
Watch all they words and actions, thoughts companies and habits
Leave them tricks for rabbits, that greed for the savage
And you can make it happen, if you just don't give up
I guarantee that you can be that anything you want
Give 'em that real talk, show 'em that real walk
And maybe one day you can be like me, somewhurr

Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound

Mmmmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin
I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring
It
Sing it loud (what?) I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm ""Born to Mack"" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggas like Onyx

Yo, know what I'm feelin'?
Check it..

Mmmm..
I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
(Since we came down wit mo' sho' than the first time
I thought I'd go trade the Rover in for a six fo' this time)
A lil' mo' sho', listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop.. zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop.. zoop zoop zoop
Mmmm..
I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' doe, listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop.. zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop.. zoop zoop zoop

You can find me, same city, same state
Carryin' more weight, fishin' wit more bait
More license plates than your DMV
Takin' more total request than your MTV
Errry, gaga, they call me Dada
The rookie wanna signin' bonus for that pu nada
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find anotha'
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my steez
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? Yu-kon not fuck wit me
Eight batteries, four pumps where the trunk should be
I hear the conversations, about Nelly he overrated
I'm feelin' like Chris, slightly a little violated

Now what you lease I pay cash for, lit up like the dashboard
Went from the PJ's to livin' out past Ford
What the cash for? me to spend
Like the rims on the Benz while you pretend to got
I fuck twins from the back end
Back to the club and backed in
Went to the back end gotta announce we back in
The place where my crew go, iced out Jesus face and Parasucco
Bread sick I need your Pluto
Black Menudo, in the candy black two-door
BMW Sport, check the Ra Report
What you thought it was a widle? yea, them seats swivel
Cats be killin' me talkin' ballin' and can't dribble
Bits in the Kibble, mnage trois was civil
Crystal y'all, head from all, 18 ta' 80 bar
Hit the mall nigga, and shop 'till we fall
And the bitches y'all be lovin' won't even bother to call

Mmmm..
I'm comin' back down baby
This time in the six fo'
A lil' mo' doe, listen to the switches go
Zoop, zoop.. zoop zoop zoop
Zoop, zoop.. zoop zoop zoop

I'm comin' down down, baby, duck when you see me
When Kyjuan comin' the spray, yo it ain't graffiti
No I don't eat bullets, but I'll feed the needy
Throwup a L, but I won't smoke a L at the city
Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip Ajax suit Vokal
Nights mis-match , hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence Harmen at?
Only got caught once, where my warnin' at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet

(Back in 1993) Was when a school boy decided to be an MC
(See some said no, others said fa' sho)
And now we comin' back down, this time in a six fo'
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(wait 'till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (how does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed
Palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. to 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee

Mmmm..
I'm comin' back down baby

Shake Whatever,M.O.,2013.0,"My license plates be heavy
4-55 in my Chevy
Got a stitch in the seat that read Nelly
Peanut butter inside and out jelly
I push it straight down the block, I made a left at the curb
I had my windows cracked cuz I was smoking some herb
I saw the Shawty I knew so I started to swerve
I pulled right up beside her and I started to serve
I said hold up, Shawty get it
Boy thats soft like the seat that you be sit in
How bout we ride somewhere where I can get it
She aint want it at all but she was with it
Like a 50 amaro she was ready to follow
Like a coke bottle with a walk in the bottle
She was sippin muscato with a skinny malato
The only thing that I did in here was hit her lock

Shawty it could be real
Hell it could be a headshot
I got a couple bills
Tryna put em in yo stash box
Your sexy ass gon get it
Got band in hand, come get it
That pinch is a herb  its my method
Just shake whatever that is behind you

I like em big, I like em small
I like em thin, I like em tall
I like em round, I like em both
But on the real, I like em all

Now I done swoop off your pants, theyre worth were buying the same
Now I did most of the layin like only offer it came
Ali came with demands, I became the man
Then came in the bands, then they came in the Benz
Im like oh, Shawty works it
Put that ass in the air, dont twerk it
Swing around that pole, go and murk it
You see a nigga behind, you know Im lurkin
I like a girl with a bottom, I like a girl on the top
I like a girl when I roll, I like a girl when I rock
I like a girl when I sing, I like a girl when I rap
Cause when Im doin my thing I want that ass to clap

Shawty it could be real
Hell it could be a ass shot
I got a couple bills
Tryna put em in yo stash box
Your sexy ass gon get it
Got band in hand, come get it
That pinch is a herb  its my method
Just shake whatever that is behind you

Ive got what you want but baby
This aint love, could drive you crazy
If you want it go on and say that
Say that, say that",https://genius.com/Nelly-shake-whatever-lyrics

I'm somewhere halfway between there and the bay
I like them broosy bras I like round the way
I take them outta they Js put them in hermays
Might hang out in the club might chill out somewhere safer
Kinkos and Office Max, I love to hang with paper
My crib is plush plush, I'm talking elevator
So don't touch touch don't feed the alligator

This is not a gift it's a souvenir
See maybe I'm that nigga who knows how to ball
I am hes thug will hight the money tall
I'm off his and hers
Bodys straight hips and curves
Friends hanging near trying to tell 'em I don't want your girls

Om du var här hos mig ändå
Ja, då slapp jag sakna dig, whoo
Om du var här hos mig
Du finns i mina tankar
Och i min fantasi
Där är vi två tillsammans
Där är det bara vi
På morgonen när jag vaknar
Kommer saknaden igen
Hoppas du hittar vägen
Och vill vara mer än en vän
När jag sitter här i min ensamhet
Ja, då tänker jag på dig
Om du var här hos mig ändå
Ja, då slapp jag sakna dig, whoo
Om du var här hos mig
I mina drömmar
Där håller du min hand
I min fantasi där är det vi
När jag sitter här i min ensamhet
Ja, då tänker jag på dig
Om du var här hos mig ändå
Ja, då slapp jag sakna dig...
(När jag sitter här i min ensamhet)
(Ja, då tänker jag på dig)
Om du var här hos mig ändå
Ja, då slapp jag sakna dig, whoo
Om du var här hos mig, whoo

Cut it Out,UnKnown,UnKnown,"* originally slated for ""Brass Knuckles""

(P-I) Yeah, ay, whassup c-c-cuz?
It's goin down, Eastside, yeah
Ya boy Sean P, Nelly, Pimp C, ay

My paint too wet bitch, never pay my set bitch
Blue and red make green, just cash the check bitch
Went to the car lot, bought me a Vanquish
Never trick my money in the club with a skank bitch
Big shrimp on my plate, look like dolphins (dolphins)
Pushin cookies in the soft ones
I can do better by myself, not bad (bad)
Girl ate the whole thing if she call me Chad (Chad)
The records ain't sellin up there, they mad (mad)
Rappin like us gotta hit but you a fag
I'm a young country nigga, uncut like snow (snow)
Make them young girls get down on the flo' (flo')
Make them young niggas put candy on the 'Llac
You got clouds in them diamonds, take that monkey shit back
Cause I'm smokin out, throwin up, keep that lean off in my cup
Smokin out, throwin up, keep that heat off in our truck

When I hit the parkin lot, and the fifth wheel drop
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
When I'm fresh from the jeweler and it's sunny outside
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
When I'm creased up, J'd up, E's and my K's up
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
From all them niggas that's trill to them niggas unreal
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me) uh-uh
So quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (look here)
Quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (look here)
Quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (now go 'head)
Now watch my fingers (lil' boy) cut it out (hold up!)

I ain't choose yo' chick, yo' chick chose me
I ain't gotta pick one, I'mma take all these
For every hundred you got, I'mma peel off three
Hey, don't worry 'bout it lil' boy, that bill on me
Eight years now, you can call me a vet
That money you grossin, call that a fourth of my neck
We don't call paint shiny, we call paint wet
A Darryl Strawberry colored Coupe, call that a Met
Got a few rides already, got a few more to cop
Got a blue one that's hard, got a black one that dropped
Got a Buick that's green, the same color my snot
Lil' daddy you ain't the shit, you might as well get off the pot
That's some new St. Louis shit, yeah that's funny
But I'mma stick with the old, the new don't make enough money
So when I'm on (wipe me down) when they dirty (wipe 'em down)
You think I showed my ass befo', sit front row (and watch me now)
Cause my grandmomma hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Said my grandmomma hate it, but my lil' mama love it


28 inches sittin tall, it's ridiculous
With a slum yellow bitch cause that's the type I kick it with
Ride with a stupid pack, and a couple stupid cats
They call us the Goon Squad, so you know we stupid strapped
Shuttin down the parkin lot, we doin the moonwalk
I ain't stuntin ass ho, cause I'm tryin to pillow talk
I be where that work at, where niggas get murked at
Earth is spread, then we mounted up and drop the purp' back
Can't you tell I'm hood rich? You ain't from my hood bitch?
Don't you see the leather seats? The way we grip the wood pimp?
Goin hard on 'em (goin hard on 'em) rocks shined on 'em (rocks shined on 'em)
Sponsored by the hood, this is our grind money
If we pop the bands on 'em (pop a band) throwin grands on 'em (throwin grands)
Nelly grab the wheel and make the Chevy dance on 'em
I'm a block star (block star) ain't a phony nigga (nah never)
A phone call'll have them youngsters all on ya nigga

So don't start no shit, won't be no shit!
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit, boy!",https://genius.com/Nelly-cut-it-out-lyrics

Listen
Wish man this track is blazing
Better yet this track amazing
This track remind me of when the studio was down in this Nick Day's basement
My shit was far from legal
Wrong place in a buick regal
Check under that seat look in that lil box in the trunk sure illegal
Hold up better pump your brakes
You don't wanna make no mistake
Running up on the wrong nigga and the wrong time might get you something hot in your face
And I ain't talking bout no mase
I'm talking that shit that chase
That shit that a run ya down and take Forensic files gonna solve that case
I hear a lot of that I did this
I hear a lot of that I did that
It's funny when he go to the stand and point at his man like ""he did that""
You wanna stand looking so not gangsta
Plead to the judge ""I'm so not gangsta""

See it's best you play your part
You don't try to be who you aren't
Ain't gotta prove anything to me motherfucker I know you ain't got no heart

He just flew the coop and got chickens he wanna move

Leave at seven-forty-five in LA for the summer
I've got the worldwide sale to check the e-mail

Who may not be original but still a don-dada

You go ahead and take your plane and I'm gon' take the chopper
I'm tired of niggers' fronting like they're top gun shotters' (hey)


Not come running over, Jah-Jah shine his light
Blessed is the day, sacred is the night
Wrong wishers beware now that I am here
Hey, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy Lord

Shoot, they thought a Derrty wouldn't make it this far
Now I'm supporting my family, they liking who I are
Schoolboy's a hard worker, they consider him a star
I guess that's why they look at us as if we're from Mars
Singin-a-ling, I deal with bars like weight trainers
Hustling's got me bigger like weight gainers
Always remain a Saint Louis entertainer
My women love me later, how could a hater blame her
Shoot, I'm just that dude that kicks bars for a living
Get rich and trick, collect cars for a living
Houses on hills, with great lakes in the back
Bowling alleys in basements, beds bigger than Shaq's
Damn, look at the leather in that old school 'Llac
They be doo-doo green, I wonder who would do that

Probably know me from touching your booty at school",https://genius.com/Nelly-river-dont-runnn-lyrics

I was hanging out with my partnas but I told that ass to get in
Girl let's go for a spin you know a nigga got ends
She was checking out my checking out my checking out my rims
Hey girl let's hit the hotel make a movie more like the matinee
You know do some things you know well
Thug dashing baby that's alisay
My car was all in your lane
Them thoughts were all in your brain
My hands is all in your hair
But I won't tell your man

You better not let go
Cause you ain't you even you ain't even close
Just wait till I get you out them clothes (out them clothes)

Clear all them dishes do it like we on cable
Cut out both of them phones
Girl you need to be sippin champagne or that 'tron
Then the headboards'll be cripping
V.i.p is b-e-d or the backseat of my ride
Fog up my windows so they can't see from outside
You can call my daddy I'm a call you baby
Girl you can get at me who be fucking you lately

Lemme see if you sweating or lemme see if you hot
Lemme show you why I am and show you why I'm not
Shoot 'em all night long shawty you ain't need to stop
How bout I pick you up and throw you in the middle of the bed
Till you're overwhelmed kiss you from your stamche to your neck
To your back to your thigh to the middle of your wham
Keep going and going till you scream out damn
Yea baby I'm something like a nimpho
A saint louis here with more pimpflow
So so hold on like you're in for
And get lubing show what you're in for
A whole lotta banging a whole lotta lice
Like a heavyweight fight with a '86 mike
Tyson slicing and you only know biting
Biting biting

You better not let go
Cause you ain't you even you ain't even close
Just wait till I get you out them clothes (out them clothes)
I'm a show what your body is for, I wanna know

Now that I'm here I'm gettin' my shine
All of you haters can kiss a behind
Specifically speakin' I'm talkin' bout mine

If I Gave U 1,5.0,2010.0,"Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
It's like no matter what I try to do I just can't make her happy
See every other day it's like she throwin new shit at me
A constant petty complain 'bout every single thang
Hard to swagger maintain, shorty driving me insane
In the beginning I'll admit it, if you said it I was on it
And even if I felt you did me wrong girl I was coping
I guess a nigga was hopin, thinkin 'bout eloping
See I just call it focused, but some might call it open
Yeah, it's like I'm compromising everything I stood fo'
I'm breaking rules that every nigga in the hood know
One, weigh it yourself; two, never play yourself
Three, it don't matter girl
I'll throw 'em out the window 'cause for you

I, I-I'll bend over backwards
I'll, do anything you say
I, I-I'm here for you baby
Don't have to worry 'bout me
A little bit goes a long way
If I gave you one, would you want two?
If I gave you two, would you want three?
Yeah, they say a little bit goes a long way
But if I gave you one, would you want two?
If I gave you two, would you want three more?

Somebody said relationships should be like 50/50
How come I feel I'm giving mine but not receiving any?
Why must you make it so hard to play the part?
I'll put you in the light but yet you leave me in the dark
And every time I think we're moving forward you pull back
And every time I think our train is straight you jump track
""Oh who the fuck was that?"", you always doing that
Let me turn that shit on you and let me see how you react
Oh yeah, it's like I'm compromising everything I stood fo'
I'm breaking rules that every nigga in the hood know
One, weigh it yourself; two, never play yourself
Three, it don't matter girl
I'll threw 'em out the window all for you

I, I-I'll bend over backwards
I'll, do anything you say
I, I-I'm here for you baby
Don't have to worry 'bout me
A little bit goes a long way
If I gave you one, would you want two?
If I gave you two, would you want three?
Yeah, they say a little bit goes a long way
But if I gave you one, would you want two?
If I gave you two, would you want three more?

If I gave an inch, would you want a foot?
If I gave that foot, would you want a yard?
If I gave that yard, would you want a mile?
And if I gave that mile would you walk the town?
I wanna give you everything you want
I wanna be everything you need
I'm right here for you baby girl
Don't have to worry about meeeeeeeeee...

I, I-I'll bend over backwards
I'll, do anything you say
I, I-I'm here for you baby

Chill,Brass Knuckles,2008.0,"Yo, what you tell a motherfucker with two black eyes?
Nothing, you did already tell his punk-ass twice

D, E, R, R, T, Y
We all we got, yo, know I want y'all do?
Yo..
Ey yo stand at attention, raise your right arm, salute
Roll the carpet out, watch all the Bloods ""woo-woo""
Watch the Crips loke it up, we back, we got our focus up
St. Lunatics, nigga know that, know that
Supreme the team, if we lose you open your minds
Start readin some things, we got it, holla at us, come on
Easy with that ""murder, murder, murder, kill, kill""
We did that back when I was born, real, real
But I still do the knowledge, let me give you the math
I rock a 7-and-a-half on my 7-and-a-half
I be with Moses and Kane and Abel putting in work
I slap a nun, beat the reverend up and spit in his church
My Derrty niggas come through, we turn the heat up in June
We at the party macking, even throw our bitch in the room
Menage-a-trois, ?
Cause we the baddest motherfuckers that you seen thus far

(So) Nigga chill (chill) calm down (calm down)
Watch your words (watch your words) don't let your mouth get ahead of you
You really talking wreckless right now (right now)
And we know you ain't built for that (nope)

Look, learn, listen, check it
Start your cars up, trick your broads up
Pump your hard up, homie now put your guard up
You throw that one-two but, look how I jab you
No need you run in the derrty, homie I had to
You was doin a lot of talkin,yup, a lot of barkin
But your bite was nothin, guess you might've been fronting
Yo ain't no mic to it, City see right through it
I was born to be the shit like I was Mike Hewitt
Don't, test me though, homie I might do it
Check my track record, the flow that'll go right to it
It was easy for me, I was born to win
You was born to hate me, you should be born again
You with Mike and Kevin, we with Law and them
You cop American cars, we cop foreign 'em
Take a look at us derrty, we put the star in them
No slow stray bullets nigga, we Brett Favre-ing them

You gots to chill, and let your conscience be free
Lil' boy, obviously y'all ain't fuckin with Ky'
You see I stays real high, but I be as low-key
I'm so allergic to the line errybody know me
You know what? (What?) Why shouldn't y'all hate?
Cause y'all so half decent, we Frosted Flakes great
And these ain't came out yet, I know y'all so late
I smoke zips, you pop 8's, damn what a waste
My lady is so happy, yours masturbates
You wash up in a sink, nigga I bathe in a lake
The way y'all copy our style ASCAP should make y'all pay
But they don't, so I'ma smoke a joint and get to the point
The muhfuckin point is keep my name out your mouth
Unless you saying how we repped the Lou, since we came out
We've been winners since we came out, yo' mouth keep my name out
You don't wanna see thirty cardinal birds with their thangs out


Murphy Lee God-body (like) take shit from nobody (nope)
Nelly bought it for me so that's my Maserati (yup)
Y'all know about me, I'm so far from sloppy (dirty)
You not a female, nigga, so how can you top me?
My style can't be copied people trust me (trust me)
Even though you look like me, your flow musty (musty)
That means you stinkins, what you think's extinct
Been gone too long to even dig up the bones
I'm on my new-new, upgrade the kush from the doo-doo
That's a big step, but that's how niggas from the Lou do
Last rap was too cool, but this one is too damn hot
You wack rappers think you hot when you not (this is why I'm hot)
All this I talk slick shit as if you really did shit
Thinking you deserve my spot, well thurr it is then
Gave niggas time but now I'm back with a few of my friends
Lunatics about to do this again, ohh


Uh, tell you something...
You should see their faces when I walk in the facility
Mean mug, what's the purpose of you ice-grillin me?
You're killin me but really B, you ain't on my radar
Always used the right amount of strokes, that's why I stayed par
I ain't no killer lil' silly nigga but they are
You got the same ride as me but that's just my day car
My decor, might be Levi's and a A-R
15 G's in my pocket just to play cards
So meet me in the casino, way in the back
Me and her fleein the scene, away in the 'llac
She say she feelin her bean, a green double stack
She say she like it obscene, I'm way into that
In fact, you niggas ain't like me, you salty (nah)
Me, I'm like pepper cause I spice shit up
The Flavor Flav of the game cause I hype shit up
Might call my hundred watt niggas in to light shit up
You better chill",https://genius.com/Nelly-chill-lyrics

Hockey players pagin' me to practice on my wrist
20 inch chocko treads so my whip don't slip
Pullin' up bringin' joy like my nigga Baugette
If I go on a rampage then watch my mo' flip
Draw from both hips, emptyin' both clips
Got a whole lotta niggas wanna ride wit' me
Now that a niggas so hot, can strike fire from me
Thinkin' Nelly 'posed to take 'em outta poverty
But when I tell 'em no, they think of robbin' me
Son ain't no stoppin' me, some are home at Iceland
Hang with penguins, like that's my reason (that's my reason)
Like Berkley we'll find the part that's freezin'
Last time you seen Nelly, snowin' in June
You ever had a bicoastal orgy happen off in yo' room
But what happen's in Cancun, stay's in Cancun

Icey neck, icey wrist
Icey cris, I see miss

I live a nice way, I store my jewels in an ice-tray
How you want it, the man or the mice way?
Talk 2 of these karats, call me in tha mornin' have an ice-day
I stay in more leather than Andrew Diceclay
You might say I'm arrogant, just because I ain't sharin' it
If the check ain't seven digits, I'm tearin' it
If the 'Tics can't fit in my whip, then I ain't steerin' it
Bomb that rifle cuz, now a nigga wearin' it
Catch me on my set wit' my iced-out chain
An iced-out rapper wit' my iced-out name
A cold hand shake because of my pinky rang
Iced-out Cordeara's with an iced-out frame
Catch me in an iced-out Range wit' icey dames
Puffin', bling-bling, while she do tha damn thang
I'm spendin' half my changes on clockin' thangs
And I got a icey game like hockey man
(Ali)
I gave knowledge to scientists who brains was locked
They didn't know that Iceland was just my jewelry box
And then the South Pole, that's when I used to slang O's
And moved to keys and bought diamonds outta control
My poppa, Snow Man, momma, Eskimo
So many rats that I need pest control
Would cop from Jacob, but I don't know where he at
So 'till I found that cat I guess I'll roll wit' Zach
And puff sacks in the hydraulic-dancin' cars
Gotta a caulus on my hand for poppin' Branson jaws
Bitches be prancin' hard cuz they know we maintain
With enough ice to freeze rain in a woodgrain Range
Dual exaust playa, I keep some soft
It's da gloss-boss, the floss-frost across the Randy Moss
Until we meet again, y'all keep on servin' 'em out
Nicky Sach, AKA, George Durban, what?
(Chorus-2x)
(Murphy Lee)
Young dude 'bout to do this like a veteran
Long shorts, tall Timberland's
Flossin' in my icey Vokal, Varsity letterman
Icey headband to hold my baby-dreads in
That's what it is, what 'of that a been
Cuz when I get cold I freeze, when I'm hot, I'm water
On ice at all times, hittin' hockey player's daughters
I'm like Ralph and the Honeymooners (Why I oughta!)
Put ice on the S-T-L and my role model for startas
I'm like icey as frozen foods with frost big friends
Who all like 'em thin with icey rear-ends, nine outta ten get hit
Seven outta nine givin' icey head in the icey whip
School boy keep a icey fit for icey mits
Who like icey that and icey this
Smoke a icey spliff gettin' icey licked
By these Pizza Hut delivery chicks who love tips
(City Spud)
Aiyyo, I'm icey when you say Lunatics gon' ride
Love when ya call me to make yo C.D. hot
Met this man sayin', ""How you go from bottom to top?""
Juan B beside me when I do T.V. slots
Now I'm at the bar floatin' from the icey jaw
Know who we are when I pull up in tha icey car
I ice the chain cuz niggas got twice the change
I ice the ring and niggas go to sortin' the game
So if I'm hot, I'm hot, if you not, you not
And if I'm clockin' dough, let me tick and tock
And if love ready to rock, yo I'm hot to trot
Courtney B. ready to rock, I'm hot to trot
Yellow Mack ready to rock, I'm hot to trot
Cougar Love say I'm hot then I'm buyin' a yacht
And a drop to shock these niggas who jock D's
Think he might shock Eve, like the icey watchee
Put these on six e's, if I want it I get it
I do it for publise so honeys'll love this, ugh",https://genius.com/Nelly-icey-lyrics

I ain't even gon' talk no mo'
When you done with the minors ma come to the pros
See I could put you in all them clothes
Your neck, wrist, ears, hands, all that froze
He could never ever put you in a rose
But anything goes when you dealin with the baller
Stand on my money if I wanna be taller
Smack him with a G, I bet he go and get his lawyer
Cause he really wanna sue me
Take the bitch route, cause he know he cannot do me
Know he can't outdo me in the records or the movies
Man, I don't want your girl, plus I heard she got the cooties
(Ah, ah, ahh...)
If you mean what you feel then I mean what I said
(Ah, ah, ahh...)
You don't like cheap sex, I laid a mil' on the bed
Spread it all out and we can roll around in it
Hop off in the whip and we can roll around in it
In the back seat and we can go to town in it
Or maybe on the hood, sound profound, did it?
He ain't get the message ma, act like he ain't get it
He ain't catch a hint when you gave him back his rented
Now his lil' condo one less tenant
And I did it - but you know what?


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Well who you know with ten mil' on a plaque?
Hit the Superbowl once so they brought me on back
Ride around with my Grammy's on the 'Llac
Better bag up nigga, Nelly bonds are the bag
Me be the rapper, Nicky Bonds be the crack
Think I fell off when they fell from the track
You wanna come to Nellyville I'll draw you the map
Follow that yellow brick road
Follow that rainbow of diamonds down to the gold
Follow shorty as she slide down a pole
He tryna make it rain but it's comin down slow
I hope he got the gloves cause I'm about to make it snow
(Ohh, ohh, ohhh...)
Like kids seein Santa when I walked in the club
(Hohh, hohh, hohhh...)
But I only brought presents for the girls
Listen, play with me nigga if you wanna, if you feel
Won't kill at will but will kill Bill
Somebody better grab Bill, tell him to chill
Before somebody find him buried in the hills
(Ah, ah, ahh...)
I got a reach, try on an order myself and such
(Ah, ah, ahh...)
Cause I be feelin myself too much, now listen

The hump back girls with thighs
Where they be built like bricks, praised for bein thick
Or maybe skinny like a stick, but they fine as shit
I stay..

We stay wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy down in da water.. yeah
Off the banks of the muddy Mississippi ready to put that ass in order

Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy down in da water.. yeah
Off the banks of the muddy Mississippi ready to put that ass in order

You gettin close to me when you hit them rocks on the banks
So grab your flippers, goggles and oxygen tank
Go grab a wet suit, check your regulator soon
Cause we pack spear guns and give niggas harpoons
Then we - flood the streets, oh how they - lovin me
Come through in the Buick sittin so - love-ly

Where niggas come through your window with pistols
Like Bruh Man off the fifth flo'
See the way the wrist glow, sick flow
Better yet, turn off the lights, I'll turn this bitch into a disco
Hood crime highly infested
Check your rap, rock and pop stations; Gube Thug, highly requested
And my gun like Chris, you know I'm gon' +Tucker+
In a Spider Modena, the color of Apple Pucker
And the game from the veterans, righteous bars
I'm in it for longevity, stripes and stars
And the world might change if ever I quit blessin it
Just use my illest verse to throw in the New Testament
I got a need for speed like Jeff Gordon
Shot hoops in size 10, it's just Jordan
Plus, I should be a warden the way I lock cells

Take nothin for granted
Blessing everything on my life
Trying to see a new light
At the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel
But I speak the truth
I heat the booth
Nelly acting so uncooth ( so crazy)
Top down shirt off
In the coupe
Spreadin the loot

And my - Closest to kin
And I - Do it again!

You know I just couldn't hide shit beneath me
Only nigga can take a still picture in 3D
If need be, I'm leavin' the party with Cindy
It's gotta be, bo-legged, long hair, Fendi
Ninety-nine, I move over to her twin-sister, Medni
I spit game like that to get brains like that
Butter soft leather seats, it came like that
If sex was football, I'd be a running back
Get ya on and get low, and I never fumble
Make ya throw your hands up when I bring in the zone
So if it's on, it's on, shit, I'm takin' you home
I got my home-dog out, it's on chrome, long gone
She like my bizza, my batlin' dog
You Lunatics, that's what I be sayin' bout y'all
I'm not a MD but I'm always on call
And I got a safe-way guaranteed not to stall
Here we come (Here we come now girl)
Come for you (Baby girl, aw, aw)

Sippin' Allezey, steady puffin' on a pound
Hollerin' ""woah nah"", slow down, switch it up
Mami, don't front, go down, hit it up
I'm like the New Edition, Don, Ralph, Bobby, and Mike
Not even Ricky ""Rapper"" Johnny can stand the rain tonight
Is this the end, damn right, I turned on a liking to
Vannessa Derrio like over Brian McKnight
Said ""Oh no"", baby doll kissin me and she goin down low
People at D.E.M.O., HOT, tell that you a pro
Swore up and down you never did this before
Whatever, just go slow
Hated by all types, baby fathers and dykes
Uptight and ready to fight 'cause I'm the one they women like
He think he tight, think he got more game than Spike Lee
Runnin' thru his vains like an IV, high speeds
Tightest nigga for 5 G's and Al D
Tryna catch my now when my price is low
Then 95 digits when the Lunatics blow
Another zero for a show, to let you niggas know, now what
Here we come (Here we come now girl)
Come for you (Baby girl, aw, aw)

You see me and my niggas only come out on the weekends
'cause on the weekdays to busy creepin', freakin'
Wit' yo rat, now picture that, when she wit you
She now speakin' what u weak in
Lettin me know that she really been thinkin'
About a nigga, even when I'm not with her
I'm frosty all year, while you only in the winter
My pockets gettin' fatter, your pockets gettin thinner
I ain't payin time so you callin' me a sinner
Old Payne, 29, callin' me a young tender
Nelly stopped on me, don't stop when I'm wit her
She ready 4 whatever and I ain't' even bought her dinner
I sorted tha game on a bench with splinters
Beggin' your coach, let you play for a minute
The last seconds of the game, used to weigh in to enter
I ain't gotta herd no drugs no more, I know who tha winner

Goin to start a money war, what is he there for?
Stacks little paper, what he do that for?
Throw a few thousand out the roof of my Maybach
Just a little somethin that I got from Reebok
We cop, e'rything you see up in the windows
Shoppin sprees keep me hungry ma, it's time to get some {?}
Turkey bacon, egg whites all up in my griddle
Obscene how the protein keep a nigga lean

It's obscene how the protein keep a nigga lean

I'm chillin in my Coupe with my chick on the side
I'm just chillin in my Coupe (what?) I'm chillin in my Coupe (what?)
I'm chillin in my Coupe with my chick on the side
I'm like a country-ass Adonis lookin for my goddess
Same attractin apparatus around, that can find her
Pulled down the shades, clothes on your body
She can go behind this lame and let shorty go to work
Show a couple thou', bet shorty go berserk
Last night she on the pole, then this mornin she in chruch
On her knees in both places, man I bet that hurt
Get you some extra funds, support ya single moms
Heard she slangin ass so you can say she buy sex
Plus she got a friend so I hope she bi-sex
I park right next to her, yeah that's me
Plus the house up on the hill, baby yeah that's me


See I'm a U-City alumni, lookin out my one eye
Similar to Popeye, when I'm on that spinach
Somebody call up the Guinness Book, it's gotta be record
Like when I heard the beat I knew it had to be on my record
Know folks need it, I'm officially elected
The right to bear arms, I'm officially protected
So if I call you out, don't argue, respect it
Matter fact, go hit the showers, you officially ejected!
I used to slang the Jimmy Crack when I didn't care
I seen Jimmy jack corn homie, I was there
When Jimmy turned around with his devilish glare
I showed Jimmy waistline, partner he wouldn't dare (c'mon)
I can burn your chest like shots of Patron
Fuck a drink, I'm talkin 50-cal desert eagle holmes
... Ah ah ah ah
I drop down and get my 50-cal desert eagle on (boom!)

Here we go (WE ALL WE GOT, OHH!)

She blowin cause she seen that car (she 'bout to blow!)
She blowin cause you turned that corner (there they go!)
She blowin cause she seen that watch (she 'bout to blow!)
She blowin cause you flashed in it on her ('bout to blow!)

Carrots and the broccoli, how the hell can you stop me?

Would be uncivil-ous, and like some syphilis I'm killin this
Beat by Pharrell-y; yeah, yeah, really
Chad this is silly; ju-just silly (WHOO!)
Got a team in the Carolinas, your highness
Keep the finest big booty behind us, behind us
Just to remind us that, that we the flyest so
Kids at home, yo, please don't try this
My hands in my pocket mayne I'm doin the wop
Lil' mama on her Snoopy Doggy Dogg, she droppin it hot
I got whatever in my garage, pull up and shut down your spot
I got how many in my bezel man I shut down your watch
Oh yeah I'm rappin, believin, my zing and my trees in
And soon I'll be leavin, with yo' chick (ah-ha!)


She call me Mr. extra sexual, Scorpio ma is legible
Extraterrestrial, she say I'm harder to swivel
I keep a fresh pair of Versace, shine up my Liberace
My Dolce and my Gabanna, ma I'm keepin it thorough
I keep one hundreds in the bunnies{?}, let me keep it 100
I'm the most underrated, under-appreciated
Most sold to dated, fuck you rapper we GOT
See I don't drop every year to give you niggas a shot
Now I might not get five mics or a double-XL (never)
But fuck it, you keep it, I'ma take the 100 mil' (cha-ching!)
And the Murcielago with the rim kitted Tahoe
The show stopper, when I ride all you hear is ""Bravo"" (bravo!)
 And all you hear is, ""There he go""
Ha ha ha - ah, ah, ah
You see my paint job's a fool, my paint job be poppin
My paint job's so wet my license plates read (what it read?)

Let's go, ay
This story we about to tell you, is all true
The names may have been changed to protect some of those close to me
Uhh, uhh, true story, but if not

They say money is the root of all evil
And I'm really startin to see what it do to people
Check it (c'mon) mo' money, mo' problems
Well e'rybody got problems, but they expect me to solve 'em (hey)
And I can barely solve my own
Got me lookin at 'em like, ""You supposed to be grown?""
And I done said this shit in four different tones
To they face, e-mails mayne and over the phone
I done said that shit calm, I done said that shit loud
I done pulled 'em to the side, I done tried to sit 'em down
But some just don't get it
Cause they mind only focused on (hey) shit what I got
What they ain't got, and what they can't get
Got me lookin at my albums like ""Who wrote this shit?""
Believe me man, I hope this get
Just a tad bit better but I doubt that shit (it's like hey!)

I can hear these people say, ""Damn that boy done changed""
But they don't understand the pressures I'm goin through
Oh how I wish there was a way, to change places for a day
Just so they can see what it's like to walk a mile in my shoes

Yo, listen
C'mon, I love Dave Chappelle
But I don't know too many turn down 50 mil'
See that's talk for real
Besides, you know what I had to go through to get this deal?
How many brothers I done seen get killed
For 50 bucks and a few of them pills? Y'all don't feel me
(Man please) Damn right I sing all them songs
So I can buy my pops a car and my momma a home
So she can sit up on the phone with her best friend Joan
Talkin like on and on how her baby done grown
""How my baby make his own through the microphone
And how my baby been my baby since my baby was born""
But uhh, I ain't sayin man it's all about the money
But let's face it, you can't make a record for free
I'll be damned if I watch 'em make a mil' off me
And I just sit back and take it, for minimum wage
And I done gave 'em e'rything but my D and my A
I say hey, that's what the contract say (contract say)
They make it seem like you can't get away
It's like you owe these niggas three more days
Y'all don't feel me (hey!)

With the best thunder than Shaun Jon, you don't want none
Partna I gather up and leavin' heads swollen up
On top of all that, I got the rap sewed up
Hold up, with the Budda thumpin' niggas outa
And just the teach a lesson, I put one in ya shoulder
I told ya, 'tics live for the street life
Eat right, fuck good, And reffer thru the pipe
And give me head all night
And if its some beef, I pumpin' lead on sight
Until they deceased, I took ya head off right
I live in the beast
Nigga, where the Feds, play sheist
I still floss ice, keep it tight
Every time, call me the Black Liberace when I'm playing mine
Thats how I flow when I gotta get mine, anyway it go
Whether it be rapping or with the four four
Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0

Blind-folded, with no shows
Using no flows, just Arm -n- Hammer
And folk O's
Gimmie low does and a connect, that neva closed
And watch me lock it down from North County to BenRos
Fuck some Mo-Mo's, Gimmie hundereds with soft chrome
On the Navigata equipped to click and log on
I leave that before its gone
'Fore they even bring it home
Matta fact, I'll tell you what's in the back, its all gone
Two holes in the roof, to let the sun come in
Match it leather car seat, in case my son get in
I spare one off in the back in case he bring his friend
Play Station just in case a nigga think he can win

But only if the ice on your wrist cause glares

West missies, 1-2-3-4 or 5 bottles of Cris's
On the table, arms the strong ripp off the label
No more shows for free, I'm pay per view like cable
They all screamin' my name, different shades and race
Take them all backstage and lett'em plead they case
Make a million like Jigga, standin' in one place
Sound Scan like Thrilla with out changing my face
They threw the weak plan B
Says who? Says me
Then whats plan A, 'cause plan B is a BOMB case

Go (feat. Ali & Talib Kweli),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Life, what is it for real, I don't know
It's like hate taking over the whole world, what is it over?
Suicide, man, that's the devil trying to control us, they told us
,but we didn't notice the pain was sitting on they shoulders
The world was just a polar, the rather live in the solar
System got us hopeless, and focused on forclosures
Wake up and smell the folgers... oh momma and bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9 11 was bogus, now we right back at him
Say the war is our motive
Wake up early in the streets of the block, streets of the block
He posted up on the corner like a soldier in the drill but he wouldn't stop
Living life in the battlefield, battlefield, trying to survive every day and every night
It's the same deal
Lifes strange lifes strange ,times change times change, but karma always finds the way
Stay strong, stay strong, hold on, hold on
Don't let all your dreams fade away
Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going,till it feels like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard,and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way
A lot of mothers they just don't understand, they just don't understand
They think we're hard on our sons but we gotta teach our boys how to be a man
They only know when they walk out the door, when they walk out the door
See we can show em how to fire but they gotta teach themselves how to reload
Cause unenployment is harder than its ever been, sometimes it feels like i can't win
And even through all the rules keep changing, I'm stronger now than I was when I came in
Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way
Hey, hey, going through the back streets like i got beef
Carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
Animalistic it's why we call the cops beast
We're on the hunt, cause they're hungry for the dark meat
I'm rapping through my heart beat, brain is the base, my heart is the drum
Give the drum some, promis of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, I'm trying to live
Cause all I want is a better way
Hey, if you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know
Get a grip on something real and never let it go
And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets harder, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way

Don't play around, nigga like dat
Shut shit down, straight like dat
Uh, I'm Dukes of Hazard playin dodge, 8 bricks in the Charger
Inside my hood they call me Ace, yea I hustle harder
I started up behind a bitch but now I play the starter
Tangle up so many rocks, they call it Mr. Carter
Mr. Cate, G I'm talkin sure
My money disrespectful, ghost Phantom, sleep on my lawn
My Drisco well in distance like Diddy with Sean John
I got the streets so my bitch on lash, I can't post no bond
Nah, tell them niggas I'm like dead beat
Summing up, they don't fight back
Up in Barcelona, no flight back
In the outtie 8 til bank black
Hundred grand a spill so I backpack
And fear the safety, come right back
Build it back up just like dat
Straight up (like dat)

My X texts, I ain't write back
Til I came around with my new bitch
She like Daniel, it's like that
Ride around to that pimpsy
With your girl and her 2 friend
I don't drink but it's tradition
I sip syrup in Houston
I fell in love at the strip clubs
She fell in love with my clique
Goddamn right, bandz a make er dance
Shit, I'm tryina make enough to make her quit
In the cut with Dirty Mo
Yea, young nigga on the move
Mama tell your friends your son is on TV and I ain't on the news, word
Now they all call cause they see I'm hot
And they see a nigga buzzin like a beehive drop
Don't be fooled by this brand new Rolly baby, I've been getting money since ER dropped
Hotels I spend nights at, that pussy good enough to miss he flight back
Black card, I swipe dat
10 thousand just like dat, word

Groovin’ Tonight,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Brian McKnight)
Tonight's the night, tonight's the niiiiiiigggght
Girl you lookin so fly, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Said I wanna get it on, mmhmmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Girl you lookin sooooo fly, do, do, do, dooo
Said I wanna get it on
(Ali - talking)
U-City, uh, uh, Brian McKnight, Lunatics, groovin, groovin, groovin tonight
Ha ha, yeah, what you think about that nigga?
Hah, hah, what you think about that nigga? Ladies
(Ali)
Now you could search the whole globe but couldn't replace me
You skurred (scared) then face me, you don't wanna race me
Fendi fur, Cartier glasses for the blur
I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her
I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like ""ahh man"" when they see me with Cardan
Puffin on the green, discussin a war plan
I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a labtop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order
So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take?
Plus she been on my nuts since thumps and pencil breaks
'Cause I'm a nigga with the hoe, a nigga with the flow
Fo' Reel nigga, pissy drunk in the Rov'
(Chorus - Brian McKnight)
Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn (break of dawn)
'Cause the ladies are groovin tonight (the ladies are groovin tonight)
To the ladies lookin fly (looking fly)
If you wanna ride them hold on tight (hold on tight)
'Cause the fellas are groovin tonight (tonight's the night)
(Nelly)
""Skuuuuuiieeee"" baby girl, you hear me callin you?
Now I ain't hawkin you, just wanna walk with you
Talk with you for a second, spit a little somethin in that err (ear)
Whatever it takes to make you come nerr (near)
I'm tryna' sound sincerr (sincere), ay
Baby talkin to me but I'm starin at her rerr (rear)
And I'm like ""oh derr (dear)""
I ain't never seen nathen like you before
And you the type to make a nigga wanna open your door
And to the house up on the hill and the jag is yours
As long as you can prove that you wit' a nigga for sure
You know I'm young and a thug, so I got issues
I did them St. Louis blues, I done paid them dues, ay
But nevermind that, how 'bout we hop the next cruise
We can cash it or plastic, you choose
Get pissed out with the Cristal or the Boones
Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom
(Chorus)
(City Spud) (talking)
Keep it movin, keep it movin, I keep it groovin, huh
Keep it movin, keep it movin, keep it groovin, huh
I keep it, movin, keep it groovin huh, uh, uh, uh
Yo, baby girl you lookin fly in yo' Donna K
Hopin I could give you some love in the right way
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I keep it mellow, sayin hello
You still thinkin I'm a thug fellow
So I let you know from the get-go you thorough
You a cutie with thighs and you live for the nero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japenese
I'm a goodfella, you know, I'm a made man
Got 'em winin like spoiled babies in play pens
Put that ass up baby and I hit it from here
Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here
Let me whip that, lick that, and I don't stop
Then hit the block with my niggas in, my new drop
Convertable, tens and dubs, no matter the weather
One-sixty on the dash, chinky eyes and leather, c'mon
(Chorus)

Paaaarrrtttyyyy, party, hey, hey, hey

I only deal with what I can see cause over history, mystery brought us nothin but misery
Man more people done died in the name of the lord
Than in any natural disaster, disease or gangwars
Before guns there was swords and they was killin each other
And what's changed to this day still killin each other
Killin a brother while another mother cries for help
Man! we need to help a brother find themself
Feed em light 1, 2, 3
Hey! that's something every brother should see and that's Fo' Reel
And that's Fo' Reel, and that's Fo' Reel
Ha ha ha ha ha ohh
And dey say ohh ohh ohh

High on life,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They say I was always destined for fortune and fame
Now that I've gotten what I wanted everything's changed
And now I'm living the
High life, high life
I never looked back once I left my hometown
High life, high life
I left behind everybody I know
And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
They say you have to come clean with your past to move on
All of my dreams have come true but something still feels wrong
But I'm still living the
High life, high life
I never looked back once I left my hometown
High life, high life
Said goodbye to everybody I know
And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Everybody's dreaming of the high life
It may look good from the outside
But all I really wanted was a good life
With a memory reel of all the highlights
All I want is to sleep good at night
Look myself in the mirror knowing that I live right
So when I'm six feet in the ground
I'll be singing like
A million dollars in palm
Not a worry in the world, that's everything I want
I'm wishing I was there I feel like it's where I belong
I wanna be able to go pay all the bills for my mom
And make her smile
Pick up my family and take em out
On me
And my over capacitated bank account
Money is all I think about
Of my life it's a highlight
Tired of being low I'm ready for the high life
Look at me now
Look at how I get down
Stubs and Wooten on my feet
I'm the flyest youngin in town
But I'm loosin it
My vision has just become an illusion
And Now my highlife is low again
Struggling to hold it in I was on a mission
And messed everything up making all the wrong decisions
I know it's not the end Well then again it might be
And it's sucks god forbid you ever end up like me
And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life",https://genius.com/Nelly-high-on-life-lyrics

Hangover,UnKnown,UnKnown,"6 in the morning, shorty at my door
Banging in the sheet, yea let's you want more
And who am I to tell her no if she want it?
Shorty se the pole, I say go and she on it
No hesitation or procrastination
She come and lay in time like a reservation
My demonstration, power of persuasion
Should be your education, know how to get relations
Slip, slide, right up in em down to center
Don't stop, (ey) this shorty you represent uh
Both sides, the backhand and the front in the

Lil mama hot, you should see her body parts
Her pussy wet, I'm diving in like a life guard
I'm a equal opportunity provider
With that lean, a 69'er
Slow grinder, that's just a reminder
Roaming over shorty like a sail a provider
Get it in when I step out aha

Country nigga fly, country nigga fly, country nigga fly
That country nigga fly, that country nigga fly
That country, country, country, country nigga fly
I'm a boss hoe riding hazel like a duke boy
Making neck jerk like a new boy
Erry summer, I'm pulling out a new toy
Erry winter, I'm pulling out a new toy
I love the noochies, but my old school is better
My paint dripping wet, my inside dripping leather
With a hood rich been hood since I met her
Name tattered on her pussy and I'm licking her a letter
Errytime you see me you know I'm so clean on em
Cause I ball on another level, whole team on it
I used to cook it up and break it down, triple bean on them
Fliest thing you've ever seen around, no wings on him
I'm a strip club veteran, better than you done ever been
Louie knapsack, full of racks and stacks when I'm coming in
Let me hit tonight, let me hit tonight
King of diamonds, magic city, let me hit tonight
Ain't no doubt, I show up, show out
Cause I'm country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly (fly)
Country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly
All I know is everywhere I go
They say that country nigga fly (fly), that country nigga fly (fly)
That country, country, country, country nigga fly
I can't help it, I was born in this lame state
I get it in, from the lou up to the great lakes
My great estate, got beef gates
Eating dinner off my money, call it paper plates
Now what you know about that?
Now what you know about that?
I pull up, they say where you go and cop that
Tell them goodbye, not too far from my rack
Back on the leer, with a chick from Niger
Blowing Amsterdam kush while she biting on my ear
I'm in my nine's mode, feeling so sincere
I ain't playing with you niggas, I'm just tryina make it clear
I get it in, when I step out
Pull up that Benz and pull the billy out
I'm who your friends, is talk about
If you ain't with it, lil mama you missing out
Ain't no doubt, I show up, show out
Cause I'm country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly (fly)
Country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly
All I know is everywhere I go

Missouri to Indiana, country niggas fly
Louisiana to Alabama, them country niggas fly
Texas, Florida, Georgia, them country niggas fly
Tennessee to Carolina, them country niggas fly
Let's get it, I tell you once, I tell you twice
G's in my griss, sugar on my rice
First niggas rocking grills with the ice
Now every country motherf*cker think the leg not
East coast bitches call me mac daddy
But west coast wanna see my cat daddy
I swing a mean hook, I think I'll need a Caddy
If I was Tyga I'da never got married mane

She Don’t Know My Name - Ronald Isley,UnKnown,UnKnown,"HOOO! Hooooooo
Well well well.. yeahhhh

There's this girl, AND, I see her every day
But she don't know me (she don't know my name)
And it ain't all that strange to me
Cause I know hers, AND, it won't be long
'til she's convinced that I'm her man
The one that's gon' take her away
Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo it's three in the mornin and the party's still goin
Bass still knockin, +Pimp Juice+ still flowin
'Tics in the back, you can smell the chronic blowin
I got girls all around, I got my Hef' game goin
Baby girl right but her partner got ass
Baby girl left but her partner got ass
She got 'em stuffed in them boy shorts covered up with lil' hearts
Her partner got 'em laced, cut right below the waist
You can tell they got taste by they ensemble
One like to salsa, the other the mambo
Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?
They like to work out, and I ain't talkin Tae*Bo
They like fast cars, I ain't talkin Volvos
They both are the devil but they like it diablo
Don't worry got it covered just listen to Ronald

Hmm, she say them suckers agitate her, told her I'm a regulator
Man I wanna lay down witcha, maybe we can do it later
I ain't got no time to waste, another move I got to make
Cold thang, she ain't even know my nizzame (damn)
I didn't even have to say it, baby wanna stop and play it
Rewind that, pop and grind that
You'll find that, a woman like yourself can't keep cumin by yourself
Get in where you fit in, now enjoy yourself
Cute brightskin brownskin take me to the mountain
Get you wet like a fountain
Then get your counselin, have a seat have a drink have a toke
It's a +Doggy Dogg World+, you can have whatever you want
... or whatever you need, all you got to do it follow my lead
Take my hand, and roll with me
And live it up, with a D-O-double-G, lavishly

Hey girl, what's yo' fantasy?
Can I take you home? I want you here with me
Ooh girl you blow my mind, I want to be yo' freak
Let me take you there, to that ecstasy, hoo
Oooooooooooh ba-by, ba-by
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh, what's your name?
What's your name? Gotta get you home with me tonight dear",https://genius.com/Nelly-she-dont-know-my-name-ronald-isley-lyrics
