Me Myself And I,3 Feet High and Rising,1989,"Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La Clothes
Or is it just my De La Soul?
What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No we're not, thats pure plug bull
Always pushing that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Glory Glory Hallelu
Glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By concensing dookie eyes
People think they diss my person
By stating I'm darkly packed
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, ""Black is Black""
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin up
So I don't get an aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the 4th day of July
Cause they tried to mess with third degree
That's me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-me-myself-and-i-lyrics

Vibe, vibrations
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high
When we talking 'bout the 
vibe, vibrations
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high
We talking 'bout 
vibe, vibrations
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high

The instamatic focal point bringing damage to your boroughs
Be some brothers from the east with them beats that be thorough
Got the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it
I gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets
Gun control means using both hands in my land
Where it's all about the cautious livin'
Migrating to a higher form of consequence, compliments
Of strugglin', that shouldn't be notable
Man, every word I say should be a hip hop quotable

I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout blunts, sick of Versace glasses
Sick of slang,
 
sick of half-ass awards shows
Sick of name brand clothes
Sick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks
Cocaine and crack, which brings sickness to blacks
Sick of swoll' head rappers with their sickening raps
Clappers of gats, makin' the whole sick world collapse
The facts are gettin' sicker, even sicker perhaps
Stickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapse

Man, life can get all up in your ass, baby, you betta work it out
Let me tell you what it's all about
A skin not considered equal
A meteor has more right than my people
Who be wastin' time screaming who they've hated
That's why the Native Tongues has officially been reinstated

Yo, it's about love for cars, love for funds
Loving to love mad sex, loving to love guns
Love for opposite, love for fame and wealth
Love for the fact of no longer loving yourself, kid
We living in them days of the man-made ways
Where every aspect is vivid
These brothers no longer talk shit
Hey yo, these niggas live it
'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone
Plug One
 translating the zone
No offense to a player, but yo, I don't play
And if you take offense, fuck it, got to be that way
J.D. Dove, show your love, what you got to say?

I say G's are making figures at a high regard
And niggas dying for it nowadays ain't odd
Investing in fantasies and not God
Welcome to reality, see times is hard
People try to snatch the credit, but can't claim the card
Showing out in videos, saying they co-starred
See, shit like that will make your mama cry
Better watch the way you spend it cause the stakes is high

Cause love don't get you through life no more
It's who you know and ""How you, son?""
And how you gettin' in, and who the man holding heat
Hey yo, and how was the skins and how high
Yo what up, huh? I heard you caught a body
Seem like every man and woman shared a life with John Gotti

But they ain't organized!

Mixing crimes with life enzymes
Taking the big scout route and niggas know doubt
Better than they know their daughters and their sons
(Oh boy)

Yo, people go through pain and still don't gain
Positive contact just like my main man
Who got others cleaning up his physical and fluids
His mind got congested
He got the nine and blew it
Neighborhoods are now hoods cause nobody's neighbors
Just animals surviving with that animal behavior
Under I who be rhyming from dark to light sky
Experiments when needles and skin connect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
When them stakes is high you damn sure try to do
Anything to get the piece of the pie
Electrify, even die for the cash

Eye Know,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

Eye know Eye love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

Eye know Eye love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me cause

Eye know Eye love you better

It's I again and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

Eye know Eye love you better",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-eye-know-lyrics
Rock Co.Kane Flow,The Grind Date,2004.0,"Up in them 5-star tellies saying two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without saying the producer's name all over the track
Yeah I said it! What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that A grade shit
Now quit now before we pour
That sure shot pure rock cocaine flow

From the top of the key for 3 -- Villain!
Been on in the game as long as he can wheelie a Schwinn
Turn the corner spinning, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to free power like LILCo
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay youths when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose V with a fur collar
And charged a fee for loose leaf words per dollar
Ya heard? Holler - broad or dude, we need food
Eat your teams for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon him for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up

Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

DOOM brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam and 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Their rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, ring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on you fools, his own Boss like Hugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from being hot
It's about if you can handle being cold or not
And we was told to hop on no one's dick by Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from the other way of thinking
Hey your lady's winking, I think you need to control that
Or I'll have to hold that

The elements are airborne, I smell the success
(Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man)
Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sipping broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing
I finger pop these verses like first dates
The birthdate's September 2-1, 1-9, 6-8
Too old to rhyme, too bad, too late",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-rock-cokane-flow-lyrics
Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey),De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,"""Yes, this is Miss Renee King from Philadelphia. I want you to give me a call on area code 215-222-4209 and I'm calling in reference to the music business. Thank you.""

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I gotta answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
""was it def?""
And with the straighest face I be like, ""hell yes.""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call they get

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here by the miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny, jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me, Myself, and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like, ""oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone she'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak.""
So no problemo, just play the demo and at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind cause I'll just lay it down the line

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
POS:
Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you.. peace
'Yo what's up man, this is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank
Posse, man, you know man, so you know you can just hook me up, troop. You know we got this fly new jam called 'Swimming In the Fish Tank', you know we gonna rock it man, you know what I'm saying, but I just need your help, Prince Paul gave me your number, you know man, you just gotta do that for me.

Pain,and the Anonymous Nobody...,2016.0,"Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world had you licked (Put 'em up high)
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Needing help on the sand put you under quick
Big mama said, ""The Devil's up to no good""
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book (What?)
Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look (And)
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya, it hit ya like flu
Better times will pick ya, do what you gotta do
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light, saying

Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I hear the people saying)
Pain will make it better
(I hear my people saying)
Pain will make it better

No wetter, four-letter, mo' better
Slow pain, no gain, go-getter
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather but well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that gain makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang-bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation
But not for me, G, I’m into public relations
That's food for your De La Soul, word to the letter

Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I heard my nana say it, say it, yo)

The bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus,
 
talking Watts
 
to Mobile
Now we're on a house on a hill
Struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT couldn't cover the bills
When life came with a couple of spills
But we're gon' use that pain for fuel, so

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I hear the people say)
Pain will make it better
(You hear my people saying)
Pain will make it better

Pain will make it better

Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (Okay)

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions, no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos, hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I'll initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)
(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y (why)
'Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny I seem
(Very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lift
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree, I hope that you're not mad at me
'Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip)
On the A side or sometimes the flip
(Never gonna flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush, my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Or let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll
(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy, I will boast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed
(Word)

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my Swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
'Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware?

The Magic Number,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Three, that’s the Magic Number
Yes, it is, it’s the magic number
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community
Was born three: Mase, Dove and me
And that’s the magic number
(What does it all mean?)

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos’ pleasure
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in my measure
Measure in my music, raised in three parts
Casually see but don’t do like the Soul
Cause seein’ and doin’ are actions for monkeys
Doin’ hip hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name’s Brewster, cause Brewster's a Punk (three)
Parents let go cause there’s magic in the air
Criticising rap shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires
And don’t get offended while Mase do-si-do’s your daughter
A tri-camera rolls since our music’s now set
Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y. production
It stands for “Da Inner Sound, Y’all” and y’all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function

Everybody wants to be a deejay
Everybody wants to be an emcee
But being speakers are the best
And you don’t have to guess
De La Soul posse consists of three
And that’s the magic number

This here piece of the pie
Is not dessert, but the course that we dine
And three out of every darn time
The effect is “Mmmm” when a daisy grows in your mind
Showing true position, this here piece is
Kissin’ the part of the pie that's missin’
When that negative number fills up the cavity
Maybe you can subtract it
You can call it your lucky partner
Maybe you can call it your adjective
But odd as it may be
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be
My three: Mase, Pos and me
And that’s the Magic Number
Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who honor the scroll
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Set aside a legal substance to feed ‘em
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug
Time is a factor so it's time that counts
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number
Now you may try to subtract it
But it just won't go away
Three times one?
(What is it?)
(One, two, three!)
And that's a Magic Number
(Yo, what's up?)
(1, 2, 3)
(I say, children, what does it all mean?)
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3)
(I wouldn't lie to you)
(No more no less, that's a magic number)
(No more no less)
(What it is?)
(No more no less)
(Do the shang-a-lang)
(No more no less)
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?)
(No more no less)
(How high's the water, mama?)
(No more no less)
(How high's the water, mama?)
(No more no less)
(Three feet high and rising)
(No more no less)
(Three)

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings sad boy joy
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Saturday, it's a Saturday
It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the weekend check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Five days you work
One whole day to play
Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
(Is the word, is the word, is the word)

Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a 
bounce, rock, skate, roll
 fest to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
Cause all we need is feet
(And rollerskates)
But promote the hustle cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in

(Is there a Dred on skates?)
Yes, man
(So kick the wham on this jam)
Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, huh
It's a Saturday

Pos: 
Now let's all get baked like Anita
Q-Tip: 
Watch Mr. Lawnge
, don't look at the peter
Dove: Feel on the fun, I'll feel on the
Vinia: Hey, watch that!
De La Soul: It's a Saturday

Now is the time
To act the fool tonight
Forget about your worries and you will be all right
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday

Memory of... (US),and the Anonymous Nobody...,2016.0,"Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
I remember your face, I remember your way

I remember you now
Part of my existence
I remember your face
You came in and got me
All in a day
Yeah, all in a day
I remember your lips
Do you remember the taste?
Remember family names
Your child, my child, our child
Whitley and Dwayne
Different to my world now
Remember the ways
You gripped my hips so tight now?
Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
I remember your face, I remember your way

How could I forget?
A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallel amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of departure
Gave in your pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you
Cause I kept wanting to feature
With them other females on they songs too
Your words spoken in mono for monogamy
Telling me I had to go cause I chose
Stereo for stereotypical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps
For you to fall in for me again
Who hates you to tell me
""Slow up the pace, maybe erase, don't…""

Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...

Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance just showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
""Forgivin' won't erase the bitter past""
But I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit, you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

I remember you now (Accountability is major)
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
Cause time can't be replaced
And I don't want to stay

Cause, oh, it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's so dah-dah-dee-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
It's so easy to fall
In dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
Remember your way
Remember your way

Plug Tunin (Last Chance to Comprehend),3 Feet High and Rising,1989,"""And now for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics
Perhaps the most famous classic in all the world of music—""
The first time around, you didn't quite understand our new style of
Speak
(Don't worry, we can fix that right now)
So why don't you all just grab your bags
(Come on aboard, hoist the anchor, and we'll be off)
(And good luck to both of you)
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One

Answering any other service
Perogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my ability
After the battle they admit that I'm with it
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with
Like wind, vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called plug tunin'

(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma
Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know'
Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet
Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid
When paying position to the naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two

Freeze cause these are the brothers
Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick
Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative
Flow to the sway cause I say fa-so-la-ti
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell
Motions of the Soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant sends L.I. on the strong map
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap
Style of the Tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all
Watch while the pitcher is pitching
Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard Dove crying, I ain't fearing
Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the B-B cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the Plug Tune

(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

And and bass up the track a little bit
'Cause I'm — I wanna hear that woom sss-ch woom, knowhatI'msayin?
Yeah yeah, you know the bizness, Common Sense
Soul with the De La
Forget all them playas
We the rhyme-sayers
Huh, and that's the bizness, hah
Gon' do it like this
Gettin' it hot, like the Chicago streets

I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high
Always exhale the facts 'cause I don't inhale la/lie
Play the greater man's game to bounce off my losses
So I can earn the acres (uhh) the houses (yeah) the horses (huh)
Of course it's much greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das
Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos
And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin'
They call me Luther Van', they say my style is So Amazing (ha)
I'm fazin' those who're supposed to have the last laughter
'Cause even when I'm gone I'm reappearin' in the after—
I haveta, send respects to real money makers
Do not connect us with those champagne sippin' money fakers
Taste the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town
Now what that prove? You're so full you can't even move

'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun
Uh, and I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink...

Do you wanna be a MC, or do you wanna serve?
Do you wanna be dope, or do you wanna deal it?
Fabricated acrylic, I feel it, I'm the style molester
I do a show get Extra P's like the Large Professor
I
n fact, I get more hoes than Tessa
Peep game like a refe-ree, in sole control of my desti-ny
In the best of, three out of five, whip anybody ass at NBA Live
Rappers, take a dive like Greg Louganis with his gay-ass
Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the Clique with gators
Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner
I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her (ahuh-hah!)
At one point in rhyme I thought I lost my erection
But then I got it back with the 
Resurrection
Blessings upon rhymes, old man who called him traitor
Big Com-stradamus, niggas styles I predict

I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun

I'm the most from the coast of the Eastern flav'
Droppin more knowledge than litter on the New York pave'
It's me, Wonder Why, in the place to be
Certified as superior MC
While others explore to make it hardcore
I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door
'Cause these kids is rhyming, sometiming
And when we get to racing on the mic, they line up to see
The lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling
My rhymes escalates like black death rates
Over musical plates, being played as the rule
Kids thinking stepping to the Soul, you're labelled fools
Who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching
I don't worry on what crew you run, or what section of earth
You reside, you're not even a MAN
So I don't deem it MANdatory taking your pride
But I will, 'cause my man said Soulful Delight
You tried ""Keepin' it real"", yet you should try keepin' it right
That's understanding microphone mathematics
Which leads to currency and temporary world status
And when one shows he posed threat to this one
This one will make that one into none
Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero
If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from

Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun
Yeah, and I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
See, can't another brother cook these delicacies
See, can't another brother cook these delicacies
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun
Walk around the planet Earth making money having fun

Ahh, that's how, that's how I'm supposed to do my thing, huh
Like triple it, alright
That's how we do it, all the way from Strong Island to Chicago

Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll
Food on the floor, not to be wasted
Or doing what’s being pasted and know that it’s not a copy
Eye on the prize, instead of gas prices
Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest
Born of a generation that don't generate patience
And travel too fast for you to clock me
Not always a good thing
You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour
I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones
Had me like a fiend screamin' ""What you got for me?""
Two words (I'm mortal)

It's better for me, I'm satisfied with repping for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claiming never been gone
Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you

You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped
Always out there scheming!
They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiending?
Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed
That's the truth! Things ain't goin' like you think they should
A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Alright then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed, like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't phase
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah

It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-all-good-lyrics

I am the man-ner of the family cuz the pants fit

Wit the thread from needle outta hay, I wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again

Wave the eighteen mill', eat a still
Sack or bag of troubles, make the single double

Lay it low and late night I get sessed
Uncondition my ways, of the everyday sunset
Wagin my days, to the one bet
Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin'
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
Cause the days of the breaks, be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm exploding

I be the fab, I be the fabulous but see unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name (ah one two, ah one two)
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin on to when I caught the fame (ah one two, ah one two)
Pass the task to ask me bout the Native Tongue again my friend

Cause in the mix, man, it's alright
Momma got the rhythm to my day-life
My pops gots enough so best to leave or sail the waves
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, I stay inside of my gates
Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eye-scan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special

Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the never-ending factor while I'm over, tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
(Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin' up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round em up and get 'em back to the hotel
Motel, holiday, inn-fact

Jenifa Taught Me (Derwin’s Revenge),3 Feet High and Rising,1989,"Access to her code
Lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook
Jenifa... (oh!)
Breakfast, broke it fast
She was in my English class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat
Jenifa... (oh!)
Jenny, lost her favorite penny
So I gave her a dollar
She kissed me (and I hollered)
In a flash the school bell rang
Jenny grabbed on to my hand
Took me home and said, Trugoy just
Swing and swing and swing

The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Transcripts showed more than flirt
""I love Daisies"" read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Marvelous, shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan, I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried, ""Kick it""
Posdnuos was in
Jenny
Only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said, ""Let’s try it in the bathroom""
But ’dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan
And came back wrapped in saran
Now waaaaaait a minute! Little Derwin got something to show us that Jenny could never do!
Listen...
Hey, look at little Derwin! Look at him go! Look at him go!
Awww, baby

Positions, muscles flexed
Dove was lost in a gon-a-hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Notions soothed the mood
Dove was lost in De La heaven
Screwed plug two, did the do
Jenifa oh Jeny
Jeny
Teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool

No more I dispatched
Was it Jimmy had met his match
Or could it be the realization
All girls owned a Jeny
For normal health, I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don’t flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you came with plenty",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-jenifa-taught-me-derwins-revenge-lyrics
I Am I Be,Buhloone Mindstate,1993.0,"I am Shortie
I be 4'11""

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
Product of a North Carolina cat
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
Look ma, no protection
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
(And that'll be sometime soon)
Faker than a fist of kids
Speakin that they're black
When they're just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied
And said ""We'll be natives to the end""
Nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool
Now I won't apologize for it
This is not a bunch of Bradys
But a bunch of black man's pride
Yet I can safely say
I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside
I've always walked the right side of the road
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs
But a man with a plan
And if I was a rug cleaner
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am

The Plug Two brand with the flavour
In the flute watch the sniffin'
So a sack of shows in demand
I read the diction from the second page
I got the one-two gauge
Baritone to the izm fan
Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink
So let me need ya to my ems go
I push the infinite and carry it
My carrier's the three over one
So my pluggins already know
Lick shots with moo
Catch the boo
From a ghost in the heckling crowd
If I give a foot
Jack Ville caught a spill
When a still came from my mouth
I brought a head down south
I don't check for the noose and the neck
So I never tell my ems
That finesse is knocking at my door
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun
And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore
I bring the element H with the 2
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade
It's just mind over matter
And what matters is
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade
I keep the walking on the right side
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong
Cuz that's how he wants to be
No difference, see
I wanna be like the name of this song I am

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
The deeds of a natural
Are seeds that are no longer planted
So the famine in the mind is strong
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane
Sane enough to let you know from within this song
I stabilize many cableized viewers
So my occupation's known
But not why I occupy
And that is to bring the peace
Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-i-am-i-be-lyrics
Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa,De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,"""If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions""

This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad

Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot""
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self

Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?""
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-millie-pulled-a-pistol-on-santa-lyrics

If money makes a man strange -- we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go round
If love is against the law -- listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin down

Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh
But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name
I guess love ain't nuttin but emotion and game
It's a lesson well learned so praise is well due
I'm sendin off from Big I, to Kenny Calhoun
And add a reservation for the resident crew
And yo get your bowl cuz we cookin up stew
See them Cubans don't care what y'all niggas do
Colombians ain't never ran with your crew
Why you acting all spicy and sheisty
The only Italians you knew was icees, niggas price me
I'm keepin it clean, like a washing machine
And yo, get your locomotion running to full-steam

Now here's the lead, y'all niggas pray to hot rods and not God
While Versace play you bitches like Yahtzee
Crackin jokes like you Potsie
(When's the last time you had Happy Days?)
Blazin up your herb to escape the maze, but the problem stays
Think big get it big is my motto
You can go and play your lotto, I'll be singin like baby won't you be mine
You'll be pressin rewind, you can never see mine
Keep your eyes focused, you can't touch this or quote this
Style is crazy bogus so you can't try to approach this
Stomp you out like roaches, pullin on my coattail
Like some horses pullin coaches, WHOA your roller coasters
It's hotter than the temperature that's cookin in your toasters
While the heat'll put you deep into hypnosis

Royalty Capes,and the Anonymous Nobody...,2016.0,"It's the flies
They are so annoying
(Shut up you fool, she's here)
Ladies and gents
Crystal carrying pixie peasants and warriors
Elders, ancestors, sons and daughters
Lion hearted kings and everything in between
Take a seat, be witness

You consider 'em king, about to icing on cakes
Chariots cruise at tortoise speeds
Lay your bifocals on royalty
Longer than Sears catalogue
Stern like matadors and (factual, actual) LPs
Mirror the crimson tide
The color of the Rubics
Them duplex views got your nose up
But coozy up to this warmth though
That long term froze is up
The jawn is up
I get swallowed by the barracuda
Androids read raps off iPhones
I choke the blood out of felt tips
Heavy weights up to the front if the belt fits
The wealth is like ivory toothpicks
One out of each tusk
And must gets bust for each and every hiccup
Salute life when dawn breaks
Fawn colored faux mink lapels on these royalty capes
I repeat, salute life when dawn breaks
Fawn colored faux mink lapels around royalty capes
Royalty

Behold this divine alignment scrolled secretly in cloud formations
Waterfall rhythms from crowns containing galaxies
Gems from past dimensions
A bond so strong it has unbreakable status
Spits hieroglyphic scripture like a god from Atlantis
(Atlantis,  Atlantis)

Us three be the omega like fish oil
This royal right we own, no rentals
Owners of the cape express
He went fresh from the mind, you ate off the plate of fundamentals
Knocked on every door of the country's red rugs
We'll lay on floors
We walk and etched in like testament
And find the atomic number 79
On Vernon's periodic table we dine upon
Sittin' on thrones gettin' blown to bits
By our royal dime, fillet of fine dinin'
News from the east sire
Them east coast kings are still findin' ways to stay on
On for play on like a damn disease
Spread the word of Ramses and fry up a pan of these
Salute dawn when day breaks
And give me my checks with the same first name as my cape
I repeat salute dawn when day breaks
And give me my checks with the same first name as the capes
Royalty

We are an army of stars unleashed
The sky takes notes when we speak
Our capes move with the wind
Because of the wings beneath
This is royalty
The sky takes notes when we speak
Our capes move with the wind
Because of the wings beneath
This is royalty

Time today or within the next couple of days
If, if, you're in the studio.. or if you're at home.. or car, whatever
That song.. that.. it's called trying or something, Mase
Was tellin me that I needed to hear?
He said it was amazing
Whoo.. the way he was talkin.. man I wanna hear it!

Am I just another lost in the pack?
We Horshack shit, you know, laugh it off
Years just blow by
My eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus
I cry a lot but admit to it
Enjoyin life now but I've been through it
Sometimes I wish that I can go back
No bills no kids just getting tore back
I want a wife, I love women
How could I front like I don't be in love wit em?
A li'l man that I can teach
A li'l sand but not the beach
I figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin
So when I'm gone, make sure the head stone reads, ""He did it for us""
I'm like your modern day Jesus
I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose
And float soft kisses to my baby

Yeah, respect her for that

I'm tryin to pop a hole in your Yankee cap
Absorb me
The skies over your head ain't safe no more
And Hip Hop ain't your home
And if it is then you fuckin up the crib son
You make life look like I don't wanna live one

Throughout my change to grow, Some of my people got left behind
They didn't listen for the gun, as I leaped from off the line
Thirteen years deep in this marathon I'm runnin
Paid dues and still got bills to pay
When I came back around the way
Old friends gave me dead eyes
And fake smiles, half wide
We were supposed to rid the world of danger
These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers
It's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree
I'll be there if they need me to be
And I know all my local shorties
Cuz they all know who I am
And latey wanna flip grammar instead of grams
Like that's the only choice they got
They tell me how they gonna shake up the game
But came to me to see if I could give em guidance for change
Shit y'all, I need guidance myself
And I chisel right words to make gems
Got fans around the world, but my girl's no one of em
And my relationship's a big question
Cuz my career's a clear hindrance to her progression
Said she needs a man and our kids need a father
I'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother
And break
And this I know I can't take
But uhh
C. Smith said to hold on
My brother Luck said to hold on
My nigga Dave said to hold on
My nigga Mase said to hold on
Yo, Maseo, we need to hold on
Eh, yo, y'all we need to hold on

 People are you ready?
 Yes we're ready!
Well, what you wanna be?
We wanna be ready!
Do you wanna lose hate for love?
Yes!
Do you wanna see these gates above?
Yes!
I said people are you ready?
Yes we're ready!
But are you willing to try?
We wanna try harder!
Do you really wanna carry some weight?
Yes!
Are you ready to design your fate?

All I is is man, and once an embryo
Am I solid gold? I don't cast a glow

Yes, I guess it's reflex some have no control
I'd rather let a laughter and tally, off I go
Canoeing up the river or out into the O
You just know me not so not play the role
Some are lovey-Dovey, ah you crazies know
Some shake your hand but (this is called the show)
I was John Doe, now I'm Mr. Jolicoeur
Pissed with the witness, and now I adore
O's got the world cause O's was on tour
Girls gave the O's, and guys, oh for sure
Were they arose, well nobody knows
What do they mean, well here's how it goes
Oh shoot's got the O's when you hold the dough
You know who you are but they didn't know
And now with respect they flex like a pro
You're first another nigga but now an Afro

Breathe in the fresh as the stale hit the road
Girls ask for flicks and I'll plot the pose
Eat the Al Greens, won't sniff the Kurt Blows
Mase got something to say and it goes

I'll give a shout out to Quest and my fellow Jungle Bros

Knocked by the dock of the bay by the shore
Swimming in the rhythm of the hi-de-hi-de-ho
Punk Pinocchios gotta go, gotta go
(What's the reason?) to be cheerful
Season is breeze, time to pimp promote
Nuts can no flow if the shade is in the dough
On with me hat, d-d-duh-duh-doh
Dreadlock is heading out the door y'all

We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling O's and O's
We're selling O's at the corner store y'all
We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling oodles and oodles and oodles
And oodles of O's, y'all
We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling O's and O's
We're selling O's at the corner store y'all
We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling oodles and oodles and oodles
And oodles of O's, y'all",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-oodles-of-os-lyrics
Fallin’,Judgment Night (Music From the Motion Picture) ,1993.0,"Oooohh ....Travelling at the speed of love
Do do da-doo

Hey yo kids, (whats up?)
Remember when I used to be dope, (yeah!)
I owned a pocket full of fame
(But look what you're doing now), I know, Well I know
I lost touch with reality, now my personality
Is an unwanted commodity (believe it)
Can't believe I used to be Mr Steve Austin on the mic
(Six million ways) I used to run it
I guess Oscar Goldman got mad
Cause I got loose circuits (so loose, so loose)
I be the mother goose with the eggs that seemed to be
Fallin
 Fallin Fallin
You played yourself
 (x4)

Hey yo pack my bags cause I'm out of here
Momma don't love me and my momma don't care
Read the papers, the headlines say
Washed-Up Rapper Got a Song (Wawkah!)
Lingo's busting while the guitar sways
B-Side copy for the radio plays for something
I knew I blew the whole fandango
When the drum programmer wore a Kangol
Never could be like baked fish won't bite bait
Realize that I'm over like clover
No good lucking so Mase keep the 
fucking beat
While the teenage fans the heat
I bring it to the blues, I pay all my dues
So what's gone's dead, let me use my forehead
Easy pack it up man, let me stop stalling
Cause everything I do is like falling

Bitties in the BK Lounge,De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,"Yo man let me make some Cap'n Crunch
Man alright
Yo man we have any milk?
Yeah, what time is it?
I don't know, what day is it?
Don't know, well I'll tell you
Well it was a Wednesday
Me and Boss Hog was kinda hungry
Like two eggs, and a sloppy slice of lettuce
And a glass of milk and some cookies
Spotted in the midst was a BK logo
What we said - well what do you know
This chick thought I was trying to play fly
Cause I had a pair of blue jeans on
Young girl, won't you take my order?
She said, ""Yeah, but right now I'm sorta busy...
So don't you see I'm trying to put this band aid on my finger?""
Lingering, I could tell
She's a B-K mademoiselle
Wrinkled uniform and bottom bell
And some Jelly stuff on her sleeve
Look to this cause I had no name tag on my collar
Could be pissed cause she's clocking 2.45 an hour
And then Boss Hog holler
""Girl you better make this quick!""
She said, ""I ain't your girl and I ain't your chick!""
I had an idea of lickity split
Took my hat off and that was it
Dreadlocks falling all over me and then I said
""Yeah now we'll see!""
And o' with quick velocity honey was mesmerized
""Ain't you that guy?""
""Ain't you that girl!""
""De La Soul, right?""
""No Tracy Chapman!""
""Why don't you come over to the counter and write me out an autograph?""
Ha ha ha, I had to laugh
She was quick with the Bic just to get that autograph
But me and Hogg just laughed, and laughed
""What's the name of that song you sing?""
""Living in a fast car"", I said
Forget about the order I made
I'll go get a slice of pizza instead

You're as booty as they come 
And you dress like a geek
My shoes cost more than you make in two weeks
Posdnuos: Look, you don't have to play fly in here (I'm not trying to play fly...)
Yo, I can tell you're fly by the weave that you wear! 
But you must be aware that a fly can be swatted by a BK tray

Posdnuos: Speaking of fat, would you like a diet soda? ('Scuse me?)
Cause less fat on you would spare us all the odor
Or better yet pour it down your pants and let the acid kill
The smell that should have been left to Massengill (Mistakin' me for your mother?)
Let me make you a deal, take the soda free and jet
I got too much family to heed your threats
Shushawna: Are you a family man? 
Well I shouldn't be surprised
Since your sister's flipping burgers and your mother's frying fries
(Don't even try that sh--!)
Shushawna: Oh damn look! 
Here comes one more
It's your father he just finished mopping the floor (Yeah right)
Now give them a hand, its the BK clan
So you can't talk garbage about who I am
Posdnuos: Well... (Well what?)  aren't we living foul? (Yes we are)
Speaking of foul how bout some chicken for the cow? (Your motha)
Oops I meant you, sorry for the mix up
But your stomach's always big due to sexual slip ups! (That's your sista)
Shushawna: I could buy you and sell you for pennies, young man!

I think there's something you should understand
I try to be nice and help the poor make money
And since I know you need it, I'll go elsewhere dummy! (Yeah, OK)

Say No Go,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon
In the delivery room
It would've asked the nurse for a hit
The reason for this?
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me, Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new life
What a way, but this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
'Cause second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it then even talk to it and say
(You got the body now you want my soul)
Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase...

Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go

Nah, no my brother, no my sister
Try to get hip to this
Word, word to the mother
I'll tell the truth so bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like Pleather
You don't wanna wear it
No need to ask that question, just don't mention
You know what the answer is...

Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade

Did he take any heed?

Nah, the boy was hooked, you could've phrased the word ""Base""
And the kid just shook
In his fashion class once an A now an F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes made for Oshkosh
Has converted to nothing but stonewash

Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down, son
Cause that could mean down and out as an action
What does it lead to?
Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb
People say what have I done for all my years
My tears show my hard-earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
Cause a pusher's a jerk

Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go

Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more than charity
But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity
Is it a chant that slants the soul to fill for it?
I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it

Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all, tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should have been no

Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More
(It's the joint!)
Rewind that back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch how the zombies scream ""it's the crack""
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claims shop over every park

Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Don't even think about it
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go
Say no go",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-say-no-go-lyrics
Potholes in My Lawn,3 Feet High and Rising,1989,"(Yo, something's wrong here. No, not again!)
(Get the daisies for the...)
Potholes in my lawn

Everybody's sayin'
What to do when suckin' lunatics start diggin' and chewin'
They don't know that the Soul don't go for that
Potholes in my lawn
And that goes for my rhyme sheet
Which I concentrated so hard on, see
I don't ask for maximum security
But my dwellin' is swellin'
It nipped my bud when I happened to fall
Into a spot
Where no ink or an ink-blot
Was on a scroll
I just wrote me a new 
mot
But now it's gone
There's no
Suckers knew that I hate
To recognize that every time I'm writin'
It's gone

(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-a)
(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-ee-hee-hee-hee)
Potholes in my lawn

I've found that it's not wise
To leave my garden untended
Cause eyes have now pardoned all laws of privacy
Even paws are after my writer
See, I've found that everyone's sayin'
What to do when suckers are preyin'
On my well-guarded spreadsheets
Oh why, hell does it send up fleets
Of evil-doers through the big hole
To get to evil-doers who dig holes
Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew
I think I'd better plant traces to give clues
Or better yet call 911
And when they get here I inform them I'm the Plug One
Open a chair and let them realize the reason
For concern of the Soul
Cause we've come down with a case of potholes

(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-a)
(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-ee-hee-hee-hee)
Potholes in my lawn

(Who stole, who stole, who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?)

Now you got the method
What to do when you die
The death that I predict in 'Plug Tunin'
It's a shame that you deny to claim
That you stole my words of fame
That I wrote in my rhyme sheet
Which I concentrated so hard on, see
I don't ask for a barbed wire fence, B
But my dwellin' is swellin'
It nipped my bud when I happened to fall
Into a spot
Where no ink or an ink-blot
Was on a scroll
I just wrote me a new 
mot
But now it's gone 'cause those
Suckers knew that I hate
To recognize that every time I'm writin'
It's gone

No doubt, y'all care anymore, about this hip-hop man?
I mean, how far will you punk motherfuckers go
For 15 seconds of fame? Microwave popcorn-ass niggas
Yeah, we give you much more, longevity baby
Aiyyo Dave

Yo! It's been instilled in me since infinite y'all
Usin' these minutes like I value the call
Put your money in the bank, and hold rank
Over friends who ain't got leadership skills
I got the sheep in my eyes so I can't sleep
We like the, land and laid, the brand old way
Grand operate the scandal way, L.I. sheist
I play the X-Box instead of fuckin' with dice
I hate losin' to those who walk away with my dough
Cause I goes, crazy broke man
And now she wanna see the resident provokin' me
To pop wheelies on my bicycle, watch her eyes twinkle
One house, two houses, third house
House rules so house take bank, watch Dave bank
Banner had 'em on the hawk since Atlanta extravaganza
Gamma ray rap I make the Hulk snap
Jump back like James Brown, hey now
When the liquor over we smokin the hay now
Delegatin' numero dos, I holla out the sound of los
And keep the Island close to me

Much more is what we got in store
Just believe me
""And what we have is much more than they can see""
Much more than they can see
Is how it'll always be, believe me (gotta believe)
""And what we have is much more than they can see""

I got verb skills, babies and bills, brothers who smoke krills
And still tryin' to get himself together from it
Knowin' he can't quite run it like me
I'm on the cutting edge of what's alleged to be, hot
And when you rock, it's just impersonations of me
The rightest MC, MP with the V in the middle
I belittle your plan, courtesy, of NY dirty C my man
My base of fans are made up of many; with kids allergic
To belts lettin' they mind melt from drinkin' the Henny
And them straight and narrow types who be waitin' to hear
Them drums say the revolution is near - are you listening?
Are your eardrums open for christening?
We God Body MC's with these tools
While some others play God, they just God damn fools with it
I don't cuff mics, I rough mics up rough and rugged
Yet the girls still love it
Still and all five-oh came to my mic check
Tellin me I left lacerations around my mic's neck
Domestically disputed and you just might get
The undisputed underdog servin' y'all threat

The Grind Date,The Grind Date,2004.0,"If the meek shall inherit the earth
And not the weak
Let me inherit the street, fuck it
You know what I mean?
I mean I love life man, you know what I mean
Life is beautiful, it's just the shit in it that's fucked up
It's rough but it's fair
People gotta go out there and bust they, bust they ass for a job
I mean, my dad's got five kids, man and I mean yo
He hates drivin' a bus but he loves five kids
You feel me?
:
I'm a rhyme artist
Out here tryin' to grind my hardest
Up early so to milk the cow
Keep my john deere out here plowin' the fields
To keep my John Hancock's worth up in the now
Went from hangin' on blocks to hangin' on charts
Positions is parta my mission to hangin' on top
Gotta get your polly cracker or with them crackers
And them scheisty ass niggas if you like it or not
I've been rewired to work more efficiently in the dirt
I'm hands on with it all up in my cuticles
Some try to get off the farm but fell into harm
Of gettin in the game of those street pharmaceuticals
But, I was raised in those blue collar themes
Havin' white collar dreams cause I see what it means
And though the meek shall inherit the earth but don't forget
The poor are the ones who inherit the debt
You can bet I got better things to do than that
I was a dick who got jerked by Tom and his boys
Came on my land, seized my cattle, and catalog
As if it wouldn't leave me less than coy
But I'm far from bitter even farther from quittin'
Got a grind date to make, no time for sittin'
And playin' xbox, stand up and exercise my rights
As of by seen of through masta's eye

It's the grind date
Know what I'm sayin? I'm sick of askin' that
I mean, the street philosophy is that
I'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat
The grind date
At least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink
Because sometimes you can't come back
Like momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3
Ask for 10, that's for sure

Yo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that
I was born with the boom bap, respect the name
My hands on experience was hands on my first contract
Taught me quick how to respect the game
Introduced to the block, got used to the block
But your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn
It's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed
But we got ahead, and we got along
And puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars
Worth of hump days that broke the camel's back
The grind'll make today look gray
And paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black
Meet the rhyme, street grind, son whatever the beast
I'm a take it at the horns till the pinky toe torn
And show you why we here this long
Cause when it comes to puttin' in work
Once again it's on

I'm just like everybody else man
An average nigga with above average potential
You know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman
I'm sayin that I know how to act like a gentleman
In order to get the things that I need
And if I gotta pull out my nickle bag, I'm gonna do that
This ain't no accident, we stayin' here
You damn right I am proud of myself man
And I'm proud of my team man
I don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real?
I don't have sex with people that I do business with neither
And that's the real
But I do do business with people that I have sex with
So if there ain't no conflict, let's get this grind on
Cause I'm gonna fuck the shit outta you, that's word",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-the-grind-date-lyrics
Tread Water,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"I was walking on the water when I saw a crocodile
He had daisies in his hat, so I stopped him for a while
He delivered me a message, a massage to soothe my stage
What it was was more then plug-up dosage
More than DAISY age
Conversation drew a rule
Which the crowd will roar by millions
Mr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look
For now the villains try to hold you underwater
But one thing we all must heed
Sony Walkmans keep us walking
De La Soul can help you breathe when you tread water'
As I walked along my journey
I thought 'What have I just learned?'
In a flash I saw commotion
There was movement in these ferns
Silently the silence came, was it the end of my world?
I shouted out in fear, 'Who's there?'
'It's me,' said Mr. Squirrel
'I've searched for you all over, now you're found
No time to waste. We must find the Preacher Man
We must find the P.A. Mase. All my population's dying
And we're all in tune to doom
Like the Daisy, I need water
I need chesnuts to consume.'
'Mr. Squirrel,' I said, 'I'm sorry
But the problem can't be solved
If there's no one here to help, and no one to get involved
Always look to the positive and never drop your head
For the water will engulf us if we do not dare to tread
So let's tread water'

Now one weary day I woke, my alarm said 'Plug time's up'
Filled my bath up with the water, gargled with my gargle cup
As I bathed I felt a presence, and I'm sort of ticklish
I looked down and then around and I heard
'Hi! I'm Mr Fish. How do you do? As for me
I'm in tip-top shape today, cause my water's clean
And no-one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet
See I look past all my worries, which is something you must do
Though you're fed up, throw your head up
With this advice from me to you
And that's to tread water'
As my day went unexplained, time was finding nothing fun
As I walked along the sidewalk, I heard
'Psst, excuse me, Plug One.'
From my Soul, De La that is, I hollered
'Yes, are you talking to me?'
'No alarm meant,' he said, 'Let me introduce myself
I'm Mr Monkey.'
'Mr Monkey, I pledge you slap of five
Now how does your problem meet?'
He said, 'My bananas are at their ripest, but they all
Stand at three feet. My swinging hand is bandaged up
Could you help me with this chore?'
I brought him down to the Native shop
And bought him copies of the De La score
Which assisted well in his elevation
Now all bananas is at his grasp
He decided with this accomplished
He would put me on to the path
He told me to live by the Inner Sound, y'all
Which would bring me health in showbiz
Then to use them, not abuse them
And then in the words that got me to 'em
And that is to tread water",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-tread-water-lyrics
Ghetto Thang,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"[Verse 1: Posdnuos + 
Trugoy the Dove
]
(Mary had a little lamb)
That's a fib—she had two twins, though
 and one crib
Now she's only fourteen, what a start
But this defect is ground common in these parts
Now life in this world can be such a bitch
And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch
Negative's the attitude that runs the show
When the stage is the G-H-E-T-T-O
Which is the one to blame when bullets blow
Either Peter, Jane, or John or Joe
But Joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk
And Peter's pimping Jane, and John's a punk
Infested are the halls, also the brains
Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains
Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown
The kids are all alone
'Cause it's just the ghetto thang

""It's just the ghetto thang"" (""Word"")
""It's just the ghetto thang"" (""Word"")
[Verse 2: Posdnuos + 
Trugoy the Dove
]
Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule
This title is sought by the coolest fool
Define coolest fool? Easy, the one who needs
Attention in the largest span and loves to lead
Always found at the jams, but never dance
Just provoke violence due to one glance
The future plays no matter, just the present flow
When the greeting place is the G-H-E-T-T-O
Lies are pointed strong into your skull
Deep within your brain against the wall
To hide or just erase the glowing note
Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat
Truth from Trugoy's mouth is here to scar
Those who blame the G for all bizarre
So open up your vents and record well
For this is where we stand, for the true tell
Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways
Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play
If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range
Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change
Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact
They lie like ghettos form, cause people lack
To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold
The truth they never told
Cause it's just the ghetto thang

""It's just the ghetto thang"" (""Word"")
""It's just the ghetto thang"" (""Word"")

Do people really wish when they blow
Out the cake candles, and if so
Is it for the sunken truth which could arise
From out the characters in which the ghetto hides
Roses in the ring supply their shown relief
Granted it's planted by their shown belief
Kill and feed off your own brother man
Has quickly been adopted as the master plan
Posses of our people has yet to provoke
Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke
What causes this defect, I don't know
Maybe it's the G-H-E-T-T-O

When problems hold more value, but never dealt
With buildings crumbling to the ground
Impact noise is solid sound
But who's the one to say this life is wrong
When ghetto life is chosen strong
We seem to be misled about our dreams
But dreams ain't what it seems
When it's just the ghetto thang

Q-Tip
]
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany, mean
Oh, you gotta do that again, Dove
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (OK)
Hello, it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who I call my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, on a roll
Black medallions, no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos, hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now drop the beat, for the Phifer from A Tribe Called Quest
When I see Buddy, I will never half step
I just do her Tribal style and then jet
The Buddy that I like is to be sexy and nice
Just good enough for the one they call Phife
A brown skin Buddy with shoulder length hair
Nice firm breasts and a round derrierre

Now for the next, I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And if you quest for the Buddy, don't fess
If your jimmy wants nothing but the best (the best)
The best (Ooh Wee!)
Let's stick out the jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick 'em up, stick 'em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

Dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage, you scream for more
Native Tongues got rhymes galore

Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me

Fly buddy (buddy) don't you know you make me go nutty (nutty)
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy (duddy)
Not too skinny and not too chubby (chubby)
Soft like silly putty
Miss Crabtree (Crabtree), I know that you're not mad at me (at me)
Cuz I told you that it was your buddy (buddy)
That was making me ever so horny (horny)
Junglelistically horny

I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny, I seem (very serious)
Like a peek freen
Buddy is an act that occurs on the lift
When Jimmy and Jenny start shootin the gift
Boy let me get shot, I won't even riff

On the dial, my Buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the {Q to her Tip}
On the A-side or sometimes the flip (word up)
Buddy, is the bud to my daisy tree (uh huh)
And the luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug Three
(Plug Three gets the whole caboodle)

Behind the bush, my Buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ, just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Well let loose the juice)
My Buddy helps me to (De La my Soul)
Keepin Jimmy in total control
Without Buddy, I'd be on a roll

Now as the lady
I thought that Jungle and Quest and Soul would just maybe
Give me the chance to say that I get crazy
Due to the fact I let Buddy amaze me
As a matter of fact, it crazes me in many ways
I decided that it was time for Monie Love to say
That when it comes to the B, you know that I don't play
'Cause to me chasin Buddy is the perfect way (perfect way)
To spend the day (to spend the day)

Oooh child, things are gettin a little easier
Oooh Buddy gets easier (yeah)
Oooh child, things are gettin a little easier
Oooh Buddy gets easier

Girl, I heard you're lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, guess what we'll find
Whole lotta fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (Yeah, that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my Buddy, I will toast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille McGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your Buddy

The best Buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee?)
Word to the D
I don't beg, I just tease my Buddy with my right leg (ha-ha)
And then when it's ready what's said
Is Buddy is best in bed (Word to the D)

Buddy buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't bug because I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you
(You know what? She freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my Swatch to see the time
The Tribe had formed a Buddy line
And that Buddy was mine, all mine

Now when Quest, Jungle and De La Soul
Is at the clubs, our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' in everywhere)
'Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware?
(Mmm, Hmm...yeah!!!)

J-I-M, B-R-O, W-S-K-I
And the girl was next to me
In order to make his cave girl smile
He had to improve his whistle's style
Here he comes now
Jim Browski
It's very stimulating
Oh the dic-dic-dictionary, is very necessary
Ooh I don't know what to do about this Buddy stuff man
It driving me crazy
Sing French to me baby
Oh my god, what is that in your hand
Wait a minute what are you doing with that
Ay dio mios
Oh my goodness
There's something about these french men out here today
Buddy?
Let me tell you something
You can be my Buddy anytime",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-buddy-native-tongue-decision-lyrics

But then they all started talking
They were talking about love being gone
In my house
They said that there ain't much left to love
Well, there's always something to love if you're familiar enough to recognize it
I mean have you cried for anything lately?
And I don't mean for your friends or your bills or yourself
I mean for this!
When do you think it's time to love something the most, child?
When it's successful and done made everything easy for us, huh? Psh!
Uh-uh, that ain't the time at all
It's when it's reached its lowest and you don't believe in it anymore
And the world done kicked it and its tail enough that it's lost itself!

Always tryin to sham too that's why they crave champagne

Good luck guys

Mase is ready!
Yo y'all ready
Yeah they ready
We bout to burn this shit down

Yo, there's a fire in the kitchen, it's like nine cooks
The Kool-Aid got spiked with porcupines, look
Rode into Rigo, this ain't a fast track
Your tickets ain't straight, TSA your ass back
NASDAQ, IBM, the big honcho on the block
Bitch, I be him
The rock mega death, we gonna kill the Kane
Fuck everyone, bitch, bring everything
Swing like a mandolin, this ain't a sex toy
This ain't spanish fly, this hot shit
Push the dagger in the devil's eye
Slick Rick, yo, get the big dick, yo
Blow the dust covers, pick the age on it
A nose full, sniff a Rose Bowl full
New game, new players, new year
The hardest rock shit you gon' hear

You can save your soul
If we are no more
Suffer the consequences
We are the way the Lord intended

Her ass, she got it from her momma
Tits from the doctor
Fingers fiddelin' the puss
She looks like an Octa
Fresh off the pole, hanging from her hook
I'm in her Grassy Knoll to hit
Just to say that I cocked her (click, click)
My hardware is progressive
My sex crime language is leaning on obsessive
The Lord looking down, judging, the room needs smudging
But I'm over your stars screaming ""the moon ain't budging""
Ain't from Hollis, don't need to tell you who is
But who in here raisin' hell? They be like ""you, kid""
I’m ambidextrous, liken to Dexter
Murderous lyrical blood splatter over the texture
We live by that code, not to regret living
Electric guitar sparks and ignites gun powder
A sabbath ain't black enough to call my bluff, bitch
The kill switch just turns it louder

You can save your soul
If we are no more
Suffer the consequences
We are the way the Lord intended

Fuck everyone
Burn everything
Leaving an impression, not just a dented legacy
Fuck everyone
Burn everything you see
Not just clinging to the planet
Powerless to avoid the cataclysmic impact of a massive asteroid
(Fuck everyone, burn everything)
Fuck everyone, burn everything
Never to surrender to the cosmic schadenfreude
Of only meeting your creator on the day you are destroyed
(Fuck everyone, burn everything)
Just as the Lord intended
(Just as the Lord intended)

You've got so many different types

Knowing how to cook a good twenty-two pound ham
Whooty-who
Nothing like a tall six-foot-five woman
For a short man like me

She'll be swinging on chandeliers
Baby got that skin
I can handle years
And I won't mind if she fucks asleep
Her mouth game is like Rap-A-Lot
Her Facebook say that she aim at this rap a lot
Online surfing for them beach boys
To bring the sand under her feet boys
She my rock bottom like last offers
Wouldn't write me off like the last offer
Even though she a bomb scare
I'm standing right here

The bedding's over the mattress we lay with the actress
For social media to swallow us
Watch them rap peers who don't reply back
'Cause they think we gonna snatch up their Twitter followers
That's some female type foolery
And your females like glue to it
She know it, the scent of a poet
Police buy restraint to cover all the angles
The opera of operations
Scene One got you and your crew all confident with courage
We'll be there, jump in your square, wreck it
You be like ""Check it, they stretched the shit into rectangles, damn!""

Dance, freak, get out your seat
Show me that you is a real whoodeeni
Get loose y'all, work it out now
Everybody, everybody get down
Whoodeeni, whoodeeni, whoodeeni

Born institutionalized
My homie from N.O. found his crib with the roof on the side
FEMA asking for an address, but ain't no mailbox
Nothing left to do out here but to sell rocks
Now they got cellphones inside of the cell blocks
And my cousin on parole 'cause he sold Glocks
My cousin that sold stock
Told you we have more soul than James Brown
Wearing a gold watch that obviously don't work
Used to go home and rob niggas for homework
See if the chrome work
Might call your girl to see if my phone work
I'm a hood star and the trophy's a gold vert
Mouth full of gold teeth
Niggas might end up obsolete if I'm four deep
Real nigga for real bed full of new sheets
Bedroom floor filled up with the loose leafs
This is a war zone, me and a two-piece
Put another head on and make it a new piece
She be like ""ooh wee"", I be like ""ooh wee""
I love myself so much I'm a groupie
Everybody know my verses is Pookie
Had 'em all strung out like it's a drug house
When I'm in the booth I'm MJ with his tongue out
When I'm in the booth I'm Kanye with a gun out
Run in your mom house
Then I'mma lean sideways and burn out
All natural, I hope you got the perm out
I've been straightening that shit
New niggas came and tried to hate on that shit
I'mma use it now, I ain't waiting on shit

Dance, freak, get out your seat
Show me that you is a real whoodeeni
Get loose y'all, work it out now
Everybody, everybody get down
Whoodeeni, whoodeeni, whoodeeni

Yo, big drawers, where the big drawers at?
I got a case of the little head controlling the big head thinking
Played Honest Abe in the back of a Lincoln
Chopped down a cherry, American Pie varied
Next day she was on my Snapchat sexting
Had her bunny hopping a quick ten seconds
Dear Lord, forgive a nigga, I've been down with doubt
Had the frog legs, now I'mma knock this piggie out
Now Dave like to cuddle, but Dave don't play that
Like Dave had the ring, listen, Dave ain't say that
Courtships to door steps for gettin' ass
And if it's one of my broads, keep your feet off the grass
Size eleven the gas
Mash that potato 'til we lay in the grass
She mellow like it's a picnic
If she the mermaid, give her the fish stick
First class flight, shoot her out to the district
Wait, cancel the stallion, hold your horses
Kickstart your life and cut your losses
Look how we did 'em, ma, your boy still got it
I quit drinking, I quit the narcotics
Life's a bitch, but she seeing a therapist
This hip-hop done really took care of us, huh
We got stoops and Van der Rohes to sit on
Bitcoins, 
Vivian Maiers to bid on
But we cautious
Never undermine the hate and turn the spell on your evil forces
But this ain't the cha-cha two-step
Been a rider ever since the Schwinn gooseneck
The buck stops here, ain't no 'who's next'

Dance, freak, get out your seat
Show me that you is a real whoodeeni
Get loose y'all, work it out now
Everybody, everybody get down

Yo, a slow burn we are
Last long three-man act to wake up your thermostat
Blind through the property line
Creative minds crossover and back
Scribble with a knife to earn that slice of life
Cock back, aim, shot the name wherever the price is right
The pain earned is the pain learned, and heads talking like Byrne
Connect (to the same as it ever was)
Respect the land cause it never floods and well irrigated
Looking for my vanity, it's there, the mirror hate it
And stated, stop being an MC and give your verses more weight
By being just M-E, thoughts are oxidized when I spit em out
And my lungs prefer tastes, encrypted words laced to get them out home
With removal service to get kings out the throne
(More hands on) With hands upon the neck
Of a voice magnifier over decks
The sound is found at the youngs in the batch
Lovely how I let my mind float
You can catch me in the early morning
Find me up with no yawning
Haven't been asleep, I'm on cue
8 in the corner pocket from the booth all 24 hours like it was our debut
Life edited my etiquette
Dreams beyond your eons
You can't wait this out
Start blitz, starring it's that crew who never call the splits convey lines made from outer spines
So the nerve of us to be so damned crush
Grit like JDL and we sip from the grail
Where the current course connects, so we're not unsung
Just vets, this mission's undone

We getting loot in this, you new to this
We true in this
Baby you already know who it is
We been doing this
We been doing this
Been true to this since Yoo-Hoos and tunafish
Catch flights, hit the stewardess
We been doing this
We been doing this

Yo, it's a honor and a pleasure
Rappers is not try to see me like a diamond tester
I'm on the low, I'm like a silent investor
Well dressed, my suit and vest is never polyester (never)
Keep a shottie on the dresser
My queen look like a young pepper
Up in her plump compress her
My tongue is forever under the weather, however
My heart was still lighter than a feather
Culturally, snort em like coca leaf
Them niggas suck more - no teeth
On the low though in my Polo tee
The show cost money but the promo's free
My pen collection is interesting
No steel, but still niggas will feel threatened
My genetics is comedic
Driven in lanes I was looking angelic
Psychedelic, if niggas like it I can sell it
But I don't fuck with that sweet shit, I'm diabetic
This is rapping at its peak
Your bird's steady yapping at the beat
Of a parakeet
You're not unique, you're no Kool Keith
Shit is more parrot-y (parody)
To get with the illa rhyme distributor
A verse might run you a year's salary

We getting loot in this, you new to this

Yo, put that bread on all fours 
The Catcher in the Rye
New York City lights look better in July
4th, no fireworks will dangle in the sky
Like right there, feeling the night air
Promoting the fair fight
Square dance, men at the faceoff
Crooked eye letters from 
Madoff apologizing
Long journeys walking cold hard facts
Once you turn up there, there's no turning back
From 
Rock Co.Kane Flows to flows that are crack
In the hemline, versus on the land muddied your man
The hard work you threw on the scale, damn
I'm Joe Pesci on the Dish, so messy on the disk
Puerto Rican mamis call me ""flapi""
Leap a tall feeling in a single bound
Way over your head like my ex-girl talking bout mind sex
(Well you're a dickhead)
Two ticks away from aww shit
Cause I'm an old fart
Go campaign DAISY Age
Dave fresh like a pound of sage
Decorate the paramount figures
Watch the way they crown the stage
Sipped Crown but I was down in age
See the sailor took a sip, saw the whole ship drowned in grey
Classmates couldn't find a page
Had the answers written in my palm ever since promise paid

Get Away,UnKnown,2013.0,"I want to give y'all a little announcement man
For the last year there's been a lot of music comin out
The shit been weak, knowhatI'msayin?
A lot of niggas trying to take hip-hop
And make that shit R&B, rap and bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin?
Or make that shit funk
Fuck that, this is MCin right here, this is hip-hop

And like the Wu we bring it to you in the purest form
We reside far away from the norms
Spawn from the big catch, big bang, big breaks
Fetch pads and pens, even with the pencil
Rap labels studied us, flooded us with stencil
That's tinseltown, murder your display
And we stay flying even with the terrorists' trying
This to that town, monitor the pat down
Searching for controlled substance with sustenance
We inventors of the drug, ever since
Day-glo covers, broke pots, green balloons
The black shirt saying stakes,
 elevated noon
AOI, grind, you hear it
Understand we steer it
Some choose to veer it off the course
The main source missing
You've paid no dues, you've earned no pension
Learn the rules! You can either be the pimp
Or the pimped out tools
Wack niggas need not forget!

Stop running up on niggas with
All that wack shit
(Word up man)
Talkin' bout you emcee
You ain't no emcee...

...Like me
I bake works of art
While labels worry 'bout artwork
Or top of the chart perks
You need to insert a lot more of that
Original tier, that you can't manage
Just causes damage so just go, get away from here!
You're fuckin' the game up
Too low to aim up so just go, get away from here!

And some'll believe that they're leaders
Young fella you're a two liter
Simply waterway drowning out the source
This lesson is aligned with an underground cause
So sharpen your paper mate, my number twos'll make the beacon shine
And you 
*sound effects*
The fine lining is detail, the garment is retail
But I don't buy rap or excuses
The code used to be an unspoken device
But since that's gone you see what rap produces
(Y'knahmsayin'?)
The one on one, two on twos
Assemble in the center of squares like statues
 (Word up!)
Understand I just do this I don't have to
(Y'knahmsayin' this is hip-hop right here!)
(Y'knahmsayin' this is lyrics!)
But you wouldn't know that feeling if it slapped you
Like new credit, the blood work's indebted
Microphone donor, two pints of get right
I got my cardio up my nigga
Don't give a damn about a party
I do it for the body
Upchuck your mandibles, the scrambler's back
Since the two inch tape how ample is that?
Like furry dice hanging off the mirror
Your position is concerning my vision
These objects seem to be closer than they appear
And they could never catch us their directions don't match up
Just go, get away from here!
You're jamming the lane up
Messing the game up
Just go, get away from here!",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-get-away-lyrics
Greyhounds,and the Anonymous Nobody...,2016.0,"Fresh from a bible belt town
That's what she's givin' up
Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a greyhound
That's what he think of her
Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm
Hides that he is a shark
Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home
That's what he wanna do
She just wanna new zip code for an old dream
Lost in an appetite now the Big Apple might
Find her habit of a queen
Filled her an ego that's filled with illegal maps
Road Destination unknown
She's Little Bo Peep
And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn
Now the wolf give a push
Now watch her jump in with two feet
Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs
Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her
Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines
Go fast with the fast life so she needs more
One fun fix, now a daily chore
Provide the score, written and produced so perverse
He's a pro well versed
Told her that the purse that she want
With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid
She can earn with speed in a day
Escort on the high class side
Champagne glass rides
White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies
When you're flyin', crash and burn
She learned that her soul was dyin'
That's worth savin'
She's cravin' that bible belt town
So she crawls back on the Greyhound

Next stop, NYC
Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face
I know how to get there
And I give you my word that I get you there safe
I don't need to check your baggage
I don't need to know your name
All I need to know is
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed

Fresh new Gucci belt, bound
Fast to the city scape
Dash to deliver fate
Stashed in this duffel bag, proud
It's no scaredy cat
Life's always spared him that hand
That the gamblers fold
No chips if the scramble got cold
But them warm cushions and them soft bus seats
Push that second thought along
Beneath the roof of a Super 8, he sleeps till it's night time
Then connects in the streets like a pipe line
In dark shades he supplies dark brigades
Of lost souls with his chemical morsels
He's no lab tech
He was born into a legacy stretched from Aztecs and beyond
Assets he was drawn to
Had him spinnin' the wool over his mother's eye
He's the black sheep
His pops career driven, he's the backseat
The man on the wheel that cruises on sunrise
That the man bought eyes to his pay per view
Kind of paper make a fool shoot his staple through
And tape a label to
Until he's can bait
Until a pancake pocket's change the landscape
Take a short visit home in the town
It's time to re-up, it's back on the Greyhound

Next stop, NYC
Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face
I know how to get there
And I give you my word that I get you there safe
I don't need to check your baggage
I don't need to know your name
All I need to know is
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed

By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed
Forever be changed, forever be changed
So watch where you're goin'
And this food you're chosin'
I don't need to check your baggage
I don't need to know your name
All I need to know is
By the time you arrive you'll forever be changed
Forever be changed, be changed
You'll forever be changed",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-greyhounds-lyrics

I missed the last
They say a better tomorrow is to sacrifice the calf
Keep that cow in the pasture, knife in the drawer
It's been a long 40 days, it's gonna take 40 more

Intro (Stakes is High),Stakes Is High,1996.0,"When I
First heard
Criminal Minded
I was in...
Damn, where was I?
Seventh grade
Battlin' this other emcee
Smokin' a blunt and drinkin' a 40 down lower east side with my niggas
I have no idea where I was, it was so long ago
I was on my way to a family reunion in a car on the Long Island Expressway when I heard it
Roosevelt...Projects
I was in...
I was outside of church when I was really little
And I was doing the Wop with this girl
Red Alert played one of the songs on the radio
It was so long ago
Yo merce, what's up, this is Hanson
Man, I want you to peep that out
Yo, kid... I was at this party
This hype party, when I heard
KRS' criminal minded. I'll call you back, peace
All right!
All right!
All right!
All right!

Channeling, in sync so my what brings that testament
To cover twelve inches of funk
Flip like as if I was the Dalek himself
Specializing in cleansing like the hits of Ella Fitz'
Dove hits Bibles out the park, man
Don't even try to toss bleach, I'm too dark and
Major more soul than James' ""Escapism""
De La Soul is here to stay like racism
Hatchet know and I'mma put the pillow off the bed
As I lurk up on your thoughts while phones on your head
Riff a tech pro, flex sue, running you the links
Scout weather, pouring rain outta duck's survive links
And if one winks for pink slips, the slips are short
Dull-minded as sperm, to give out for the souls I report
I sport too fly for the forty-ounce drinker
I sport too fly for a forty-ounce thinker
A fresh linen scent so sniffer on the two-inch
A talker of the verb without weed influence
So stick to you Naughty by Nature's and your Kane
'Cause graffiti that I based upon the wax is insane

Grand groove, I wish I had the flavor bid
Give me six bottles of beer, I take the seventh one free
I got the chandelier, kick, constructed by my man
Little elf, big four gets the zootie for the self
Long island living, what, twelve o'clock dawn
Jiggy-not see me so I trip straight to your porches
Mr. Partymaker puts the boogers in your bottle
Straw it and drink, what, bees gotta be's
'Cause I snort the crazy-crazies
Man, I kick the franken-style, dig the bolts in my neck
Wreck, ship, boat, rock
Heavy metal grooves ain't the infinite
Here I hips to the hops
I'm looking for the words in the faces of a prince
That brother been down ever since soaked cheese
And motor go smiling
Hey, how ya doin'
Now, meet in front of Big Lou's fighting
Hey, y'all reminisce, six streets, little miles
Straight to my avenue
(aaaah... aaaggh)
Six streets, went miles straight to my avenue
I'm headed for the bigger E, for the bitter OE, not me
Here's my Malibu, child, here's my Malibu
Buckshot honeys, dig a gun and go aaaahhhhh...",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-intro-stakes-is-high-lyrics

(LET IT FLOW!)

And yes y'all
You are about to bear witness
From the lands of Long Island
Takin' you to the sky's survival
I am your captain, Enola
On this endless joruney
To invisions, to broaden your outer visions
To where you never been before
It's just a one night trip to love
Sun shinin' forever, and forever sun shines

Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh
Be that crew from the five one six point of view
With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vagina
Them clits will turn into a diamond, the level of rhymin'
Pressure comes from lesser forms than me and my man
And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand
And there's money to be made cause cacaussians are paid
Only brothers who
Rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls
Plug 1, with them rhymes makin' your heart stall
Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls
It ain't nothin' but the thing wonder why can bring
As we come to the bring the pain everyone will sing

De La is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies

I'm on travellin' to places that the eye can't see
But kinder, cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon
Aiyo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard
And than God, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine

Down right to dirt, wonder why makes it work
With access to talent like caucasians to yellow cabs
With an Arab driver
I liven parties with marvelous confiction
Ain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be ??? some dried up Funds
Best believe that the life is strife
Cause the gun made a man outta pussys from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And L.I.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows
The anthem of ths guy has a place in yo' eye
So you can be blessed to see in 3d double-e",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-sunshine-lyrics

Realistically explicit in the things you say

Hey kid, what's the word?
Man, it's all about mind
Keeping focused on them self-mechanisms of rhyme
So no longer stand erect 'cause your thoughts are drained
Walkin' round, manifesting attributes of shame
Used to squabble for the mic but now accordingly
We act unless a club can't afford the fee
We act so name that any best man to put us under
Created from the ground yet know nothing 'bout the under
Take a glimpse at them pimps playing record exec
Adding up all your OHs so's to cut you a check
Saying why the blunder wonder could've G'd today
So you can put up some swings for your seed to play
But a swing ain't that important when the park's around the corner
Filled with life causing death, greeting victims for the morning
It was the moment I feared
Nah, the moment I steered upon the right path
To know the right math to overstand

It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)

A flavor you will savor in your soul
Wax is distributed and then sold
So watch it turn, bring your next of kin soul
P.A. Mase has rocked it on the console
Scream real hard until you blow your tonsils
Bang-oh-bang until you burn your shoe soles
Cause you are now dancing to the new soul

Live is the motion of the soul step
Set the exposure to my one step
This scene'll last to the next step
All those in favor take a big step
True to the Soul, we'll never back step
In sense to that, we don't half step
Just as a reminder from the last step
Negative ones are lost in footsteps

Levels we've set will never go down
Competitions commence the step down
Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down
Can see that the Soul has got a new sound
Dance until you find yourself a new part
If you don't then I'll give you the True part
When received you'll see the real small part
Of the new way is no part at all

Pos and Dove is rarely caught not dressed in peace
Movements always walking round now stressing peace
When this biter should know true in peace
Instead they cause violence and shoot out beef

Due to a clue of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm)
(Mmm-hmm, yeah)
Flowing in file with a new style
Barrels are cleaned and loaded for salute
Chanters with the choice standing steady like my mouth
This paragraph preacher is now introduced
Drums are heard sounding off on each and every person
Vocal confetti is blown at top stage
Roses and violets aren't proper for throwing
When showing appreciation, why? This is a Daisy Age
Hands won't sweat cause there's no threat
Mic will stay dry while pitchin' so loose
Rhymes aren't fables but stable to be on time
Cause they're marketed and labeled sticker 'Posdnuos'
This pitch will fit with every consumer
Microphone loosed in cycles, start blooming
Profit and cost could never be lost
All due to a clue of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm)
(Mmm-hmm, yeah)
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
DOVE:
Dazed at the sight of a method
Dive beneath the depth of a neverending verse
Gasping and swallowing every last letter
Vocalised liquid holds the quench of your thirst
Reasons for the rhythm is for causes unknown
Different individuals are dazzled with the showbiz
Auditions are gathered but the Soul would just rather
Hold a count at three and in the end leave it as it is
Flow to the sway of my do-re-mi
I'll fix lunatics who will hawk
Words are sent to the vents of humans
Then converted to a phrase called talk
Musical notes will send a new motto
Every last poem is recited at noon
Focus is set, let your polaroids click
As they capture the essence of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm)
(Mmm-hmm, yeah)
Vocal in doubt is an uplift
And real is the answer that I answer with
Dying yet live, what you must realize
That the tune that I present is surely not a gift
Different in style is definite
And style which I flaunt is sure legit
Now set aside, I say I hold pride
In performing this melodic misfit
So swing cause this pitcher is pitching
In sense JD Dove is now saying
All sing along to his favorite song
While the pocket transistors are playing
But least but not last I'm frightened
For the words that I reply hold doom
Life of the check can be stopped by accident
When you're tripping the wire of the Plug Tune
(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm)
(Mmm-hmm, yeah)
(No-one that I know can live my life for me)

Patti Dooke,Buhloone Mindstate,1993.0,"Why do we have to cross over?
Why are niggas always crossing over, huh?
I mean, what's the matter, huh?
They can accept our music as long as they can't see our faces?
One, two, one, two,  You got it
Wootah!

Runnin' through the trenches (What?)
Runnin' through the trenches (What?)
Runnin' through the trenches it's the Patti Dooke

Runnin' through the trenches (Oh!)
Runnin' through the trenches it's the Patti's Dooke

Just the other day I got a starter kit
(An M is a terrible thing to waste)
Caught the face from the backs of the border of the mindstate
I play control to a fraud
(Nah it ain't happenin')
Nada to make it even
Robbin' and theivin' is one who infiltrates with a Colgate frown
Y'all remember my nasal for I sniff frequencies
(Well, it started in the year of '78)
But it's '93 or should I say '94 for my style is much more
(I said, ""Come in"") Come in
(Come on) Come out into my reservoir
As I macks a men your bastard style has just been stuck
By a sticker with a 'frigerator lickin'
What if, how's about why would
Never thought that the napalm would bust your jeans

Mash it up
The one with the beard
Mega moustache the beat (hide it)
Deep under sheets, cover this hint
Hostin' all threats but watch out Mr. Jarbage
Jimmy and the jet, standin' on the pier
I'm known as the farmer
Cultivatin' mate without mendin'
Bendin', comprimising any of my styles to gain a smile
Listen while you hear it
There's no pink in my slip
I reckon that the rhythm and the blues in the rap got me red
While the boys from Tommy plant bridge crossin' to a larger community
Yet they're soon to see I have a brother named Luck
A nigga named Dres
A groupie named Cassandra caught bobbin' on the head
Of a Baby named Chris, I missed a kid who caught wreck when sayin'
(Afrika and I when Sammy B's on the set)

Runnin' through the trenches (What?)
Runnin' through the trenches (What?)
Runnin' through the trenches it's the Patti Dooke
(It's the Patti what?)
Runnin' through the trenches (Oh!)
Runnin' through the trenches it's the Patti's Dooke

Succeeed in crossing over)
(Cross over ain't nuthin' but a double cross)
(Once we lose our audience we never gon' get them back)
(He may even try to change our sound)

Let no man put asunder
Severin' the groups I never blunder
Cashin' all the checks on the mic
I might cherry to the bush, brand Plug One-der
Funk to the fame against hoods
Bridges saggin' to woods down under
They can't be raised with the feminine praise
In conjunction with no chocolate in the mix
White boy Roy cannot feel it
But the first to try and steal it
Dilute it, pollute it, kill it
I see him infiltratin' to the masses
And when the leechin' I mo shoot 'em all in they asses

Runnin' through the trenches (What?)
Runnin' through the trenches (Yeah?)
Runnin' through the trenches it's the Patti Dooke
(It's the Patti what?)
Runnin' through the trenches (Oh!)
Runnin' through the trenches it's the Patti's Dooke

I shed light and not skin
I ain't from Europe
Afro connects at the root of the retina of the third
Mums the word when ya blind baby
Blind to the fact
Don't rest in Compton so I don't own a gat
But respect is clear crystal
Cause Millie got a pistol
And she's down with me
Wild of most wild
Born child to the old school legitimate (soul)
Talker of the many paragraphs ago
Walker of the plenty broken calves ago
Phantom of the phrase black in many ways
Cause I see her runnin' through the trenches
Comin' in to rent my style
I'm not the one to fuck with
I'm lockin' you out
I'm just not to fuck wit so check it

Y'all know who I am
Listen up son
Peace to my man Premier
And y'all better guard your trenches cause we runnin' through 'em

And ain't no druggin', my credit's a gain
While you searchin for some trick to put the shit in her name
I be spendin' on wall Street and buyin' boardwalk
Dodging problems of the world drawn out in white chalk
Peace, Mr. Walt, I'm seein' all dimensions
But unlike your eye extensions, my vision don't blur
'What' 'when' and 'word's where the gossip occur
Heard I'm sexin' Sade and I bought her a fur
Battin' eyes at Toni Braxton and I bought her a fur

Before there were guns, there was Native Tongues on these plains
Putting others on without them being pawns in this game
Cause a pawn in this game is left with no game to play
So, um, you best ta check and hear what we got to say
Now if you came to party, just let it be known
Now if you came to fight, you might get that head flown
By the one and only Maseo plug third
J.D. dove plays the wall as Kenny Cal spurts words
And a number to a crew of dope girls from the woods
And not dope meaning weed, but dope meaning (good)
Like them West Coast kids, who be throwin' up signs
I hate a buster, unless his name is Busta Rhymes
So check the way my mind moves over times and grooves
Got some money to blow, wonder why I wanna know

A fair black tie
Got these kids fillin' up the premises
They want the supply
Product is uncut
We givin' you what you need cause you pay the prices
And if albums like pizza pies
We know you ain't tryna pay for them slices
When them chefs in the streets they call me De La
As if I lost my soul
I still got it baby boy
And the sound on patrol
Check the file
While we run it international like no other
For me in the pics
Rockin' them New York Knicks in them number blue colors
They got it for two for five
We got it for three for free baby
Cause you gonna get hooked off this verbal dope we cook
That's how it's gonna be baby
This digital onslaught, it's the world we live
Get with it or get quiet
You stay home while we stay on that Nasir Jones
Ya'll, the world is our diet

When we glide the world, what we tellin' 'em?
(Still god it baby boy)
Within' the loudest crowds, what we yell at 'em?
(Still god it baby boy)
Walk amongst the people, what they eyes sayin'?
(Still god it baby boy)
Those that thought they were equal, they demise sayin'

As young boys we sat on the stoop playin' punch buggy
Now we OG's drivin'
Limited whips from 2016
Just watch what we call perfect timin'
The cradle is straight, the fridge got a cradle estate
We dine like Thanksgivin'
If you on seconds with nothin' to share
Then kill yourself what's life worth livin'?
Case studies say hip hop is dead huh?
I think I need to taste the puddin'
Proof in it
, if God was a kid
When sales went from platinum to wooden
Special affairs, who cares about the special effects ya'll
We're like no others
Show respect to this grown man ink young fella
Recorded your mothers
Now when I walk in the street they call me De La

Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh tough luck, cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text
In the Big Blue in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock Jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
Cause now in the hood he's
(Johnny the Fox)
Till one ring came, Jody blew a park
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practising the range, bellowing the blues
Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
""Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date""
Padlock Jody's screaming ""Wait, wait, wait!""
""Don't worry, hon,"" he replies, ""I'm keepin' the faith""

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?
Hooked by your ever-so-shyness
Want that bush, heard you're from Flatbush
Ran after ya, caught ya
Brought ya to Long Island, stylin' for a while
In my hut, I was on a cut for a peck
A silly Greg Peck
You tried to play me new, Plug One you disconnect
I'd try to touch your hair (You would say no)
Yo, I'd try to touch your hair (You would say no)
Is is cause you want my financial flaunt?
First you gotta please me, nice and easy
But I guess you want that in reverse
So I stand Plug First can see
We got a serious block
Turn the other way, ooh what do I spot?
A hoopin' Hey Love whose scent left a trace
Had a stash in her pocket with a body that's safe
Ball to the eight, now you wanna swing?
Forget the rap, yo, Black Sheep, sing
(You're banned, you're banned)
(You're banned, honey dip, you're banned)

Now remember 'bout Padlock Jody, here's the fact
Jack little wick but she was acting wack
Jack wanna lay but laying ain't exact
For the past four or five she was banned by the pack
Hip to the witness, putting on a plan
No money, no more Puddy Tat for the man
Jack knows that honey means playing a game
Only wanna bowl, got nabbed for the fame
Claude Van Damme (God damn)
Sam was the man that you planned to command
Nothing new about a neighborhood
You know what? Padlock Jody wanna cut
Jack's thinking cap, make mine into a pack
""Yo, here's 20, 40, 60, pay me back""

Hey, whatever happened to the *emcees*

Man I'm on the set like the flicks so let your cameras flash
A splash bigger than whales, I'm makin monsters mash
Spit Pinnochio's Theory when shit be looking weary
I need rest, but I boogie for now, I'm on some mess
Like the best mics respond to me
Living days, like dreams of specializing in the art that pays
I be a mystic for life, so check my ID number
Emcees be kneading/needing dough while I make bread like Wonder
Yes, that's what you heard, so save that acting for the screen
See you can can that madness with the beans
I bust emcees like lies surprise em out the box
Put away the soda pops I’d rather rum on the rocks
A dime-getter tried to get what I got, for what?
I guess other folks' cash makes the lovin' come phat
But I'm past alla that, it's time to break with the breeze
Get to your knees, here comes the Supa Emcees
Chorus
Verse Two: Pos
Within this program of rap, I'll eradicate the glitches
Yo I'm dark like Wesley, but I be sparkin more bitches
Entering my constellation puts your lives in jep'
While you others represent, I present my rep
Cause when it comes to making dents, I'm that main imprint
Even smoked from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint
Could not prevent, YOU from seeing I'm the light
But bring attention to my words like some ass in tights
I heard you want to fight me, with your words on stage
So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam YOU made
And as he starts cutting what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones
As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean ""Puffy"" Combs
Send your tattered ass home, with celly phones I roam
With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete
While you live fables, unstable, acting very radical
Projecting like you're hard, when in fact you're quite vaginal

Is an undesired element. This element is known as the basehead: the lowest of lowest of all elements that exist. And the sad thing is
This particular element... is me brudda!
Brother, brother oh brother of mine
We used to be down as partners in crime
From our parents our name was forged
I was the Beaver, you Curious George
Wanted to dispose of this and that
But curiosity had killed the cat
At this age no wonder it was read
But this was the fate that you were fed
Throughout high school our minds we'd waste
High off all the cheeba that we could taste
Soon you had converted to nasal sports
Every five minutes cocaine you'd snort
Told me that you needed a stronger fix
Stepped to the crack scene in '86
Unlike the other drugs where you had control
This substance had engulfed your body and soul
Now from me you lost dumb respect
Said you need to put that shit in check
Wanted me to believe that you had tried
But your mind and the craving didn't coincide
Said there was a voice inside you that talked
Which said you shouldn't stop but continue to walk
Now the brother who could handle any drug
Had just found the one that could pull his Plug

Don't have a dime? It's payback time, payback time

Brother, brother, stupid brother of mine
Started getting high at the age of nine
Now at twenty-one you're lower than low
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to go
My dividends and wares started to disappear
Where it ended up, I had an idea
Barking you with the quickness, reversed intent
Instead went to Pop and gave him the print
Now Pop grew tired of being a mouse
Finally told you to get the hell outta the house
From there a mother figure came into play
Claimed for you she saw a better day
Now Mom was a product of Christ's rebirth
Thought the only chance was to go to church
Quitting this stuff you had tried before
This time you claimed you'd really score
Something I had to see to believe
Put on my suit and to church I weaved
PREACHER (Squirrel):
My, my, my. What happened to the people? The people who used to care
About what took place in the world today? I've been summoned here
Today to reach the people who still can be reached, to save the people

It's doing is taking over. Where them crackers at? Them crackers that
They serve, where they at?

Bullshit, didn't believe a lick
Knew this fool too well for that to stick
Instead I gave you benefit of the doubt
Wanted to see if you would work it out
First you reach your front of calm
Walked round by rehearsing psalms
Then you smiled with the funky frown
What do you know, the voice is back in town
Mom would say it would soon go away
You and I knew it was here to stay
But the man helped you when you helped yourself
That meant going to rehab for your health
Finally it went and blew your cork
Heard you moved to the comfortable streets of New York
And when my friends see me and come and ask
""Yo, where's your brother at?""
I'll be the first to splash: ""Yo, he's a basehead""

A Little Bit of Soap,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Please listen to this simple De La style I'm gonna sing
It's strongly directed to all the misery you're bringing
Now I'm not all about dissing someone else personnel
But there's no quota on your odor
That's right, you smell
Now you might feel a little embarassed, don't take it too hard
And don't make it worse by covering it up with some Right Guard
Before you even put on your silk shirt and fat gold rope
Please take your big ass to the bathroom
And please use

POS AND ANN ROBERTS:
Hey Love
Talkin' bout Hey Love
Wanna be your push and shove
Pop, popcorn up above
Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
Discover all the football teams
Mack and eat jelly beans
Run in the cold with no jeans
Get yourself sick till we're seen
Catch the flu and make tea
How Dan Stuckie life will be
It's all about you and me
Cause you're my Hey Love

Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love

POS: What?
TESHA: About you becoming fully dedicated
POS: So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh?
TESHA: You're damn right. I wanna know whatever you do for me has anything to do with love
POS: Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't that showing you love?
TESHA: You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx
Love, I wanna be your Hey Love
POS: You wanna be my what?
TESHA: I said I wanna be your Hey Love. I mean it's just not the mood being one of the many girls on your list, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love
POS: Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose
TESHA: Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named Selena from uptown like a Daisy. You even
Gave her some of your special donuts for free
POS: So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts
TESHA: No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love
POS: Look I don't understand why you're dissing me, it's not like I'm Paul, I don't have two kids in every state

He Comes,The Grind Date,2004.0,"""Oh, whaddya know? He comes""

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds clown
Ground you like terrible weather
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin
To all - rise and shine - give God the glory
I already give a percent of mine to Bert & Cory
And still got bills and employees to pay
So excuse me Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days
My ways of control is hard to swallow
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind
Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine
Dis-play your indie but say no -
- more or I'll blind you like Spit did to Ramo
- to the dirt - and edit the clip and lost Kano
My mens wear problems like Timbs
See it all in they face, ask Mase, he got wars to win
Scores to settle, crews to crush
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile
It's Long Isle y'all, longevity sustainin my celebrity status
From AM to PM, you see him on file y'all
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop
Shinin his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light
""A few short words, and whaddya know?""
""Oh, whaddya know? He comes""

Aiyyo I'm up against these walls, here's my back stiff straight up
Dazzle and razzlin broads like I'm little Juan Magic
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop
Top drama every time these commas don't drop
Pop spots like lint on your shirt, the net worth
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six
I circumcise the track, you just a dick - overlapped and hooded
Skin repeated like Stutterin John
I repeat like yesterday, it don't stop
George of this poor life pop, put to Scarlet
In a place she believes, much better than your lies
She say she lookin better in my eyes, bullshit!
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin to fuck
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby
I tried to speak my piece in court but Judge Mills paused me
Bifocusedly die hopeless sometimes
Yo cry your poker face, you oughta try it one time
When God is an iPod, you stand to download
Demanded like slaves on trial - we want free
Man cock aim ready, it's time you MC
So you rappers bust bee-bee guns, graffiti runs
Through my veins since cable with the wired remote
Woodgrainin like you wired his float

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids so original
 You heard?


Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners who got 'em
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew, and his whack dancers
Bitin is forbidden pah, pay that tax
And don't you ever look at us funny - boy, we'll bring rap back
And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in
Floor you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn
Hula hoop all bitches crew full with brand new Keds
Cutmaster kill 'em, make sure we cut classics
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the PA
And just lay whooptay whooptay?
Use the ruse, sport beads and snatch a dude's toupee
Since tunin into T-La Rock'n AJ
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of OJ
Girls you can go cruisin in my OJ

Brakes,Stakes Is High,1996.0,"There's a lot of people out here who just don't know
What plays a factor in movin' heads and toes
It be them kids bangin' them hits out of the stereo kits
Whether cassette, radio, or CD bits
Mix tapes from the best going on and on
Throughout the city grounds to suburban lawns
Man, we don't play, everywhere we stay
Videos shows the visuals of jams today
Coinciding with the rhythm of the heart and neck
The brakes got you in your proper context
You let your lex or your sixty-four suspension
Bounce away all your tension en route to the club
Where girls need the quenchin'
Diamonds on your wrist, sunroof top
But niggas out front makin' guns go pop
So the spot gets shut but on to the next
Cause your ears get vexed when they don't get the fix cause
(These are the brakes)
It be your listenin' pleasure
While you're doin' your chores
(These are the brakes)
No matter where you from, it's for you and yours
(These are the brakes)
Bringing it back to the brakes like the ""yes yes y'all""
(These are the brakes)
So let it be your anthem when you're havin' a ball

Well it's silly of me to think that I
Would never get a chance to see a piece of this pie
I sat dead in front of speakers thinkin' that could be me
Anticipatin' open microphones so I could emcee
Had a catalog of raps impressin' all the 'round-the-wayers
Before I went to bed included rhymes into my prayers
But that rhyme is all on paper
I want my song on vinyl plates
I dreamin' hits and doin' shows, makin' my niggas spines shake
Expectin' nothin' but a little bit of radio play
Gettin' diced on 1 and 2's by the best DJs, hey
Time was kinda tight, but still I dotted on the line
And some expected me to start buhlooning in the mind
Seein' spaces and places that I couldn't pronounce
But still I had the pulleys to make all the bullies bounce
With the blessings of the great we took it from state to state
'Cause we landed on the good foot and got our biggest brake 'cause

(These are the brakes)
A mother gets mugged by her crackhead son
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes""
You're in the wrong part of town so the shots make you run
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes""
Your best comrades put six tabs in your o.e
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes""
Your boyfriend made you a carrier of HIV
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes""

Now what's gonna happen when the sun don't shine
I'm buyin' tickets aboard the caravan of love
Hey fellas
See, money don't make shots repel
I break woes and compose some rhymes to tell
So when the party's live it shouldn't be beef
Or playin' indian roles I guess you thought you was chief
Seems all broke up and now you woke up surprised
Situation's gettin' sticky dead in front of your eyes
We play the wall similar to tacks
Until the DJ plays the necessary track
In fact as the jam plays on out comes all your bread
To pay for drinks for them girls you want to spread
Don't be mislead when the brakes inside your head
And have you reminiscing on them kids who got you fed
Until reality reveals a miss who wants to know
If you can play her real close out on the dance floor cause

(These are the brakes)
A mother gets mugged by her crackhead son
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes""
You're in the wrong part of town so the shots make you run

Remember to keep the De La in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup our sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area cliques
From manicured lawns to projects bricks / from 718 to the 51-6
Remember to keep the Mos Def in the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets now

Now, come on y'all, get live get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So don't none of y'all just be misled
The De La's gonna do the body good like wheat bread
Shakin laces out of shoes, Mos Def brought the brews
Sittin indian squats to make that bread tie knots
See I'm out to get the coin like in them rainbow pots
Swingin life like a hammock, invested like stocks
Through your sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Slappin fives with pain is a crew here to gain
We remain on your mind like skulls
Not a dull moment shown
When in the house all perimeters are blown
Native Tongue come through to make you say yes yes
This is the mighty Mos Def style fresh like baby breath
We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes

Now this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks

No tricks in ninety-six, Native Tongue gon build
But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC mean, makin' cream
When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like gabardine
Tryin to hang out with Dove and catch love in Aberdeen (word up)
I bag dimes like my man born on August 17
Life be nuttin but a river son I'm swimmin upstream
Playin wait up, with the data servin your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin, like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale the smoke of fiends, while bangin the tape
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin MC's at the top of a class, occasionally
Rippin some sucker's face
Or some suckable ass from a girl
It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world
I'm makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind (right)
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggas buttered Benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille (uh-huh)
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set it like equators invented, with the heat
Yo Mos Def how you radiate to make it complete
RIGHT *echoes*, so when I shine the light crabs wince
Manifestin for the future here in the present tense
No doubt, I love the sound biggin out off your Jeeps
Son I want the little kids bangin big brother beats

Now this goes out to all area cliques

Remember to keep the Native Tongues in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup our sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area cliques

Ya go ""ichi, ni, san shi""
I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat
I got multiple stabs of jazzy
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly
I plugged for the Tunin'
Which cause eyes to zoom in
Which put your person into focus
No longer Kelvin Mercer but the Posdnuos
Plug One yo I found fun
In the scribblin' of speak
On a naked white sheet
Most recognized by my dark-brown self
Yo you found some wealth?
More in my mind than in my pocket
But I's got every Girbaud that ever sagged
I met some hoes, met some girls
Did a tour that took me all around the world
Did a tour that took me all around the world

I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now
Remember when the floor might have had a spine
Well it's all bent over
The DayGlo nigga gets the red door mat
It's a roller coaster when your shit's burnt toast
Now Mr. Club Owner knows your jam
When your jam is the jam and there's a tab at the bar
My mindstate's great, no thanks I don't drink
I sip the bobo, then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave, tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think Mr. Radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one MC after one MC
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 Watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from Denver up to Maine
And lovin' deluxe, she won't catch me in no tux
Nah, man I won't honor the style

Funny funny how time flies
When you have some

Light on the face cause the focus is the fickle
'Stead of fusin' I'm a use it to the utilize the trickle
Caught a rush, but I played hush
While Andres Titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush

The same way for Titus when he Blacked the Sheep
But as the Knee went Deep, to deeper off the charts
The album faded to black, that's when the amnesia starts

I saw Big 4 go get shinin'
A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
""Ain't you?"" Yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being True dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight
I mail my ass to the darkness

I wanna be a supa emcee
(Well you're already that) so let me step up to bat
Attack a hit to go beyond this age of rap counterfeits
Out of the heavens August one-seven, sixty-nine
Born I, Wonder Why with the thoughts to rhyme
Til there was no longer thoughts to dream
When an unpolished demo led to limos at the age of eighteen
Accompanied by the screams, Plug One
Shot up with fame like novacaine it made me numb
So numb I wouldn't been able to feel
Niggas diggin in my pockets for my currency reels
But still, I make girls brown eyes blue at will (until)
My ass was no longer mass appeal
Oh shit, I guess that was all the fame I was alloted
Wait a minute, new video, like a leopard I'm spotted
In a night club chillin' with Khalil and Phife
I be that farmer cultivating owning acres of mics
And I likes to make it known Strong Island stylin
For a while, so do that dance
(Are you rockin the spot?) Yes I be
(Showin others they do not?) Yes I be
(Havin then towed from the lot?) Yes I be
That's my job as a supa emcee, I'm from Long Isle
Mobile, make it worth your while
If the jam needs motion I'm the one to dial
(Goin beyond ninety watts) Yes I be
(Well are you rockin it?) Yes, yes I be (rockin it!)
I can stress the makin of loot to feed the fam
While the voices impersonate the true who I am
Buzzin in my ear, oh you one of those wannabees
Always buzzin in my ear you down with supa emcees
Steppin' to me with your pleas that you gots, butter rhymes
Man the only thing butter bout you is your spine
Mad yellow, you can't rock the Mardi Gras, my mellow
Cause my stealth show more than knowledge of self
I got knowlegde of you, to know you a wack em-crew
(You mean wack emcee) Nah, a wack em-crew, see you a crew of wack niggas
You should have never tried to test
These words that I Man, with the eye/I to Fest
While you sayin' one thing really meaning the next
You're just a contra-DICK, your mind's been tampered WITH
Like some holy boooks, but looks to the sky
Cause Wonder Why's here to save the day
(Are you rockin' the spot?) Yes I be
(showin' others they do not?) Yes I be
(Havin' then towed from the lot) Yes I be
Cause ultimately, I'm lettin' all MC's know that
What's the name of this crew? (De La, De La)
Well alright, and what be the dish we servin'?
(We servin' pasta!) Posdanos help the necks get loose
Like an alcohol scenario rap be on the rocks
Authenticity that missin' fee to pay to join the flock of MC
These niggas stand lower than knees
Dramatized in they eyes as the ones to please
When rap kids apply violent pressure to father, brother and son
Wonder say they inflict pain
R&B niggas lie to mother, sister, and daughter
To have sex disguised as lovin' in the rain
Their words are more hollow than October 31st
What's worse, is to see the females
Switch to sexual mentality, it doesn't match with they given anatomy
Man they rather be hoes like that male emcee
Who walk around like they got nuts
And use the tits and ass like a crutch
Man the underground's about not being exposed
So you better take you naked ass and put on some clothes

Long Island Degrees,Stakes Is High,1996.0,"It's strong island for real, where the critters run wild
The prefix is 516, the top of the dial
Through the L.I. Sound, to the villa down under
And across the globe I heard a lot of folks wonderin'
So when's it coming cause the stakes is high see big money that waves
Don't put the pen to my page
And ain't nothin' wrong with standing still and relaxing
And spendin' some of that cash that Uncle Sam is gonna tax
A New York demeanor, sit back in the beamer
With nothing to lose but some gas and some minutes
Ignorin' the gazers cause some stars don't get petty
And that trash you talk is just New Years confetti
It's like that y'all, but that's all 'bout to change
Like some of my own, people tend to act strange
I'm making a scene, and it's served with it's capabilities
So set it at an island's degrees

It's strong island for real, the diagnosis is supreme
The prefix is 516, where microphones fiend
The voices that gots the gift, cause the world is on their shoulders
Makein' plans to switch from little rock to money boulders
The real proceed
My girl stands deep from nubians actin' like Colombians sellin' keys
Characters have the tendency to con themselves
To think the East Coast is only New York and Philadelph
You know the way we blow, your shit is played like pork
And as for what we be bringin' you, we live and direct from New York
I ougtta say my fam calls me Merce
Steppin' to me fool will get you punched out like a curse
It's like that y'all, let it all consume
Like them brothas who smoke, 'till they high like the moon
Soon to a town near you be them super emcees
Settin' them Long Island degrees

I hit the L.I.R.R. for big dreamers out east
And get your bank roll split
Bangin' dents out your systems
Sellin' points to get the uppercut like Sonny Liston
But eyes closed episodes
Bring you back to zeroes
The same herp playin' like he Casablanca
Blind to it, but I'm a grind him up a cup of Sanka
Servin' dimes loves on tennis courts and sorts
Laid back like grown folks sippin' tea for sport

I be sweepin' up the room with my lyrical broom
While others rhymes smell like plastic like some lunch room utensil
The official color for this planet is green
Which growns in pockets of them people willing to scheme
An't no expose, these facts are from the mouth
Profilin' through Island with that wind from down south
At last, be the world broad cast from the crew who gave you 3's
Magic on an island degrees

It's strong island for real where the critters smoke fritters
Night time excites time for the heavy hitters
Gang on hers cause in the mean time mine is home on date
Fluffin' pillows impatiently waitin' ain't no debatin'
'Bout to settle, check the level stakes is higher than the sky
I got questions about your life if you so ready to die
We in the last quarter y'all, somebody's gonna cry
I think they need to set the clock before the time pass by

In the round one no nines my size can get swelly
Sensing danger I will play a ranger on my celly with my felly
We're wonderful like colorful flix
Provide a thread and needle every time the stages get ripped
I grip upon the pleasure sippin' the tea
On the island cause that island is the main artery
So uh, you better come and give respect for catch some of these
Knucks from the island degrees",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-long-island-degrees-lyrics

DOVE: You mean Rhthym and Blues?
DE LA SOUL: No! Rappin' Bullsh...
DOVE:
Connection A, click, what?
My dick, chick
I smack a fish if you thinks
My connection ain't thick, dick
Headed like a punk whip
I travel miles with a rhythmic limp
I rock an Afro
In '83, gee, yo
And spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow
I play the corner tough
And me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt
MASE:
Givin' high-five is what I want
So I puff a blunt, I don't front
I get spliffed, get a stiff
Then I go hump a stunt
Like a pimp pro
(Nah, man, a super ho)
That's cool cause I'm still an Afro bro
Yeah, I'm live for my life is hectic
Every hour, every minute, every second
I keep a level head and stay down to earth
Cause I've been an Afro since birth

Yeah
Now I hold my crotch cause I'm top-notch
I run amok Sasquatch, and I like to eat live crab
I've got five beepers, you scab
But you can find me directly on the Ave
(You niggas cheat me, well who's that!)
My breath never smells wack
I eat the watermelon Tic-Tac
Before I kiss myself I always jump back
(Yo, gee, this track is stack)
(And you know that)
I do three flips
When a punk flip on my duke lifts
But I flex more strength when I'm asleep
On the other side with his main tapes
Make her dry her face, buy her gold earlocks
But I may, she flocks round me like a donut
She got sprinkles but I bite my way out
More brothers come about, try to scheme slick
But the Native Tongue's thick
Lick 'em real good, like a real hood should
But the fly tape let the car speakers shake
I ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but
Show gold teeth, cause I ain't a vegetarian
Not scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief
Got a scribble pad, you can get these gonads
Cause I'm big-willed, won't arf like a seal
Cause connection with the Afro is real
DOVE:
I be the gift of gab, but be a bro with a diss
Because it's tough to bluff a cab
No wonder Melle Mel is 'Rrrr-RAH!'
I play of tape of the son of La-di-da
My cousin Rilo sells blow, a G a day
Keeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half
I kicks my tricks, is to live for Island
I mug a mug vic, but I's cool, I self
With the quickness I bust the true slang
Show no pit to those who don't understand
MASE:
The Maseo got tailed with the big bail
I busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail
I seen the ghetto go lower than it is
(He don't care, cause his nigga's selling crack to the kids)
My jeans are brand new, with twelve more
In the closet with my silk, and velour
My 45 pack thick, draw quick
If a nigga starts some shibidibidit
My crib is uptown, downtown, L.I
And another crib in Queens
I munch some cornbread, Boar's Head
My favorite pork chops and
A plate of collar greens
I chill with Shymel, Akeem, Jaheed
And the Rastafarians'll be the crown in
And the Poppa

Dissect survival, passed on a whisper
Placed on the mother who shunned, now it's the
Boys who shot joy inside the violent

This is for the bottom of the deck

They call us the the little goat cheese (let's get the engine, baby)

Not signing blood with his back, bottle for knack
And we ain't backpack, we backbone
But that's how rap be
My own kids can't see they pops
Cause I'm onstage in some city making someone else's kids happy
Doing things that ain't over until the big lady sings
But since the world is so health-conscious
The big gal lost weight, so we rock non-stop the date
Give me a hard road to walk, I walk mine
Similar to blood that won't stay in the chalk line - I won't stay boxed in!
Worth every penny the record companies lend me
Sam Cooke-d the fish, but darling You Send Me
Creep out the mouth with the house like Mr. Fisher
When I want out the picture
My zodiac is commonly known as the proudest
(So even when I whisper..) it still sounds the loudest
That's just that NY, NY shit in me
But smart enough to know no one stay the epitome (Where?) In this game
But the aim is to clock out, covered in quality hip-hop
The sureshot will sure to get the cop-out
Work out the kinks, month later hear it in the club
While Smilez go work out the drinks

Held Down,AOI: Bionix,2001.0,"Allow me.. to break it down.. ah yea yea yea yea yeahh..
Life.. {*humming*}

This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts
Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You from the same type of people try to hold you down
Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things
Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring? I tell you for me
It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin
Cats posin as my fan just to get grabbin what's mine
I'm livin in times where my daughters are found around
Kids who can't afford thinkin caps
But always found drinkin raps and eatin off beats
Claimin laws of the streets - but who made the laws?
Everybody playin rebel with no sign of a cause

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down
You've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be
Where you wanna go with your life
With your life..

Yo, I'm never singin the blues but findin the clues to maintain
And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream
I had, and I made it come true
I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin the clue
To perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
I find people settin traps
Tryin to find the goal - without havin any maps
Even friends of mine, jumped on line, just to become my adversary
They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
They don't come to chill or behave
And they got, toast ready to burn
Not learnin to live, but they yearnin to take what you earn

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down
You see - you've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be
And where you wanna go with your life
With your life..

So quick to place blame.. and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
So many names held accountable for my own account
When a large amount was weight - that I made and shaped
When I climbed I found
It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
Which made me realize the truth
The biggest supressor could be your own ego lookin for an excuse
To plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow
To sprout and follow the first thing you feel
Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic
And when I'm watchin the news, and my daughter walks in
And choose to ask, ""Why were all those people on the floor
Sleepin, covered in red?"" I told her
That they were lookin for God, but found religion instead

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be
And where you wanna go with yo' life
With your life, with your life..
{*Cee-Lo harmonizes and ad libs with choir*}

I need my SPAAAACE, to live..
Well I, feel the world around me
I've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be
And where you wanna go with yo' life

Had some Chinese food but I didn't have a spoon
I had a dope rhyme but I didn't have it soon
I'm looking out the window day is filled with rain and gloom
Man oh man oh man I hope I find my spoon soon

Pony Ride,Stakes Is High,1996.0,"Just stop takin me for a ride..
(c’mon, c’mon, c’mon)
All I wanna do is take my time..
(take your time baby, take your time baby, c’mon)
Just stop takin me for a ride..
(ah hah ha hah-hah, hah ha hah-hah)
All I wanna do is take my time..

I’ma stand up for art express, do mic test rehearsals
Eight years of man livin', ain’t no edits or commercials
Flick the God like mummy, but my own want a debit
Tossin facts and how they axis don’t, spin on a limit
Ain’t no need to dwell, to health I’m fakin your jax
Ride niggas get to sittin' to rear, so play the parks of rosa
Suppose I have my whole life on it
Funny how those you love love the evil they do
I brew the medicine to heal, a bit of verbals we had
But your ideas of heal, is left the surface of it scabbed
Navigations nearly took me on some cruise type expense
Dispensing me some shitty canal, I took the juice
Because I’m used to one-ways, detours and destinations
Of ways in life, I pretends the knife
Stuck in my spine’ll be a symbol, how jack can be nimble
But it’s time to make that foggy vision crystal
We gots to get the crystal right?

Just stop takin me for a ride..
All I wanna do is take my time..
Just stop takin me for a ride..
All I wanna do is take my time..

Well I don’t wanna go that far
To sell my soul, I ain’t gonna go that far
I’m takin minds and hearts beyond the shining star
Raw dick, honey I don’t wanna go that far
So listen why you risking your mentality against mine?
Sick of leading love
Sick of leading love, leaving love loudfaced
In the vehicle of mine
Them wanna do awards, ? nine ninety-nine, watch em
Profile the true fall out for so-called friends
Like mercury and water, we just don’t blend
I end the game technically, you wanna stop me
True gems show affection like jody watley, so..

Just stop takin me for a ride..
All I wanna do is take my time..
Just stop takin me for a ride..
All I wanna do is take my..

Take my.. take my time..
Take my..
Take my.. take my time..
Take my..	(but I don’t wanna go that far!)

I recall kissing on my lady, talking bout making babies
Now we made the baby, but cannot connect as legal spouses
Now me and my daughter reside in different houses
What louses up the structure, is leaving things up to
The child lesser, than a child runnin wild from mild pressure
Mega.. (mega..) nega.. (nega..) tive
To live a master plan when that plan has no master
You stare at false tongues, leadin the yung’un to disaster
Postures of this world is seen as mad crooked
Want your manhood, but man, your dad took it
We used to swallow 40’s and a whole lot of pride
Nice mc’s be frontin on some whole other vibe
Just because them albums are sealed, doesn’t mean
Them lyrics are untampered with, let’s kill the myth
That as mc’s we know it all, we all children still
No tricks for ninety-six, it’s due time we build man..
Just stop takin me for a ride..
Yes, stop gassin me, stop gassin me
All I wanna do is take my time..
All we want to deal, is reality
Just stop takin me for a ride..
Stop gassin me, stop gassin me
Cause all I wanna do is take my time..
Take my time, take my time, c’mon!

Nosed Up,and the Anonymous Nobody...,2016.0,"And in from the door steps a dumbass struts the fool's gold
Know-it-all, and you wear it well
Funk-less in full length
Too square to stand for anything
Somebody get that man a chair

No matter where you opt to sit, the opposite-attract law don't fit
Repel even the docile
Always showing your nostrils, got em hostile
The way you're so uppity, till someone barks on ya
You get puppy feet
Quite a laugh, cause you don't know half, but act like you own a puzzle
And everyone allegedly under you, begging just to guzzle from your fountain of fresh
(Hashtag)
Fuck outta here, they rather stay clear
Roll up the papers and pass
While you turn your nose from the smell
Like Stanley on Fridays
Saying we should stay off the grass
As if the lines you sniff is more healthy
Delusions of prestige is not where the health be
B, you need to get it together
But nah, here comes you, part Frank Drebin, part Mr. Magoo
Stay stepping into trouble
Oh so  when you're repping for your bubble
But bubbles can get popped, exposed to reality
Watch the words that drop
There's not enough salary to cover the check
'Fore you're behind on cash
People can see you coming like 9/11 ash
Toxic till your last days
And with your shady maneuvers
No one will include you where they ass stays

Behold your royal highness of sinus
It's near 100 miles of running cause your nose needs plumbin'
Captain Nose-dive reporting for duty on the good ship Handkerchief, all aboard
And that goes for you too, Nostril-damus
He who knows nose
And from the from the rooty to the tooty he defines snooty
Somebody asked me the other day is the brother a brother
Does Kleenex wipe?
Yeah I see that

Like you got one eye on top of your third
A star is born but whose claimin' that birthright
At first sight you the well dressed Park Ave sachet
Acclimated to the scent of your own tail (the bullshit)
The same bull that rage when the buck stops
You'll be walkin' on clouds but that's a smoke machine
See your dineros can't buy bliss, you high fist then
Turn into you flippin' the bird
And every man under your wing
You build your nest egg but you was spoiled rotten
Forgotten you can get robbed of your fame
Beak out like pelicans
You relishin' the fact that you stand feet from stardom
You bargain astonishin' antiques in this modern way of livin'
So tight and not a half size forgivin', you takin' the piss
You got a butler in duplex
Them two Tecs and our God won't protect ya
Can't stay in them white gloves for too long Mr. Handyman
Canaries don't chirp in your candy land
Give them motherfuckin' pigeons a hug

And then he strolls through the valley of dark
Nincompoop, simpleton
Stranger to his own father
Seldom down to get down
And just never stays up
Well, I'm yours son
We talkin' up there like a satellite
Species: 
canis lupus

What's happening, dog?
You smell more like pig to me

Say “I Gotta Believe!”,PaRappa the Rapper 2,2001.0,"(Double in background)
 Let me hear you say ""Alright!""
 Alright! (Alright)
 Let me hear you say ""Oh yeah!""
 Oh, yeah!
 Now let me hear you say ""whatcha gonna do?""
 Whatcha gonna do?
 I need to hear you say ""you gotta believe!""
 I gotta believe! (I gotta believe...)

If you thought your dreams were fulfilled before
You need to come on back, Jack
Look who walked in the door
It's Parappa The Rapper, and my name is Pos
I'm known to emcee for free or a cost
If you be at the mosque, synagogue, or church
Drop to your knees and pray for Parappa The Rapper
To save the day and make you scream hooray
Just clap on time, 'cause it's time to play

I know you're slick and smooth, cool with an attitude
On the right track, leader of the pack
Kickin' back, never looking back
You know my words won't satisfy
What I have now, deep inside of me (Inside of me)
And all I need is much security

When you're needed for a mission, he got your back
Sure to have a cool time, man, that's a fact
Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
So come on and let's go

We are the concentrated Vitamin D, with the title
Hookin' it up, speedy quick, like noodles to cup
It ain't nothin' for the one man
Buttin' to move somethin'
Runnin' par rappin' through laps
Hurdlin' raps
And just when you thought your game was dead
Well, we got you cookin' up rhymes all in your think kettle
Proceed and click the next level for fun, player
Play ya game, player number one (One...)

True love that speaks the truth
You know it'll help me through
In the cold night
In the morning, all night
Or even in a fight
You know you should come home to me
We can have fun until the morning light

Here to serve up a dish like Sunny Chan
You know I'm the man
Here to have fun
Wanna have a taste?
Here, have some
Servin' up O's by the oodles
Oh, I forgot
Parappa The Rapper, he don't like noodles
We like eating snapper that's red
Freestyle from the top of the head
Yo, Parappa got skill
Why don't you give it try, see what you can build
Tasty like fruit that's peeled
Watch your heels, you might slip and fall
And if you do, you know who to call (Who?)
It's Parappa The Rapper and De La, y'all

You and me can walk together
And down the road forever
And smell and touch the treasures of life
Every day
Love and hate are face to face
And good and bad are back to back
Every day, uh huh
(Uh huh, uh huh, oh yeah, yay)

Switch on your 36 inches
You in the boob tube, trapped deep
'Til the game watch you sleep
Overdosed on moves taught by the sensei
Your timing's all off, tiger
You in the little leagues
Striking out a De La joint
Book a session for the Plugs and PJ
To come train the camp, y'all
Mooselini, graffiti tag and plug dose
(Dose, dose, dose)
Game over, I'm ghost (Ghost, ghost)

When you're needed for a mission, he got your back
Sure to have a cool time, man, that's a fact
Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
Come on, everybody, saddle up and let's go
(Double in background)
 All my people say ""Alright!""
 Alright!
 Yeah, that was good
Now let me hear you say ""Oh yeah!""
 Oh yeah! (Oh yeah)
 Now let me hear you say whatcha gonna do

Area,Buhloone Mindstate,1993.0,"I can just remember the number...
[Hook: Dove + 
Pos
]
Just another area
For me to patrol
Just another area
That shows I got soul
Just another area
For me to patrol
Just another area
That shows I got soul
[Verse 1: Pos + 
 Dove
]
I got soul you see, I'm swimming in the De La
I'm in my hood man, my manhood worries ya
I'm known for sampling of soul food
Off the old school plates
When I met up with my niggas from the 
718
One the Jungle Bro, the other Questas from Queens
Yet I had the matrix of the 516 in my genes
So I sided with my funk to bring my second on call
For me and the Sheep, our mission's on the beach of 804
(You're runnin' on an empty tank)
But still get paid in full
 
(And get the girls)
Man, I'm packing gravitational pull
Bring the instamatic avalanche, my code intervenes
I'm out to scout the areas that remains to be seen
(What?)
[Verse 2: Dove + 
Pos
]
Well, many many digits had me seeking in my Wizard
Man, who's ringing up my area (ooh) oh!
I used to shoe it to the bridge but that's gone
Like the 718's out of Vietnam
Sniffin' skypagers had me drugged
(Man, I knew a psycho)
703's on my love bug
I made mates with the brothers up in 215
Crazy buddhas in my mind
My Chattanooga champs had me late for the camp
And my 202 keeps me marvellous
I guess Mars was my hideaway
But if the stars for a getaway
[Verse 3: Pos + 
Dove
]
Since I'm capable I conjure up the walk in this way
I slip a syllable for Aspen and a Chester souffle
I be the 919 seeker, cause ain't off legit
So when I'm with my crew I always have a place to sit
Due to this, a brother tries to play me
(Yeah, like one in 514)
Yo, some kid tried to flip on me
They instigated a brawl
(So we set our knuckles on stun and made them all fall)
Then I just laughed
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(We whooped that ass)
And put the feelings aside, I know who I am
I cashed the grain by the pound
I make sounds with the horn
When I color the corn, caught the fit
And sit the two when honey slung the tip
[Verse 4: Dove + 
Pos
]
Well I'm taking my funds to the 301's
And Im playing my flute in the rear kibbut
My man from the 908's, he don't like it like that
So I pipes till the sunshine hikes
A kettle of our master plan makes the Malibu idol
(God forgive me)
 Well, it's a hook
The third to the 0 to the 5 had top feel the vibe
When the 516 played convicts

The man Maseo is here to put the habit along
And what you have, I'm 'bout to speak about your area code
Is it 918? (No)
Is it 212? (No)
Speakin' on 404? (Hell no)
What about 516? (I dunno)
What is it? (Not tellin' ya)
What is it? (Not tellin' ya)
What is it? (Not tellin' ya)
What is it? (Not tellin' ya)
(Huh? What?)

Just another area for me to patrol
I got status cause I'm baddest with the paint
Giving upside down frowns to London when 703
Her moms didn't like it, I had to let be
For the fact I lays bricks
Cause my semen ends with the letter T
My seed is hard to submerge
I play the tack in the wall if my rear's not watched
Cause some knuckle might just head for the urge
But I got Prince Paul in the Area
(Oh, it's like that now)
I got Hot Dog in the Area
(Heh heh heh)
I got the Violators in the area
 (Aaah)
I got the Violators in the area (Aaah)
It don't matter where you hide, I clear up the fall
Cop the fuck outta here, you fake-ass fraud
Clear my area

(I'm going home now, I have been up all night.)
(I been up all night, it's still Friday to me.)
(Come on now. Hey, Ellory, I'm going home!)

Down Syndrome,Stakes Is High,1996.0,"I be that mind blessin blessin these lessons we've ignited
Want to bring it to my face man you're cordially invited
Cause I've cited, you posess no science in your thinking
So I'm gonna (never) you're blinking!

Fingers be pointin, and leakin for some finna stink
You think I'm pink I bl-l-link with them shades of thought and think
(and in this corner be the hush) so play on William Rhodes
Cause at the sound of the bell my circle square controls
And all MC's best sweat, we bringin buckets of heat

So don't fret kid I let you lick the love I secrete, yo
Even my foes give me bravos, and that shows
Total domination in this rhyme complication

Yeah the skill is a cinch I rock the womb with a mic
And in the days of the nipple and breast, I knew de yes yes y'allin
Was the callin, clearly not for the gat
For combat, I bring a bag of my rhymes for the stat

I'm Plug One-of-a-kind, for you people's delight
And for you sucker MC's, step to your knees
Ain't no second thoughts and all your thoughts are from Orion
I can tell that you a devil by them rhymes you're designin
Your play doggin tactics can't fuck with my facets
Just because you talk all that Glock shit don't mean you can rock shit!
Your identities on freeze
Just a form of protozoa tryin to cross them seas

See high horse riders gettin shot by the sheriff
Cause nobody's safe from crimes
And even all you skirts need to checkin in your upstairs attic
Cause Mase is smackin hoes if hoes is startin static

Now it ain't all good when your jam goes wood
So as a deterrant, I use mental current
Got them brothers shook, peep the look comin out of the face
Cause they all catch a bruise from the hits we make

Your fame and cars should be listed as magnets
Legends never die but they can get shot and killed
Ain't nuttin glitter when you're battlin MC's
You once imitated in a mirror so to down syndrome you kneel

The same status I heard, the same nothin
My ears fears the faulty locks tryin to lock down the stops
But I earn more than your Menudo or your Boyz II Men
While down syndrome keeps you immune to frequencies I send
Fresher than a sniff off havin them J in fifth
I identify with your rhythm
But I exist for more than just a Benz, so mends
I'm cuttin off my friends to keep a smile calcium iron grain

Let me tell you a little something ‘bout the self (tell 'em, self)
I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to
Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in ginger
So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it til December
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city
Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making
More money than a pagan holiday
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say

Say what man? You gritty like a diamond grenade
For the cameo spot you tries to fool Parade
You acrobats flip the star gazin map, for alla that
You'll be the first to place, and ran it all to a waste
And all the style that you bring (gotta make decks bend)
You gotta rip it from the start (when the beats come in!!!)",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-down-syndrome-lyrics
It’s Like That,The Grind Date,2004.0,"It's like, New York without a New York yanks
Better yet, New York without the New York franks
It's like hot summers without no A.C
Or never hitting numbers when you go to A.C
It's like six years of your life, go ask Rob
I'm like ""Yo how is it?"" he like ""It's like hard""
Trying for that queen but you nothing but a man
You wanna keep it clean but you can't
Why it gotta be, like, that
And what the life, see life is like a J shot
Shooters son, they got
One point one second, you half court
I'm feeling the adrenaline like you half-caught
Like pink slips and dipping these ink tips to paper
Imagine if we fuck around and lose Hip-hop
Imagine if it didn't exist
Imagine nothing shining your wrist
See, imagining to you is a risk
But think about it, like no chrome rims
And tims would be construction boots (ill)
We probably wouldn't even substitute (ill)
For words we use defining our likes
I'm coal mining these mics
To keep that gold nugget like Dave Megget
Giant like a motherfucker, like Dave said it
But ya ain't listening, ya paper gon' stack
Why it gotta be like that?

Just running, running, fast as I can
I'm trying to be a person but I gotta be the man
If I, can't stand the life that I'm in
I gotta keep running cause I'm still gon' win
Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that)
Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that)

It's like, Slick Rick without the eye patch
More like, saying slick shit you won't catch
It's like bed time without your PJ's
Or no fed timing in out the PJ's
It's like, one minute you got it, then you broke
Like what I do with it? I copped a few with it
Looking like a problem, but you won't get it solved
You working but you won't get the job
It's like, who would of thought (thought)
If you would've bought (bought)
Into my religion you'd be more like God
But you were steady swimming so you more like cod
See these fools is fish scale, converting to Ishmael
See I see it like, A alike, B alike
I was taught, if you play alike, be alike
How they don't see it for one to go pop
And this is how you treat Hip-hop?
Imagine if you didn't have that phantom chrome sitting on a curb nigga
The word nigga wouldn't be a bit disturbing nigga
See them roots are like begging for the rain
You entering my kingdom just a begging for the reign
Putting shit stain to paper
Ink pain feeling like fifty-five licks on a slave niggas back
And not a one of y'all stopping to help
But why it gotta be like that?

Just running, running, fast as I can
I'm trying to be a person but I gotta be the man
If I, can't stand the life that I'm in
I gotta keep running cause I'm still gon' win
Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that)
Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that)
Just running, running, fast as I can
I'm trying to be a person but I gotta be the man
If I, can't stand the life that I'm in

Make sure it's V-S-One, not

Set ya soap-box up, let your talk fight
Pull ya socks up, get ya walk right
Or the chalk might outline ya one day
You oughta try steppin' outside you one day
You circle round yourself like you the answer
To the question of your inner son
But keep ya falsehoods to a minimum (minimum *echoes*)
We all need a little church
A life update, keyword - update
If they don't serve change, don't bite the bait
Instead'a givin' you a share, servin' you a dish
I lead you to the water, show you how to fish
Ain't nothin' wrong makin' that bread wid'it
But don't let the bread get to ya head, geddit?
Admit it, when you can't stand alone
I wanna stand up, give all the pretend up
And get a full blast of my demands of

Heal y'all! We gonna heal it!
So let it heal! {It's real!} It's real!

It's realer than real, for real, for real

The early bird gets the worm in this rotten apple
But explore deep and you will the find the seed
Plant more ether, get your mind free
We roll passsionate, put your lights last in it
You're holdin fear too close, unfasten it!
And like old age invades youth
Invade falseness with truth
Replace rebelling with rebirth
Face new dwelling, that's your turf
Lean back and put your feet up on the sofa
Relax! (Relax! *echoes*) learn how to punch back
And do your work to the max
The payoff's much sweeter than the payback
Even the haysack needle wouldn't play that
So let's pray at, church (church *echoes*)

You know what I mean? Rap outsold crack
You know, so rap....or hip-hop culture
However you wanna dice it, you know what I'm sayin'
It's the most powerful drug there is, man
It changed corporate America, it changed the way you feel about me
It change the way I, I do my thing now
Busta was the one who came out, on the award show and said that
Hip-hop provides jobs for people who don't even love the shit

Ok, you got your sit, have a coke and a smile
Turn off your damn phone that's no joke and a style
It's not a Sprite, it's a cartoon, soon is your size
Just wear it, there's no vacations for real guys
This is the title, you know he's still numero uno
He speak a little french, he don't need the subtitles
And who knows ? You might wanna drink a dose
Hey, just have a 
Bordeaux

Voulez-vous ?
What the ? Shut the fuck up, and get the brew
They gonna make it fly like a 45, back in 42
They run the street, daily
After the movie  is on his cellie
And round the way is just lazy
It's amazing ! (You mean lazy?)
Don't know what to say, this movie français is just hot !
Cocorico
Yo, let's to Santa Rico, no more police station
In french is ""Comico""
And ""Casse toi pauv' con"" doesn't mean ""Cup of tea""

Now, who got the cops ?
Well, it must being you, 'cause black who had cops
Ever since the debut
I ran from the cops
I stayed true to the books
Acting up on the streets
I had to stop
And Mama put a halt 
So the Port got chopped
Everybody wanna know who

That's all I eat because my co-pay's steep
The game don't stand a chance when I compete
The rain can't even dance when I [?}
After I eat shmee 
Heart's be like 'Preach Me!'
So I can control the girl, oh the girl
And I be like 'Go Girl!'
Only because mo' girl cometh
Other than that I write my brothers to chat
On events that I sat on the fence
'Today's fence got barbwire!'
Oh news from the east side!
Yo the east coast boys add it again
Off the west and the south dick
And back on the pen and when my grin's being erased again
By the pace of the world
We take trips to find a better place in the world
To give the musical, pharmaceutical to your face!
It's only rap

C'mon!

I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more (don't front, front!) 
:
It's that brown man from Long Island shores
Got a way with women, so I get away with yours
Because you're whole game's outdated
Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated
:
Mommy you can play your Ripley's
Or believe it or not
Shoot gift like Heron
With skills of Gil-Scott
Nights like Sir Lancelot can get heated
Prescribing your vibe, love
I know how you need it
: 
:
I like to mingle sometimes
So I head out of state to find a couple of dimes
But at a government rate, can't settle for no nickels
Even pennies for thought, for short
I need connections
With big bank selections
Securing all the sections
With sing-sing corrections
Seedin' like nature, escapin' like gas
Tell me how long this love is gonna last?
Thinkin' fast might spoil somethin'
Turn a whole week to nothin'
Extra to your lady is special
Seen a bigger picture on the screen
But you're a movie, you move me
You soothe me like holidays, getaways
The brochure said do it
So true
It's not a hold hand mission
Cut the public display
Heard you're headed for the stars
Put the gazers away
Nine times out of ten
We cut to good friends
But when we on the tenth
We gotta go the length
:
I'm not a playa yet I get more play
Than a talk show shown across the USA
Have em' moanin' out the vowels sounds
Ooh, eeii, and aahh
And how by now you should know me and my
Crew members do members of the opposite sex
Have their boyfriend screaming out
That we got more techs
Than that ball team in Georgia
(Yo, he said he's comin' for ya!)
All because the ho wanna go to the casbah (Ha!)
: 
:
You can get with
Some of these women
Some of the time
When your face is in the light
Thus stirred with lime
Is it a crime
To sex your mind to death?
Resuscitated
See how many brain cells left
I feel your body's drawn to my positive
Don't even want a baby
If it's that easy to give
I live right around the corner
Three states away
Take a holiday
Come check me
Watch how I set the
Mood, check a movie on the tube
Get your belt mad loose like Lee
Phone's turned way down
To avoid the beef
Or the questions
If she's the only one gettin' lessons
:
You're into crime faces, huh?
Well, I'll play your Capone
Suzy Q got the grill
To make the cake chrome
Situation's gettin' absurd
Hot on a plat
So work the format
See how we do that?
Considering you're figurin'
We'll love on the rock
I'mma keep it up front
To maintain the stock
Displayin' all the goodies
From your knuckle to knees
Make it hot like the Island degrees
Now that's special!

Pushed up a dame by the name of Crystal
Her flaunt's to the point just like a missile
A habit with ears kiddin' with gold mags
And since she fancies facial hair she asked my name
(Hey baby what's your name?)
Now ever so fab I said I'm wala
Miss Wild who used to run tough with Koala
She was a winner of my metaphor and she knew that
I said ""I'm gonna feed your mouth,"" she said ""You do that""
Now Crystal stops the jeep I think I'm mad fly
She used to have a man wit lots of mad signs
Her strut was guaranteed to make a gay smile
And in bed she had proved to be real agile
I show her to her lounge and I dined her
Then she gave me some digits where I could find her
I licked her like a stamp
Laid and sticked her like a champ
But the... um she gave me burn
I had to go see the doctor

Well it was thirty after nine and I was loungin'
Tokin' on some smoke 'cause I was poundin'
I rang up seven up so we can skip to the mall
Thinkin' a good day to shop, but then we got stopped
A shooter man said ""Yo well it's a stick up""
A whole lot of dirt was 'bout to kick up
I had screens in my pocket
And man, tonight's my date
Wit Smokey Sue, now what was I to do?
In my head I'm thinking, 'Should I dodge the bullet?'
'Man this kid is bluffin' you can pull it'
I feared the whole scene
The shooter didn't bluff
Now look at me now
He shot my ass dead
(Yeah)

You shouldn't have..

You shouldn't have done that

Mummy I saw one day
She was on some fume vapors
Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper
Cat litter had me sniffin
Since outside the palace
Eyes sicker than aids
Game harder than a callous
Tried to enter in her shit
She had locks on the session
Tellin me how her last man
Taught her ass a lesson damn
Well, I'm not the mayor
I take care of my dimes
But I excluded I had nickels
Addin' up to her kind
Short stacks with a wristful of jewels
Sayin she didn't need a man
To make her out for a fool
Dig it, miss, my love is credited in cupid account
And if you need that extra help
Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humor
Then she broke out with the words
About knowin all the rumors
""See, all you niggas rappin be like pedigree dogs
Thinkin you can have me leashed
Around your microphone cords""
Somethin 'bout her lit me up like july
And with them onions in the pants
I couldn't help but cry
Seemed lost in the essence
But i had to find my way to take
Action for the digits just to set up a date
Thought my shinin was on
I had the skirts in the bag
Until i took a bit of time
To peep the price on the tag
She said ""I'm that salt and pepa
Who like pushin it to sisters
You need to get to walkin with it mister
I think you betta listen""


 
We was at some outside jam one saturday night
When this pretty ass girl got locked in my sight
She was a ghetto philosopher
Yeah you know the type
Thinkin' Mary J. and sade understood her strife
Caught me lookin', ""Yo what's cookin?""
""Nothin' from around here
So don't approach or hope
To be the man of the year""
I said listen deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be
I'm not the one to embarrass
But the one to emcee
I traveled the world q uarters on my relationships
Used and abused by hoes
So my royalty stubs
But above all
I brought my daughter into this earth
So I understand the need
Of women feeling of worth
She glanced deep in my eyes
And said ""oh shit, you're ill
I like the way your mind
Moves around at will
Still, let me apologize for soundin so sassy
But you niggas act as if my ass
Has a sign that says harass me""
Her name was gail from the union of dale
I made her remove the shades
So her eyes could tell me the plan
Yo where's your man?
""Oh that nigga's past tense
Painted bruises on my face
Haven't seen him ever since""
Gave a pinch to my bottom
And started rubbing my back
She said ""i bet your ass is darker
Than a mobb deep track""
Only one way to know it
And i was down to show it
So we jetted back to my crib to set it
She made it known
""I've owned thoughts of you
Since that song 'meeny-meeny'
Can't believe you're about
To be all up in between me""
Man, the flag was lowered
So my wood was raised
Followed a shielding of my building
To protect me from the blaze
This granted access to
Southern parts of her borders
Did you have her comin'?
Like the new world order
I caught her with the right combination
A good combination
Keepin' it in her hard, man
You betta listen

Grab the Plug Two's live wire, my brother
And find that you've grabbed my pet boa constrict
Ringo's the garbage I'm hearing
Seek for the truth, my brother is tearing
No time to back-step, cause if you back-step

Ain't no need to guess, put it to the test
Ask ya questions alphabetically

OK, hypothetically if I do take a hit

But don't chu' know chick like to smoke and get laid
Don't be a dunce it ain't gonna hurt you once
Quit bein' a punk
Go ahead and hit the fuckin' blunt

And let us serve the hay
And get yo mind alligned to the ways

Man I seen a cast a spell
To many brain cells and sane cells
A lead to fulfill wants and needs
I heard it's like a gateway to doin' more than weed

Yeah but what if I can't stop
Shit I ain't with bein' no addict (Cut that shit out)

Man, please tell him to stop bein' so dramatic
Just take a hit and let the weed do the trick

But will this make me sick

Come on, quit actin' like a bitch
I can blaze the weed and you can make excuses
Now ya gonna smell the smoke my greenest weed produces
You'd probably like the smell too, ya probably wouldn't admit it
You'd probably wanna hit too (Come on man quit it)

Roses and violets aren't proper
For throwing, for showing, appreciation why?
This is a Daisy Age hands don't sweat cause it's no threat

Rhymes aren't fables mislabeled to be on time
Cause they market it in label speaker Posdnuos
The stitch will fit with every consumer
Microphone use and sales will start blooming
Profit and cause could never be lost
All due to the sounds of Dilla, we call it Plug Tunin'

(Are we on the air?)
We in the D tonight
(Are we on the air?)
We here with Dilla tonight y'all
(Are we on the air?)
Yeah, so dope ma dukes! (Hello ma!)
(Are we on the air?)
We in the D tonight
(Are we on the air?)
We reppin' Dilla tonight y'all
(Are we on the air?)
Yeah, and put it up for ma dukes",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-dilla-plugged-in-lyrics
The Future,The Grind Date,2004.0,"We are singing, you this message
Through our music, reaching for a, brave and brighter
New tomorrow, is the future
We must make it, safe and happy, for the children
Or... or... they will be lost
Or... or... they will be lost

Aiyyo I jump back, put the aim on my shot
It's mandatory, handle glory over with the rock
I'm not a rough guy but a tough guy to beat over drums
No son to this, I'm a rhyme bastard
Some mastered the art of cash, but not the part that lasts
And disappear after doin two albums
We're not your normal team and we still do ours to fit
Hope inside this, don't define it's
Quits for those who oppose the new
Playin' they've outgrown rap like a size 5 shoe
Oh they all neo now, alternative touch
Were surprised, no demise for us
We on the rise to bust big, how you fig' we couldn't
Never run out of verbs for you to sip, I told you we wouldn't
I never popped Crist' or pop this, girl named Chrissie
Was the first, which made it even worse not to miss me

Or... or... they will be lost (the future)
Or... or... they will be lost (the future)

So do you understand it now? Well try standin' over
Seven box sets, 
reppin sixteen years
This rap career ain't work, it's the life in-between
Bedtime 'til the next said time and date
Know the name and salute them dudes
Put the nutrient in rap when they cook them foods
Gotta be like eighteen million heads served
Shit, imagine if there wasn't no us huh?
So I'd like to take the time to shout out the JB's
Next on my list is A Tribe Called Quest
Latifah my Queen, Monie Love, Dres and Mr. Lawnge
Chi-Ali, hold your head God bless
Never ring chasin, the permanent tat
In this rap shit, y'all are just temporary lick-ons
Fadin in the days to come
While the name De La and the legacy built lives on

We are singing (sing it out now)
You this message (sendin you a message y'all)
Through our music (through the music)
Reaching for a, brave and brighter new tomorrow
(another day y'all) is the future (it's the future)
(it's the future) We must make it (we gotta make it)
Safe and happy, for the children (for the children)
You little brats",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-the-future-lyrics

Pawn star.....Pawn star

Check it, pussy got me wide open, writin' the love notes
Butt naked, strippin' out of her trenchcoat
Got me hittin' high notes, pitchin' a deep throat
Bitch be suckin' niggas car door

Yo, I broke my piggy bank just to see that pussy stank
Smelly in Africa then Africa, whoa

I know like you know when you spendin' them hundred dollar notes
We box triangles all angles

Yo, throw her on the table Shell

No, I tie her with a phone cable 
Bound her by her wrists and ankles
I bust right off Pun and Abel

Yo, actin' like we're kidnappers stabbin' the mouth with two dicks
Take a couple of new flicks

Click...click give up the money bitch
Had her backin' it up, smackin' it up
Yo, we fucked till the sun came up

Pawn star, hey there special lady do what you do
Cause I don't care what they say to you
See you're my pawn star
You're beautiful to me in every little way
A very special lady, pawn star
Rather doggy style than missionary
You very, very...very, very...very beautiful pawn star
You're a superstar to me and you came into my life pawn star
Many years ago you made me feel so good
You knew that when no one understood
Cause you're my pawn star
Haey, hey, hey, hey uh
And you could never be my wife, trick

Yo I reign supreme, champion back off
Shorty's a five start porner
Turn tricks, wants some dick inside her
Work the spread eagle like National Enquirer
Pussy lips grips the neck of Coke bottles
And turn style will have you nibblin' on a nickel
All of a sudden out came the shackel
Shell ain't go no problem with
You can be my...

Who Do U Worship?,De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,"Ah! What a beautiful day in the concrete jungle. I think I'll go down to Calliope and just be a fucking dickhead!

Damn, I feel good today. I look forward to going in and just beating the shit out of somebody and taking their money. What a fucking great job I have

I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music? Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that I just hate everybody. Damn it, it has to be that
Life is grand, life is great. I need myself a real cheap date. Some woman I can take to McDonald's, spend a dollar twenty-five on and have, like, the best time of your life with afterwards. Life is too good to believe sometimes. But we all can't have it the way I do. So to all you suckers out there, kiss off. All right? Bye bye",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-who-do-u-worship-lyrics

All them things she got, she got from you
Manolo and Prada's her style
Louis, Burberry by the pile
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you

Yo she know you come to do it, so what'cha want
Candelight might flick at'cha
Put your credit card to it, she know what to flaunt
Her handle tight like a master
She used to taunt on the runway, yeah she's down to tree
The avenue like her catwalk
Struck a bit to the gunplay, that housing street
Looks to die for, ask that chalk man for yo' hand
Spend it, you live to show
All the cash that you can burn
What you need is to end it, cause you give the dough
But get no ass back in return {*HA, HA HA*}
Stay laughin', straight at you dawg
Best believe, you wastin' time
Don't deny what's happenin', just clear the fog
And achieve you a peace line, yo it goes like

Shopping bags, they weigh down her arm
Popping tags and collars her charm
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you
She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it
She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it

Her frame goes beyond thick, she got you stunned
Livin' it up off the pop hits
Like a dame on a Bond flick
, she's not the one
To give it up 'til you cop shit
Just because she's stacked right, she got your soul
Her every wish you now obey
You should be on that actright, but she got control
She say jump you scream, ""Okay! I'm reloaded!""
Nigga you shootin' blanks
Tryin' to front like you got game
Her crib is sugar coated, like she lootin' banks
But it's your wallet she done claimed
When the limit of your plastic, reaches the end
You start payin' for your time
She'll be in it for the last bit, of money to spend
{*HA, HA HA*} And you'll be left with dimes
While she fillin' up

Shopping bags, they weigh down her arm
Popping tags and collars her charm
All them things she got, she got from you

Verbal Clap,The Grind Date,2004.0,"""You out there? Louder!
Well clap your hands to what he's doing
On tempo Jack""

NYC gave you the ball, so how you gonna hate us?
We creators of them East coast stars
If you ask me I'll tell you there's no comp
But I'm still humble, even though I will crumble halls
Some call 'em songs, I call 'em words from me
That take long to cook
So some feel free in sayin' that we don't hunger for beats
Not that we not hungry, just picky in what we eat
Keep food off the mind and keep weight off the body
All you gotta do is keep my name out your mouth
And stop frownin' like you hostile
You know that it's a booger rubbin' up against your nostril
Nigga, how you figure you can play this rap game without the backbone?
It's Maseo, Dave, Wonder Why, givin' what you lack holmes

Aiyyo p83repare yo'self for the Neutron, bitch!
This is '86, let that neo-rap go
We present these flares to put fire to your ears
To lay smoke like rusty exhaust pipes
We run mics, let Sean run the marathon
Yo raise that money son, we raisin these kids
Get claps when curtains close, stage left
Up your stamina baby, bring some breath
SAT book smart, part 'ese
Loc'in like Tone, street niggas get grown
Acquire more couth before you get poofed
Or get some shells sent over to your mic booth
Excuse, my delivery, but when peace don't work
See this piece gon' work, cock aim and SHOOT!
It's my constitutional right to bear arms
Arms and bare hands on mics, make fans unite
Woodstock and white folks involved
Black man get on yo' job!

""Well clap your hands to what he's doing
On tempo Jack""

Let's go beat for beat, and rhymes for rhymes
(put, all, the things aside)
Just bring your beats, and bring your rhymes
(put, all, the things aside)

The heavyweight L.I. brother with no date, of expiration
On this fate on the mic, them birthday keep comin'
I'm hated on by niggas I love most
So what threat could you possibly pose when I'm on your coast?
So raise your guns or your glasses
Either way there'll be a toast in the air
Markin' the return of bare minimums you need to learn
Get your verbs right when you down to clap

See that gun powder calibre rap'll tip hats like gentlemen do
Smash tenements and skyscrapers
Bow-tie papers stacked high
Pay the resident tax or get your street sweeped
Front row, backstage or the cheap seats
I +Dodge+ richochets like +Ram+ trucks, you slow poke to pull it
And I sup-pose you wanna top the Billboard chart
Man I toast these rhymes and then pop like Pop-Tarts

No,The Grind Date,2004.0,"I never can say goodbye
No no n-no I, never can say goodbye
I don't, I-I don't know the rest

We those pros, we never procrastinate (ah)
Them guardians they shouldn't let you get past the gate
Watch out dawg, the watchdog's showin his teeth
(Guess you bit too much shit) they bitin your beat
While I speak from experience, hunger and hurt
And a little bit of hate from niggas doin me dirt
I just wash it all out with Tide and show love
To those who ride with me while I'm puttin in work

Full-timin it, 8:30 to 6, the graveyard shift
The three months before the benefits hit
But my position went temp' to perm'
I sat and listened like an intern watchin who applied get fired
Now I'm sittin in the break room, they gotta make room (make room)
My paper stacks, put staples through 'em
So I can keep my money together
Some die-hard fans just don't want it like, ""Put Pos back on it""

I'm back on it, that's why you never disappointed
We give you what we live through for real (for real)
Don't own a crown but I'm royalty
And tryin to see the royalty checks about a half a mil'
Whether off or on the chart, my cuts grips your heart
(You know we got you open) like your gut splits apart
I never pass the buck, my shoulder holds the weights
So don't beef when we don't pass collection plates

I don't give money, I don't support the needy
Schooled in America, taught to be greedy
And everything ought to be, easy
But I never could say goodbye to my friends who get high
Wonder Why, I'm rockin with that guy, it's serious
Still make him cry when the satire's hilarious
Cold for your areas, flows come in various shapes and sizes
So hot that you despise it
 + (Yummy)
Never last up to bat (no no no no)
These skills we don't lack (no no no no)
We never fall and pray (no no n-no no)
Make all the ladies say (ooh ooh baby)
You can't knock the hustle - not at all (no no no no)
Can't be budged by your muscle (no no no no)
Never ridin on E (no no n-no no)
It's De La and Butta V (drive you crazy)

Yo, if you are what you eat; some of you
Cats heads between your girl's legs a lot cause y'all act too sweet
(Go brush your teeth!) Then after that
Put in a little more practice on your rhymin attack
What you write's not the least bit hot
Maybe cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop
Hate to hate a playa but you know what?
I still smother ya like cheese and broccoli's freshly cut

And we the steak and potatoes and De La's the greatest
And ladies be on the floor thankin the Lord that He made us
I'm tellin you, I swoop her like a pelican do
You sayin - 
look at that pelican fly
; you spittin gelatin rhymes
They shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit
We the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful
Your imitation flavor is tofu
It's true we make our bed all day, and we are..

.. the world of rap! Take you back
In the days of all four hundred ways that people lack
It's that (what) authentic, big-nosed mic music
Four to five survive all night to it
I'm tryin to keep up with my Jones' and Thomas'
'til I'm broke like them New Year's Eve promises
And that's alright, I just penned another sixteen
To fill my bank account with the mixed greens

Moms want 5's and 10's
The girls I got is 9's and 10's, VH1 ""Behind The Pens""
You anticipate greatness from elder statesmen
I ch-ch-ch-AHH, like Biz Mark' or Jason
I bust one shot just to start the racing
The tortoise and the hare, which one there is chasin?
Slow and steady, we already Andretti
Get ticket take parades, waves and confetti and..
 w/ minor variations
 Come on y'all

Sh. Fe. MC’s,Clear Lake Audiotorium,1994.0,"(Check it out, y'all)

We are here to tell the world just who we are
Shocking female
 (MC's, MC's), shocking female (MC's, MC's)

No need for, introductions, cause I know you know my name and
Knocking MC's out the frame and, putting them suckers to shame and
I live for hip-hop, so I have no time for fun and games and
So just come and peep the unique styles that we're displaying
The beat's just ridiculous, the lyrics articulate
Feels good, as if a girl had just touched her clitoris
Sucker MC's, I'm killing 'em, I'm so sick of seeing 'em
Silly (shit) when they rhyme, like that red rugby shirt worn by Gilligan
Plus the hat, they (shit) is wack
When you see me coming take ten steps back
I make usage of the pronouns, adjectives, verbs
My granny says ""You always had a way with words""
And that's because my word is bond, lyrics are laws
Sucker MC's look at me like a friggin' eye sore

Here comes a brother hipping others on the style they lack
I've always rhymed abstract
I even know 
the brother named Abstract
I am the earner of the soul and mind
Forget the physical cause the physical will die with time
I'm shaped to vibrate indefinite proportions
Of the kids who need the fix (Just listen to the mix)
I got the knowledge constant non-stop for the rubbishing
Like (niggas) using Clinton loops as if they owned the publishing
Gums be bleeding from illegal feeding on my verb
I bring the Mardi Gras to your face
I outwit vipers in my rhyme cipher
I can easily lick them cause they're victims of the subconscious race
Tossing periods in front of foes reps
It's not the 187 when the 360 slept
You swallow the cake from the plate of elevate
Or you might get sparked by the crew who got the weight
So resuscitating rap like the hicks do with Presley
Is the kid who peeled the jeans in Orleans off of Leslie
Sh. Fe. MC number nine, if you let me rhyme nine times infinitely I will climb
I let my 
Walkman from Sony
 play 
cassettes from Rabboni
Which guarantees to put me on the narrow road
Ayo, that's it from me, Plug 3, and Ali explode!

When I rhyme, the effect just ripples
You sound sick, I hope your cells get sickles
And formulate into real stiff (shit)
Then I bet that (niggas) cut the chit chit
Cause the Ab will, be sharper than a Ginsu
Cutter or your bum (ass) head for the gutter
This is not a game and we ain't looking for the fame
That's not the aim, we came to rip the jam out the frame
My inter-reaction with paper is amazing
So needless to say mad trails are left blazing
A whole lot of bull(shit) rhymes start to get play
But I'm here to say that real rhymes do pay
I'm the type of brother that writes until my knuckles get nary
And through the domepiece, the rhymes will carry
Then transported to my throat then the quotes hit the air
As I stand dipped with the wares
Rhymes get slot times, move back from the jack
It's the verbal constructor, some MC's is wack
I make a girl do the bogle, doo doo brown and all
Make (niggas) jump up, drink Dom, and have a ball
I animate the unlively with the verbal combat
The Abstract, never the wack
Motivator of the many like Moses
Moving through, bringing danger to the dummies that poses
That means you, the sub relator of the sub culture
Wack (nigga) vulture, I swoop down on crowns
Cause confusion all around
Mental burdens I bring to MC's who sing, they sad songs
Money, your dough's not long
Mines on the other hand is lengthy type
The Abstract gets real, real, real...

Real down to Earth I hit the Long Island Rail
You never see me tango with the horn and the tail
I got the kit for your mind I design it like Zender
Smoking mad hope from my neighbors, and da
50/50 luck takes the ""S"" off my chest
Cause the ""S"" on my chest makes a mess
Settling for Superman, stupid man, put on your glasses
Now your asses be slow gassin' like molasses
Continue the menu, next on the platter
Hey where that (bitch) at? (He's right here boy!)
I gotsta see what I got and who I'm getting it with
This ain't no nickel dime game that I'm peddling with
Mikey Roads said ""Stop riding, it be dividing
Taking me out how I be vibing""
(Niggas) actin' hard like gristle
But my pops got the pistol
Told me if I ever need it just *whistle*
Respects to Griff Dog for the razor
Much respects to Joe Buck for the favor
It's about a million brothers trying to be MC's in this world
I'm glad I got a baby girl",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-sh-fe-mcs-lyrics

If you crossin' my line, nigga do the same
I' guaranteed to run through and prove the game
Ain't bigger than the pieces in it
You see the pieces in it had me stuck travelin' one side of map
Clappin' hands with rap cats who ain't deserve dap
Long hauls and livin' out a suitcase man
Chickenheads and gangs of fruitcakes man
Ain't nothin' better than explorin' the outskirts
Especially when she ain't got no pantyhose on, and it's on

Kids - Okay

I remember when Mama spoke of the birds and
The east side kept me off the curb and
Betsy Ross was sufferin from the scaredy cat
Till my man Ricky brought the remedy for that

I massage your mink, coat
Then part your leg's rope
And stroke so hard you'll start to smell smoke

Ain't gotta drug problem but a love problem
But then again that may be one in the same
I claim possession
Pull the girl among the eighth like Charlie Heston
Ride off on the horse and show no remorse

She look niiice
Honey oriental, brown eyes
Want friiiies?
Chicken, vegetable, fried rice
And I'm tryin to  you to go
Fast subtraction, grab some
""Oh don't stop nasty black man""

Man that action had me coughin up cars, keys, and cash
Just to sniff a fat rabbit I would give my very last

You know them boys will come runnin
(When nature calls)
You know them girls don't mind comin
(When nature calls)
You know them boys will come runnin

You know them girls don't mind comin
Just to get it started, for startin something
Is what we do to get some lovin
What we do to get some lovin
This what we do for love (do for love)
This what we do for love (for love)
This what we do for love

You ain't lyin
I 9-5 it, more like 12-12
Can't get the thought off (sex)
From off my mental shelf

I'm like Bruce Lee
Beatin up the cootchie profusely
My tomboy chicks that act a little to butchy
Recieve this (uh)
When my semen ceases
They'll be screamin out, ""We love bein the female species""

Hello?
Veronica, it's Dove
Uh, I think you got the wrong number
What?
Veronica, your baby's crying
Yo, chill
Baby?
Whatever yo, later

For the past two summers I been sizin up Veronica
Southern belle, I heard she blow notes like a harmonica
Yarmulkes couldn't satisfy her spendin fetishes
She was all about gettin the head like she was lettuces

Yah, them types be actin like they ain't sleazy

Like this uptown chick playin opposite of easy
Delighted, the honey fly difficult, couldn't knife it
Tiiight
Seen the imprint on honey's private
Now she's love sick
Ruler Rick scoress agaaaaain

Sex present itself like trophies I'm out to win
And it's easier to claim with the fame I've obtained
Her mommy was a liar, she's so ashamed


Well, I got this rude boy Jamaican honey at the rest home
Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on
Whatever
Been around, stuck her till she poppin bout
""Hey take your blood clot finger off me bottom""
Anyway, another dime I met one time
I'm kiiind, chick in the world, butt fine
And her, structure pumpin, told her
Gotcha mumblin bout
""Slow down, what you tryin to rupture somethin?""

I don't bug out, I chill
Never copped a feel
But these pretty ass girls come and flaunt in the grill
Big ass eyes, with the matchin big ass thighs
Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies
""But you got a girlfriend""

Yah trick, so do you
And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do

So stop playin so squeaky clean
And let the dirty side see me later
So we can play 'let's wake the neighbours'

So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors
Second episode, and you returnin oral favors
Buyin up groceries
Searchin for hosiery
Holdin hands publicly
And now you supposed to be
Mr. and Mrs. huh, lovin and kisses huh?
But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her
Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen
So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-what-we-do-for-love-lyrics
Set the Mood,Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump,2000.0,"Now check it (sup?)
Let me set the mood here aight? (yeah aight cool)
We gonna, set it off with In-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee, -deed
(Yeah that's right) You know
La-la-la-la-ladies first and all that
(That's right ladies first)
So peep it, you see this girl
Who been poppin' mad shit about you
So I want you to get into it a little bit
I want you to cru-cru-cru-crush that ?? flirt

I was sittin' on my lunch break, grittin' my teeth
It's the last day of the week, man what a relief
My arms are sore as hell, I felt rigid and stiff
So I turned around and I rolled this big fat spliff
That's when I seen her, steppin' out a rented yellow Beemer
This local ghetto fame rap cat her name was Tina
She was braggin' she was goin' on tour
The same shit she was screamin' since the year before
Ever since the De La Soul video, she seen me on the TV
Heard that she was holdin' a grudge and tryin' to see me
Workin underground circuits and mad cyphers of people
When she asked who was ill, all she got was Indeed
She wanna battle (what?) and it wasn't hard to tell
All that I was thinkin' 'bout was tryin' to smoke my L
I had four hours left and I was tired as hell
Plus it was 12:55 almost time for the bell
She had an ill screwface look, fronting like she’s no joke
Gangsta bitch profile, boppin' like her leg broke
Forty-below Timbos, fatigues saggin'
Pullin all her money out her pocket while she's braggin'
On her gold fronts with her name on it
Her ice finger roll hand g-low while she claim fame on it
I peeped the stee', then I crushed her with ease
Just for interruptin' me while I was rollin' my trees

AIGHT? (Whoo!)
That shit was bla-bla-bla, bla-blaze! (word)
Now we gon' se-se-set, se-set this one up
For my man Mercenary (aight aight yo let's do this)
(Whassup?) Yo, I don't want you to make it like
A story or nothin' (aight)
I just want-want, want want-want
Want you to come on some straight rhy-rhy-rhyme
Rhy-rhy, rhy-rhme shit, rip a nigga in his ass!
And let him know how we do it, y-y-y'know?

Now Maseo puff cheeba, while Rich sniff lines
David J push the whip while Candy Cal pull dimes
And me right behind, with the shorty gettin' her math
To do the Savion routine and just, tap that ass
Still the one who kill wackness, man I left them niggas crippled
Had em all soft to hard back to soft like a nipple
My Art is Official while you're art-ificial
Break you down to your very last participle
Let me enlighten you, cause your third eye's on dim
Me gettin' taken out is rare like a smile from Rakim
See I'm remarkable, you're just bull
Last name shit, y'all niggas need to quit
Open your mitt, and catch this
I autograph every word you bit
??Testify then?? take your picture
Got an infinity of non-rhymes to hit ya
While your whole clan is bland
Understand that you must be smokin' pounds of weed out of a pipe
And mistook your munchies, for bein' hungry for the mic
And now you have to deal with these cats who's truly real
Like estates with a pit on the lawn bark at the gates
Put the whole entire plate in your face
Make the point like who's that on that joint? It's me
I'm in everything you see like cran', yo I'm in demand
I'm in the club man I'm in your hand
Bein bought, I'm even in the thought from your girl
The only thing you're in is inactive
Your world'll be smashed
Run against the Won and you'll be last
Like that call for alcohol, depletin' your cash

That's how you supposed to get in somebody ass

Ah with my ""ah one two"" I substitute about a loop
So let me serve with the slope, with the Plug of two scoops!

Mr. Miyag' never did dip for Dove
Bootleggers my legs and, grit about a hug
And who gets the Motts, I knots by the chance
I rain-dance.. I rain-dance
But steppin just a bit I don't need another shadow
Makes makes, is gonna be the new man's motto
Don't increase the bull, because my pulley is broken
And my belly is full
It's a second I reckon on the bone and the ball
Makin London bridges fall, so check it
I bring a point to the joints that we change and chop
But we could bring it back to the beatbox!

I'm Posdonus Plug Wonder.. plotter
Serenade her cause I gotta.. record
When in the womb I was naked.. now I
Chill with latex cause of how I, enter
The black wood without a splinter

I had the chills what helps in movin, asses
Saw the light cause I got glasses, so we
Sip the cappucino slowly

I'sah makes the big money!
I drive big

Cars
, serve the bubble like a bar.. tender
When in flight like a sender, lace
Sticks of dynamite on bass, head

Lace the shoe until he dead

Run! Cause the cop is gonna come
This my Plug style

So they can kiss my, grits
Hold my balls without a mitt.. grab
The mouthpiece to talk the dag.. nabit

If it's true..

WELL CATCH A FEVER FROM THE JUNGLE
Chocolate, nubian girls flock to it, sweets
And if I can't sample beats, get the
Beatbox equipped with the, dirt
BizMark and Doug E. works, fine
Mase work the wheel I tangle lines, HARK
The light is thirsty in the dark
So we..
* BizMarkie beatboxing while De La Soul chants the words ""I'll beatbox"" *

It's like I saw it in the river but my M wasn't fixed
Super heavy like a Chevy pump a Maseo mix
I had some screams in my pockets, and played it kinda hush
And did the outs (
got to check out, the avenue
)
I peeped the ?? Zoah ?? on the gimme gimme, plus we hit the plat'
Then the amps was on samp's, the villains got fat
The Natives weren't the neighbor then to, NIGGA PLEASE
It's a hustle for a joint when your settlement G's
But we still be on the wax because it acts like that
We still be on the moves because it moves like that
So there ain't no reason to don't stop
Cause we can bring it back to the beatbox!

That isn't an option, our theme is to be currency kings
Thoroughbred, NYC borough bred
We barrel through dirt and cracked open cement
These lines with pen, while I was semi-bent
The innocent Smilez {?} broke when he shook it
Remind me when my Grandma used to say my way need a brace
Cause my ways used just seems so crooked
The little black terror had a ball-bearer watcher

Peep out the transition
The ammunition that we shooting is ambition
And implanted inside every history book
We the crew who travel to every cranny and nook
Of the free world, freeing girls from they mate

She move her head back and forth instead of side to side

The one that jump inside of and make love to your mind

A Vancouver lady, Amsterdam boy
Sent to the earth to ambush at five point one
Radio decks I revamp cassettes
It's that digital age, ma protect your credit card
Plastic dope on lasso rope on
Cowboy-style like giddy-up, she get forever
Perky like morning coffee
Skin dark like coffee, bitch get off me
Fixed her mouth to mouth off and she lost me in that
Eve of the night, a plate of Monte Cristo, skip the disco
We leave in the night, rules don't apply the theives in the nights
Steal hearts like crooked card decks, with more facts
Show her more moeny on the budget, you gotta love it
Screams take flights like spaceship's at nights
Now count it off, T minus
Reunited after degrees on September
The leaves begin rushing, the Earth'll felt for it
Scores of faces, so we rock the bells for it
Now the horses shouldn'ta done me like that, I make sure we got

Aligned arrays retired all in the days

Got rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes
I got a million like rhymes leavin' ya stung
I got my own crew called the nasal tongues!

Well yeah I got these fishes swimmin' round my barracuda
Back in '82 I used to ride a street scooter
Called em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep em level, and
Smack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle (owww!)
Firm on the mic since my days of a child
Got a ""License Too Ill"" to flash to police
The only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys
Bringin ""Noise"" like P.E. to your TV
Ayo this beat's barefoot and knock-kneed
Stripped to the rhyme!
And every line made from scratch
Attached like stripes to shell-toes
Thin spools that hold the herb
Mike what's the word? (WORD!)
It's like the ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la
Rhymin over old breaks like the Mardis Gras
Party people cross and bump they go ooh and they ahh

Album:  Joe's Apartment soundtrack
Song:   Dreams of the Funky Towel

In rap goes apartment leave your chart bent off of hits
And catch mad love with a mix
Scream on fire like grits, and make sure the shine spits
Do away with all ignorance
Look out for the roaches and the pits Mr. Burns beware

I be the Mr. Bern like the Bernstein Bears
Keep it Sloppy like Joe, cuz Joe don't care
But as long as I maintain savoirfaire
And the bums on the street chump change I spare
Keep it slick like James Brown hair, do
Keep it raw like the Z Ave crew, true
The temperature's high up, or H-D
If the last thing's a booger you can't count on me
I'm a give a cockroaches, Mos Definitely

Now the apartment is getting kinda hot up in here
I guess a De La Soul jam's been placed in your ear
Added sugar to the thoughts of the inner-city circle
Who might have to hurt you on a night that's late
When you're in the wrong town picking up your date
I guess your date wasn't set on having you for a mate
Chorus: Dove
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I, to disagree?
I travelled the world and the seven seas
And everybody, say it's gotta be funky

We be the Suns party people rotate around the fun
(It's Plug One) One never played no guns
I specialize in never putting wool over the eyes
This is the tower of stain that wouldn't be surprised
If you didn't apply it to the ordinary skin
I'm a MC in love with the way-back-when
Match pens to pad, I be Ayamo's dad
Doing laundry to clean up on reality's fad

Now we in a sticky situation but we make it FON-KAY
And bring it back to the days of watching PU-NKY
Brewster, used ta, be in L.I. flats
With the bricks, jibbin this and that, upon tracks

We came to thank kids, not the blankets, but the towel
Shed love with the verb and the vowel
Move grooves like a bowel, De La representer
See funky is the way we keep it settin in your dreams like that
Chorus 2X
Teah yeah, gonna keep it real for the apartments in your area
Yeah, gonna move it like this everybody just funk in your area

Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sippin'
CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize
Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

Yo, you better recognize and try to analyze this
Hand over fist - how can a man act like a bitch?
Change and switch, snitch on his crew

Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll somethin'
One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole somethin'

Drawin' the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I won it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet (shhhhh)
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name

I rip it from home to L.A
With connectin flights to rip it elsewhere

Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand

(C'mon!) You makin' diss songs?  Spit that rhyme my way
I can shut y'all niggas down like the Y-2-K
I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe
We on the same vibe, cause real niggas coincide
(""Right-right-right.."") The situation is drastic
But see songs like these is why this album goin' classic

This is for the DJ, bring it back one time
I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme
I'm old school like my dad is
So add this, to your collect', Plug Won, who the baddest?

Ayo we theme park status, upstage these niggas like Gladys
Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire
Blamin' they legs, while I'm claimin' these tunes
In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms

Yeah - we flat out classic, separate the real from the plastic
And I ain't gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is makin' sure that Hollywood burn
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggas
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back
De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that
And what you know about us droppin' ya
And leavin' you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera?

What you know about my writes? (my writes)
What you know about what's weak, what's tight?
And what you know about an off night? (Uhh)
What you know about niggas frontin' for the light?
And what you know about them gun fights? (Gun fights, baby)
Got a nigga duckin while them girls show fright
What you know about my writes? (my writes)
Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)
Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been breifed:
NO BEEF, JUST PARTY!
Of course your gonna have some clown niggas try to
Take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned but its known
That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down!
Tight security and its still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed
Cause the floor's filled with action and we don't need
Any distractions tonight ya'll

Introduce me to your madaam ?Mauzel?
I'm Tarzan and she's my gazelle
I live at Biggs and say its notorious
Travel through minds, emotions and euphorias
Glorious (echo) as I get great (echo)
Still kinda smooth like way back in my old school tapes
I bring it pronto
Rep the BX like Billy Blanco

Treat your troubles like colds
Sweat it out, get it out
So we can get in the right mode
Let it out
No need to pull on the throttle
If I could bottle this love I wouldn't hesitate
Get it straight
Wonder why I can medicate the soul
While takin' its toll
Just for Simply (Simply!) Havin'(Havin'!)
The right record that could bring in the pull
And this must be the right run ya'll

Standing on the corner building. Seen the path
Looking at the corner streetlight, walking, and
Waiting for my brother to come over and then
Someone tapped me on my shoulder. 180 degrees I
Did. Oh my... what? Oh oh!
I didn't hesitate so I ran and I ran and I ran
And I ran and I tried to catch a cab
(Cab driver, fuck you)
I ran into an abandoned building, I heard big
Heavy breathing on my back I turned 180 degrees
Again and oh oh! Oh my God!
Oh, I dashed and I dashed and I dashed and I
Skipped into the BK lounge. I asked the lady if
I could get a Whopper. She was facing... she was
Facing toward the back. She turned around...
She stated: (Can I take your order?) Oh Chrissie!
Once again, I dashed and I dashed and I dashed
To my pad. The phone started ringing, but
Luckily my answering machine was on and with
The quickness...
(Hey, how ya doing, sorry you can't get through)
Yeah, saved by the ha ha ha. I went into the
Shower. Oh my... I heard the holler... I turned
The water on and she was screaming... who could
It be? What did she want from me? What did she
Want from me? What did she want from me? She
Was screaming and screaming and she had the tape
In her hand. But I knew what she wanted. I knew
What she wanted. I knew what she wanted

Got a sea of hands wavin', ain't misbehavin'

Cause it's nothin' wrong gettin' your bubblin' on sticker
But too much bubblin' can make you fizz quicker

Tryin to shake the money off the limbs so I can do me

Dancefloor it after Mase brings you out of the break

To all those folks out there that been supportin De La since '89

I cultivate moves larger than that
And I don't ball too much, ya dig
I gotta ball and chain at my crib who want my ass home

But can't adapt to where I'm at
And even though I sing it sick 'til I'm blue, I'm not a crip
So unlike non-GANG members I won't C-walk to look hip
But if I had to join a gang I think I'd join GangStarr
Me, Guru and Primo with them beats for the car
That bounce trampoline style, revamp the deen child
Hot and mild and I hustle rap the same

Can't be denied the bout for the title
Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol

Come on Down,The Grind Date,2004.0,"Look man! You're botherin me G
I got shit to do right now, aight?
This is for De La Soul, y'knahmsayin?
Word up I got shit to do you test tube baby! {*laughing*}
Check one two, check one two
De La Soul, is now back on the map
Long Island, is now back on the map
Good rap music, is now back on the map
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin nowhere
Old school is here to stay BOY!
 + (Flava Flav)
On the outskirts, of what works
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked
Live by the sword and die by the semi
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my
N.Y. mentality for me to be the best
The current, the ones who weren't
Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
To sell to all who wanna hear some
(Young'uns these days got fireproof eardrums!)
They don't give a SHIT who's hot
Just long as you're not, pussy, and be the would-be King
But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down
(And what makes the world go 'round!!)
And I be the world renowned Wonder Why
Wonderin why you can't stand me
Is it because I'm the main Jackson
And y'all just Titos and Randys? (Yes, it is!)
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last
At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin you how us Native Tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes since gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy just settin it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin, got a degree in braggin
My daughter says I'm a teen, cause like a teen
My pants always saggin and I walk with a bop
The sag's part of my time, my walk from my pops
No longer on Tommy 
and was never on Loud
But cooked rhymes that make the Chefs of Wu proud
I'm top cloud to rain on your show
And still ""anything goes when it comes to hoes"" because

Music (c'mon) New York (c'mon) Detroit (c'mon) c'mon down!
Miami (c'mon) L.A. (c'mon) Vegas (c'mon) c'mon down!
Boston (c'mon) Tucson (c'mon) Long Island (c'mon) c'mon down!

Make you shake like, sunshine, naked shoe was once mine
Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids
Fix your playground player or some kids'll
Come stomp in your sandbox, swollen hands cocked back
No knives, no drama, no guns
No disrespectin your seed or Ma Dukes
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff
Of these fricaseed raps on Carribean riffs
See last night's change was today's dough money
No time for your freestyles so roll money
No more whack albums with two joints
No more ballplayin rappers who shoot ya two points
(No more G cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!)
Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
Switchhittin niggas will receive no pitches
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real
Simple, see the God flows healthy
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
Thank you for your purchases, we dough out
And roll out the Kool-Aid, {?} see us pimp strut
Ain't really pimpin, I'm tryin to catch the bus
The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush!
We dolly dolly babies cause we shootin cats
'Back to the Future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin it
And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin it
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
The mush-in-your-room son, we stay portobello
Can't settle for the same picket white fence
I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa
Still push the truck with the factories pa
I'm bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out, make 'em shout

D.C. (c'mon) Oakland (c'mon) U.K. (c'mon) c'mon down!
New Orleans (c'mon) Little Rock (c'mon) B-More (c'mon) c'mon down!

Yeah that's right! Flava Flav, with De La Soul
Act bold, and we knock you straight up in the hole
Y'knahmsayin? Six feet deep, that's the way that we keep, rollin
Y'knahmsayin? Operation tech sensation in the nation
Ready to take it to Penn Station, y'knahmsayin?

Am I Worth You?,AOI: Bionix,2001.0,"Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah

It's a pity that you're so dirty
Worthy of some Southern hoes-pital
See we them Northern boys with nose and hows
NYC livin' ain't nothin' like it
See how me and my peeps fit, we jigsaw
Sometimes I play big saw to cut the deal
And we keepin' them bills paid with meals in the mouths of many
A noble job at Feni
Money ain't everything but everything makes me want it
But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers
Act like game on the dice on the mic device
Stay above middle class for life
Not an easy task but I've grown to love it
Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin
While I speak to my mens about the world problems
And girl problems with no immediate way to solve em'
But I'm on the case

I make the best of the life I be with it
Making the most of the moment among the livin'
And it feels good
Being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Now I'm asking am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you

Pull them quarters down
I got some things on these nine ounces to vamp
Me on a mission y'all
Dug fresh dirt out the ground
Lookin' for the treasures in life
A bambino picket fence around the residence
I wore these shackels here for thirteen years
But the only real slaves is the ones we record on
We off all checks and God's blessin'
Tryin' to own a thousand island like we salad dressin'
Patience for the main course
Don't have me in position to remain boss
Cause the man next to the man above the exec
Don't give a damn if I papered yet
Sometimes it make me wanna go make a bet
I did away with knock em' and release some stress
By any means, these petty greens will only get me stuck in a box
Doin' a dick shot in Oz, jerkin' off in the J
But anyway I keep my head on


I know people who tippy-toe through they own stompin' ground
Master not makin' a sound to stay safe
From the local star renaissance
And the response is usually the same
Wishin' like it used to be
Nothin' in that life is new to me
We roll like eyes on a ghetto girl
Brushin' off some no-man cause she's his ghetto pearl
We into livin' beyond not livin' fads
Me and my comrads became dads young
Try to have fun amongst responsibility
Like fillin' these accounts full
Got caught up at a party in Bull's
Sometimes gotta have the nerve to say some rhymes
Because some minds take offense
Try to make ya life tense but we still here
Still gainin' the love, still standin' above most",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-am-i-worth-you-lyrics

Who,Smell the DA.I.S.Y,2014.0,"Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up and let’s get ill
(Hey yo, get your ass up and let’s get ill)
That’s right y’all, we more than rough, we callin’ your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes…

Don’t scandalize mine, I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin' for crime, halt! Who goes there?
Well it’s the squeeze of five fingers puffin' Smokey the Bear
Shinin’ black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare
While I’m rockin’ it, I rock in it
Like a little ball inside spray cans provide
Three coats for both child, woman and man
God bless the God, lay these streets wall to wall
We go “oooh!” (world famous)
You got popped like a flick by the rivalry clique and went “oooh”
It ain’t my fault your ass is on the asphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam
Thought you brought harm, you see
We iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cooks, y’all just rooks to me
Slidin’ up and down courts, I don’t like you can D
Why, try? Maseo be sky high
Since Luke was Luke Skywalk, my topic of talk
Is sheddin' shame all over your game, it’s life
Afrocentric love they must have passed drug
A life filled with (guns) that’s what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
Man, they muffle your voice man
So when I’m swimmin’ through the joint, I put the funk on hold
If you don’t, you see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with big lips for that ass to kiss
Most crews are post-current while we’re forever
Direct beats that’s contagious, love for all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity of hard hittas for real
I got peoples in the street that would blast your ass for this beat and go “oooh”
If you a big girl gettin’ your love between sheets, go “oooh”
Put your hands opposite to the ground if you lovin’ the sound
And go “ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh!” (how do I work this?)
Uh, Marvin? (Oooh!)",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-who-lyrics

The Art of Getting Jumped,Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump,2000.0,"I was on my way, to the disco
You know the club, Maseo was rockin' rub that night
Midnight to four, name at the door
But the whole crew I can get in as well
So I got on my cell, called my nigga C. Smith
Let this be a jam that we need not miss
""Yeah I'm already en route,"" no doubt
Might even jump up on the mic
To make sure that this party's turned out
And we some punctual types, on time, look for the line
To stand we find girls screamin' the blues
Miscellaneous shoes everywhere
""Yo Mase, what happened here?""
(""Go Brooklyn!"") Yo Brooklyn, y'all know the rules
Bump  people and out come the tools
Ain't been a fair fight since the creation of crews
And that's why them dudes hearts all pumped
Done closed the club down
'Cause one of they niggas got jumped
(Jump, jump, jump to it!)
Uh-huh, you heard the hook
No matter you Braveheart or shook
You can catch a bottle from the right, tap to the left
Kicks to the mids relievin' you of breath
I seen it done sloppy, seen it organized
Some saw it comin' and for others it was surprise
Catch a swollen eye and blood loss, courtesy of the

Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!

Yo!  When they put the contracts out, bats and chairs included
Chicks can get into it, 'specially pretty broads
My New York City dawgs seem to master the art
When you hear the (""whoo!"") that's when the bullshit'll start
It only takes a second less you got on ice
Just for wearin' your chain in they club, they'll beat you twice
Served with fried rice, you get a can of whoop ass
My only advice is don't fall and book ass
For the nigga who slip, don't fall in a position
Where your lip'll catch a hickie (girl, they'll fuck your mascara)
Shoot, go and ask Tara, just for havin' good hair
Man they left her ass cute, pulled it dead out the roots (ARRRGH!!)
It's never one or two of 'em, they headin' out in troops
Timbos, hoodies loose over jumpsuits
Waitin' for the first vic to disrespect
Catch a double-dutch rope around your neck in the midst of the

Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!

It's schematically plotted out to break hearts and bodies
And ya best believe we came to party
Don't cause trouble but still can find double the crew
Against you and your peeps and leap-like-frogs on ya
For reasons like - not in the right part of town
Actin like you wore a crown
Some occasions long and mean to earn the right
To throw signs wearin' only one color scheme
And bein; positive is no exclusion
That's an illusion, you can still catch contusions
For flossin' your hard-earned shine
I'm talkin' games  the longest
Then it's some other niggas time
You'll get beat out of your mind just for rage
Shit my black ass almost got pulled off stage
Just for holdin' it down on the mic, you could be talkin'
""Black people unite,"" and still catch a lump from the

Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!

Yo, it's this joint, called the art of getting jumped
We had to put this one on the album y'know?
Yeah, this is dedicated
To them punk motherfuckers out in Germany
That Turkish gang that jumped me up in the fuckin club
Tried to knock me senseless
They just couldn't get me though
That's why I second round outside on 'em
Pull out some fuckin guns, punk bastards
And that's why my ass was hidin' under the bridge (HAHAHAHA)",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-the-art-of-getting-jumped-lyrics
What Yo Life Can Truly Be,A Roller Skating Jam Named “Saturdays” (Single),1991.0,"Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be
Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be
Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be
Saturdays for you to see
What yo life can truly be

Son, sun is on thick, thick
One thought coming up quick, quick
Wishing that the days would come up six
Friday's the Red Alert radio mix
Then comes the day that nobody plays that
Punishment wish in the crib
Time to go chase the dibs
On a Saturday fiasco
Bright, bright, bright is the ears
All fun, game and no biz
Business, one naughty note
Rock the boat, don't rock the boat, baby
Jingle it, jingle it, jingle and swing
Here comes the just have fun that we bring
Don't debate, no, don't debate
Don't make me wait, just grab your roller skates

Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

Yo, yo, I'm up, out, moving all about
It's Saturday again? Eheh, no doubt
Where's my skate key? Yo where's my skates?
Ayo where's my huh—I mean, where's my date?
‘Cause if it is today
I see sunshine, I want to play
Fill up my shoes, pit stops Sunoco
Yo mister with the 50 cent cocoa
Ice, ice, me baby
Cause the Black Sheep Dres be up on the scene
Let the top down, turn up the sound
Got my hands in the air cause my drawers are clean

Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

Yo, now I got the rice cakes, I got the rice
Ridicule the roller if the skates don't suffice
Sustaining the honeys like the rim holding smoke
I was never good for fixing, so yo, I go for broke
Push up the pusher, but hold up on the pull
Cause Saturday's here and summer's holding like wool
So let it be known, I had to get flown
Unless Mase plays the Vaughan Mason I'm racing
Up the side, a little to the left
Got on the jacket so I'm cooking like a chef
But I'd rather be safe like my man safe sex
Cause a man without a plan is cancelled O’s on a check
But back on track, get the skates off the rack
Cause the best roller king is the new ladies mack
The '91 Sheep will supply the two
The Plug One will be fine, playing Saturday's fool

Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

Wait a minute, hook, you know you got the look
But don't play me out cause it's a Saturday and shit
Running 'round town while at home I sit
Staring at my boob tube
Listen to the box for a new groove
If I don't hear it then I get my spirit lifted
I sit and write a rhyme ‘cause I am that gifted
Got a five gear shifted in reverse
And I'm mista Quest pose with the De La verse
The Saturday is, uhm, rolling around
And oh it gets me waken out on the sound
Disrespected on days of the week
When the Saturday comes, that's when I hits peak

Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

Saturday's the day that bring me joy
Jumping in a hoop, pick up my boys
Shorty D, B Love, light with a big bite
Sparking up skunk, well alright
Sunoco put my tank all full
Before we’re out, Life, feed the pit bulls
Pit bulls, that's what the logo be
With the noun stuck for the K9 wreck
A Saturday's a day that can't be wasted
Air so fresh I can even taste it
Back in the hoop, give a toot-toot
Throw it in one, now here's the fun
Southern state with a freestyle tape
Headed to the rink, none of us can skate
See some cheese most-wanted on peep-out scheme
I train in mind with my team

Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

What the hula hoop's spinning for the chosen of ‘em
Yeah the Saturday's sure to be nice and lovely
Bzz, the honeybee sting brings cupid
Skins in here, make 'em run around buckstupid
Uhoh, yeah, chosen in there
So shake ya derriere
Now, the brother that you're peeping is thorough
And I cruise the streets in a red Montero
Pick up my crew and then we chop-chop make it
To the Quik Mart and get the blunts, cool
Laces come as next suggestion
With no question, if ends are guessing
Everybody bounce, skate, rolling and lighting it
And right about now, the honeybee be kited
Me and honeydip see eye to eye
And if I see bull, she'll walk on by
But that's not the style of the black child
Broke from the shine, I get it go on the show
We'll interfere, stick and steal be the deal
Come get with the sicker Saturday flow, yo

Have fun, have fun
Have, have, have fun

Friday be the fly day but Saturday be my day
I'm rolling with the Soul on skates, I can't wait
Time to let the good times roll, let's lose control
When Sunday come, we've got put it on hold
Feel the vibe, feel the bass, feel the treble in the place
Got your skates string up, so let's skate
For goodness' sake, don't take a break ‘cause it’s a Saturday
You’ll never know again if you’ll have another phatter day
Ride the rhythm and get with 'em for this fun day
It's not a whole week here to speak, it's just one day
So leave all your troubles behind
And come climb to the Saturday's rhyme

I worked all week, now it's time to relax
Searching for a honeycat I can mack
Wanna go to Great Adventures, all these places
But oh shit! Why not go to Laces?
Do a little rollerskate and bust my ass and all that
Crazy skins in the mix, I bring the jim hats
Lounging with the fellas, system booming in the car
Scoping out the honey with the D cup bra
Shout out to Aletta, know I wanna do her
Gassing like Eddy, now I know she's ready
Like Father MC, great is how I'll treat her
But I'll diss the ho if her name is Bonita

Yogurt to verse is what I fed
Slipped a note, rocked my yacht

Jenny, only thought about Jenny
But didn't think about Derwin
The Jimmy who's only a virgin
Steady we go, Jenifa led
Plug and a tune was freedom well said
So what's the fix, oh Jenifa
Can a brother the soul get swingin'?

The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape

Transcripts showed more than flirt
'I love daisies' read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed

Shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust

Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried 'kick it'
Posdnuos was in
Jenny, only thought about Jimmy

Like some kid named Derwin?

My new dis was three days later
The door turned blue, you guess who

Teddy persuaded us to turn off the light
Wanted me to rhyme while she
Wrapped me up in a ball of twine
No more, I dispatched

For normal health I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught

Why miss?  Have you misread my shyness for conceit?
I'm peepin' how you move it to the pace of the beat
Got my eyes on wide as they constantly collide with yours
Your heavenly body rushin' the tide to shore
Your heavenly body rushin' these guys to the floor
To find pleasure in your double digit design
But these clowns look hurt
And as a woman's ex-nigga I'm a woman ex-pert
Understandin' how the ovaries and all that shit work
Extremely dreamy, my eyes you look surprised
That I'm movin' closer, don't be, I'm supposed to D.C
Are you for real or a tease?

Now let that drink set in sweet, we up close and personal
Ain't nothin' dull about this, sharp like Swiss precision

Teran escortin' us to V.I.P., we live in D.C
Shoestring dress I wanna fuck and make your hair look a mess
Suckin the straw huh?  You know the head game

I want my trophy life-sized in a see-through

On these plains is how we spread it around
But for now we in a party in Miami

That's gonna cause trouble
And she giving em for free so I can stay in her vicinity
I'm thrown by the stone on her finger

The People,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now
Usually when a party is given, right
It's given by a promoter, right
And the promoter has his own people distributing fliers and advertising to get people to come down to the party
But this time
The promoter that gave the party
He was so, like, down
And such a together brother, you know what I'm saying
We threw down with him
To try to make the party a little something
Now I don't know how many people remember who gave you a flier for the party
But if you didn't see it hanging up somewhere one of us probably gave it to you
Cause we was busting our ass giving these fliers out
Trying to get this thing, you know, a nice size for y'all

We are people yeah

We are the ones left to make due with the two hands the good Lord gave us
With no resources enthroned to the forces that be with no one to save us
The ones in the classroom where the books are outdated, teacher no longer outspoken
The ones left to congregate where the pusher gives a fix to those who had their dreams broken
The ones left to drown and rebuild the towns in the path of the waters from the levies
The ones with the problems of the world on they back to make light of the fact that the weight is getting heavy
We are the ones who have daughters and sons who commit themselves to having unsafe nights
The ones who lost family in 9/11 hours after telling them to have a safe flight
We are the one


We be the soul, the human core, the planet whose blood, sweat and tears even we take for granted
We the ones separated by wardens at international borders  to take government orders
We are the ones with the same childhood dreams but adulthood brings nightmares and screams
We be the raw excuse to slang, I mean, we the people they stereotype for gangs
Who sowed the seed for our daughters and sons, withstand the infiltration of drugs and guns
We are the ones who kneel to the young with a heart of gold to avoid being victimized by our sons
We be the ones trying to raise them into all man brothers got some whipping post from coast to coast
We are the people run down, lied to, cried to, still they depend on our culture to live and dance to
We are the people
Still the wretched of the earth
At the end of God's day
We persevere through the hurt
We are the ones


We are the world

Come on, Michael, that's a motherfucking lie
We the people at the fish fry
We the eighty six percent with heart disease
Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Nike shoes wearing, no banking accounts
No misbehaving, catching the blame
Same old same lotto playing
Looking to Obama for deliverance
But ever since they popped Malcolm and Martin
We at the front of the bus now, pouting
Complacence ain't nothing but a lazy man's sofa
You can see the whole scope 
With a video hostess hoe
We're emotional, but if we  I think we're supposed to roll
But we the same lying, cheating, backstabbing
We part of our own struggle
We would burst our neighbor's bubble
Destined to meet the maker but at the same time we the same people late for his arrival
Yo, a false survival
No longer feeling tribal
And as much as it makes me feel good to say ""we are beautiful people""
There's a lot of us messing it up

Currently we can be seen across your screen
Stayin wide-eyed cause you niggas tryin' to scheme
Welcome to the spot, I'm slaying with it
Chop it up and fit it inside your quart of rice
You speak ghetto falsetto on the mic device
Tryin to give me third degree, you just a third of me
Couldn't be the shit if you were a turd of me
A man tight with my funds, crush like Ricky D
Who quoted Vance Wright, no one can serve us!

We nail terror up against the wall for target practice

But I see clearly with ease you lack this

Playin host to your regiment
Who rally to boast, but now boast no more
They got floored by the sight of my ledger print
I came specifically, to fracture yo' ability
To grandstand anywhere next to me
This is the year, when the true better man
Keeps the cheddar and writes to his destiny (word!)
Timeless episodes of talent got me nominated
By the ones who hated me on spittin' tighter
Salute these ""Supa Emcees"" for bein' clever;
And never use the weed as a ghostwriter

Your aim's to please, my aim's to freeze
You dead center in your tracks with your hands high
Ain't no tricks, we set it to fire like Hendrix
All the hard rocks at liquor spots
All over the scene, makin' it messy
So we make a clean getaway to a better day
Can't say the same, for them cats who left the game
'Cause they couldn't claim the better pay
This ain't no masquerade
So the mass parade of people need to stop frontin'
There's truly a few makin' them hits
While us, we got our mitts closed cause you on the field buntin'
Make it to third base, but never reach home
The word is, your whereabouts is unknown
While we're that point of view, that you never really knew
With the stitch to keep the cut sewn (De La!)

I was curious to how Kris and Scott blew the stage
Back then I didn't know you kept the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
Like my man from Black Moon when he enters the stage
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
DOVE:
I got seventeen kids who speak to peak rhythms
And they all know I didn't come to make any sense
I heard Mikey Roads bust licks like
""Hey ma, what's for dinner?"", spit cuss like a winner
Malibu down cause they can't see the standard I clown
Bundles and bags is sniffin' like
Dragons (ow) and dragons (oww!) and dragons (OOWW!!)
Hit the pit stop on the corner cause I see brothers flaggin'
Party on the moon but first I gots to spoon
It's wiggle your ass man, you made the jam jiggle like
Whoomp, not that, ain't it? I hit the elephant
Damn, Super Lover Man, your shit look thick
But first things first I'm gonna take it to the sea
The 
Chattanooga champ
 is gonna take it to the sea
I'm the employer, you're my employee
You gots to bust your ass for the cash money
Double on a bobo, Mr Bartender
Got to make this tree look pretty tonight
I'm on a kite, never trippin' on the ego
You know how we go, if I had a million bucks
I'd go buy me an Amigo, a house and a pinball machine
Slip myself some Spanish Fly and wet dream
Amazing how I zoom to the pervert mode
You wanna know why, you ask me why
(Why you trippin'?) (Good love, good love)
You wanna know why, you ask me why
(Why you trippin'?) (Good love, good love)
You wanna know why, you ask me why
(Why you trippin'?) (Good love, good love)
Do you wanna know why, you ask me why
POS:
Well you wanna know why, I'll tell you why
Classic example of a date rape
Check the moves in the laces so the shoes won't fake
Standing on the bread, honey take the moves to the head
DOVE:
Nah nah nah, just sit to this permanent
Cause I'm a never movin', I clown it like
Get down, get down on the illegitimate
Yes I am the Chattanooga
I know this girl named Joelle, her mama drives a Cougar
POS:
Ay yo, I flaunt gets way beyond the bets
Little girl be cheesin' when I'm twirling her barrettes
I'm entering through the centre in cause she sweats
Now her Mister needs to see if my construction can be kept
I run it back to when I had Millie in the sack
Where she did the nothing cause her father showed her something
I ain't frontin', I'm mashing all the comp cause I'm thorough
Like crack, that's here to clear the inner city boroughs
But jump inside your mind so there's no escapism
Yo, De La Soul is here to stay like racism
You wack-ass rappers, they don't take much to see
If you don't sync with my mental
What the fuck makes you think you can touch me?
Well anyway, I'm levelling the masses, which gets me asses
Now tell me who be the tramp
Hey yo honey, what the fuck you riffin' about?
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out
Hey yo honey, what the fuck you riffin' about?
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out

She all independent but want her throat wetted
Tight from the floor to height
See I saw the night, in dream bubbles I fiend to see double

To get her bottom limbs arched like a grasshopper
Puttin in work to make it last proper
Ninety percent of the time is on my mind frame
So I'm game to reign up to par
While my fam runs it cool up at the bar, I stay clearheaded
Lettuce enough cheese to get shredded
We like Navy Seals lookin' for the gold
Our natural appeal got them others on hold
Them girls dealin' with us tonight
Came with the large appetite and got served
Got nerve to think less, you can bless me and my kinfolk
Rushin up against my yolk-sac promote that

Vertical hold, we gon' combine together (yeah)

They must be out they mind, them rookies get dismissed
Cause it ain't hard to find, the ladies that can move it
To the latest bassline, attached to the drum
That'll set it off and make the local DJ a star
But can I get a boost from the bass and the treble?
This record ain't for soothin but for raisin blood levels
We simply havin fun but know that some don't like the music
That it promotes rappin, and global gun-clappin
But still promoters packin in the clubs where I'm at

Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul

And he states, 'Black is Black'
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July

Stop screamin', this is about the demon up in vines
Brooklyn to Long Island, and you can find us
Makin hits followed by music with many flicks with girls
With big tits playin themselves, all across the world
Is the frenzy of the get one to MC for life
See many shades of pay without having trades
Thoughts designed to drink more wine in the ride
Breathin in air that's conditioned
Many many be wishin they could wonder like I
I be wonderin why, embarking on that Soul expedition
The mission, of many to be licking honey vixen
Blowing money just so you can 
re-up like Nixon's
The nearest eardrum wants to take a chance
Just to say that they can do the dance, called the hustle

S-O-S, the hustle got you stranded out in the shuffle
Bagged you up in a duffle
Bag (bag), I take the express zone to keep y'all locos
Blowin out your noses, your mannequin poses
Keep the situation plastic, I mask it
(Identifyin mine takes too much time)
It's a wage of higher stakes of what's more deep
Some even do the hustle off-beat, it's the hustle

Yo, I never smoked no weed in my life
Single De La brother, one kid, no wife
And life can be trife, ask the Mobb from Queens
Heads filled with knuckle chuckle when robbing you clean
Fallin out like barrettes
, be them vets that didn't know that they
Could be the prayer, wrecked cops or bootleggers
And all them chumps lookin for anything to toss me
Figure me as a police line, don't even cross me

I catch theories over crews when they tell me I move
Like chesspieces, wild one steps, make heroes on reps
Came to toast MC's like Ted Knight
, see I ignite em
When they 
too close for comfort
, and some try to come hurt
My ego, man, it's big like illegal drug business
Stay down, my bare witness, and just electric slide
Aside, five boroughs is the way I come thorough
Makin musical tunes, like my bind-tight squirrel
Beatminerz design, stitched for your behind
Takin you to heights you thought was too high to climb
Averdeen couldn't map it where hurricane collapsed it
For whatever, I'mma strap it where hon' wants to tap it

Damsel in distress so I stress good guy
Tarzan and Jane more like Bonnie and Kareem

Like written wouldn't be past tense without ten

If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you {*4X*}

Hey, because of you my little lady named fame
People spot me like nerves spot pain
You put the S on my chest and inside my veins
Before that this darkie had to smile for them to see me
Now them same kids that used to diss wanna be me
Due to me bein down with you
Hooked up in eighty-two plus six when you gave me my fix
You fixed my house and bankin accounts
You fixed me up with too many women to count
Only right for you to have your side niggas too
And even when you don't come back
At least when you was here for me the world cheered for me


Pen you my muh'fucker, I'ma hold you like piss
Even when the itchy burn make me wanna let go
There you go smudgin, see actin mad funny
But you kissin looseleafs so I can't be mad
You my confidant when I couldn't tell pops
That report card came, you signed off with me
So when the checks come you'll be signin off with me
But when I'm dead and gone will you sign off?
Oh, Papermate, you light like paper weight
But you pack ink can make tattoos turn pussy
And when it's mush time you be there like a man
In my hand spillin my heart wit'cha blood


You're my first born, my little Capricorn kid
Slid in this world at one pound eight ounce
My miracle baby, grown into a little lady so fast
Like pressin the gas while the tape bounces
Through you, me and your grandfather grew closer
I understand now, all he tried to give for me
I wanna give it to you the same way
But sometimes fall short and you still live for me
I just want you to know, I may not show
All the right feelings and say the right verbs
But you're my little black diamond
And always shinin in my heart
And that's way beyond words


You've been with me on the inside homey, pumped life in me
Ever since I was a knee high, I knew I had heart
Ain't gang related but you relative to blood
AB negative you represent love
Though you break like Pringles, you're heroic in your size
You make David beat Goliath, you heartbeaker~!
Broads love you on Valentine's day
Quaker brought beats to my chest before hip-hop
Let's take this time to remember

Leave Your Cares Behind,Smell the DA.I.S.Y,2014.0,"I love the way you make me feel
On Saturday

Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold up, back up the track and grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
The sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' thick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, I'm really and willin'
No hackeysack, let let me in
Slip on the bottom I'mma slip away
And have a ball on a Saturday

I love, I love, I love, I love it when you do it on a Saturday
On Saturday

You go back once more with the wallop in the score
Sponsor ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
Sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights (what else?)
I'm diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life
Slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss the briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
Unfasten that sleeve around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody, come on everybody, come on everybody

Leave your cares behind
Leave your cares behind (on a Saturday)
Leave your cares behind
Leave your cares behind (on a Saturday)
Are ya ready kids? (Aye aye, captain!)
I can't hear you! (Aye aye, captain!)

Taking The Train,Smell the DA.I.S.Y,2014.0,"Gooooood mornin', good mornin', good mornin' everybody
Yea, e'erybody's lookin' good this mornin'
Today's gonna be another good day, so let's go get 'em

Ego trip, ego trip
We be takin' the train to the ego trip
Ego trip, ego trip
We takin' the train to the ego trip

Yep, yep big trucker man is rollin' in town
How ya do, how ya do?
I got the joints to make ya...(JUMP!)
Because we headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around
And everybody's talkin' bout yo, so funny
But they still tellin' lies to me
I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me
And who's the foot, when I'm the foot, now you say it
Now who's gon' say it? You know what I'm sayin'?
Skirts play with it cause I'm slick like that
I think they sayin' y'all the greatest
If I'm the greatest, well gimme gimme mine
Cause I'm heavy when I weigh it
Now watch the way I say it (ego trip)
Change my pitch, smack my bitch, I never did it
The flavor's bein' butter but brothers ain't gettin' it
Get it; or else you're a goner
When I rolls over ya gonna have to wanna
Chill, cause it's the chattanooga champ
We takin' the train, we takin' the train


Well I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Yo, I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
I be the better brand, superman
I run blocks with my circle we be nubian
I got platinum rust, never ever fuss
Ey yo, Maseo, he down with us
People stop takin' his stylin' for a joke
Don't sassafrass I put foots up the ass
Sometimes I'm fast, I blow off like a seal
Hey hey, for real
Mase chopped the record down to the bone
And now Renee King is on my cellular phone
So we talkin' autographs, years and laughs
Champagne, caviar and bubble bath
Yo see uh, that's the life that I lead
I got halos on tilt with the wings of speed
Cause I'm so fly

And yes on and on
I'm in it like a river so don't you rock my yachts yo
We got them Gills like Johnny
And sail those seven seas (we good for ya)
We bigger than bigs so dig it (you better dig it)
With waves that amazes popes
I am the is equals is cause it's caught up
When the tides taught me the ropes
Ain't no weights for the bass (man I'll give you four)
And we're the verb unheard, you better gimme one more
I ask you you got it if you're special
With a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on
Hey, the answer to the riddle is me and here's the question
Who can be, and who can be, and who can be...",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-taking-the-train-lyrics

It's in the back y'all
It's on the wall y'all
It's in your head, but it's not the fever

Now with the B-I double L bill
We bill the par territories placing flags on terrains
Nas said it was yours so snatch the world back from Wayne
We did,
 universally sparked the lid
Now these ladies love how we live
Got'em caught, shit you already know looking so fly
That the dog that played spiderweb your up 
LI's in here
Sucker cats don't try to steer
Near this, wish you could bring it this way
Compliments of Wonder Why and my nigga David J

So the do, re, mi, fa, sol, la
Many reach to devour the stage, put the guts out the venue
Ah, shut up with your face, no need to continue
I've been there, done that
Received it, won that
Yo stunned that, that's how you like To Sun frozed
Keep my shit in harvest like Farmer John grows crops
Hops, you'll need the whole ceiling to tops
I saw the empire, set your liquid to fire, (""Damn!"")
Bim Blam set a flame to your fanny
Dave is to surname like Dave is to Sammy
A grammy, my concern is to earn for a little age
Next time, next rhyme, next phase
Chorus 2x
Now put your hand on your hip
Now put your hand on your hip
And let your backbone slip
And let your backbone slide
Now put your hand up on your hip
Now put your hand up on your hip
And let your backbone slip for the fever

Hey, ladies and gents reintroducing to you
Shootin' shit like hot asses after sipping bean stew
(""Its David J"")
Super fat come the visitor zoo
Peace to my homewood niggas and my man Tofu
(""I Fell in Love"")
But I'mma do the evil that man do
Get some ass on the side so that my love can shine through
Pull a cigar with crew, lean back and let it soak
Your holdin' on to my twelve dollar smoke
Man...
(POSDNUOS)
It was Mase who laced the beat from up out the Earth
Leaving brothers hypnotized like Bootney Farnsworth
But I'm hip but no tized than that, clap to the break of dawn
Dada, wonder why it's hotter than hot
Why not Me, my Steeze got niggas on the dick
They want to join the click
I hope that ass get a record deal
So they can feel what I feel
To overstand that ring ring, how you do is real
(DAVE)
You must be from Italy cause all you do is roam
Microphone to microphone, lookin' for home
I write a poem to make the publicists flock the prone cop
Shining on stage so I don't need a spotlight
Should be tight like tupperwear supperwear, drawers of socks
Sippin' on gray pot

Yo scratch the pork chops
Cause nothin' here drops
We're goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Sibling Rivalries,The Hip-Hop Experiment,2002.0,"Baby sis, you got super sense hearin' and you touch too much
You be all in my space, you consume my breath
If I go left or right, then you'll go left
Then you're right behind me like a quarterback
I oughta rap about the times I used to change your loves
And wash your baba off, but you done changed enough
If I go out to play it's like, ""No way, no how""
Ain't no taggin' along, I'm in the 6th grade now
I ask mama for some cake, you're like ""I want some too""
""Mama can I have a dime?"" You're like ""I want one too""
When I asked her for a kiss, you cried ""I want one too""
Wish she would have asked if I wanted a sister
And if I wished her away at my birthday cake
You'd probably blow the candles out before me
You the reason why I lost my lucky rock and my puppy rock
Stressin' my time, tick tock and she don't stop

Ayy, what's the matter with you, boy?
Did your joy go away when Sis hit the playpen?
You've been makin' a fuss, feelin' the achin'
Of the grownin' pains of just maintainin'
What's the matter with you, girl?
If your world caves in, there should be no misbehavin'
Understand lil' drama means well
Maintain and time will tell (Maintain and time will tell)

Only time will tell
Only time will tell (only time, y'all!)
Only time will tell
Only time will tell (only time, y'all!)
Only time will tell
Only time will tell (only time, y'all!)
Only time will tell
Only time will tell (only time)

Only out to show love and concern, if you want it all badly
Burn, don't act mad, don't call Mom and Dad
Not grown, but not the younger than your own age
To the stone ages, tellin' and tattlin'
Yellin' and battlin' amongst the blood that ain't thicker than mud
You dishin'
Your karate can't match my kung fu (ya-tat!)
I put it on you, kid, I did a bid on dish detail
Why you clown me and wish me well?
Always on my nerve like skin over the muscle
And my hustle stay fresh and clean, sharp and mean
My dean knows the best part of mom and pops
Your R&B can't rough up my hip hop
Am I my brother's keeper? No
But I'll keep my eyes latched on him (so he don't snatch my gems!)
My kicks scuff-free so when chicks bust me
The dirt they find won't overshadow my quality time

Ayy, what's the matter with you, boy?
Did your joy go away when sis hit the playpen?
You've been makin' a fuss, feelin' the achin'
Of the growin' pains of just maintainin'

See, we came here
To build a Pos - D root of respect
We don't check coke
Got the antidote for hip hop is swallowing cold

Check your postal rap fills bank
Check the hundred CCs of De La to make the heart crank
Keep ingredients nice

Screamin' like imma hawk

Got the money that I make
Help to make the fool

Dirty and dead vowels

Surplus C cell, the battery pack
Stayin' fresher than romaine, Rogaine the spot
Where the track fallen out
We in and all out
Takin' me apart while I'll bring the ball out
You haul your city and truck it all out
All being exhausted and enduring swallown' pills
Drop the last load and we rip the small out
Call out, if you need a sixteen the green
And having  attack  entire wall out
Born in the heart of hip-hop, move to the belly
Knew the B-boy pose before exposed to the telly
Make bread to break bread
Not here for the playin'
Make sure we keep it pure

Lovely How I Let My Mind Float,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I was born in the Boogie Down catscan, when my building…

Nah, I’m not even going for that this time
You got to kick that new—you ain’t been out for years
Why you gon’ be actin’ like that on this track?
Kick some old funk joint like this…AH!

You know P-O-S-D-N-U-O-S
Usually the reason for a cardiac arrest
The back off you silly hardcore wannabes
Plug’ll fly to blow that ass from the ground like stacks of leaves
(Check the sleeves) Not a trick when sniffin’ in my word ‘cause
(Only practice makes a real jam) Heard
I’m just a man without the man con tan
‘Cause my tan been sittin’ in my DNA plan
I’m a rap fan who never saw Bam rock the parks in the Bronx
Yet I still snap skulls in the dark
I can raise mad heads in the sky without a tool
Which requires a clip to play a nigga for a fool
I be the blessed cheer for an upset ear
Who had to hear “Say ‘ho’” forty times
‘Cause I’m…(So fresh)
Yep, you heard from the one of many queens
Who dissed The Educated Rapper when I was just a teen
Back then fame was just a dream
But now I be the physical scream shoving speaks for weeks
And as for the girls like the Crew that Crash, I adore
So let’s put the chorus to the floor
Girls, girls, girls, girls, reach out and clap your hands
I be the fabulous man, so just play the fabulous fan
And bring the breeze, bring the breeze

Gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)

It’s the Biz Markie as you can see
You know I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
That’s why I rock the mic and I’m in control
This is a rhyme dedicated to De La Soul
I’m the M-izza, M-izza, M-izza, A, A, R
R-izza, R-izza, R-izza, K, K
I’m not Jack, Jill, John or the Marvin, ay
But hey, I rock the mic and I’ll break your day
The B-I-Z M-izza A-R-K-I-with the E
And every record that I make I’m rockin’ history
Hey, you know me as the man that go “ah, ah, ah, oh”
It don’t matter ‘cause you know I got pull
I rock the microphone down, I’m rockin’ Gotham town
I do a dooga, dooga, dooga with the funky sound
Hey, hey, you know it’s me, the R in rhythm-B
The hip, the hop, I rock the microphone and I do, G
Hey, they want me go crazy, they want me go nuts
They want me rock the funky rhymes for the big ol’ butts
No, um, I got to do what I could what I could do
‘Cause I’m down with the rhythm of the De La crew
Native Tongue, gotta give a shout to my man Tip
Bound to wreck your body and rock the ship
So check me out without a doubt, you like the way
That I could rock it to the rhythm with all the blasé
M-izza A, R, R, R-izza, K
The man appointed rap king of rock break of day
Hey, ‘member in Long Island when I used to kick
Yo, I gotta stop, gotta stop (Rock) quick

I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
Gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)

Hey, see ya tomorrow, it’s the early bird
Silly Chattanooga got the shits for your curb
What’s a million bucks if your life is disturbed?
Who’s in the shade if you’re picking up the third
Listen, duck duck goose, watch the cockle-doo with ‘Nuos
‘Cause ain’t no stiff behavin’ when you’re David
Mister Party Maker but only to my peers
You could say ‘My niggas’ but daughter’s open ears
So put a sticker on it, and dig it, doggone it
Respects to the Biz ‘cause he is who he is
Let me catch my pace, give me sugar, Mase *scratches*
Oh, you’re just so ridiculous
I gots to move it like a U-Haul, give me a call
7-8-9, oh shit, that’s my behind
Lovely how I let my mind float
Now I’mma take my baaad ass home ‘cause I’m a goat",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-lovely-how-i-let-my-mind-float-lyrics
Freedom of Speak (We Got Three Minutes),3 Feet High and Rising [Reissue Bonus Disc],1989,"You all have three minutes to do what you all wanna do
Yo, so speak as free as possible

Check the clock!
Watch me!
Come on!
Funky!
Repeat

Bright everyday I wake up
Look at my travels they stuffed up
Ring go the telly which I pick up
Turn on the news as it screws up
Mase on the line to see if I'm up
Wrong thing to do at 5, I hang up
Lay on the floor sit and think up
Why the whole world alone is messed up


Woke up the same morning I felt fine
Took me a shower I smelled fine
Checked out the weather it looked fine
Made some breakfast, I cooked fine
My girl calls me, she's so fine
Wanted me to help her go find
Some shoes but I had work to define
And it was Tuesday, I had to take P-Fine


Folks styling jokes get the time set
Movement of the tune growing and set
Positive it is and perfectly set
Soul go to show soon we all set
Slipping lunatics shipping one set
Meet us for these now we upset
Chance to spread word we at full set
Rhythym weighs more than your weight set
3 will be the number till sunset
Plug 1 & 2 now we all set
Dove praises flow in your headset
Flow De La Flow there is no threat
Categories carry difference in sets
Differences are equal to an offset
De La from the Soul and its kept set
Soul is the revivor, Masey you set?

Watch me!
Put it there!
You got to get it!
Get it!
Shout now!

My name's Posdnous and I'm above sink
The world is so out of synch
A lot of emcees can't play synch
That's why unfortunately they sink
But problem and speak are no way synch
We wash problems like hands in a sink
I hate to make this rhyme leave synch
But the reason De La bad is cuz we think
It took us a time but the crew's here
Activate a dance when you hear
A roll from the Soul like this here
And respond to the bond that assists here
Politics of speaking are intended here
And the president of paragraph will end it here
Cuz the 3 has completely lured here
That freedom of speak is assured here

Folly set the frequency in your show

Better yet ya whole scene, here to pull in the green
With Philly Black
Just layin' back, raisin' my stacks
Cause how they want it I give it to em' rock or the raw
Yo it really don't matter son, some hot shit for y'all
To go cop at the store, I spit, kick at ya jaw
Leave you on the floor on all fours, you slaw
We burn fast in black flag lands
Bringin' herds and caravans
And heat rock rythms
, you blink one, two times
In between I do mines
Showboat refs, I put y'all niggas on deck
Yeah son y'all faggots are soft
I been through, carried the torch
Recognized and done married a dwarf
So in-laws pay a writer's fee
My stizzy sets a wiz bitch's eye in me
Pissy in a rizzy
Indian wife I flip em' behind reachin' for sobriety
Blew north, never find me
Reside in this state of mind
Keep my temple developmental
Projects, front-line essential
Reminded of concubines and evil that men do
Cut off Ginsu, carry a brand new
Vandle issues, brandin' issues
Grabbin' tissues, like you didn't know you had it in you
I live it up y'all, givin' you what y'all
Need and can't call, carry the ball
Like a spit-kicker should and ya wish ya could
Hold it down like the digital who stitched the hood
Better yet the whole globe, light it up like a strobe
While you froze panicin'
Went from man to maniquin
We them peaceful rap stars
That can still jab ya in ya face
Leave ya shit redder than Mars
The sauce and shit, of course we it
The flossy shit
Groundin' beef like Maxwell House
Go ask the house
We representatives
Go call ya Senators
Change laws in rap, renovate ya landscape
The man takes for sixteen
And pull a paragraph up out the tango

Potholes in my lawn

In which I concentrated so hard on, see
Don't ask for maximum security
Eh yo my dwellin' is swellin'
Lit my bud when I happened to fall into a spot
Where no ink or an ink-blot was on my scroll
I just wrote me a new mot

To recognise when they come through
And leave with the words


I've found that it's not wise
To leave my garden untended cause eyes
Have now pardoned all laws of privacy
Even paws are after my writer
See, I've pursued that everyone's sayin'
What to do when suckers are preyin'
On my well-guarded spreadsheets
Oh why, hell does it send up fleets
Of evil-doers through the big hole
Give them evil-doers who dig holes
Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew
I think I'd better plant traces, give clues
Or better yet call 911
They get here I inform them I'm the Plug One
Of the plug cheer and let them realize the reason
For concern of the Soul
But yo check it, we gon' do it like this

Ain't no Dilla like the one I got
No one can do shit better
His beats held the DNA of hip hop
And kept it hot like a thermal sweater
Can't duplicate it so just leave it alone
Nah, you can't duplicate the sound, boy
He has a universal sound but the D was his home
The D was his home (Mo-Town)
The D was his home (Mo-Town)

Channeling, in sync so my what brings that testament
To cover twelve inches of funk
Flip like as if I was the Dalek himself
Specialising in cleansing like the its of
Elephants, Dove hits bibles out the park, man
Don't wven try to toss bleach, I'm too dark and
Major more soul than James' ""Escapism""
De La Soul is here to stay like racism
Patrick know and I'mma put the pillow off the bed
As I lurk up on your thoughts while phones on your head
Riff a tech pro, flex Sue, running you the links
Scout weather, pouring rain outta duck's survive links
And if one winks for pink slips, the slips are short
Dull-minded as sperm, to give out for the souls I report
I sport too fly for the forty-ounce drinker
I sport too fly for a forty-ounce thinker
A fresh linen scent so sniffer on the two-inch
A talker of the berg without weed influence
So stick to you Naughty By Natures and your Kane
'Cause graffiti that I based upn the wax is insane

Grand groove, I wish I had the flavor bid
Give me six bottles of beer, I take the seventh one free
I got the chandelier, kick, constructed by my man
Little elf, big four gets the zootie for the self
Long Island living, what, twelve o'clock dawn
Jiggy-not see me so I trip straight to your porches
Mr Partymaker puts the boogers in your bottle
Straw it and drink, what bees gotta be's
'Cause I snort the crazy-crazies
Man, I kick the Franken-style, dig the bolts in my neck
Wreck, ship, boat, rock
Heavy metal grooves ain't the infinite
Here I hips to the hops
I'm looking for the words in the faces of a prince
That brother been down ever since soaked cheese
And motor go smiling
Hey, how ya doin'
Now, meet in front of Big Lou's fighting
Hey, y'all reminisce, six streets, little miles
Straight to my avenue
(Aaaah... aaaggh)
Six streets, went miles straight to my avenue

Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl

(Get dowwwn!) Just another day in a lonely world
Where I like to make a lonely girl
Feel a little less lonely, tell a tale where she's
My one and only, she got homegirls
Who likes to do more than chat
So she asked where my homies at, I mean that song was fly
But if my homey can't have none, sayin I won't have fun
Is honestly just a God damned lie~!
Self-missions are less stress, and cut out the mess
Of havin a girl, verifyin if I'm lyin or not
With her girl, cause my niggas occupyin the same spot with her
I'm like the fox with the fur well groomed
You find me in hot clubs and hotel rooms in between the sheet crack
And if the bed squeaks or noise-free, I'll put it to use
Swig from the tiger beers for the extra boost
Blow out your back like flames over the cake
Cut out a piece of your heart, for the claim
When I get you worked up to cream, and I can get on
Some Snoop Dogg shit and scream, ""What's my motherfuckin name?""
 w/ Erick Sermon ad lib samples

Hey, we in the position to renew things
I specialize in doin me and you things
Now what's that he say she say?
We got mortgages, dump all this gossip you're hoardin
This world premier is for real ma
A catalogue of lovin you can hear ma
Put the quarter in the jukebox
I brought a bit of luggage drawers and a few socks
A little Dane Dane, and some X-Clan
I'm tryin to save you from the chores of the next man
See we can picnic, and go horseback
I love your laughter even if you sound like Horshack
You so impeccable but damn them birds peck at you
Your technique is cuttin like you catch beats
Or def these nuts cause your sex speaks
We oughta ""Chill"" like EPMD

Get Away (The Spirit Of Wu-Tang),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I want to give y'all a little announcement man
For the last year there's been a lot of music comin out
The shit been weak, knowhatI'msayin?
A lot of niggas trying to take hip-hop
And make that shit R&B, rap and bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin?
Or make that shit funk
Fuck that, this is MCin' right here, this is hip-hop
And like the Wu we bring it to you in the purest form
We reside far away from the norms
Spawn from the big catch, big bang, big breaks
Fetch pads and pens, even with the pencil
Rap labels studied us, flooded us with stencil
That's tinseltown, murder your display
And we stay flying even with the terrorists' trying
This to that town, monitor the pat down
Searching for controlled substance with sustenance
We inventors of the drug, ever since
Day-glo covers, broke pots, green balloons
The black shirt saying stakes, elevated noon
AOI, grind, you hear it
Understand we steer it
Some choose to veer it off the course
The main source missing
You've paid no dues, you've earned no pension
Learn the rules! You can either be the pimp
Or the pimped out tools
Wack niggas need not forget!
Stop running up on niggas with
All that wack shit (Word up man)
Talkin' bout you emcee
You ain't no emcee
Like me
I bake works of art
While labels worry 'bout artwork
Or top of the chart perks
You need to insert a lot more of that
Original tier, that you can't manage
Just causes damage so just go, get away from here!
You're fuckin' the game up
Too low to aim up so just go, get away from here!
And some'll believe that they're leaders
Young fella you're a two liter
Simply waterway drowning out the source
This lesson is aligned with an underground cause
So sharpen your paper mate, my number twos'll make the beacon shine
And you *sound effects*
The fine lining is detail, the garment is retail
But I don't buy rap or excuses
The code used to be an unspoken device
But since that's gone you see what rap produces
(Y'knahmsayin'?)
The one on one, two on twos
Assemble in the center of squares like statues (Word up!)
Understand I just do this I don't have to
(Y'knahmsayin' this is hip-hop right here!)
But you wouldn't know that feeling if it slapped you
Like new credit, the blood work's indebted
Microphone donor, two pints of get right
I got my cardio up my nigga
Don't give a damn about a party
I do it for the body
Upchuck your mandibles, the scrambler's back
Since the two inch tape how ample is that?
Like furry dice hanging off the mirror
Your position is concerning my vision
These objects seem to be closer than they appear
And they could never catch us their directions don't match up
Just go, get away from here!
You're jamming the lane up
Messing the game up
Just go, get away from here!",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-get-away-the-spirit-of-wu-tang-lyrics

Tell me what's more pollution
Black fog, burning log
Or infested prostitution

Or interstate drug dealing
Tell me what's more tantalising
Flip flop, skeezer lies and props
Or Three Feet High And Rising

Tell me what's more demanding
A dominant race, a fad called base
Or peace and understanding
Tell me what's more neglected
Teaching our seeds the fact there's greed
Or words being said in a record
Tell me what's more pathetic
A lallygag lush, a habit to cuss
Or a lawsuit filed on a medic
Tell me what's more amusing
Comic strip, or break that hip
Or what Prince Paul's producing
Tell me, what's more?
POS:
Tell me what's more old-fashioned
Lemonade, a black man's fade

Stix & Stonz,Clear Lake Audiotorium,1994,"If you can dig it, deal with it, if you can't, just forget it
'Cause nobody rocks the party like we
Get loose, get loose, Sunshine get loose
Just rock, and show 'em you got juice
And have, have, have, have, have, have, have fun

I know it's been a while since the last time
You're heard LA Sunshine pick up the microphone and rhyme
But now I think it's time to go for mine
So you can sit back, relax, just max and unwind
Because it's time for me to out a few heads to bed
Because I'm upset at what somebody said
I've heard it through the grapevine it's been said
That Sunshine, can't rhyme?
Ha! That's the funniest line that I heard in a long time
The wanna be me's that they I sound off beat
I'm not offbeat, I'm totally unique and it sounds real sweet
So if you're ready, get set for a trip to the sun
You'll be guided, and I've decided to become
One to take total control of your soul
Young or all be bold because it's a sight to behold

Sticks and stones might break your bones but Pos is gonna blow your mind
Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time!

Now you can bet that I'm first kick a watt
Soul son, Plug One, Posdnuos I'm top notch
Forward, backstep, got cabbage on the brain
So I'm leafy, peasy, and I act kind of sane
So homeboys and girls just come follow me
I'm the fried pipe piper down with dub and Plug Three
I like my mans, freestyle is not my flow
But I gets mad respect from Norfolk to Glasgow
I run this up to court about a minute to the sec
'Cause my hoodie won't clash with Whipper Whip's mockneck
So my hip-hop teachers please show me the math
And after this give me your goddamn autograph

Whipper Whip, you can make the microphone sing
Walking around sporting your diamond ring
All the ladies know you as an MC king
So get on the mic and tell 'em it ain't no thing

Well the Prince is my title and, I do what I must do
When rappers get beside themselves, that's when I bust two
Or three, see it doesn't matter to me
'Cause the W-H-I-P's got an army
Whipper Whip, the Whipster, money gripster
Can't stand the tipster unless she got the hips to
Move a mountain, left on Kingsly and Fountain
1345 is where I used to count them
The grips in my bucket's the kind that choke horses
No more losses and no toy mosses
It's the Kings of Kingsly, from Bronx to Hollywood
I'm Whipper Whip, I but the G in ""good""
Yo I can blow like a whistle, run far beyond average
Been rapping to the man like Randy Savage
You be the judge, come stand as I slam some
There's open invitation to all and then some

Sticks and stones might break your bones but JD Dub is gonna blow your mind
Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time!

I kick the Chatanooga Choo Choo so listen to the calling
Next stop's the body rock, here's the ticket to my clock
It's the flips, but keep your jaws on your hips
From back in the days I used to air it to the hits
Earn the dance step and guaranteed to play the wheel to wheel
And Wild Style was the real, dig it?
I block the heckles and hecks and gets nuff respects
Without the ""bah diddy bah"" I couldn't go and cash checks

DJ Mase, since you got the bass, why don't you hit it, hit it?
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it!
The do re, the mi phi, the sol la, the Tito
Rocking it, rocking it, yes he is rocking it
Tito, rocking it!

Smiggity smoking, no joking, turning styles like a token
No singer, but swinging rap lyric like a ringer
I'm solo, like Bobo, breaking backs like Bolo
No kitten, no hitting booby traps for the sitting
Ducks should I mention rhyme breezing like Benson
Or hedges, I'm fuming autographs for the human
Being, I'm g-ing, off like keying
Or Keenan, live Ivory, Waynan, who's slaying?
A TV or movie, hit singles often move me
Like groove me, they got me lingers like a ???
No slipping, no tripping on me while I'm ripping
Slam dunking like a donut on the Bulls Scottie Pippen
A vocab that's no fad, I'm Heftier than Glad bags
My son's about 2, buckaroo and yelling ""Go dad!""

Sticks and stones might break your bones but Superstar's blows your mind
Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time!

I get the honor to rap with some old school greats
Caz, Whipper Whip, Tito, and LA
Maseo, Posdnuos, Trug, they from the new school
A perfect blend from the old and new
Superstar, where did I fit in? How did I get in?
Where did I begin, sin?
I'm known from Belcourt to Freeport, not a West Coast or Five Boroughs
Yeah, my name's whispered in the ghettos
When I'm on stage, I write a book, flip a page
Write a chapter, and leave a hell of a phrase
Now, before I go, you know that I'm a pro, yo
You won't forget me, why, because I flow

So GMC, ha, GMC, ha ha, GMC ha, GMC, ha ha
GMC, ha huh! (Yo my throat is sore)
Yo, get on the mic, stay on the mic (dammit)
Rock on the mic with your rhymes galore!

Well I'm a black act back to attack the wack New Jack
Smack the sad sack track with the stack of facts
True old data, see you later alligator
Raid or raider Darth Vader, 'cause I'm greater or rater
Made a plate of soul food, barbequed a rude dude with the attitude
Who got screwed 'cause he chewed
But I'm a writer, you can't take a bite of
So light up your lighter and watch me recite a
Dope verse or two with the curse or two, yeah rehearse a cue
But first a few minutes of funk, preferably seven
Microphones, all I need is one
MC's to school, ten or eleven then a bottle of Don
When the job is done, but don't stop me now
I'm on a roll, control the whole stroll
And bowl the whole toll, fold the known souls
Patrol shoot the fruit, toot toot the hoot
Scoot with the loot and knock a cute suit boots
Entertain your brain like Kane, not strain to maintain my main (shit) stain
Walls record us, break through the borders
All the manslaughters and kidnap daughters
Who are building and chlling in the building with a villain
I'm killing and illing but still in like Bob Dylan
I'm Democratic emphatic erratic static I'm good at it
And suckers get gatted with the automatic
Rhymes are plenty, styles are many
Yeah, and that's as real as Jimmy sticking Jenny
If anybody knows a trick to slip my wig
With a lick or real sick with a lyrical brick
He's a vick bound to get tracked off
Step to the Grandest and you'll get slapped off
Stage, and thoroughly stomped with the quickness
Now can I get a witness, 'cause I'm out",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-stix-and-stonz-lyrics

Unfold,UnKnown,2016.0,"Now here lies a tale of three lone outlaws
Chained to the game they were bound
A long way from home they were facing
As they traveled through unknown ground
Pos:
We were on our way back to the New York act
Sunrise in the sky giving me eye
Long trails ahead, horse needs to be fed
Stumbled on a town built upon ground soaked in bullets and blood
The best that murderous slain
Wanted by the law man so the draw hand is ready
Catch the local steady looking but they silent threat caused no fret
Mase lit the blunt with style and said
 ""this fire's ?, stick around for a while""
So they climbed down from their saddle
Will all eyes a comin'
Like drifters, their face stone hard
The ways of a man can always be tested
So through the whispers they rode on guard
Pos:
Never felt such a warm welcome as this
We need to venture into these parts more often
Mase:
Hold your horse, we've been in worse one-horse towns than this
I'll tell you one thing, I can go for a gut walla right now, and have a hog killin time
Pos:
Well there's a saloon over there to the left
Pos & Mase: Right next to the bank!
Make way to the saloon it's not even noon
It's packed bending elbows tossing them back
Bar keep slid us two Jacks and one Jill comes over for the thrill (hi stranger)
I told her how I steal the show there for a day to lean on
She was keen on my advance but Mase glanced at a storm a brewin'
His eyes motion me to look West
See a poker game going towards the favor of a stranger
He wins, it ends with holes in his chest
Dave:
Now when it comes to a dice game, yeah I'm your Huckleberry
I buy and short cause cars are my kryptonite
A round table of high bind is all broke
A fifth of tobacco, whiskey, and all smoke
The proper canvas for a ham sandwich
I'm all excessive, but they don't seem to take kind to jokes
I had that glare in my eye, nose down
Full house, Jackson Fives; Motown
Their eyes harbored malice
Their breaths wreaked of envy
A showdown would be set for noon
In the eyes of the township
All bear witness
To the gambler who met his doom
Wait a minute Jingler
He's cheating
He's sliding cards
He sure is
Nobody slides cards on tumbleweed baker
That's right TB
Stop saying that! they'll think I'm a lunger
Listen boy, there's only one way of settling this in these parts
Showdown, high noon
Now it is a cowboy, there lies a pasture
10 cent man takes with the of expense 10 steps
A mind never taught me to show my best kept
So a secret and a lie; peas in the pod
I'm lightning on the draw and there's fire in this rod
In my will to tarnations my death should be avenged
A funeral's a testament; let's see who attends
Small church in Gotham laid down with gems in my eyes
I snap back in my boots, is this the end?
Are you ready to die, boy?
Not today
When that clock strikes noon, draw, dead man
When the troubles of the land
Grab hold round the mountains

The Corner,"The Impossible: Mission (TV Series, Pt. 1)",2006.0,"Yeah, the 15 millionth time, 15 and 1
Check it out
Yo Com, how you rhyme to this slow shit
Yeah yeah, check it out
Yo memories of the corner, we huddled and stayed in trouble
Guzzled on 40 O-Z's and played the double and back
We doublin crack, no wonder why they fear us
We cussin cause our mommas couldn't hear us
Young lovers'll cuddle at 15 shit, they seen the struggle so
That makes him a man con-sidered he got plans but
She don't understand that this is where them fools bust at
Same corner where she go and catch the school bus at
It ain't changed a bit, we stand circle and spit bars
Cigarette butts scattered like glass shattered
And pops he play the corner 'til his day comes, DAMN~!
Ambulances on the corner but hey, now it's offi-cial
Cisco was the daze them cups of E&J
Went down and hit a warm spot even in the winter's cold
We had our snorkel and our winter playboys on
These are the corners we was sent to play boys on
Our socks is pockets, the guns is rockets
It's where the after school fight was at, brand new bikes was at
Fila suits, Kangols and new Nikes was at
Same corner is today's same yesterday

I wish that I cold give you this feelin
I wish that I cold give you this feelin
We was livin on them corners, had a nigga rhymin, drinkin
Whylin, potted out, livin HIGH~!

We live it real, hard, revoke your zeal
God don't come around here no mo'
So why you screamin HIS NAME in vain when the pain hits
Pick yourself up and get to a hospital quick
But leave out the bit, about what went down
I know they hound us for hawkin
Just a flesh wound, stitch it up, keep it walkin
Niggas on the corners loyal, they ain't talkin (they ain't talkin)
Put down the sea of chalk and
The use of chalk is for lines of hopscotch
Or tracin dead bodies for crimes that got botched
For just crime commitin and it's, time to fit it
In the schedule, cause them crosstown niggas
Came to our corner sprayin that lead you pull
Ain't nuttin deeper than pilin in the car
With the streetsweeper so we can clear every star
Off the corner",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-the-corner-lyrics
Big Mouf,Are You In?: Nike+ Original Run,UnKnown,"Some say the game's rigged
Cause The Man didn't give us manuals to the game to make it big
A corner boy tryna claim a smidge
To keep all the right foods in the fridge
Keep all the right dudes on the bridge
When I get in, the captain's seat
Sorta like James Kirk, but my name's Work-MATIC
Here to adjust, the pros oppose to gettin froze than economy plus
Link up with Erick and P
And do a whole collabo together, called +Da Joint+, business class
To run up in first so the biz can last
Instead, the biz went to hell and got infiltrated
By them mainstream infidels, so here to settle the score
Blow up the track to bits and leave nothing!
No clause or claim, provoking a fear or fame
Just know the name! It ain't De La, that's the group I'm in
It ain't old school, that's the truth I blend
And this will not be the realest shit I ever wrote
But more real than theirs, so what that say about the words THEY spoke?
I tell ya like Lou Rawls, you never find this black man with blue balls...
Like U-HAUL, sell a load every area code
Domestic or inter-national, see that sounds a little un-rational
Watch your step, you might TRIP!

Look out below, a nigga done fell in
These rhymes are for sell, but it ain't gun sellin
Tellin tales as such, that's just for liars
Equipped with the hands to silence ya whole choir
Deny her! She the one who started this nonsense
Excuse me, I got issues of my consciences
Flip like Geminis, in fact, I am just a Virgo
Tee shot the bird to skeet skeets a burner to ya big mouf
You can find us in the big house, invitin you to the doorstep
Where the raw's kept, the fourth step, broke
I'mma take him if I got money on his mouth so I'mma move the cliff
The right route, we break bread and make bread
Charge a fam a fee for its mistake bread
Good times, sometimes seem corrupt
I put my shell on the book so we movin on up
Confuse it all up, peep the rule of thumb
I got consent from a king so a bitch can't run
And beggars can't beg when the deaf don't hear
If I'm blind to the facts, I see your bullshit clear
And you been all year in my ear with your feathers
Peacockin the boy, we droppin the boy
Inserts volumes, twenty are dances
It'll be sweet if you heard the advance...
Now bring the chorus in
 (Pos)
SHOUT! Talk about it! Say somethin!
(That's that SHIT right there!)
You heard that? LOUDER! It's the BIG MOUF!

The mirror shows me frowns when the money's tight
Sometime you gotta go LEFT to get the money right
And I'm NOT gonna be left behind
Fuck all your phonecalls, Merce has left the line
Whatever you need say, say it to Trent or Ray or Chris Ak, or Smilez
No longer wanna hear it, unless it's the files of the MP3
Gottin me to spit the P, wit about five-letter Fs' attached
While you in your ride screamin'..
(YO, what the hell did he say?!) (Man, bring that back!)
A poor man's hope, a poor manhood
Back in your egghead like yo...
You niggas will NOT elude me!
Helpin you remember wire the first, you should include me

And SLASHED all four tires on the bandwagon!",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-big-mouf-lyrics
Mornin’ Rise,Are You In?: Nike+ Original Run,UnKnown,"Good mornin'
Good mornin', good afternoon
De La! Soul! Fresh!

Yes, good mornin' (Good mornin')
Because the party don't stop (till the breakadawn)
And we won't go pop (uh-uh, never that)
Yeah, what's your name, dog? (Raheem DeVaughn)
And who you rocking with? (Yes, I'm rocking with the best)
What else do they call us? (De La, baby, baby)
Ain't no and, ifs, or maybes
It's the uncut that will pick you up

For my mornin' rise
I hop straight out of my bed to clear my head and my mornin' eyes
I was swollen in size
So I'm pulled back to the bed to my girl who's bony thighs
And it's no surprise
We spend another hour curled up intertwined like curly fries
Yet it's hard to stay, too much to do, too much to brew in my pot
The stew that I got I want to share with all
Yet I find many things that got me on stall, keep me on slow
Someone upfront, you better give chase
So I pick up the pace to pick up the dough
'Cause sometimes the bread comes in bits and crumbs
I spend half the day throwing fits in thumbs
On the keys of the BlackBerry trying to get a handle on my biz
Callouses from holding on so tight
And the days grow long as something goes wrong that felt so right
My neck's in pain from holding the heavy head up
Lay the chin up, trying to stay the pin-up
On the walls of your mind
Top 5, we drop live on every stage touched
As well as the life pumping your chest clutch
Let me know you a fan of the brand
So I keep with the plan
I keep moving

Don't let your burdens keep you down
Wait till the mornin', things will get better in the mornin'
Keep your head up, things will come around
Wait till the mornin', things will get better in the mornin'
Don't let your burdens keep you down
Wait till the mornin', it's got to get better in the mornin'
Keep your head up, things will come around
Wait till the mornin', things come around better in the mornin'

G-g-g-g-g-good mornin'!
This is the perfect jam to start your day
Good mornin'!
Press ""play"" on this right after you pray
Good mornin'!
(Stop yawning
Got to get up because you reap what you sow)
Good mornin'!
(And if you take too long to see the yawn
You can't get that dough)
Good mornin'!
(Stay diligent
But know when to leave when the opportunity knocks)
Good mornin'!
I think I'ma go out tonight and party on the block
Good God, girl, whoo!
Hey, little mama, tell me what's your name
I'm Radio Raheem
And I want to see you two-step to the De La thang

Don't let your burdens keep you down
Wait till the mornin', things will get better in the mornin'
Keep your head up, things will come around
Wait till the mornin', things will get better in the mornin'
Don't let your burdens keep you down
Wait till the mornin', it's got to get better in the mornin'
Keep your head up, things will come around
Wait till the mornin', things come around better in the mornin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Good mornin', good afternoon
Summer's in the rear, now we crafting toons
Imagine how many stacks to relax the goons
Who be after that harvest that done lapsed in June
And perhaps if we all collapsed in saloons
Popping corks front page in the last tribune
And the headline read ""He'd been acting the coon""
But I was asleep catching Z's in mittens
The season is written in cookbooks
I put a feast on a tab and let the youngs dogs indulge
Pardon the way we expand is the garden of bulge
It's the growth of self
See the price ain't changed on that 
If crack don't get em, the rock's soon got em
As fast as  could set shop in Harlem
I'm setting up the camp and we gon champion change
We gon see if  advances the stage or if the curtain's on em
We're more certain when everybody's naked
Silk ties may make em feel better
But I get my connects via the fabric of respect
If that don't get them, we gon gather ever Tec
Every handgun, missile, wood hand and pistol
Embark on their doorsteps 
To mile them  God bless the child
And Lord tell my pops he made a man out of death
I got a ticket up to see him when I'm done here
It ain't even one year gone with more work to do
Now how the hell am I supposed to serve this through
Huh?

Don't let your burdens keep you down
Wait till the mornin', things will get better in the mornin'
Keep your head up, things will come around
Wait till the mornin', things will get better in the mornin'
Don't let your burdens keep you down
Wait till the mornin', it's got to get better in the mornin'
Keep your head up, things will come around
Wait till the mornin', things come around better in the mornin'

Rock Co.Kane Flow (a cappella),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Up in them five-star tellies and two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without sayin a producer's name, all over the track
Yeah I said it! What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that english
And knock it out before we pour
That sure shot more rock co.kane flow

From the top of the key, the 3 Villain
Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn
Turn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar
Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar
Ya heard? Holla - broad or dude, we leave food
Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up

Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death, or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from bein hot
It's about if you can handle bein cold or not!
And we was told to hop for no one, s'what I dig bout Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin
Hey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that aura
Or I can hold her

The elements are airborne, I smell the success
(Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man)
Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sippin broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing
I think I'll pop these verse like first dates to birthdates
September 2-1, 1-9, 6-8

Is to go out there and get it, y'knahmsayin?
It's like sometimes you gotta just put it all and bet the farm
You ain't gonna get it any other way, you know?
For me it's about bein better than I was yesterday, y'know
I'm sick and tired of bein sick and tired, I'm tired of losin
So I'ma bet it all, y'knahmsayin?

All hail to the check one-two
You can catch one-two at a theatre near
Where you'll find me supportin rap, like a brassiere
Not sayin if the game is tits, but you gotta admit
That the soul be the, holder of the mic device
Rhymes filled with blood and guts, the game filled with
Bolts and nuts, but them shits rusty
And the trusty MC got the W-4
You can find me up in the W. Moore
I'm back on the juice with them heavy-o Chevy rhymes
Missin like crime on the deuce
We don't sit in boats and fish, we sit in studios
And quote words to serve on a dish
And the nerve that you wish you had I got bags of
And tracks are drugs that only make it worse when you're high
Listenin to the Why on the first verse named Wonder
So don't underestimate, what we create
And you'll never find us pullin up to clubs
In them long stretch whales
Or pushin inside girls with Donkey Kong stretch tails
And when all else fails, we hit 'em with the charm
That reflects like muscles on the arm
And even if crowded like food courts
We own home court advantage so we never feel alarmed

It's eighty-six y'all, put your rap on pause
More milk on the mic than them pregnant broads
Nine times out the dime it's a penny on the floor
Same penny you walk around and ignore
See I'm the penny that'll have the deal closed
Turn that point nine nine into one point oh's
A millisecond you'll be needin in the race
That photo finish I ain't even see your face
I'm that one degree that made the Pisa lean
The one goal, one job, one aim and one team
That one good push that gave birth to your dream
That one good year, that one good beer
See you can hit the lotto with hope and a buck
But with 99 cents yo' ass is outta luck
Once upon a time, it's not once it ain't happen
One pop in the air does not mean you clappin
One rap hit does not mean you be rappin
Although you bust rhymes, you ain't kill it ONE TIME~!
Never was to be in the first, just the second one
If you don't find me with mic, I'm mic checkin one
One good pinch, and one good hunch
That's just one bad apple out the New York bunch
Got ones, but I want 2's 3's and 4's
I'm that one when you got one more",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-go-out-and-get-it-lyrics

Talk about my so-called friends
Aiyyo God bless the child who hold his own
And never wanna touch a microphone
Cause the game's addictive, and leave you inflicted
With a bad case of chase the dead president's face
But I know how to pace myself, embrace the wealth
Make time for the dotted line
But when we find some contract, got a con tryin to stab our back
We sever them ties - wash them lies off!
And dry off in the truth
Wonder Why say it, I proofreads
Some speed past and think I won't catch the ink
I don't match with the main word
I heard your bitin before
And it's just a way to get more
Out of America, the land of the wants and needs
Where the flame of greed is hard to put out
So the output is to put yourself first, and worse
Everything that grows from out the Earth is quicker to die
Cause the clouds been actin hard and they too stubborn to cry
But when the rain comes the main drums'll have De La on the track
And whether y'all back us or front
Ain't nuttin gonna stop the progress
Less niggas more money in the pocket to profit from
To then hold loaves of bread instead of crumbs
Aight, now let me talk about my friend
Who some cases that's your girl, check it out
Yo when we clash like titans, I write wars
Rock white tees in L.A. and that's yours
Your brain cell catch that? You move slow
Turtle wax your muscle with this jackrabbit
And crack habits kick that ""Rock Co.Kane"" and when we rhyme
She call me every night and say the dicking's on her mind
Signin like sex, cause sex don't talk
Deaf mute parachutin down to New York like (whistling)
Yeah, I can be your gent
Horses and carriages, roses and wine
Twats are gorgeous but I fucks wit'cha mine
Drownin in ya milk givers, the guilt with us
Cause I got another pair on the other side of town
When she get up to go to work, that's when I get down
Runnin episodes like B.E.T
Over and over like B.E.T
Back shots like a muffler hiccup
Put the boy in your mouth, and drink up!
We on the sink, we on the balcony, we on the stars
A Little Dipper in you, but not in miniature
A co-signed love, but no signature
We dead stop it like Blacksmith ops
Pack bag, drag race back to the shop
Servin coffee over cock over donut holes
We don't sweat a bit cause we know them hoes
Servin coffee over cock over donut holes
I won't sweat your chick cause I know her
Yeah I know her, she my friend

Potholes in my lawn
DOVE:
Everybody's sayin' what to do when
Suckin' lunatics start diggin' and chewin'
They don't know that the Soul don't go for that
Potholes in my lawn
And that goes for my rhyme sheet Which I concentrated so hard
On, see I don't ask for maximum security
But my dwellin' is swellin'
It nipped my bud when I happened to fall
Into a spot Where no ink or an ink-blot
Was on a scroll I just wrote me a new 'mot'
But now it's gone There's no Suckers knew that I hate
To recognise that every time I'm writin' It's gone

Potholes in my lawn
POS:
I've found that it's not wise
To leave my garden untended 'Cause eyes
Have now pardoned all laws of privacy
Even paws are after my writer
See, I've found that everyone's sayin'
What to do when suckers are preyin'
On my well-guarded spreadsheets
Oh why, hell does it send up fleets
Of evil-doers through the big hole
To get to evil-doers who dig holes
Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew
I think I'd better plant traces to give clues
Or better yet call 911
And when they get here I inform them I'm the Plug One
Open a chair and let them realize the reason
For concern of the Soul
'Cause we've come down with a case of potholes

Now you got the method
What to do when you die
The death that I predict in 'Plug Tunin'

That you stole my words of fame

I don't ask for a barbed wire fence, B

It nipped my bud when I happened to fall

Voodoo Circus,"The Impossible: Mission (TV Series, Pt. 1)",2006,"Kick up the dust like ""Another One Bites the""
It ain't the Queen version, see you heard 'em back on Bentley Road
With the show council - whattup Divine - the bell rang
It ain't no champagne fall, we dump the taste through the crack
For the folks under the floor, on tour {*beatboxing*}
Ever since I was a ""Fat"" bastard
But now I travel a little light in my skin
It ain't all that cute, I still tuck a little in
Like Schwinn bikes sting 'em Ray sting 'em, Ray sting 'em (""Sting 'em Ray!"")
I blind box, niggas hit 'em when I hear 'em
It stays six here to bake you rap crumbcakes
So scrumptious with cholesterol
Lube out your squeak, your selection is weak
This combination is like Halle and Beyonce (BAD!)
But smooth like Ponce DeLeon
Explorin this Dave West bounce that we on
On on on on on on on...
(""Here's a very curious thing, a verse that'll fit any song"")

We all do what we gotta do
When no love in the heart of a city
No love in the heart of a crew, so most break up
Others stay together, cause there's not enough money to leave
They tryin to get the cake up, frost it out a little
In eight days and wake up, exercise demons
Leave you in a state screamin, ""Come back De La, come back~!""
Sorta how Prince did to Nikki
No need for that, here to give it to you quickly
Cause some of y'all lookin kinda sickly
Eatin that bullshit rap (word) split ya asshole
Then let all the whack shit fall out
Then come grab another pouch and sprinkle us in (sprinkle it)
Until you stay twinklin, roll your ass up
No I won't pass up a toke, for all the shit De La wrote
So smell us all on your clothes
Try to wash us out, we ain't comin out, that's how it goes
Winner of the pro see- FUCK ALL AWARDS (""Fuck all y'all!"")

Yeah, and wipe your face pa
Your bone swat on speak tongues that ain't near ya
I knew Cayman since we met on the Island
Kodak kid (CLICK) kept it all candid
An apple a day, we have FUN dip
I knew one dip, after school special delivery
She kept up on asses like Nancy Drew
We did a dance or two, until my girlfriend showed up

(Nigga I know you ain't disrespectin me who is this bitch?)
(Why is this bitch all in your face? Why is this bitch ALL, IN, YOUR, FACE)
(Yeah whatever nigga just dancin, I am not the numerical uno)
(So you got one night out and wanna act like a little monkey?)
(I know IT'S HARD OUT HERE FOR A CHIMP~!)

Can I get a Soul Clap?
It's the summertime 1969 nigga, born durin the Woodstock
Many men do wish they could rock
But all they do is inject the value of shock
But KABOOM, I blow up the spot, the scene
The little ones, the teens, them elders, the peers
They don't run in fear, they gravitate
To the way I navigate know-how inside your ear
(Never) fabricate vo-cals inside your ear
And let's make it clear, I'm Plug (""one for the trouble"")
Wonder Why (""for the time"")
Workmatic, pullin them dimes
Who like to get on their knees and {*WHISTLE BLOWS*}
And {*WHISTLE BLOWS*} and {*WHISTLE BLOWS*} and {*WHISTLE BLOWS*}

Clear Lake Auditorium,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Chorus: All
If you can dig it, deal with it, if you can't, just forget it
Cause nobody rocks the party like we
Get loose, get loose, Sunshine get loose
Just rock, and show 'em you got juice
And have, have, have, have, have, have, have fuuuuuuun!
Verse 1: LA Sunshine
I know it's been a while since the last time
You're heard LA Sunshine pick up the microphone and rhyme
But now I think it's time to go for mine
So you can sit back, relax, just max and unwind
Because it's time for me to out a few heads to bed
Because I'm upset at what somebody said
I've heard it through the grapevine it's been said
That Sunshine, can't rhyme?
Ha! That's the funniest line that I heard in a long time
The wanna be me's that they I sound off beat
I'm not off beat, I'm totally unique and it sounds real sweet
So if you're ready, get set for a trip to the sun
You'll be guided, and I've decided to become
One to take total control of your soul
Young or all be bold because it's a sight to behold
Chorus:
Sticks and stones might break your bones but Pos is gonna blow your mind
Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time!
Verse 2: Posdnuos
Now you can bet that I'm first kick a watt
Soul son, Plug One, Posdnuos I'm top notch
Forward, backstep, got cabbage on the brain
So I'm leafy, peasy, and I act kind of sane
So homeboys and girls just come follow me
I'm the fried pipe piper down with dub and Plug Three
I like my mans, freestyle is not my flow
But I gets mad respect from Norfolk to Glasgow
I run this up to court about a minute to the sec
Cause my hoodie won't clash with Whipper Whip's mockneck
So my hip-hop teachers please show me the math
And after this give me your goddamn autograph
Chorus:
Whipper Whip, you can make the microphone sing
Walking around sporting your diamond ring
All the ladies know you as an MC king
So get on the mic and tell 'em it ain't no thing
Verse 3: Whipper Whip
Well the Prince is my title and, I do what I must do
When rappers get beside themselves, that's when I bust two
Or three, see it doesn't matter to me
Cause the W-H-I-P's got an army
Whipper Whip, the Whipster, money gripster
Can't stand the tipster unless she got the hips to
Move a mountain, left on Kingsly and Fountain
1345 is where I used to count them
The grips in my bucket's the kind that choke horses
No more losses and no toy mosses
It's the Kings of Kingsly, from Bronx to Hollywood
I'm Whipper Whip, I but the G in ""good""
Yo I can blow like a whistle, run far beyond average
Been rapping to the man like Randy Savage
You be the judge, come stand as I slam some
There's open invitation to all and then some
Chorus:
Sticks and stones might break your bones but JD Dub is gonna blow your mind
Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time!
Verse 4: Dove
I kick the Chatanooga Choo Choo so listen to the calling
Next stop's the body rock, here's the ticket to my clock
It's the flips, but keep your jaws on your hips
]From back in the days I used to air it to the hits
Earn the dance step and guaranteed to play the wheel to wheel
And Wild Style was the real, dig it?
I block the heckles and hecks and gets nuff respects
Without the ""bah diddy bah"" I couldn't go and cash checks
Chorus:
DJ Mase, since you got the bass, why don't you hit it, hit it?
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it!
The do re, the mi phi, the sol la, the Tito
Rocking it, rocking it, yes he is rocking it
Tito, rocking it!
Verse 5: Tito
Smiggity smoking, no joking, turning styles like a token
No singer, but swinging rap lyric like a ringer
I'm solo, like Bobo, breaking backs like Bolo
No kitten, no hitting booby traps for the sitting
Ducks should I mention rhyme breezing like Benson
Or hedges, I'm fuming autographs for the human
Being, I'm g-ing, off like keying
Or Keenan, live Ivory, Waynan, who's slaying?
A TV or movie, hit singles often move me
Like groove me, they got me lingers like a ???
No slipping, no tripping on me while I'm ripping
Slam dunking like a donut on the Bulls Scottie Pippen
A vocab that's no fad, I'm Heftier than Glad bags
My son's about 2, buckaroo and yelling ""Go dad!""
Chorus:
Sticks and stones might break your bones but Superstar's blows your mind
Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time!
Verse 6: Superstar
I get the honor to rap with some old school greats
Caz, Whipper Whip, Tito, and LA
Maseo, Posdnuos, Trug, they from the new school
A perfect blend from the old and new
Superstar, where did I fit in? How did I get in?
Where did I begin, sin?
I'm known from Belcourt to Freeport, not a West Coast or Five Boroughs
Yeah, my name's whispered in the ghettos
When I'm on stage, I write a book, flip a page
Write a chapter, and leave a hell of a phrase
Now, before I go, you know that I'm a pro, yo
You won't forget me, why, because I flow
Chorus:
So GMC, ha, GMC, ha ha, GMC ha, GMC, ha ha
GMC, ha huh! (Yo my throat is sore)
Yo, get on the mic, stay on the mic (dammit)
Rock on the mic with your rhymes galore!
Verse 7: Grandmaster Caz
Well I'm a black act back to attack the wack New Jack
Smack the sad sack track with the stack of facts
True old data, see you later alligator
Raid or raider Darth Vader, cause I'm greater or rater
Made a plate of soul food, barbequed a rude dude with the attitude
Who got screwed cause he chewed
But I'm a writer, you can't take a bite of
So light up your lighter and watch me recite a
Dope verse or two with the curse or two, yeah rehearse a cue
But first a few minutes of funk, preferably seven
Microphones, all I need is one
MC's to school, ten or eleven then a bottle of Don
When the job is done, but don't stop me now
I'm on a roll, control the whole stroll
And bowl the whole toll, fold the known souls
Patrol shoot the fruit, toot toot the hoot
Scoot with the loot and knock a cute suit boots
Entertain your brain like Kane, not strain to maintain my main (shit) stain
Walls record us, break through the borders
All the manslaughters and kidnap daughters
Who are building and chlling in the building with a villian
I'm killing and illing but still in like Bob Dylan
I'm Democratic emphatic erratic static I'm good at it
And suckers get gatted with the automatic
Rhymes are plenty, styles are many
Yeah, and that's as real as Jimmy sticking Jenny
If anybody knows a trick to slip my wig
With a lick or real sick with a lyrical brick
He's a vick bound to get tracked off
Step to the Grandest and you'll get slapped off
Stage, and thoroughly stomped with the quickness
Now can I get a witness, cause I'm out",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-clear-lake-auditorium-lyrics

You know I'm just havin a ball

A part time sucker, I implore the game (word up)
She quick to dodge-balls, avoidin the face stain
Jack-in-the-box, nah that ain't no haps
I need that Mrs. Potato Head in my lap
In checkers and chess I do a big cut bounce
36 ounces of hula hoop hips
I'm shootin for that Duck Hunt, that Dan Quayle tail
What I gotta spell it out? I'm about to campaign
For that President Bush, damn I declare war
Bring on some of your friends, matter fact, the next whore

Alright I'm tryin to have a ball without all that girl talk
Cause my girl wouldn't like that either

Routine to rock roll and rip shows
Across the zip codes and fold the thick loads
Of information inside your earlobes
We are the high end thread for your mere clothes
Outside of the box is where you'll find us
Those who find to it, step behind us
It's not about the lead, we not tryin to be
The heir to the throne but the air that you breathe and it's
Protocol for us to get at y'all
With a face filled with game
We play without the cheat codes, we don't need those to rock
Close the do' in our face, best believe we gon' knock
Let us in y'all

It's De La, that's how we do
We just have a ball everytime we have a ball

(Mary had a little lamb)
That's a fib, she had two twins, though and one crib
Now she's only fourteen, what a start
But this defect is ground common in these parts
Now life in this world can be such a bitch
And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch
Negative's the attitude that runs the show
When the stage is the G-H-E-T-T-O
DOVE:
Which is the one to blame when bullets blow
Either Peter, Jane, or John or Joe
But Joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk
And Peter's pimping Jane, and John's a punk

Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains
Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown
The kids are all alone
Cause it's just the ghetto thang

POS:
Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule
This title is sought by the coolest fool
Define coolest fool? Easy, the one who needs
Attention in the largest span and loves to lead
Always found at the jams, but never dance

The future plays no matter, just the present flow
When the greeting place is the G-H-E-T-T-O

Lies are pointed strong into your skull
Deep within your brain against the wall
To hide or just erase the glowing note
Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat
Truth from Trugoy's mouth is here to scar
Those who blame the G for all bizarre
So open up your vents and record well
For this is where we stand, for the true tell
Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways
Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play
If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range
Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change
Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact
They lie like ghettos form, cause people lack
To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold
The truth they never told
Cause it's just the ghetto thang
IT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD)
POS:
Do people really wish when they blow
Out the cake candles, and if so
Is it for the sunken truth which could arise
From out the characters in which the ghetto hides
Roses in the ring supply their shown relief
Granted it's planted by their shown belief
Kill and feed off your own brother man
Has quickly been adopted as the master plan
Posses of our people has yet to provoke
Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke
What causes this defect, I don't know
Maybe it's the G-H-E-T-T-O
IT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD)
Standing in the rain is nothing felt
When problems hold more value, but never dealt
With buildings crumbling to the ground
Impact noise is solid sound
But who's the one to say this life is wrong
When ghetto life is chosen strong
We seem to be misled about our dreams
But dreams ain't what it seems
When it's just the ghetto thang

Excuse me, junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light, what a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway push couldn't shove me
To understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave

My tears show my hard earned work

Believe it or not
The plots forms a fee
More than charity

To kill for it

Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time
8 ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all
Tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue

By the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole

Word to the Dero
The answer shoulda been no

Rewind that back

Great all-dedication
Mos Def affiliation
Adequate representation
This is the phat presentation
De La dedication
Common Sense collaborations
Peace to all of you Haitians
Check it out
Chorus: repeat 2X
If money makes a man strange -- we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go round
If love is against the law -- listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin down
Verse One: Dove
Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh
But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name
I guess love ain't nuttin but emotion and game
It's a lesson well learned so praise is well due
I'm sendin off from Big I, to Kenny Calhoun
And add a reservation for the resident crew
And yo get your bowl cuz we cookin up stew
See them Cubans don't care what y'all niggas do
Colombians ain't never ran with your crew
Why you acting all spicy and sheisty
The only Italians you knew was icees, niggas price me
I'm keepin it clean, like a washing machine
And yo, get your locomotion run into full steam
I'm sending out a greeting to my man Daseem
I got a child so I gotsta get the green, right right
Chorus
Itzsoweezee, it's gettin hot this year
Itzsoweezee, it's gettin hot
(repeat 4X)
Verse Two: Dove
I own the deeds to some acres in the West Indies
Where my pops is building residence to house my seed
Now here's the lead, y'all niggas pray to hot rods and not God
While Versace play you niggas like Yahtzee
Crackin jokes like you're Potsie
(When's the last time you had Happy Days?)
Blazin up your herb to escape the maze, but the problem stays
Think big get it big is my motto
You can go and play your lotto, I'll be singin like baby won't you be mine
You'll be pressin rewind, you can never see mine
Keep your eyes focused, you can't touch this or quote this
Style is crazy bogus so you can't try to approach this
Stomp you out like roaches, pullin on my coattail
Like some horses pullin coaches, WHOA your roller coasters
It's hotter than the temperature that's cookin in your toasters
While the heat'll put you deep into hypnosis

The Pitch,Smell the DA.I.S.Y,2014.0,"A Nubian sprocket is the one
Plug One, cut the cap
Forward is the marcher of the chant
Now to the clan, unless you slept
Willy to the Wonka of the feast
Smoke your blunts, but close your drapes
And if we get fined by police
Don't sweat it, yo, I got papes
Toxic is the talk that I tell
The note be held by the lady who's fat
Chris made the dope beat for no Bo Peeps
And you can't beat that, that's a fact

He's no batter, he's no batter, batter
He's no batter, he's no batter

Swingin' with that good old step
It's Plus Dos, groove a gut
On gets by when it's kept
Three miles to my strut
Forgivin' them fools that's false
I cook goose, serve a plate
Position is never at a loss
No cost, no relate
See Dave's got a badge of his own
Cause the link in the life got slack
I'm lick it down to the Tootsie Pop
And you can't beat that with a bat

Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without sayin a producer's name, all over the track
Yeah I said it! What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that english
And knock it out before we pour
That sure shot more rock co.kane flow

From the top of the key, the 3 Villain
Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn
Turn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar
Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar
Ya heard? Holla - broad or dude, we leave food
Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up

Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death, or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from bein hot
It's about if you can handle bein cold or not!
And we was told to hop for no one, s'what I dig bout Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin
Hey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that aura
Or I can hold her

The elements are airborne, I smell the success
(Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man)
Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sippin broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing
I think I'll pop these verse like first dates to birthdates

Answering any other service
Perogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my utility
After the battle they admit that I'm with it
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with like
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm)
Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma
Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know'
Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet
Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid

Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method

Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative
Flow to the sway 'cause I say fa-so-la-ti
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell
Motions of the Soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
Vocal is local so believe that
This chant shan't rely on the strong lap
Trying and live so you best realise
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap
Style of the Tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study 'cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all
Watch while the pitcher is pitching
'Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard Dove crying 'I ain't fair'
Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the B-B 'cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the Plug Tune

The Magic Number (Chad Jackson Hip Hop Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"POS
3
That's the Magic Number
Yes it is
It's the magic number
Somewhere in this hip hop soul community
Was born 3 Mase Dove and me
And that's the magic number
(What does it all mean?)
Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in my measure
Measure in my music raised in three parts
Casually see but don't do like the Soul
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewsters are funky
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air
Criticising rap shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires
And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter
A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set
Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production
It stands for ""Da Inner Sound Y'all"" and y'all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function
Everybody wants to be a deejay
Everybody wants to be an emcee
But being speakers are the best
And you don't have to guess
De La Soul posse consists of three
And that's the magic number
DOVE
This here piece of the pie
Is not desser but the course that we dine
And three out of every darn time
The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind
Showing true position, this here piece is
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin'
When that negative number
Fills up the cavity
Maybe you can subtract it
You can call it your lucky partner
Maybe you can call it
Your adjective
But odd as it may be
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be
My 3 Mase Pos and Me
And that's the Magic Number
Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who are never scrolls
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug
Time is a factor so it's time that counts
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number
Now you may try to subtract it
But it just won't go away
Three times one?
(What is it?) (One, two, three!)
And that's a Magic Number
(Yo, what's up?)
(1, 2, 3)
(I say, children, what does it all mean?)
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3)
(I wouldn't lie to you)
(No more no less, that's a magic number)
(No more no less)
(What it is?)
(No more no less)
(Do the shang-a-lang)
(No more no less)
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?)
(No more no less)
(How high's the water, mama?)
(No more no less)
(How high's the water, mama?)
(No more no less)

By some girls who managed to run me over
Over the fact De La Soul was in a shopping mall
The gall of the floozies
Though kids pose with no chains or uzis
Yo they're straight up weak
Now I made it to the end of the street, what do I spot
... it made me drop my soda bop
To the beat y'all it seems my nightmare won't stop
I spot myyyyyyyyy girl and this cop
Gazin at a De La Soul poster on the side of a building
Was willing to forget it but my girl was singin
Like a beaut' how cute Trugoy was
And if she was older how she'd be his boy
Was this somethin I deserved
I'm a dedicated proom, only cheated once in a blue moon
And she's ready to quit me for some face on a wall
The cop gets a call and
He had to jet, bet the more man with a holster
Now I'm quick to face the troublesome poster
Pulled out a marker that I had stashed
Figured I'd give him a blue mustache
But with a dash I received a slash
From a fist, it was my girl fist at that
I knew what I was doin would truly toast her

What the Fuck #2,"The Impossible: Mission TV Series, Part 1",UnKnown,"We back with the ""What the Fuck"" portion of the tape
We 'bout to get into this song called, ""Mindstate,"" which was recorded
When we was makin all the songs for ""Buhloone Mindstate""
And this is a song we made purposefully
Just to fuck with 
Tommy Boy
's heads like
We wanted them to think we was on some crazy shit
And we didn't, we, we had no plans on puttin this on the album
And of course, certain people in the boardroom, when they heard it
They liked it but we still didn't care so
Here we go, ""Mindstate,"" check it out y'all

You can't beat my mindstate {*3X*}

Aiyyo let's skin the ghost
Because the sheet's been stained with the ocean
(Wishy-washy, wishy-washy, wishy-washy)
I am the elf to seventh closed closet
Burnt to the Flintstone...
Singing in the black man's wish
Figure me zoomed to the outskirts
Slave with the big black sword
Down in the underbelly...
Walk, run, pick, pluck
Astinence to FUCK-INNNG
The M = a norm
Timbs made fruit to skills (hello)
Tally on {*3X*}
I'm not hard
You can't beat my mindstate {*4X*}

Aww yeah, where he where he be?
Where he go? (Yo I got that fat shit~!)
To make matters worse (yo I got that fat shit)
You got money in the purse (yo I got that fat shit)
Had to sit down for a while from my style
Was too heavy to bear (yo I got that fat shit)
For my head to contemplate (yo I got that fat shit)
Went on the blind date (she was a fat shit)
I'm not home {*everyone laughs*}

I get gooder than gettin be (""GOOD!"")
Gooder than, gooder than, gooder than - gettin be (""GOOD!"")
Time to play the low self watch...
I get to zone on the kosher stuff
With my avenue attitude
But I'd really like a psycho meditation
(Anybody, anybody, anybody, anybody..)
With my Indonesian boogaloo
Makes the mix cause the rainy weather is flyin soon
And ABC News won't be able to catch it baby
I'm not home
You can't beat my mindstate {*4X*}

When a sperm cell met with Haaaaa-dy
(Twelve months later) the first words was dad
Then I ran into a Peppermint Paaaa-ty
Charlie Brown gets mad
(He's comin after me) no he ain't
Yes he issssssssssss (no he ain't)
He's now over my house shootin out all the windows
(""Broken glass, everywhere!"")
Just like I'm standin here doin the same to his
(""Everywhere!"") Cause I'm not, home
You can't beat my mindstate {*4X*}
You can't beat my mind {*2X*}
You can't beat my {*2X*}
You can't beat {*2X*}
You can't {*2X*}

Yeah yeah, that was ""Mindstate""
And I ain't even gonna give it a
""What, the, what, the?!""

Tommy Boy

I mean, every mornin I wake up and I give thanks
Y'know, that I get dressed up and rob banks
I don't need a mask, I ain't askin for favors
Everybody got it rough
If you were the only one who had it bad
Then there would be a cause for effect, you hear me?
It's easy to live after the world's opinion
It's easy to live accordin to your own
And when she don't got love for you, man
She's like a loaf of bread with nuttin to drink
Goin down hard, that's word up
She'll tear anything up for you

Poetic Greed,Are You In?: Nike+ Original Run,UnKnown,"Greed got you thinkin you're speedin up, when you really slowing down
Got your eyes bigger than anything your arms could ever fit around
And still, you want more...always more...
Satisfaction guaranteed but never comes
Bend you backwards into believing it's your birthright to own the world
Excessive, too many cars in the garage
Bling on every finger, possessions pulling at you
Poisoned by that money mentality
Your vision ain't clear for them designer shades
Can't even see the sky, only empty space to buy
The pursuit of paper got you running so fast after that green
Drowning in things, tangled in your own tenacity
Desire for that dollar...",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-poetic-greed-lyrics

I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop

It's that brown man from long islandin' shores
Got a way with women, so I get away with yours
Because you're whole game's outdated
Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated
Mummy you can play your ripley's

I shoot gift like heron
With skills of gil-scott
Nights like sir lancelot can get heated
Prescribin' your vibe, love
I know how you need it

I like to mingle sometimes
So I head out of state to find a couple of dimes
But a government rate can't settle for no nickels
Even pennies for thought for short
I need connections
With big bank selections
Securing all the sections
With sing-sing corrections
Seedin' like nature, escapin' like gas
Tell me how long this love is gonna last
Thinkin' fast might spoil somethin'
Turn a (?) to nothin'
(?) to your lady is special
Seen a bigger picture on the screen
But you're a movie, you move me
You soothe me like holidays, getaways
The brochure said do it
So true
It's not a hold hand mission
Cut the public display
Heard you're headed for the stars
Put the gazers away
Mine times out of ten
We cut to good friends
But when we on the tenth
We gotta go the length
I'm not a playa
Yet i get more play
Than a talk show shown
Cross the USA
Have em' moanin' out the vowels sounds
Ooh, eeii, and aahh
And how by now you should know me and my crew members
Do members of the opposite sex
Have their boyfriend screaming out
We got more techs
Than that ball team in georgia

All because the ho wanna go to the casbah

You can get with
Some of these women
Some of the time
When your face is in the light
(?) stirred with lime
Is it a crime
To set your mind to death?
Resuscitated
See how many brain cells left
I feel your body's drawn to my positive
Don't even want a baby
If it's that easy to give
I live right around the corner
Three states away
Take a holiday
Come check me
Watch how I set the
Mood, check a movie on the tube
Get your belt mad loose like lee
Phone's turned way down
To avoid the beef
Or the questions
If she's the only one gettin' lessons
You're into crime faces, huh?
Well i'll play your capone
Suzy q got the grill
To make the cake chrome
Situation's gettin absurd
Hot on a plat
So work the format
See how we do that?
And you're figurin
We love on the rock

To maintain the stock
Displayin all the goodies
From your knuckle to knees
Make it hot like the island degrees

And we ain't cons
So just like Etta (At Last)

Who works harder? You say First Serve
Try to say different, say you got some nerve!
See you got some herbs that gon' hate
The Band-Aid is for dem boys! Nikita La Femme boys!
The key to the city is ours
The broads, the house, the cars
The sky's the limit, the stars
Shalamars in it, there it is!

The energy's a tall glass of milk, the secret's best kept
In the basement, potential amazement
Until we hit the surface of the pavement, PEACE!

The Grind Date (Inhumanz mash-up),UnKnown,UnKnown,"If the meek shall inherit the earth
And not the weak
Let me inherit the street, fuck it
You know what I mean?
I mean I love life man, you know what I mean
Life is beautiful, it's just the shit in it that's fucked up
It's rough but it's fair
People gotta go out there and bust they, bust they ass for a job
I mean, my dad's got five kids, man and I mean yo
He hates drivin' a bus but he loves five kids
You feel me?
I'm a rhyme artist
Out here tryin' to grind my hardest
Up early so to milk the cow
Keep my john deere out here plowin' the fields
To keep my john hancock's worth up in the now
Went from hangin' on blocks to hangin' on charts
Positions is parta my mission to hangin' on top
Gotta get your polly cracker or with them crackers
And them scheisty ass niggas if you like it or not
I've been rewired to work more efficiently in the dirt
I'm hands on with it all up in my cuticles
Some try to get off the farm but fell into harm
Of gettin in the game of those street pharmaceuticals
But, I was raised in those blue collar themes
Havin' white collar dreams cause I see what it means
And though the meek shall inherit the earth but don't forget
The poor are the ones who inherit the debt
You can bet I got better things to do than that
I was a dick who got jerked by Tom and his boys
Came on my land, seized my cattle, and catalog
As if it wouldn't leave me less than coy
But I'm far from bitter even farther from quittin'
Got a grind date to make, no time for sittin'
And playin' xbox, stand up and exercise my rights
As of by seen of through masta's eye
It's the grind date
Know what I'm sayin? I'm sick of askin' that
I mean, the street philosophy is that
I'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat
At least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink
Because sometimes you can't come back
Like momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3
Ask for 10, that's for sure
Yo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that
I was born with the boom bap, respect the name
My hands on experience was hands on my first contract
Taught me quick how to respect the game
Introduced to the block, got used to the block
But your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn
It's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed
But we got ahead, and we got along
And puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars
Worth of hump days that broke the camel's back
The grind'll make today look gray
And paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black
Meet the rhyme, street grind, son whatever the beast
I'm a take it at the horns till the pinky toe torn
And show you why we here this long
Cause when it comes to puttin' in work
Once again it's on
I'm just like everybody else man
An average nigga with above average potential
You know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman
I'm sayin that I know how to act like a gentleman
In order to get the things that I need
And if I gotta pull out my nickle bag, I'm gonna do that
This ain't no accident, we stayin' here
You damn right I am proud of myself man
And I'm proud of my team man
I don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real?
I don't have sex with people I do business with neither
And that's the real
But I do do business with people that I have sex with
So if there ain't no conflict, let's get this grind on
Cause I'm gonna fuck the shit outta you, that's word",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-the-grind-date-inhumanz-mash-up-lyrics

Sinin' above all who are y'all to boast
Stayed calm and all came to me to host

Now my bix became a bouqet
Every nose in it, fillin' up seats like a session in a Senate
Been a minute since ya heard the souls
So the soul gon' cost ya three
All ya people wanna front like the soul don't hold control
But it don't mean shit to me
Plain to see that a song like this been what ya all missed
Come on, genuine adrenaline from off the wrists
We run the interference throughout the game clout
Can't be denied the bout for the title
Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol
Bring it back to the draw
Ghosts of grand wiz Theodore
Played dirty with ever since played on the floor
Stop verbal assaults just in case a war break out
Steal vaults bigger than giraffes

But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from Denver up to Maine
And lovin' deluxe
She won't catch me in no tux
Nah, man I won't honor the style
(Curious, curious, curious, curious)
DRES: How you doing, my name is Dres, listen...
SHORTY: Isn't that Posdnuos? Oh, my...
DRES: Baby, what's wrong with me?
POS:
Funny funny how time flies
When you have some light on the face
Cause the focus is the fickle
'Stead of fusin' I'm a use it
To the utilize the trickle caught the rush
But I play hush
While Andres Titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush Dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for Titus when he Blacked the Sheep
But as the Knee went Deep
To deeper off the charts
The album faded to black
That's when the amnesia starts
(Curious, curious, curious, curious)
SHORTY: Aren't you Dres from Black Sheep? What are you doing here? Who
Are you here with?
DRES: I'm with my man Pos, you know Pos...
SHORTY: Oh yeah, Positive K, I.. I like him...

DOVE:
Hey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in
Should I shot it or begin
I saw bootleggas no shinin'
I saw Big 4 go get shinin'
A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
""Ain't you?"" Yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being True dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight
I mail my ass to the darkness
I dig it, I dug it
I dig it, I dug it
I wiz it, I was it
I wiz it, I was it
Oh Lord let me switch it off
Because ya find some'll do it all
For the light

Supa Emcees (clean version),"More Supa Sweet Stakes, Baby",UnKnown,"Chorus: (Slick Rick sample from MC Ricky D and Doug E. Fresh's ""La-Di-Da-Di"")
Hey, whatever happened to the *emcees*
Times done changed for the *emcees*
Every woman and man wanna *emcee*
But for what, I tell you *emcee*ing ain't for you!
Hey, whatever happened to the *emcees*
Times done changed for the *emcees*
Every woman and man wanna *emcee*
But for what, I tell you *emcee*ing ain't for you!
Verse One: Dove
Man I'm on the set like the flicks so let your parents flash
A splash bigger than whales, I'm makin monsters mash
Spit Pinnochio's Theory when shit be looking weary
I need rest, but I boogie for now, I'm on some mess
Like the best mics respond to me
Living days, like dreams of specializing in the art that pays
I be a mystic for life, so check my ID number
Emcees be kneading/needing dough while I make bread like Wonder
Yes, that's what you heard, so save that acting for the screen
See you can can that manager with the beans
I bust emcees like lies surprise em out the box
Put away the soda pops I'd rather rub on the rocks
A dime-getter tried to get what I got, for what?
I guess Southern folks cash makes the lovin come fast
But I'm past alla that, it's time to break with the breeze
Get to your knees, here comes the Supa Emcees
Chorus
Verse Two: Pos
Within this program of rap, I eradicate the glitches
Yo I'm dark like Wesley, but I be sparkin more bitches
Entering my constellation put your lives in jep
While you others represent, I present my rep
Cause when it comes to making dents, I'm that main imprint
Even smoke from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint
Could not prevent, YOU from seeing I'm the light
But bring attention to my words like some ads in tights
I heard you want to fight me, with your words on stage
So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam YOU made
And as he starts cutting what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones
As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean ""Puffy"" Combs
Send your tattered ass home, with celly phones I roam
With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete
While you live fables, unstable, acting very radical
Projecting like you're hard, when in fact you're quite vaginal

(Verse 1)
Get up and do the biz, our style is the wild
Hit you with a spell whether Jew or gen-tile
When you enterin' the realm
You find me at the helm
Still standin' like abandoned buildings
In the southern part of BX, can old school it like a T-Rex
Ya well advanced connect dance with thoughts
Deep like Barry White's throat box
I bet you those cops mix
Double high tower my power grants me the chicks
The blows the cars and enemies that wanna spar
You wanna see it no matter who you are
Yeah I'm bound to ground you like that
Put they ass on a mound and introduce em' to a baseball
Face tall, brag about it like teenage sex
Text book characters gettin' etched out to rough draft
Rush Limbaugh autograph her left titty
New Yor, New York yeah we bigger than the buildings
Do it for the love of the art and the childrens
And throw paper machet inside of ya models
See we all throttles, we zip by in this drive
Allergic to ya sperm broke hives
Concerned about ya ;ife when ya down eight lives
Top of the night I'm up in queens like ah yeah
(Repeat 1)
(Verse 2)
Introducin' introducin' to you Dave
Batter on deck, carded every time I set foot in the joint
Cabaret artist I'll two piece ya tray
If she wanna get vamped, bring her to the tent
Touch her till her back indents
Wrap it extra strength
Run a lap on her calculatin' the length
Holdin' mics tighter than hymens
Old school it like Holly-Hobby, Head-to-Head, Easy Bake Oven
Strong Jerome lovin' man I hit the pack
Panther power keep it all relative to the sixties
Bill Bixby green, ATM money
Got my pockets lookin' like I'm rockin' Popeye jeans
Classic like Reuben and Rah
One nigga under the groove we shootin' for that Parliament high
Plus bigger than the fourth of July
Take the back seat drive out
Hey yo, hey yo ain't nothin' street about me more like a light post
Sinin' above all who are y'all to boast
Stayed calm and all came to me to host
My vocab grabs many, long to cultivate raps
It's gettin' filled moms jack penny
It used to be unknown around the way
Now my bix became a bouqet
Every nose in it, fillin' up seats like a session in a Senate
Been a minute since ya heard the souls
So the soul gon' cost ya three
All ya people wanna front like the soul don't hold control
But it don't mean shit to me
Plain to see that a song like this been what ya all missed
Come on, genuine adrenaline from off the wrists
We run the interference throughout the game clout
Can't be denied the bout for the title
Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol
Bring it back to the draw
Ghosts of grand wiz Theodore
Played dirty with ever since played on the floor
Stop verbal assaults just in case a war break out
Steal vaults bigger than giraffes
But they still got a lot for me
Heard em' say alot of nigga with the underground
They'd die for the underground but ain't makin' no money

You're gonna be sorely missed my nigga, word
And this is the (WHAT~!) if portion of the tape
And what if... De La would have got, the ""Do You"" beat
That S.V. used from J.D. first
I mean, we wanted that joint BAD y'all
But - by the time we reached out for it
Jay let us know, my man got it and umm
They did their thing on it y'all but yo

Overwhelmed, overjoyed, overstep
My bounds, on your touchy subject
Your weight, shape's not what I date
It's you, my crew don't mind it thick (Uh-uh)

On them little ass girls, when a clique of niggas

Reverend Do Good #2,AOI: Bionix,2001,"Mmmmm... I fell in love
We're feeling good
Make you want to do good
Now ask me
Do you want to look good?
Wether wearing your Sean Johns
Or your rough rider *woof woof*
Giddy up! For Jesus!
Giddy up! For Jesus!
Jesus is everywhere
In the church, you see Jesus
When you go to sleep, you dream Jesus
When you wake up, you see Jesus
When you put your toast in the toast, who'll pop up? *ding* Jesus! (Jesus!)
When you take your clothes out of the dryer, who do you see? (Jesus!) Jesus!
Now I looked in my closest and guess who I saw (Jesus!)
No! But when I turned around, he was right behind me!
He was right behind me! He was right behind me!",https://genius.com/De-la-soul-reverend-do-good-2-lyrics
