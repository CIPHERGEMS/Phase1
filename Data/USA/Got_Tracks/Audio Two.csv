Top Billin’,What More Can I Say?,1987,"Check it out!

MC am I, people call me Milk
When I'm bustin up a party I feel no guilt
Gizmo's cuttin
, up for thee
Suckers that's, down with nei-
-ther one of us,
 that's how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the Two, we're rated R
We're gifted, and we're going far
Down the road, to the bank
While I'm here I'd like to thank
Mom and dad, they knew the time
Gizmo's scratching, Milk Dee's rhyming

Milk is chillin', Giz is chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
Since you understood, would you

Stop scheming, and looking hard
I got a great big bodyguard
So step up if you wanna get hurt
Milk Dee's gonna pull the skirt
I get money, money I got
Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot
That's how it is, you can ask Giz
I stole your girl while you were in prison
Jailed for MC assault
You was jealous it's all your fault

Milk is chillin', Giz is chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you

Clap your hands, your hands you clap
If your girl's out of place it's your girl I slap
And if you're dumb, you'll ask why
I am from Bed, Do-or-Die
The Audio Two, the Two's Audio
I got a brother and his name's Gizmo

Milk is chillin', Gizmo's chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you

Bite a rhyme, if you dare
I get the papers so I don't care
My contributions to this jam
Is confusing, because I am
Milk Dee stated all the way
The super easy midas MC okay
Yes I'm down, down by law
I get the girlies out on the floor
G is D, down is G
Two the at the top is where he'll be
The at is us, call us the aud
Girls come in you won't be bored

Milk is chillin', Gizmo's chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, 
got it good
And since you understood, would you

Do a dance, dance the Two
If, you can dance it's easy to do
This dance is on and 
on and on
Dance until your breath is gone!
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
What more can I say? Top billin'

Hickeys Around My Neck,What More Can I Say?,1988,"I, always hated hickeys all around my neck
But it was feelin' pretty good so what, the heck
The hickey went on, and I went home
I tried to brush it off then I used a comb
The comb didn't work it got bigger, and redder
Giz said, ""Yo Milk man you shouldn'ta let her""
But I did Giz, and now I gotta get it off
I tried lotion but it just got soft
The hours went on, and on, and on
Man - I wish the hickey was gone
But it wasn't, and, my girl was comin over
I needed a plan, to try to get over
So I called King of Chill I said, ""What's up man?
Got a hickey on my neck, I need a plan""
He said, ""Yo Milk why don't you bust a turtleneck?""
I said that's wack but what, the heck
I ran to my room but I couldn't find one
Then like Star Trek, _The Search_ begun
I ran through my house from the bottom to the top
I got a bright idea, I'll ask pop
I ran to dad, I said, ""What's up D?
I need a turtleneck, to cover this hickey""
He said, ""Oh son that just won't work;
You'll feel real hot and you'll look like a jerk""
I said, ""Okay - then what's your advice?""
He said, ""Go into the freezer, and get a piece of ice""
I said a piece of ice, to put on my neck?
It sounds real cold but what, the heck
I went into the freezer, and did what he said
I hope it would 'ork, or else I'd be dead
I put the ice on and I waited, and waited
The hickey was gone - it faded, it faded
The time was then for my girl to appear
At the count of three, what did I hear?
One.. {*scratch*}.. two {*scratch*} three
It was the bell, as you can tell
As I opened the door, my eyes did swell
As I, saw somethin' I thought I never would see
My girl chillin' there with a great big hickey
I punched her in the mouth her lip I did wreck
That's how I felt so what, the heck?
What, the heck?

I Don’t Care,What More Can I Say?,1988,"(*sample of Milk saying ""I don't care"" repeats w/ variations*)

Yo, my name is Milk, when Milk is on the mic
I say all the rhymes you MC's hate
I really don't care what you think or say
I gotta bust a rhyme in my own special way
Giz is my brother, mom is my mother
Dee is my father, you say why bother?
Because they put me here on this earth
Lyte is on my side
 and she is worth
More to me than you, forget your crew
It doesn't matter what you say, or what you do
I'll keep on rockin, I roll too quick
All you groupies make me sick
The King is my boy cause he's down with us
First Priority's the label, that we trust
I really don't care if you're big and bad
I'm makin more money than you wish you had
Girls step up if they know what time it is
The left to Milk, the right to Giz
I never throw a mic cause I have respect
And when I come, I come correct
To my left to my right I have bodyguards
And in my wallet, credit cards
In my pockets, hundreds, and more
I give it to your mother, cause your mother's - a stunt
I really don't care if you're gettin mad
I call you son, son, you call me dad
I never take drugs, I like to drink
Milk, it helps me grow and think
Like a champ, suckers I vamp
Soggy MC's will always stay damp
In my presence, and in my residence
I keep keys to my car, I go real far
To pick up my money
I think it's dope, you think it's fun-ny
(*sample of Milk saying ""I don't care"" repeats w/ variations*)

But, you, never ever bothered a brother like me
I have too much personality
When I produce, you say it's def
I'll pan it right then I'll pan it left
If I want I keep it right in the middle
You look puzzled, it isn't a riddle
It's, a rhyme, one, of mine
One of a kind, girls say we're fine
What's on your mind, you said I'm through?
You must be stupid, the Audio Two
Is here to stay, every day
It doesn't matter what you think or what you say
We'll keep on rockin, keep on shockin
You'll keep lookin, starin, and mockin
Milk style, my brother
You're, a fighter, I'm, a lover
And when I'm at a jam I'm always undercover
Unless I get paid then I do, a show
When I'm finished, I always go
I got speakers, the size of your girl
Boomin the room an', shakin your world
Bigfoot feet are very big
If you're a sucker he'll help you dig
Your grave, or maybe he'll save your life
Mike shot the sherriff, I took your wife
Yeah you look mean but it don't mean nuttin
You got dissed with the push of a button
You paid your quarter but the game didn't start
It broke your money and it broke your heart
I stepped up and the game, begins
In this situation I surely win
I am the Milk like the milk you drink
I don't care what you say or what you think
I'll keep on movin, keep on slayin
Groovin MC's that think I'm playin
On, the mic, my style, you like
If you don't then leave..
And I'll end this jam with time to breathe, boy!

I Like Cherries,What More Can I Say?,1988,"Yo man, I love me some apples
Get out of here, pears are the move
Pears?  Peaches are the move
Peaches?  I like bananas (""Brooklyn style"")
Bananas??
*singing* I like cherries cause cherries taste better
And grapes are sour, AHH, I'll ask for more
AHH, I'll ask for more
I like cherries cause cherries taste better
And grapes are sour
*cutting and scratching* ""Bust a move""
Yo Milk... what kind of fruit, do you like?
I don't like bananas, I don't like peaches
I don't like fruit I bite and it screeches

If a lime's to a lemon and a lemon's to a lime
Why do cherries taste better, all the time?
I don't know about that but you just shouldn't miss
Just sit back relax and yo, bust this
A philosopher once said
That ""life is a bowl of cherries""
*singing* AHH, I'll ask for more
AHH, I'll ask for more

""Milk D, from the Audio Two""
""From the Audio Two""

""Go for yours"" (3X)
""Go for yours while I go for mine""
Yo Milk, what kind of pie do you like?
I don't like those that's old and stale
With burnt up crust and fruit that's pale

I like the girls that pass the test
And I like those girls that are so......",https://genius.com/Audio-two-i-like-cherries-lyrics

MC am I, and I are the same

When the 2 is On the Mic,What More Can I Say?,1988,"""To the beat y'all.."" (*repeat through song*)

When - Milk is on the mic you can say I'm milkin'
All the rhymes I write are made of silk and steel
Yes y'all, I know the deal
Right about now I'll tell you how I feel
When Milk is on the tables yes y'all I said it
I scratch like THIS! {*scratching*}
.. don't forget
When I'm in a room it's science I'm droppin'
Supportin K-Rock as he goes hoe hoppin'
Effect on the voice make the voice sound milky
.. the smooth rhymes made silky
I can rock a rhyme in two minutes or less
That's on a bad day, at my best
At any time I can change my style
That is because I'm versatile
Like Nike's on my feet, and..
Bobby's on the beat, yo..
Giz is at the board, hey..
Gary press record!..
My colors red and white..
I rock it day or night, y'know..
My dad's got my back..
Yo Giz this style is wack, so bust it
""To the beat y'all.."" (*repeats as Giz scratches*)

When Giz has got the mic you can say I'm juicin'
Other MC's as I start to get loose and rhyme
One time at the drop of a dime
Now I'ma clock the mic, now I'ma shock the mic
Now I'ma rock the mic while I go for mine
One day while I was walkin', girlies' out stalkin'
Brothers on the corner, sorta like hawkin'
My style for a while cause I'm very versatile
I can grab the mic and rock a four minute mile
Now as I kept steppin', brothers kept sleppin'
Or should I say sleepin', while I was just keepin'
The beat in my stride you know like a dance
Death defyin' rope, just to enhance my look
Like a book or a well written rap (""To the beat y'all"")
If I was (?) I'd be from the tap
Okay y'all, I'm almost there
Rockin' down the street with all the fresh gear
Yo Milk, grab this mic, cause I'm outta here

Yo Giz, where's your girl?  Go get her
Yo pull out the keys to your Jetta!
I'm MC Milk D, that's DJ Gizmo
We're the Audio Two
And we're in full-l-l-l-l-l-l effffect, boyyyyyyyys!

Giz Starts Buggin’,What More Can I Say?,1988,"I like the girls (4X)
I like the girls with the real long hair
But if it's medium or short, I really don't care
As long as it's clean, it makes Milk happy
Whether it's red white blue straight or nappy
Real white teeth are somethin else I like
If your teeth are yellow and I say hello it's just a Psyche
No I'm not conceited, I just know the time
If you say 'Rock Milk' and you stink, I won't rhyme
It's not personal, I just hate the smell
Everytime you come near me, I have to yell
Step to the left like Jeff my boy
And when you leave I jump for joy
I tell Giz, he tells a friend
But before I know it, you're back again
Starin in my face cause you took a bath
Then Giz starts buggin as I start to laugh
Sometimes when walkin, around the way
I quietly hear, suckers say
'Milk makes no money', what are you a imbecile?
I'm makin more money than your parents, ever will
No I'm not braggin, I'm tellin the truth
Simply buggin on the suckers, that have no couth
Standin on the corners, pullin out knots
Sayin I got more knots than you've got
People like you, I call em idiots
If you say you don't I'll call you a hypocrite
No need to pull out knots on my behalf
Cause Giz'll start buggin as I start to laugh
I took your girl cause your girl is fine
Once she was yours, now she is mine
As long as you know, it makes me proud
You thought you was chillin, movin in the crowd yes
People like you, make me strong
You tried to diss and miss now Milk is on the next song
Don't even try it, you know the deal
I am the Milk and, I am for real
So don't even look or you'll feel my wrath
And Giz'll start buggin as I start to laugh
I like people, who like Giz and I
That is the reason, I always try
To cool with the groupies, the troopheads, the troopies
Don't even try to buy Gucci's from Poochies
Cause if you do, it will be a mistake
I'm tired, it's time to break -- peace!",https://genius.com/Audio-two-giz-starts-buggin-lyrics

Then I crack a smile, then I change again
Now say, hypothetically, that I am medically
Insane, then why are you still my friend?

You said I'm weak and wack, is that a fact
Who's clockin ducats while you're partyin?
You said you don't care about the clothes you wear

But wait, who paid their money, to get in?
You say you need a savior, with a different flavor

You're in my way, so pardon me
I gotta step to the mic

Your rhymes are old, they're dusty
Point blank homeboy, you're rusty
And it's a serious matter
The mic's getting cold, you're getting fatter
But I'm slim and warm like Swiss Miss
I could rock to a hiss
Or gimme a beat and a metronome
I bust a rhyme off my dome
Why? I'm like the great Einstein
I have a complex mind

My style is not hardcore
It's milky, better yet milkish

That's why I roll with security

Took her to the farm and did much damage
The vitamin D help me manage
Yo, I'm your girl's Molester

That means you're brave and wack

Granted, you're living large

Make the mic, my homeboy
Like Captain Kirk and Mr. McCoy
But notice who's captain
I am captain, I am captain
I am


Alright, I'm almost through
You didn't wanna leave, but now you're due
Realize you're old news

I won't let you go
Now that’s what every guy should know
You’re my baby girl
And I will always show my love for you
I won't let you go
Verse 1: Bayan
The day I saw here I just went so high
Every second of the world just went so tight
Every time I look at her eyes
I see the sun just rise
I can’t express my love for her
But peace out bye
Every time I dream about her
My body goes on the sky
My feet on the ground
With the beat of the sound
My feelings for her goes 2 by 2
3 by 3 and its all for you
Love is like a flow under the shadow
It makes me think of everything on the rainbow
Got the same style to go an extra mile
Love doesn’t change
It just makes me go insane
You can have true love
That comes from above
To make you heart go apart
You’re the one I love
Keep dreaming big with the same old grid
I’ll show you path to the same old love
You’re my high school sweet girl
Who is in my hallway
Looking at you as if you are on display
Making the world go on his way
To take that feeling and multiply it by 2
Cause this is going to true
Go ahead dig deep pull it through
We’ll make it through
I won’t let you go
Until you recognize that my feelings are just for you

I won’t let you go

My forever love, the only one I need
You've shown me love and care
You are the life in me
So rare to find what we share
We're fruits now, yesterday we were seeds
Baby (baby) yeah listen
The number 1 spot is yours to keep
I will wait for you down the aisle
I'll wait for you to sleep
So I can watch you for a little while
Anything to see you first when I awake
I'll be your best definition of love
For your sake, for my sake
Let’s walk into the sunset of forever
The sight of you has got me meditating on three words
You're the reason ""I love you""
Finally means something
You will never feel that way they said
But the ring I gave you
Proves them wrong anyway
Baby you’re the one I wana marry
I know God sent you here for me
Being the bright star of my life
Yeah and the only queen of my heart
