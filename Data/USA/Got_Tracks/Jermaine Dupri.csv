Money Ain’t a Thang,Life in 1472,1998.0,"Uh-ugh-uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-ugh-uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
So So Def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screamin out, ""Money ain't a thang""
Bubble hard in the double R, flashing the rings
With the window cracked, holla back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam-gleam (Yeah, ugh)
And to hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thang (Ugh, ugh)
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing (Uh-huh)
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang (C'mon)

Y'all wanna floss with us (C'mon)
'Cause all across the board, we burn it up (Yeah)
Drop a little paper, baby, toss it up (Ugh, yeah)
Slacking on your pimpin' (Ugh), turn it up
See, the money ain't a thang

I... flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' ho
Jigga's style is love, X and O (Ugh)
Save all your accolades, just the dough (Ugh, right)
My game is wide, all lames aside
Trying to stay alive, hundred thou for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain your eye (Bling)
Twin platinum gun, son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders (Ugh), your money's too young
See me when it gets older, your bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh'd up
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up (Ugh)
Multi 'til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces (Yeah)
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Where you at, haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screamin out, ""Money ain't a thang""
Bubble hard in the double R, flashing the rings
With the window cracked, holla back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam-gleam (Yeah, ugh)
And to hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thang (Ugh, ugh)
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Y'all wanna floss with us (Yeah)
'Cause all across the board, we burn it up (Ha)
Drop a little paper, baby, toss it up
Slacking on your pimpin', turn it up (Yeah)
See, the money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eating crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves (Moves), do the big things (Things)
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit, man (Yeah)
Type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know
If she look, she go bye-bye with da-da
And I ain't gotta say no more
I'm The Truth like A.I. (Yeah), got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy—know why?
'Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing (Uh-huh)
I don't know about y'all, but every night, I swing (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switching four lanes

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Y'all wanna floss with us (Uh-huh)
'Cause all across the board, we burn it up (What)
Drop a little paper, baby, toss it up (Ugh, yeah)
Slacking on your pimpin' (Ugh), turn it up
See, the money ain't a thang

Y'all, shit ain't for real 'til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill (What)
Said she loved my necklace (Yeah), started relaxing
Now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction (Whoa)
Went from wholesome to ""Jigga, you awe-some"" (Ugh)
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey (Hahaha)
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice, yeah, yeah, let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Rollie with the ice bezel?
It's gon' take a lot more to see my level (Uh-huh)
Where I'm at—your check, you better double that (Double that)
And personally, your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain (Ugh)
In the platinum frame (Screaming) ""It's not a game!""
(Gleaming) From ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain (Even)
Me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R, flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holla back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam-gleam

Welcome to Atlanta,Instructions,2002.0,"Yeah
Welcome to Atlanta, jackin' hammers and vogues
Back to the mackin' and jackin the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
A knock on the do', who is it? I would happen to know
The one with the flow - who did it?, it was me I suppose
JD in the Rolls and Luda's in the Cut Supreme
Skatin down Old Nat, gat tucked and leaned
I split ya spleen, as a matter of fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneaks, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
I'm allergic so doc' prescribed antihistamines
Oink oink, pig pig, do away with the pork
Only silverware I needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, I'm Bruce with Banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when I shoot the cannon
The wooly mammoth sabretooth, bitch bite your tongue
I won't stop until I'm rich as them whites'll come
I pulled up in the black Lotus, your plaques are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waitin for my cue to corner pocket eight balls, you rackin 'em up
I'm big paper like pancakes, stackin 'em up
In fact I'm slappin 'em up, Cadallac'n the truck
I can't loose with twenty-two, bitch that's what's up
Runnin in the back to fuck, better tha-than the aquaduct
Chil-li-li-li-li-n.. fli-pi-pi-pi-pi-n, what?

Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo

Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin

Yo, uhh
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
And I usually don't leave until the thang ends
But in the meantime, in between time
You work yo' thing, I'll work mine
I been puttin it down here since eighty-three
Since the Lakeshore/MD rivalry
When Frozen Paradise was the place to be
If you was ridin, you was bumping to homie Shy-D
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
Make my own rules, bitch call me the mayor
Monday night, Gentlemen's Club
Tuesday night, I'm up in the Velvet Room, gettin fucked up
Wednesday, I'm at Strokers on lean
Thursday, Jump Clean, then I fall up in Kream
Friday, Shark Bar, Kaya with Frank Ski
Right on the flo' is where you can find me
Saturday, is off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One-Tweezy
Sunday, is when I get my sleep in
Cause on Monday we be at it again, holla!

You gon need a thug in your life

You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
Somebody that’ll pull up
Somebody that’ll pull up and beat it down

First off, he weak
Yeah
Cut him off, fuck with me
Good weed, long beach
Girl you can get it wherever whenever
Just tell me you need that, I pull up
You need some love, love some
Stay with him, or leave with me
I see you caught up in something that you don’t really want to be in

You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
Somebody that’ll pull up
Somebody that’ll pull up and beat it down

You say immature, but this the cure
On top of all that, she the sexiest one
Every time I see you out, you ain’t looking at me
Your eyes tell me that you wish it was good
You say you want it, he can’t afford it
He working on it, what the fuck do that mean?
Anyway, at the end of the day
You just caught up in something that you don’t really want to be in

Cause a nigga that do it ain’t able
Do it like this shawty
Go

You know goddamn well that nigga you with ain’t shit
I didn’t mean to flex on him, but he ain’t got it like this
I know she want to ride in my foreign whips
When we fly out to Japan, your mom can’t go this year

Your nigga not loving you right, you know that ain’t right
That’s why you crying at night
I could change your life (put you on ice)
Nice Bugatti do something I like
Can’t make you my wife
Cause I heard you be stripping at night
And that ain’t my type
You want to thug, I’ll show you some love
I want you to take them trips to meet the plug

Your nigga retire, your bitches got hired
I'm living my life like The Wire
She looking at me, she admire
The pussy singing like American Idol
My diamond pissing, Imma need me a diaper
She love when I pick her up in a new Spyder
She won’t get a wedding ring, treat her to better things
Alexander McQueen

Big game D - ballin with the 21st street
Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don Chi Chi (That's me)
Still makin tight-ass beats
I'm rollin in my brome, I stay sweet
Ain't nobody ballin like me

It goes, mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the biggest baller of all
I got a 700, a Bentley, and a Magine
The girls just DIE when I'm ridin past
Live life like I'm sellin pies
Ah-rabian, with two or three wives
Two or three houses to hide
Ten cars that's parked outside
And they all got bodies that's wide, follow me
As the Leer jet flies, over Crimson Tides
Four bedroom duplex in the sky
Nicknamed Lottery, cuz I don't stop spendin
When the wheels stop, the chrome keep spinnin
Like the six moon-walkin, shit I ain't talkin
I'm straight livin it, it's a wonder I ain't shiverin
I'm so frozen and you've been chosen
To roll with me and Nate D-O double G, sing

It's five o'clock in the mo'nin
I've already downed five, I've already downed five Mo's
See ya around my block on the weekend
All we do is chase bad, all we do is chase bad hoes
Pass me the weed if it's chronic
If not then I just say no, then I just say no
Three girls a date, that's my limit
We ballin outta control, we ballin outta control-ol

Now whether you like me or not, whenever I drop
You know I give you number one hits platinum hot
It's so much clarity in my rocks, I'm thinkin like
It's gotta be somebody greater, maybe it's not
Cuz I flow for those, that get that dough
Hits for every chick with a size C tits
See it's like this, I don't mind wavin at you kids
But I can't manage to raise my wrist
Jewels so heavy, y'all fools ain't ready
My twenty-two shot the streets into confetti
Move like Andretti, redlinin
Whatever city I'm in, headlinin
At five a.m. I'm still lookin for mo'
Still gettin crunk, still lettin it flow
Bar outta Cris' now I'm drinkin Mo'
Stomach upset, I feel like I'm about to let it go

It's five o'clock in the mo'nin
Got my pedal to the flo', got my pedal to the flo'
It's time I test my 600
Wonder how fast this bitch go, wonder how fast this bitch go
Three girls and two of 'em sleepin
One got her hands on my balls, one got her hands on my balls
Sun's comin up, we still drinkin
We ballin outta control, really ballin outta control-ol

Dance, everybody
And everbody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
Everybody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
And everybody just clap ya hands

When your girl don't call you when you beep her
And you hit it and her thing feel deeper, say my name
Pull on her hair, spankin' her rear

Going Home With Me,Life in 1472,1998.0,"I'm feelin' that(2x), is you wit' me?
I'm the type you see at the bar, fresh, buyin' it up
And every girl I talk to, yeah I'm tryin' to cut
I tell'em all I'm Chi Chi and it's nice to meet ya
Real quick, I tell how she got all the right features
The jams come on and the glasses get refilled
We dance and watch the relations build
Now I'm all up in her ear and she listenin'
At the same time, watchin' how a nigga glistenin'
BLING! BLING! I'm thinkin' it's bout time to go
Get the B out of valet and start the late night show
Niggas hate, I know but I don't stop I shine
I'm in the club every week, same place, same time
Same thing on the mind, PARTY! PARTY!
So the hell with all that, we tryin' to find somebody
The right kind 'fore the lights come off
Shit, I'm tryin' to take sumpin' home

Now if I buy you a drink and you drink it up
Then, uh, you goin' home with me (and all my niggas say)
And if you talkin' at a party and we talk too much
Then, uh, we goin' home with me
Now if you came with a friend that don't wanna do my man
Then you need to give her your keys
Tell her to call you tomorrow or give you a beep
Cause tonight, you going home with me, ya heard?

Now, is it because my name's Jermaine? no
It's all about how I kick my game, you know?
I just flow with it, spend a little dough with it
Entertain, before you know, I'm in your brain doing my thang
Tellin' you how good you smell
Send you up for a drop top cruise through the A-T-L
Now when they tipsy, it's risky, you don't know what you facin'
Fuck around and end up like Anthony Mason
So I let'em know a few things before we leave
Like, ""it's true, I tapes damn near everything""
So don't even think about lyin', baby
Or try baby, to set me up for rape cause it's all on tape
Where you said put the cake
How you fed me the grapes
What I did with the ice that made you shake, shake
Now when the night's over and the girl is gone
I'm back up in the club singin' the same damn song

Now, walk in, I'm the grown man that you figure to trick
But I'm feelin' your dress, girl and lovin' your hips
But I'm buggin' off this, ""Why you stuck on the wrist?""
Golddigger, huh, mommy? Oh, you ain't that bitch?
Ain't that some shit? Suddenly, you hugs and kisses
Gotta be the dough you holdin' so obvious wit' it
I get G's to flash, T.V.'s in the dash
See Sinbad, watchin' Vibe, ladies clockin' to ride
Luxury flows, lengerie hoes, R.O.C. hit'em mo' than Jose Conseco
Uh, RBI's, orange top fly, the brown skin, slim
The nice braids, brown eyes
R.O.C.'s stay pimpin' from Jersey to Richmond
Y'all playas waitin' to ball like 6th men

Little fast bitch, actin' sarcastic
Need to get her ass kicked, tryin' to get the cash quick
She be my last pick, I got a real hoe
Take yo' ass back to class and buy a dildo
Don't let the freak in you  keep you up all night
Gettin' fucked and sucked, you wastin' your life
Before a real nigga ever kick a hoe down
She gotta understand what I know now
Ain't no broke down, lazy, gold digging, cute bitch
Come around me gettin' credit cards and don't do shit, bitch
I travel throughout the year
I keep a woman with a house and her own career
So when I buy her a diamond ring, it's just a gift (what's your name?)
Too Short baby, don't need to trick
I give her what she want cause I'm a real player
Platinum after platinum, ask me how I feel later


See I ilke them crazy hoe
Them straight, get down and pay me hoe
I wouldn't mind no jazzy hoe
Make my creep fall right out my clothes
On the blow, can't let no hoe see my flow
Tight jean and bra strap, girl that got to go (gotta go)
Strip you on down like a shake-a-booty hoe (uh huh)
Put you in the street, make me mo' money mo'

Now see, just the other night, I met me a ol' jazzy hoe
Straight boozyabitch, ol' sassy hoe
Who think she fly to death, so I ain't gon' hold my breath
To let you skeezers know, just let you ask yo'self
For as I cut one but two down the line
But could it be yo' hoe that I'm cuttin' everytime?
And I come to find she servin' every nigga in yo' clique
To get in where she fit in, now she known to be a trick

Quote for quote, who tote like this
Hit the Club Jig, on some Wes Snipe shit
Snatchin' all the hoes in your harem, indeed
I mock turtlenecks while I'm bees and tweed
Til I proceed, damn right, the spot's tight
Nothing but dimes in sight, so just might
Bag these bitches like groceries
Player to player, you can't get close to me
Now who you 'posed to be?
Pullin' toast on the  S-O double N-Y, girlfriend lookin' fly
And I can tell she schemin' (why's that?)
Cause she like the ice is gleamin' (okay)
But that's cool though, cause I know how to stain golds
I pimp tight without the kangol, niggas know
I slang flow, east to west
Available at anytime to put the pussy to the test


Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
When the real motherfuckin' player come around
Shy, not I, some times I choose not to speak
Surrounded by my real niggas drinkin' Hennessee
Or Remy or Red Passion with champagne
Chiefin' up some hay, gettin' at them hoes, man
Trick, not I, trick be you, can you dig that?
I got star hoes pickin' me up in Tahoes
Fuck them at-the-bar hoes, tryin'-to-score hoes
Mickey dropin' hoes, quick to drop they clothes
I give those only funky weave wearin' bitches
All made up, gettin' at a  niggas riches
I like women with they head on straight
Pull your own weight and you can fuck wit' Eight
Nigga think he a player with them old Girbauds
Gettin' pimped by them space age jazzy hoes",https://genius.com/Jermaine-dupri-jazzy-hoes-lyrics

Ladies and gents, let the teacher start
I am the greatest rapper, walk, talk, eat, shit, fart
You motherfuckers can't see me
Even with a patch on my eye, I'm dreamy
All in the grill of the gruesome
1, 2, 3, 7 diamonds on the twosome
Schedule, I aim to be in Atlanta with the legendary Jermaine Dupri

Uh huh, I'm more delicious than shit outta cook books
See I'll even make Salvation Army clothes look good (you know)
That divine, so fine, don't even wear the same underwear 2 times

JD, not the one to fuck around with
Heard ya got the whole entire state locked down, kid

That's right so don't ask us who the best
From the north to the south to the east to the west
We're...

Fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Still worn the Bally shoes and the fly green socks
We're fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Still worn the Bally sodadadadada socks

Come on, kids, Jermaine Dupri a wiz
Walkin' down the street, you kow mindin' my own biz
My man girlfriend started actin' like she hoein'
""Hey JD, where your fine ass going?""
To the studio, I told her frontin'
Unless you wanna take it in the cooler or sumpin'
 For real and that shit ain't a fact?

She said that she would meet me at my house around 10
Not to mention, a nice tender body
10 o'clock, here came the red beau hotty
My man girl told totally deceptive
Still I try to fuck the full out the bitch rectum 
See, the woman so shady
Talkin' bout actin' like she upped and offed JD
Now she wanna kiss and caress cause i left a couple of bite marks on the hun's
Breasts I'm...


When the doubt falls, my door they knock up on
Designers even ask me what they need to stock up on
Why the fuck did ya like to done pest us
When the tag team ya hearin' is untouchable, peasant?
Slick, Jermaine Dupri back as the fat trackers
We'll diarrhea up on your black ass
Babies jump out the carriage
Could even fix the Hillary and Clinton marriage
Charisma now felt
To the point where even I could make even lesbians melt
Models bookin' at me
Could even make her grandmother catch an orgasm lookin' at me (you know)
It's kinda outlandish, rastas even say
""What kind fine young man dis""
So don't put me to the test

Intro - Turn it Out,Life in 1472,1998.0,"Uh, spit at the world
My lyrics, I could spit at your girl
Spit when I hurl, spit on the Dutch and finish the twirl
Spit facts, spit on wax my whole lifetime
Spit on my watch, make the ice shine
Spit trife lines, .44 spit slugs out
Ready to thug out at the clubhouse
Chickens who lickin' or spit a nut out
My name within itself is a language that bring you wealth
Careful, comin' at me's like hangin' yourself, at a.....
I know you thought I'd be locked up
Dead by now, shot up, full of lead by now
Got up with JD though, crazy dough
Queens with the So So Def, A-T-L's best (yeah I know)
Every ride up the 9-5, fly friendly skies
Thug passion for J Doves, Henny's for Nas
Then we mix that shit, tip that shit
Pass it around, hood to hood, everybody get with it

Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause Queensbridge is in the house
This is Nas Escobar and I turns it out
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause College Park is in the house
They call me Don Chi Chi and I turns it out

I'm sumpin' y'all dread like locks, get bread by the flocks
Bitches love me and I'm duggy from the head to the socks
Too much to handle, here the man of the year
Hit rooms and light 'em up like a chandelier
From C-P to the Bridge, y'all know what it is
Been gettin' money like this since I was a kid
I'm in the corner with bitches and buckets of Cris
Pourin' at the most goin'est nigga wit' shit that showin' it
Now look at my ice, look at your ice, DAMN!
Look at my life, look at your life, DAMN!
See, I got niggas wantin' to drop me, top me, stop me
Copy Chi to the T 'cause I'm nice in the 3 black same color AMG's
TV's, front and back pack with nuttin' but ladies
You can look up or down, right or left
But all you gon' hear and see is So So Def

Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause College Park is in the house
They call me Don Chi Chi and I turns it out
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause Queensbridge is in the house
This is Nas Escobar and I turns it out

Touch the whole global with cold vocals and dark words
Vocal cords translate what my drunk heart slurs
Chest clogged up with sparked up herb, I feel faint
Tryin' to hold myself together, coulda spilt my own drink
All I hear is beats bumpin', I'm seein' in doubles
Last thing I need to happen is to be in a scuffle
Where my dogs at? These ain't my niggas Allah
Help the guard, forgot my niggas took some girls to the car
Tryin' to make it through the crowd, which way is out?
Which way is around? These grimy motherfuckers pointin' me out
I wish I had the drink
But then I'm too intoxicated to aim and put the clip in
It's like the floor's wet and every step is like I'm slippin'
And yo, I can't lose a step, I feel my enemies followin'
All I got as a weapon is this Hennessy bottle
I'm talkin' to myself, my peoples should be stickin' with me
Somebody grabbed me up, ""Yo Nas, come take this picture with me""
My ice strillon, I'm feelin' my arm
Thought my Rollie was gone, now I wanna swing but I'm calm
Still got that, DJ musta threw on another hot track
Think it was this one here, bounce to that
Too much Thug Passion and smokin'
Made it outside, mouth wide, vomittin', gaggin' and chokin'
From behind, niggas plottin' and scopin'
Everything was blurry at first, but now shit is movin' in slow motion
I saw my niggas pull up, Pirelli's they skidded
They open the car door and toss-ed me in it
Cats tried to rob me, the crowd was rowdy
But one thing's for sure, So So Def know how to party

All night long {?'til when?}?
Til the early morn (it don't stop)
And uh (it don't quit)
And uh (So So Def with the dope shit, bitch!)",https://genius.com/Jermaine-dupri-intro-turn-it-out-lyrics
Let’s Talk About It,Instructions,2001.0,"I'm gettin' in the groove now, so I'm like, givin it my own shit now
Alright, Could the drummer have some, y'all?
Could the drummer have some more?
Said the drummer ain't had none, in a long time
Come on, drummer!
*Beat Drops*

Uh huh, oh
Damn baby, shit
How you get all that in them jeans?
Nevermind that, you hear this?
Its that Star Trak
Clipse, (get down!) So So Def

Question, ask any nigga
Rap or a hustler, who rocks is bigger? (The rapper!)
Naw, dog, go figure, with the V12, I make that straight killa
I flood the block, I hug the Glock
I have a whole neighborhood that seen a thug to stop (Stop!)
Cause I show 'em what Waco see, then hit the district then visit to Jac-o-b
I like my diamonds colored, watch it smothered (me too)
Show off at the place of jewels, let the white man love it (hahaha)
I'm too much, got bitches out for me
Bring 'em home, give 'em they choice of balcony
She said ""We can have more fun"", I said ""How can we?""
Then she brought her girl in and ate her out for me, wow (Wow!)
All night sexin', just think, this all came from one question

You got a big ass bell? Lemme see you jingle it baby
You got a big ass bell? Lemme see you jingle it baby
Wanna talk about cars? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about houses? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about jeweles? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about money? Then talk without it
Wanna talk about chicks? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about hits? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about cris? Lets talk about it
But when you talk about cash, talk without it
 (First two lines overlap the last two lines of the chorus)
Uh huh, oh
Yo, yo
Now as the game rotates, and my chrome gets bigger
More and more girls wanna fuck this nigga
Its hard for a chick not to stick around
When I come through town, layin my dick down
They can tell a true playa by the clothes that I wear
Game that I spit, and the length of my hair
The more I come, the more I cum, get it?
What you see now, I been done did it
Every girl around, I been done hit it
Cars been kited, since I was sixteen
And yes, I'm still spendin' that Kris Kross creme
Big boy moves, big boy shine, big boy watch tell big boy time (look out)
Everybody know I got the recipe, so you know ya'll niggas can't can't with me
Matter of fact, I don't even gotta say no more, OH


Na na, (Oh) na na na na na na (Come on girl)
Na na na na na na (Oh) Na na na na na na na (Come on girl)
Na na na na na na (oh) Na na na na na na (Come on girl)
Na na na na na na (oh, I want you to move your waist for the whistle)
Na na na na na na (Come on girl)

It ain't too many things that exceed my reach
Speedboat, glass floor, let you see underneath
But nevermind that though, I'm just showing off
As I do in the Porshe show with the top lost
I ain't change the game hash, you know the name as
Malice in my wrist, like shattered stain glass
I generate them Franklin's and Grant's
Each ear look like a halogen lamp
I'm high beamin, at the same time leanin'
In the butter soft seat that keep a street thug scheming'
'for we compare paper, get your weight up
I need more points than that, don't you play with me, Jacob
You see me on my back, you see me live
I'm every color of the spectrum, like ROY-G-BIV
Look dog, get a load of how daddy ball
Wanna talk about cash? Well I done said it all

Ain't no tellin' in this life of sin
How much dough you got to spend
Take so long you got to bend
Grab yo' man snatch yo' bitch

Makin' ya' dance every chance I get
And hata's sayin' damn, will he ever catch bricks?
Nah, I don't catch those, keep it ghetto
Stayin' wit' the best hoes, on the east and the west coast

In the midst of the party they bump hits by JD
The B.R.A.T., we the element
And you irrelevant
Get down off this shit

I don't pay attention to ya' hatin' and ya' bad looks
Just think about gettin' paper like Garth Brooks
Keep it off the hook
Let the world feel the touch
Ya'll doing too much, sayin' ya oughta see us

In the six, pretty bitches with the long hair

To the ??? to mother, tell me who the thuggest in this motherfucker

That's how we play, stil thuggin' ain't a thing change
Still the same name, love the face
Real, real niggas, that's all I gotta say
You fuckin' with the real, you ball to get gusted
Really, the real ain't shit to be fucked wit'
Protected by the niner, when you careful
The nigga the trigger finger itchy fixin' to make you duck the whloe flock
Make a nigga close shop, sho nuff
Showstopper, fuckin' 'em up with diesel
What's pumpin' the shotgun?
Real neccesary cause all we want is a little respect
That's all we want but nigga, you don't feel me
Krazyie crazy, maybe insane hangin' with JD
Little rip done slip the clip into the gat, rat-tat-tat
Just like that

I ain't fixin' to be the bitch to procastinatin'
Niggas wanna be shippin' me half a cake
Go through whatever drastic measures I hafta take
Make a motherfucker masterbate, the hotter I get the more hate
Some of you hoes is overrated with flows
The salvate'll take'em to the rehab and get'em re-instated
My lyrical content send other bitches to convents
Pray for me to be deleted but that's nonsense
Been the bomb since '74 Aries
I can see how ya nigga be lookin' at me
He want to get in between the sheets
Leave the wallet and the keys for me
I ain't persuaded easily but if he spend the cheese for me
Nigga, we can fuck free frequently
You study me, but another me could never be sold
Broke the most 6-0-6-4-4
When niggas'll haul off and hit ya with the sawed off
Seen plenty motherfuckers fall off with they jaws off
When I'm finished droppin' 'em al off on the west side of Chi, I'm ridin' high
Thinkin' of way to make it through the major of the paper chase
Slidin' by, keep a luger in the chamber ready for danger when it's time to die

See everywhere I go, I feel like niggas be tryin' to get me stuffed
I'm flyin' on out of what? Iced up and all the hoes wanna fuck
Knockin' bitches and that nigga got cake stacked up, packed up
Everything I touch, gold and platinum, what?
Niggas can't fuck with us
Like Busta Bust, we dangerous
And you know that if I peel I got mo'
Y'all peel, it's gone, that's why the ice grill on
When the wheel on by y'all niggas in the corner
Back and forth, like ""fuck that little guy""
Don't worry bout me, you need to worry bout yo' goddamn self
How you shit on shelf and how you sit around
Wishin' that a nigga would sign to So So Def
I'm a A-T-L-A-N-T-Alien
Never been known to play with
Can't none of y'all see me, so y'all niggas don't really need to say shit

An' all my playas world wide it's just you and I
Getcha paper, getcha dough, getcha shit right

First off, y'all niggas know I don't slouch
An' as a kid I done did the shit you talkin about
I'm from the South, ya heard?
Where niggas fly birds outta Impalas
Live lavish
From ATL to Dallas an' the little palace
Goin once, goin twice, everyday, livin nice
In the grey wit the ice, makin money rollin dice
Livin the life, that y'all dream of
Puttin niggas outta business like Sony did to Zenith
You seen us, the green stuff
An nuttin' else that's all I collect
I got the hots like the Lox - Money, Power and Respect
An' I can damn the check that any of y'all niggas spit
I stay hittin, I ain't bullshittin (he ain't bullshittin)
Nigga, wit more glitta, than M.J
It's all pimp play, when it comes to me
An' y'all motherfuckers know how J.D. gets down
An' those who don't it's a new sheriff in town
Feel me now

Yo, let me tell you were I'm mad y'all
Shits kinda sad y'all
If you ride the buses or trains
Watch ya back ya'll
Hooptie keep stallin
I still ain't ballin
I got wild bills
An' the chronic keeps callin
My dogs wanna hang (bark)
My bitches wanna bang
But it don't mean a thang
When all you got is change
That's why my women ain't dimes
Not even close to nines
Sorta like fives and sixes
Wit scars and stiches
Type of bitches that spit in yo' face like Alomar
Broke hoes without a car
Snatchin' fruit from salad bars
Which one of ya'll come on, test me now
Me not goin' nowhere, you don't impress me now
So next time you see me up in them clubs
I'm probably schemin'
While you at the bar
Brick hard and fiendin'
I wait for 4 o'clock when yo' drunk ass is leavin'
Cause I paid to get in
And now I gotta break even
Chorus x2

Niggas goin' to parties
Thousand dollar shoes and jewels
You Begets what I be wantin' so I be bringin' the tool
Tryin' to snatch up all that ice that you came in
An' nigga D be flippin', yeah, money, it's the same shit
What you thought
Cause you bought
A joint
You might be able to creep a nigga
When he ain't on point
An' I can see it in yo' eyes that you comin' closer than tryin'
An' every step you take brings yo' ass closer to dyin'
An' I don't flow wit the dough
Cause money comes and goes

Y'all got hate in your blood
(This is fucked up)
Y'all got hate in your blood
(This is fucked up man)
Y'all got hate in your blood

Listen
I know y'all niggas want me
I hear y'all niggas plottin'
I see y'all niggas lookin'
But I ain't stoppin', I'm gone, in something fast
Through the city with no top
That reach 220 on the dash, I'm so hot
In everybody's hood with other niggas' hoes
I'm throwin' paper at them bitches
Screamin' So So
Now every spot I hit
I'm hearing different shit
About homies that want me that weren't with me when I started this
It's fucked up but I
But I can't let these niggas blurry my vision
On where I'm going and how I'm living, ya know?
I got a daughter now, young age three
If her daddy don't shine, then my shorty won't eat
Feel me?
Do I floss? YES!
Sometimes I hit the block so damn hard I start hatin' my self
It's bad, I feel your pain dawg
But the only thing I'm about to change is the game motherfucker!

Sick of seeing Bentley's
And hearing niggas talk about sittin' on dubs

Papi had raw, then I bought him out
You know me, fuck niggas
Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out
Rapid fire got my hands shakin'
And everybody hate dyin'
But most niggas die hatin'
While y'all run to the bank
I run to the brink
A real thug keep the Tommy gun under the mink
I got a glass kitchen
You can see what's under my sink
And I do shit just to do it
Too much money to think
So you can hate all you want
I'mma still be 'Kiss
Dirty, a lot of paper, filthy rich
JD's the architect, he built these hits
Ruff Ryder's, So So Def, feel this shit
And you can tell any one of your boys
You might find 'em in a hood near you and any one of his toys
Cause I know you got hate in your blood
Still dump eight in your mug
So cock sucker take it and love, uh
Repeat 1

Somebody tell me why man
Somebody tell me why
Do niggas just hate, hate, hate the way they do man
Let me explain something to y'all about me man
Why y'all think I was the first rap nigga on Mtv Cribs?
Cause I'm a young, fly, flashy motherfucker
Y'all think I'mma stop, FUCK NAW
I'mma keep ridin' down the block with my hat bent
In the black bent, with them dubs on that shit
We gon' still be in the club poppin' Cristal
Pourin' Belvidere on bitches
We don't GIVE A FUCK MAN
A matter of fact I wish I could smack the shit
Out of one y'all niggas right now with some money
But you know what I'm saying
Cause y'all niggas just hate, hate, hate

I don't even know what that is
Had a Leroy Glow as a kid, had D boy dough as a kid
I mean, I don't even
Know how that go, the 606-44
If you raise me, and I'm out sign out
Baby so pay me
Now what this is, is that Snoop and Dre, mixed with UGK
When the two of us get together, there's no more playin', GA
We got that Game, that 50, we got that ash for that siftin'
Nigga we solid as a rock
And ain't no nigga that can fuck with me

I say
Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
Uh, I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine

In this midst of any drama
I ain't the type of chick that'll leave my brother
I don't run for no cover
I'm a head on collision type bitch, motherfuckers
Shitty, pretty, built that way
My attitude rude, stay the fuck up out of my face
Well I'm known to be a master, everything I kill
No respect around this bitch in 16, you near
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
And I don't think nobody can fuck with me
That's word is bond

You must be out yo mind
Thinkin' we ain't go make no more records
Thinkin' we go'n sit back and be quiet and not give em what they been requestin'
You must be out yo mind
I gets my bread, and I gets any nigga I want
I gets my head, I'ma be So So Def till I'm dead
Me too, me too, I gets my bread
And I can get any bitch I want, I'm hotter than Ferrari Red
It's me in the party with that 42, straight to the head
Ain't no plan, ain't no actin'
What I'm sayin', fully backin'
Please believe me when I say it

Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine

Do it again",https://genius.com/Jermaine-dupri-big-brother-x-lil-sister-lyrics

What cha wanna do (2x)
We the Legion of Doom

Warren G:
1472 is the same cut throat and locs
And plenty dopes can you cope?
You can call me Count Chocula
I control all the bitches, Chi-Chi control the riches
And Fly serve the snitches

Look up in the sky it's the Fly
My herion whip, clip on hip, now trip on this
A bunch of outlaws try to take my town
Set up shop, run me out, and cut me down
And how that sound?
When I'm the illest superhero
Born and raised on that muthafucking underground
Brrrrbrrrrbrrrr stick 'em, ha haha stick 'em
Try to catch me slipping but now you 'bout to be my victim
I'm not Aquaman 
but I aqua-boogie
I'm sorta like a 
monster, chasin' cookies
And I spin a web any size you can call me to fly
I walk walls and this is for all my dogs
(WOOF!)
I'm like the wonder twins, my style activates
The many niggas get in it and try to paper hate
It's fly, the rider man the rider man
I do it like a muthafucking rider and
I represent all the time and
I represent the mad ass fuckin' eastside
(eastside) -look out, look out, come out
Cause here comes the rider man
(rider man), nigga

I rock the blue cake on 'em, drop the weight on 'em
The more they hate, the more I elevate on 'em
I swerve and collect, serve and protect
Never hit the streets without the ice on my neck
I'm all about partying, hoes, and getting paper
They call me Chi-Chi, I do it up cape crusader
Contact through the frame no mistakes
To bank rules back in town and it's on us to shut 'em down
Now Fly what cha wanna do?

Nigga what?
Let's put this shit down my lil' homey Mr. Turner with the burner
He got my back you know he put me up on game
When they get up, they getting lit up, he tear shit up
Enough said, don't tell it, just sell it
We blowin' in the wind and we gonna ride til' we win
Young soldier stay into it we put the Folger
It's your turn, gon' get on up and get the 'Lac
And don't forget to grab your strap

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, no it ain't
It's the Legion of Doom and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep it safe and sound, get it locked down
And you don't have to worry when we in your town
(2x)

Just a young muthafucker from the street
Forced to be a G-angsta, knock-knock with  a Glock, pump-pump answer
Throw your hands up nigga, yeah death's a callin
Went from petty theft bank robber straight to ballin'
Stomp with us, walk with us as we bust through
The doors, .44's like parts in us
Often us, street heroes got many hoes and
Plenty dope plus we fly as fuck
Duct tape wire him up, toe tag 'em
Have him feel the strength of a black magnum
Body bag him, nobody is as bad as them
It's on, eff them, set Kissed like FM
Life in 1-4-7 to the deuce, right then
I slipped in the bullet-proof suit
And swoop down on the bank ruler with the gats
Waiting for the permission to cancel his ass
Handle his ass
I love to see his guts and his blood spill
And crack the fuck up
As I rise flying up high with a .45
Infared beaming on him from the sky
Drop and I put the barrel right between his eyes
Said, ""You fuck with the Legion and now you must die.""
We serve and protect all the hustlers and G's
From the west to the north, south and back to the east

Look up in the sky (in the sky)
No it ain't (no it ain't, no it ain't)
Mean a damn thing changed (changed, changed, changed)
Got it locked down (locked down, locked down)
When we in your town (in your town)
Look up in the sky (in the sky)
No it ain't (no it ain't, no it ain't)
Mean a damn thing changed (changed, changed, changed)

I got my nigga Black for me, uh
I got my nigga R.O.C. for me, uh
And y'all know who the fuck I be
And for a long time I think niggas been taking So So Def for a joke
But I guess that's why we rich and y'all niggas is broke

Y'all got one chance to flow I let y'all know
While y'all stretch your mouth I stretch my dough
Also stretch the doors on my Navigators
Long as the Olajuwon
Rock mine a Phenomenon Mr. Smith style
You wanna get uh, oh here he is now
Dot to the O caughted blow your shit down
Dot to the C you're feelin' me now?
Anyhow y'all niggas can't measure up
I'm here to get my cheddar and who ever mess it up?
Then I'mma blow these rounds out, wet 'em up
For my dawgs like DMX who pound like Kurupt
And Snoopy in the club getting at the groupies
Stash the uzi tonight flash the jewelry
And just post up we can't be touched
All my niggas say, ""WHAT WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK""! (UH)
B-boy style hot like tical
Four, five cal, check into the profile of a killa
Sonny Black my mellow, my ace playa get on the

Three times a niggas like T.O.N.Y
All up in your spot like Navy Seals, wave your steel
Lay your shit down, clown I'm for real
Spittin' Crips for chips, plant bombs in your whip
I bring the pain to the game on the real tip what?
Hittin' niggas like JFK
For the pounds and the bricks and yay, hear what I say?
Squeezing off, just to mash and releasing off
Y'all motherfuckers shouldn't be so soft
Oh you type thug niggas
Frump niggas, yo I got no love niggas
Expect the worse yo check it can make you see the hearse
Tell mama I'm about to break the button for the nurse
Niggas don't want it but they think they do
And soldiers should never fuck with me and my crew, who?
1 - 
You know I'm gonna make them dance when I step in the club

Well I know another way to make 'em put their hands up

I drop the beat on
I cock the heat on
I got this party niggas
We lock the street corners
Repeat 1

Well it's him again, the Timbaland lacer
You trembling in the faces, Detroit hates us
Take us, come smooth the hard shit, rock jewelry
Like Mr. Antarctic
Watch our hands move regardless of the chartless
Cock your automatic
So the safest thing for you to do is shut the fuck up
Let my crew do this (UH) like this niggas from the bricks and (UH)

Now we make murder cases out of sleepers

O to the D to the E F-uck you 'cause we buck you
Y'all niggas can't touch us

Assume my position 'cause papermaking's a must
Straight mangle motherfuckers when it's time to bust
Lace flows with angel dust all up in your spot
We got no things with us, kind of dangerous
Don't fuck around and get caught in a verbal onslaught
'Cause I'm label your bills and my man Too $hort , ooh Lord
Getting down one more time
For making motherfuckers who be out on the run
I gotta get mine daily can't let these motherfuckers fade me
That's just the way my mama made me
Top size rider from the get go, known to spit flows
And keep them niggas on their tiptoes
I goes to the extremity blind with weed and hennesy
I know you niggas don't remember me
Got the flow poetic, and I stay diamond setted
Running over tracks like I'm Libyan, here's the past
Labeled a pussy, cash see her bounce
Shaking, moving, waiting, sipping the ounce
What's up with that? None of y'all niggas can fuck with Black
Motherfucker where's your focus at?
JD my mellow my ace get on the mic and come rock please

Nigga I feel like why you gon come if ain't on time
And ain't no need in coming out if you ain't gonna shine
That's why I am why I am with mine and y'all sick
While y'all keep it real we keep it rich
Just clowning, pounding, riding around in
Some of the most elite shit to ever hit the town
Screaming out how you like me now and I'm gettin busier
I stay platinum while y'all get dizzier
The difference between y'all is I get 'em out of their seats

New company, my shit looked great
But uh, me being the player that I am I couldn't stop
I just had to find me something else to take to the top
Something fly that'll catch your eye
Thats when I bumped into my little sister from the West side of Chi
Demo after demo we made
Got so funkdafied now we paid
Rap or R&B we ain't playing
We demand y'all respect this afroman

And me and my crew get stronger
The more you wanna

In every flight there's turbulance and I had some
But I remained focused and kept dropping the bomb
'What should I do next?' that was going through my head
Then Candy introduced me to a Jagged Edge
Three homies from the Dec, one from right around the corner
We went in, came out, now everybody on 'em
Three albums later, everyboby on 'em
Ain't a city you can go where the girls don't want 'em
Once again I was thinking 'whats next for me?'
Then I got a big call from my homie Steve
He said Hey, let throw something your way
It was none other than my brother they comparing to MJ
Girls can't stop screaming, three mill now
Everybody love him and his name is Bow Wow

And me and my crew get stronger

Puttin' the dick up in ya dame
Every time make her say my name
91 I been grippin' grain
Bitch nigga wanna steal my fame, fame, fame
I be at home smokin' dro, dro
And see a nigga doin' a dance on the video
But I'm young pimp, steak and shrimp
Flyin' high like a blimp
Write my name in the sky on track
Tell the bitch to bring my money back, back, back, back bitch

He talkin' directly to you

Well if it ain't cash then I don't want it
I'm a million dollar striver, I get liver
Then the pimps that push clock punchers nine to fivers
A high diver, with mo' tricks up my sleeve than ya boy MacGuyver
A cadaver, that'll get cha' voted off my island like ""Survivor""
Is you blind, my pimpin' only gets better with age like a fine wine
And it's time to put up yo blinds
I might raise a pimp to shine
Decide to yo mind, desing
Two steps ahead of yo slow roll
You best to get a grip on ya world, world
Or we'll put that Miracle Whip on ya girl
Pimp her, let a trick sip on that pearl
Let her pay that is
Ol' sucker for love, titty baby, mama's boy
That's just the way that is
And that's the way that it's gonna be, gonna be
So ya might as well take ya lil' Heartbreak Hotel reside

It's funny how niggas get bitch then
And wanna fuck 'til their stiff dick get limb
Gotta pay for my shit, my rent, my six
Love me like a love the dough with interest
I don't flush with no broke nigga, regardless
If its hard then it start spinnin'
Keep me grinning
With phat shit
We can fuck 'til the spring
Pop on the mack
The fact is I'm a fly bitch
I show that
You motherfuckers would love to hit it and brat know that
Some of ya'll give head to quick in the bed to quick
First think of them chicks
Bitch if he leave you could still breathe
Through the week with a few G-Stacks easy
If its me you wanna get at I'm brit at
Invest is a pussy ass


Now it's funny how bitches get a nigga bent
Trying to act so god damn innocent
Wit all that shit ya'll put us through
And ya'll know you want it as bad as we do
I'm one of the few that can see through shit
I don't do shit 'til we do shit, rich bitch
So the trickin ain't nothing
And if I trick somebody fuckin'
Now I'm a playa I show that
And what I do don't stop, you know that
See a lot of ya'll trick and get caught
Not me if I trick I give head on the spot
On the bed, in the drop, on the elevator all the way to the top
See it taste good don't it
So why the fuck you frontin'
When you know you want it


When I need the money I know who to hit
When I make the call you better jump to it
I'm tired of ya'll acting like ya'll don't trick
'Cause when I call you jump jump jump to it",https://genius.com/Jermaine-dupri-all-thats-got-to-go-lyrics

What is yours and mine		    Yeah, uh huh
Break this up, none of that stuff   This right here
What is yours and mine              Is a story about a nigga
Work too hard, way too much         wit a lot of paper

Listen, uh, I remember when we first hooked up you was only 17
Cut off shirts and jeans, was ya only way seen
What I had didn't matter, it was all about us
All day on the phone and the stuff we discussed
I used to come over when ya mom's was gon' (Oow)
We ain't know what we were doin' but we got our freak on
And one thing lead to another, I introduced you to my mother
Like, Ma, this my girl, that's when it started gettin' real
Feelings stared gettin' caught, gifts stared gettin' bought
And everybody knew the deal
We used to hang out, kiss, argue, and all that
Hang up the phone and call right back
I got to know you like the back of my hand
And, you got to show me hoe a girl love a man
And, we took a small thing to a new land
And when I say I love you, I wanted you to understand

What is yours and mine (Uh huh, yo)
Break this up, none of that stuff (Listen to me baby)
What is yours and mine (Uh huh)

The older we got, everybody said y'all gon' change
But when 2-1 came, we was still in the game
92's new version of, Bonnie and Clyde
No matter what it was, we was side by side
You know the type you see gettin' in the photo booth
Matchin' shirts, flea market, photo shoots
Everything I saw cute, shit, you had to have it
What's a fly life if a nigga can't share it
Every new dollar made, I put it on you
Hit the Porsche dealership shit, nigga bought two
And when I went away, I got ya named tattooed
A yo, I try to put the big bling on ya hand
Cause uh, you show me how a girl love a man
And, we took a small thing to a new land
And when I say I love you, I wanted you to understand, it's real

What is yours and mine (Yeah, uh huh)
Break this up, none of that stuff (Uh. listen to me baby)

His passion for the music, his love for doing shows, his want to  better than everyone else, was always turnt up.

Leaning to the side, swinging my hair
Trunk full ants, ain't no room for a spair

How lady's all over the country want this nigga so bad
You know what I say be the truth not the agg
Stretch cream belly with the partner back
You know it's just me and my niggas and some lady's getting full
Crunk as hell drinking Belvedere and Red Bull
You know about the bouncin' and the booty shaking collar
Poppin' money, making city that I come from
You know about the playing hating
Baby, mama drama, 'cause uhh

Shake the checks off your Nikes

And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too

And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
Close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

People always talk about my lifestyle
Tell me nothin' good could come of it
But I always used to figure it was worth my while
That's why I had to hit this lick
11:30, a 6-4, ridin' dirty
I got the goods, but I think they heard me
Lord help me, can I get away?
Stashin' stuff away
Cuz the boys are comin' to get me
All my pitbulls say...

It ain't no tellin' when niggas start actin' stupid

Scheme ass could start shootin'

Keepin' a weapon at all times

But who wanna come to get it?
Wanna pay that unexpected visit to my crib for the riches

But I ain't stoppin', I'm gone, in something fast
Through the city with no top
That reach 220 on the dash, I'm so hot
In everybody's hood with other niggas' hoes
I'm throwin' paper at them bitches
Screamin' So So
Now every spot I hit
I'm hearing different shit
About homies that want me that weren't with me when I started this
It's fucked up but I
But I can't let these niggas blurry my vision
On where I'm going and how I'm living, ya know?
I got a daughter now, young age three
If her daddy don't shine, then my shorty won't eat
Feel me?
Do I floss? YES!
Sometimes I hit the block so damn hard I start hatin' my self
It's bad, I feel your pain dawg
But the only thing I'm about to change is the game motherfucker!

If you're sick of seeing niggas pop Cris
And talkin' bout stacking chips
You know what?!
(You got Hate in your blood)
Sick of seeing Bentley's
And hearing niggas talk about sittin' on dubs
(You got Hate in your blood)
If you're sick of seeing artists
And hearing artists
You know what!
(You got Hate in your blood)
Listen I know you niggas want me
I hear you niggas plottin'
I see you niggas lookin'
But I ain't stoppin, it's on

Papi had raw, then I bought him out
You know me, fuck niggas
Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out
Rapid fire got my hands shakin'
And everybody Hate dyin'
But most niggas die hatin'
While y'all run to the bank
I run to the brink
A real thug keep the Tommy gun under the mink
I got a glass kitchen
You can see what's under my sink
And I do shit just to do it
Too much money to think
So you can Hate all you want
I'mma still be 'Kiss
Dirty, a lot of paper, filthy rich
JD's the architect, he built these hits
Ruff Ryder's, So So Def, feel this shit
And you can tell any one of your boys
You might find 'em in a hood near you and any one of his toys
Cause I know you got Hate in your blood
Still dump eight in your mug
So cock sucker take it and love, uh


Somebody tell me why man
Somebody tell me why
Do niggas just Hate, Hate, Hate the way they do man
Let me explain something to y'all about me man
Why y'all think I was the first rap nigga on Mtv Cribs?
Cause I'm a young, fly, flashy motherfucker
Y'all think I'mma stop, FUCK NAW
I'mma keep ridin' down the block with my hat bent
In the black bent, with them dubs on that shit
We gon' still be in the club poppin' Cristal
Pourin' Belvidere on bitches
We don't GIVE A FUCK MAN
A matter of fact I wish I could smack the shit
Out of one y'all niggas right now with some money
But you know what I'm saying
Cause y'all niggas just Hate, Hate, Hate
Well y'all gonna have to just keep hatin' motherfuckers

Spit at the world
My lyrics, I could spit at your girl
Spit when I hurl, spit on the Dutch and finish the twirl
Spit facts, spit on whacks my whole lifetime
Spit on my watch, make the ice shine
Spit trife lines, .44 spit slugs out
Ready to thug out at the clubhouse
Chickens who lickin' or spit a nut out
My name within itself is a language that bring you wealth
Careful, comin' at me is like hangin' yourself at a
I know you thought I'd be locked up
Dead by now, shot up, full of lead by now
Got up wit' JD doh', crazy dough
Queens with the So So Def, A-T-L's best (yeah, I know)
Every ride up the 9-5, fly friendly skies
Thug passion for J Doves, Henneys for Nas
Then we mix that shit, tip that shit
Pass it around, hook the hood, everybody get wit' it
Nas
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause Queens Bridge is in the house
This is Nas Escobar and I turns it out
Jermaine
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause Collin Park is in the house
They call me Don Chi Chi and I turns it out
Jermaine
I'm sumpin' y'all dread like locks, get bread by the flocks
Bitches love me and I'm duggy from the head to the socks
Too much to handle, here da man of the year
Hit rooms and light 'em up like a chandelier
From C-P to the Bridge, y'all know what it is
Been gettin' money like this since I was a kid
I'm in the corner with bitches and buckets of Cris
Pourin' at the most goin'est nigga wit' shit that showin' it
Now look at my ice, look at your ice, damn
Look at my life, look at your life, damn
See, I got niggas wantin' to drop me, top me, stop me
Copy Chi to the T cause I'm nice in the three black same color AMG's
TVs, front and back packed with nuttin' but ladies
You can look up or down, right or left

Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause Queens Bridge is in the house
This is Nas Escobar and I turns it out
Nas
Touch the whole global with cold vocals and dark words
Vocal cords translate what my drunk heart slurs
Chest clogged up with sparked up herb, I feel faint
Tryin' to hold myself together, coulda spilt my own drink
All I hear is beats bumpin', I'm seein' in doubles
Last thing I need to happen is to be in a scuffle
Where my dogs at? These ain't my niggas I loah
Help the guard, forgot my niggas took some girls to the car
Tryin' to make it through the crowd, which way is out?
Which way is around? These grimy motherfucker's pointin' me out
I wish I had the drink, but then I'm too intoxed to aim and put the clip in
It's like the floor's wet and every step is like I'm slippin'
And yo, I can't lose a step, I feel my enemies followin'
All I got as a weapon is this Hennessey bottle
I'm talkin' to myself, my peoples should be stickin' with me
Somebody grabbed me up, ""Yo Nas, come take this picture wit' me""
My ice strillon, I'm feelin' my arm
Thought my Roley was gone, now I wanna swing but I'm calm
Still got that, DJ musta threw on another hot track
Think it was this one here, bounce to that
Too much Thug Passion and smokin'
Made it outside, mouth wide, vomittin', gaggin' and chokin'
From behind, niggas plottin' and scopin'
Everything was blurry at first, but now shit is movin' in slow motion
I saw my niggas pull up, Perelli's they skidded
They open the car door and toss-ed me in it
My cats tried to rob me, the crowd was rowdy
But one thing's for sure, So So Def know how to party
All night long {'til when?}

Check the ice and the clarity, it's cake like the lottery
Playa don't lie ta me, your stash couldn't cover me
What a playa wannabe, neck light in risavie
Hoes, I keep those by the, dime or dozen
I like short-a-y, but i wouldn't, mind her cousin

And at the end of all tha shit niggas still say me
I'm the best that ever did it, got a way wit it
Put grannie on the stand, she'll never say who did it
I'm from where, even the gangsta's live to
Make a mil. on the stoop, every summer switch boots
Cats change they name, to Phil like a giant
I treat rap like packs, role dills on consignment
This is for cats hummin' crack, bitchin' and parkin'
All the grimie niggas who got generous hearts
Got a brother doin' life, to see him is hard
F*ckin' wit mase, is like a nigga swimmin' wit sharks
My niggas chase cake, play some infa-reds
Some niggas in the state, some is in the feds
Spit shit at niggas that might erase they head
And role miserable niggas who can't wait to be dead

To all my bitches in the spot lookin' real fly
An' all my niggas wit the corner lock gettin' high
An' all my playas world wide it's just you and I
Get ya paper, get ya dough, get ya shit right
JD:
First off, ya'll niggas know I don't slouch
An' as a kid I done did the shit you talkin' about
I'm from the South
Ya heard? Where niggas fly birds outta Impalas
Live lavish From ATL to Dallas
An' the little palace Goin' once, goin' twice
Everyday, livin' nice In the grey wit the ice
Makin' money rollin' dice
Livin' the life
That ya'll dream of
Puttin' niggas outta business like Sony did to Zenith
You seen us? The green stuff
An nuttin' else that's all I collect
I got the hots like the Lox: Money, Power and Respect
An' I can damn the check that any of ya'll niggas spit
I stay hittin'
I ain't bullshittin'(he ain't bullshittin')
Nigga Wit more glitter Than M.J
It's all pimp play
When it comes to me
An' ya'll muthafuckas know how JD gets down
An' those who don't it's a new sheriff in town
Feel me now

Mad Rapper:
Yo, let me tell you where I'm at ya'll
Shits kinda sad ya'll
If you ride the buses or trains Watch ya back ya'll
Who think he stallin?
I still ain't ballin'
An' I got wild bills
An' the Chronic keeps callin'
My dogs wanna hang(bark)
My bitches wanna bang
But it don't mean a thang
When all you got is change
That's why my women ain't dimes
Not even close to nines
Sorta like fives and sixes
Wit scars and stiches
Type of bitches that spit in yo' face like Alomar
Broke hoes without a car snatchin' fruit from salad bars
Which one of ya'll come on, test me now
Me not goin' nowhere, you don't impress me now
So next time you see me up in them clubs I'm probably schemin'
While you at the bar
Brick hard and fiendin'
I wait for 4 o'clock when yo' drunk ass is leavin'
Cause I paid to get in An' now I gotta Break even
Chorus x2
DMX: Niggas goin' to parties Thousand dollar shoes and jewels
You be gets what I be wantin' so I be bringin' the tool
Tryin' to snatch up all that ice that you came in
An' nigga D be flippin', yeah, buddy , it's the same shit
What you thought Cause you bought a joint
You might be able to creep a nigga
When he ain't on point
An' I can see it in yo' eyes that you comin' closer than tryin'
An' every step you take brings yo' ass closer to dyin
An' I don't flow wit the dough cause money comes and goes
Gimme the love of my thugs
Hoodrats and hoes
An' I'm good
Cause muthafucka I'm stain' in the hood
An' I'm gon' rip till I'm stiff like wood

Ahora que no estas con quien puedo desahogarme nadie mas en estó puede salvarme
Todos mis pensamientos se acumulan en mi techo
Estas ojeras solo marcan mi desvelo
Donde estas ahora que necesito de tus consejos
Fuiste todo de confidente hasta el deseo
Tengo que acostumbrarme a que ya no estas
Ahora contigo solo en sueños logro hablar
Dejaste tu perfume en mi almohada
Tu risa en mi mente tengo yo tatuada
No olvido todas esas veces que hablamos de nada
Aun tengo tus fotos bien guardadas

Solo en mis sueños te tengo
Despierto y siempre te pierdo
Solo queda aquí tu recuerdo

Se que ya no estas y nunca volverás
Se siente tan sola esta ciudad
Siento como me come la ansiedad
Me pregunto de tu tiempo del que harás
Yo ya me cansé de beber
Solo en espejismos  yo te puedo ver
Mil veces te soñé y otras mil te rogué
Siento que a este amor ya me aferre
Dime Que hay que hacer pa volverte a tener
Necesito de tus labios como Percocet
Como una droga de la cual yo me envicie
Te agarre y nunca te solté

Si no estás no veo el mañana
Ronda tu fantasma en la cama
Sabes que aun te espero
En las noches siempre te pienso

Deeper,UnKnown,UnKnown,"All these raps, and no bodys rappin , obsessed with the same old lines,im power napping
I like to talk about something with real purpose , and bring the fire from inside to burn the surface
Forget all thoughts unique to the rap game, forget the luxuries forget the fortune the fame
Think deeper then your deepest thought, real meaning falls beneath the bs that you get taught
Let go of everything your Gonna be , guess im about to unleash, the inter me
My blue eyes have turned red from the evil that im seeing,im done takin anything from any human being
Standin up for anything that i believe in, deaf from all the screw yous and im leavin
Hers my middle finger stick it wherever you wanna, youll bow down to me no doubt but i ain't gonna
My thoughts are raising ghosts from way beyond the ghost of Motzart,deep within the ghost of rap itself is where my thoughts are
Using every word i can to tell a bit of real life, holdin on to every ounce of air im gonna ignite
I know you can rap alone looking in your little mirror , how about against a title wave, katrinas here
Step into my office you just got your first lesson,your the leftover and im...... the delicatessen",https://genius.com/Jermaine-dupri-deeper-lyrics

We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I

You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you
But each romantic ending
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore

A full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my knight
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I
Sweetheart yeah
Sweetheart yeah

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

Say what
MC baby sing it to me
Say what

Stars are bright
Mood is right
To keep me warm away from harm
Nowhere better than my baby's arms
Stars are bright
Mood is right
To keep me warm away from harm
Won't you be mine, won't you be my
Sweet sweet sweet sweet

Madden,UnKnown,2019.0,"Down and stuck in traffic
Yuh
Pull up on my fours, I been down and stuck in traffic
You know that she workin’ and she out to be the baddest
See me at the bottom like I’m goin’ back to trappin’
Look up to the sky, “Roll one up and hit this magic”
Pull up with the stick ‘cause you know that I’m a savage
Yesterday I hit the stick when I was playing Madden
Got that bad connection when it’s getting really static
Pull up wanting smoke, we making sure it’s gon’ be tragic
Tragic
Flying like Aladdin
Oh no
Thinking that I’ve had it
For sure (Yuh)
Hooked on like an addict
Now I’m in my zone and I ain’t ever popping tablets
Oh lord
She won the beauty pageant
What for?
She tryna get the status
For sure
Hooked on like an addict
Now I’m in my zone I ain’t ever tell him pass it
Get designer fashion
Icy like the patek (Ice, ice)
Patek
Whatever, I been crashin’
Now I’m on the road and the 808 is blastin’
I don’t lack no passion
Keep it real
I ain’t ever cappin’ (No cap)
Tryna feel
Goin’ back to mappin’
Back inside my home, inside America like captain
Iced out, let me go and grab the cooler (Cool)
Price down when I’m hitting up the jeweler (Hit the jewel)
Fight now, they was saying it was true love (Love)
They was hating on me, now they saying that we grew up
Lights out, they a cancer like a tumor
Kite down, they was up and I’m the shoota
Way back playing Madden in the basement
Now I’m up and ballin’ and my dreamin’ got me wasted
Pull up on my fours, I been down and stuck in traffic
You know that she workin’ and she out to be the baddest
See me at the bottom like I’m goin’ back to trappin’
Look up to the sky, “Roll one up and hit this magic”
Pull up with the stick ‘cause you know that I’m a savage
Yesterday I hit the stick when I was playing Madden
Got that bad connection when it’s getting really static
Pull up wanting smoke, we making sure it’s gon’ be tragic
Tragic
Flying like Aladdin
Oh no
Thinking that I’ve had it
For sure (Yuh)
Hooked on like an addict
Now I’m in my zone and I ain’t ever popping tablets
Oh lord
She won the beauty pageant
What for?
She tryna get the status
For sure
Hooked on like an addict
Now I’m in my zone I ain’t ever tell him pass it
Down in stuck in traffic
Out to be the baddest
Going back to trappin’
Roll one up and hit this magic",https://genius.com/Jermaine-dupri-madden-lyrics

Verse 1:
Set me free I don't like being cooped up in my house I want to flee man I hate just sitting on the couch I want to leave and go somewhere else, just get me out been inside for four weeks boy you know that takes some talent on the downside I think I've gone a bit wild ate a lot of chips man I don't know how I did it watching Netflix and Disney Plus, o that explains it, man I just want to get out I'm tired of staying in

Chorus:
This Quarantine, it's boring me

Verse 2:
Oh, I'm stocked with toilet paper I got rolls on rolls, oh I got a truckload full of water and some can food I'll be Gucci with some chips and maybe Cheetos head off to my bunker man like Cheerio, man I'll be fine with all my food and water also don't forget my rolls of toilet paper man in 2020 this is how you flex on haters flex all of your goods especially on neighbors flex your bottled water and cans and cans of liceall, man you know I'm rich cause I got it all, man you know I'm rich cause I got it all don't you come near me man I'll spray you with liceall",https://genius.com/Jermaine-dupri-quarantine-lyrics
