Baby Got Back,Mack Daddy,1992.0,"""Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!""

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

""Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".""

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-baby-got-back-lyrics
Posse On Broadway,Swass,1988.0,"Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set

My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill

My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, ""Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's""
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset
She's with the Mix-a-Lot posse on the Broadway set",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-posse-on-broadway-lyrics

Buttermilk Biscuits (Keep on Square Dancin’),Swass,1988.0,"Now I'm your big maul dropper, mud duck stopper
Fila on the bottom and Adidas on the topper
Transform scratching, big beat matching
I can tell you're getting jealous by the look I'm catching
I hate dumb skeezers, MC beater
Dropped 5 grand on my Bird wattmeter
Smooth like ice, don't get nice
Just turn up the box for the Mix-A-Lot slice (huh huh)
Y'all ready to get busy? (huh huh!)
Now, buttermilk biscuits here we go
Sift the flour roll the dough
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move your butt to the funky beat (huh huh)
Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)
(Lord have mercy Mix-A-Lot's got me rapping about biscuits now)
Freak from L.A. to the Carolinas
Dip them suckers in Aunt Jemima
Don't make a difference what food you make
Use buttermilk biscuits to clean your plate
You eat 'em in the morn', you eat 'em at night
Kentucky Fried Chicken makes the suckers just right
I am eat 'em with jelly at my favorite deli
Wrapped and sealed by a freak named Shelley (huh huh)
Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)
One day I kissed my freak, hit the street
Looking for something to eat
In a 18-wheeler, looking real swass
All the girls smile cause I'm the big boss
Said I gotta eat now, can't eat later
Made a lot of noise to attract my waiter
The boy walked up, and what did he say?
""Say, buttermilk biscuits free today!""
So what you waiting on boy?  Get up shake a leg
Gimme ten of them suckers with grits and eggs
Glass of Koolaid and a whole stick of butter
Them biscuits make me a super fast cutter (huh huh)
Now grab that can and wrap it in your hand
Bang that sucker 'til the dough expand
Put them suckers off in your oven
Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'
Add a dab of honey if you want to get funny
Microwave the suckers if you want your honey runny
Kind of get naughty at the Mix-A-Lot party
And rub them suckers all over your body (huh huh)",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-buttermilk-biscuits-keep-on-square-dancin-lyrics
My Hooptie,Seminar,1989.0,"My hooptie rollin', tailpipe draggin'
Heat don't work an' my girl keeps naggin'
Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin'
One hubcap cause three got stolen
Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin'
Mis-matched tires, and my white walls flakin'
Hit mickey-d's, Maharaji starts to bug
He ate a quarter-pounder, threw the pickles on my rug
Runnin', movin' tabs expired
Girlies tryin' to dis 'n say my car looks tired
Hit my brakes, out slid skittles
Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle
Who's car is it? Posse won't say
We all play it off when you look our way
Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block
Gotta roll this bucket, cause my Benz is in the shop
My hooptie - my hooptie
Four door nightmare, trunk locks' stuck
Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck
Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin'
Somethin' on my left front wheel keeps clickin'
Picked up the girlies, now we're eight deep
Cars barely movin', but now we got heat
Made a left turn as I watched in fright
My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight
She was standin', in the road, so I smashed her toes
Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes
Law ain't lyin', long hairs flyin'
We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin'
Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous
The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us
Hit a side street and what did we find?
Some young punk, droppin' me a flip off sign
Put the deuce in reverse, and started to curse
Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt
Homey got scared, so I got on
Yeah my group got paid, but my groups still strong
Posse moved north, headin for the CD
Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me
Mis-matched tires got my boys uptight
Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right
Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded
This is what I sport when you call me big-headed
A pot-hole crusher, red light rusher
Musher of a brother cause I'm plowin' over suckers
In a hooptie
It's a three-ton monster, econo-box stomper
Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp 'er
Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft
Some get bold, but some get smashed
Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen
It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions
Rollin' in Tacoma, I could get burned
(Sound of automatic gunfire) Betta make a u-turn
Spotted this freak with immense posterior
Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area
Brothers start lettin' off, kickin' that racket
Thinkin' I'm a rock star, slingin' them packets
I ain't wit' dat, so I smooth eject
Hit I-5 with the dope cassette
Playin' that tough crew hardcore dope
The tape deck broke
Damn what's next, brothers in Goretex
Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex
Found a little club called the N-C-O
Military, competition. You know
I ain't really fazed, cause I pop much game
Rolled up tough, cause I got much fame
""How ya doin' baby, my name is Mixalot""
""Mixalot got a Benz boy, quit smokin' that rock""
Ooooh, I got dissed. But it ain't no thing
Runnin' that game with the home made slang
Baby got ished, Bremelo gip
Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped
By a hooptie
Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic
Far left lane, throwin' up much static
Input, output, carbeurator fulla soot
""Whatcha want me to do Mix?""
Push freak, push
Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters
Cars dip low with hard core brothers
Tank on E, pulled into Arco
Cops on tip for Columbian cargo
We fit a stereotype, that's what he said
Big long car, four big black heads
Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators
'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nuthin' like Noriega
Cop took my wallet, looked at my license
His partner said ""Damn, they all look like Tyson""
Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go
This bucket ain't rollin' in snow
It's my hooptie",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-my-hooptie-lyrics

Start 'em up, yeah my Italiano, not many brothers is rollin in Diablos
Hittin the hard rock, the street is my work spot
I'm lookin for females to cop (yeah)
Few things can pass me, I'm rollin over 5.0s like pimps on hoes, G
And I'm sittin in third, I'm never on swerve, to the right I merge
Now I'm patrollin and I'm lookin for a skirt, this thing I'm haulin
I still got game ain't a damn thing change
I spot ten V's in the left lane
Eye contact is on, I'm rollin down windows pointin at phones
And she's poppin them buttons and yankin that blouse
Girl let it all out!
And that's what she did, baby ain't no kid
36 D's a make a man skid

Put 'em on the glass, girl
Put 'em on the glass

Yes he's kinky, weenie ain't dinky
Got crushed rock on his pinkie
He gets paid to stay laid
My copycats fade, evade to unpaid who say its played
Girls when I'm on the freeway
Catch up and then give me leeway
And then drop them things on the dash
This Porsche is quick so don't try to run fast
At speed I got a need to see you freed
And proceed with the kinky tease
Indecent exposure can't hold ya, it's makin you bolder
Cause baby is a Mix-A-Lot soldier
Putting love singers on pause
Everybody's beggin to get into your drawers
What's makin you kids frown?
+Baby Got Back+ or (shake it up and down)
You can follow me home cause this bone is on full blown
Straight growin all night long
I like my females nasty
Never try to drive straight past me
Just get in the left lane and show me your insane
And fill up the window with thangs
Puttin niggas on skids about to straight crash
Cause she put 'em on the glass
 - w/ ad libs - (*scratched*)

How many times will you play this
Before you ban this
I heard Mrs. Gore can't stand this
But I got a fan list, lovin this scandalous rap
Guess who I got layin on the canvas
D-R R-I-C-H-A-R-D
Hard from the freeway party
Baby them things is workin
Fillin up the passenger window with Jergens
You hit the gas I hit mine too
Baby can I get with you?
Presh the flesh 'til the glass gets stressed
I'm obsessed with the way you express yourself
Some say I only rap about wealth
But baby can I talk about your health?
Lungs, lungs, motherfuckin lungs
Get a brother oh so sprung
I'm lovin this window dressin
The whole right lane is stressin
Offend me, offend me, you can freak me if your friendly
B-double-O-B-S, straight sittin in the window
I'd rather kiss them than indo
And if you see me on the freeway, baby don't pass
Slow down and put 'em on the glass

Bremelo,Swass,1988.0,"Here's a gory kind a story about a obese freak
With a 40-inch waist and a 10-inch beak
Overweight and out of shape with a triple chin
Her brassiere strikes fear in the hearts of men
The girl's a Bremelo
The girl's a Bremelo

Me and Terry hopped the ferry we were looking swass
When a dip hit the ship we were almost tossed
It was a big Bremelo standing on my toe
An enormous jelly belly trying to say hello
I was really kind of frightened as she looked my way
I tried to run because her buns made the ferry sway
To be blunt she was fat and ready for combat
On the way to Bremerton were the fat is at
The girl's a Bremelo
Let's go

I'm not fakin' or mistaken bout the big ole duck
She had hairy underarms and a whopping gut
Her hair was short and wavy, drove my pitbull crazy
A Bremerton beast chasing fellas in the Navy
After movie she's the feature, the Bremerton creature
You wear a lifejacket if you ever try to freak her
You look at her physique she ain't my kinda freak
The floor creaks when the beast starts reaching her peak

The girl's a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo
Change the beat!
(*beat changes, then changes back to the original*)

You can't ignore the way she snores, cause she blows down doors
Baby's got the kind a face only a mother adores
A big basketball head with the 10-inch feet
Big lips, no hips with the smell of a beast
I couldn't put her in my Caddy or my tranny would break
I heard of dirt because of poverty, but she took the cake
When it comes to Kool-Aid the girl would drink it in pints
You go to school for twenty years and your still in the ninth?
You're just a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo

You big triple-chin unattractive duck
Your boyfriend beats freaks up to make a buck
Hanging round 3rd and Pike, on a ten-speed bike
You can say that I'm a liar, but you know I'm right
You talk behind my back, because I dropped you flat
And you never take a shower cause your too damn fat
So your man was smart when he broke your heart
Because if Mix-A-Lot had cut ya, you'd a fell apart
Wearing polyester slacks, with elastic in the back
You could flatten Schwarzenegger in a wrestling match
You got lips like a character in some cartoon
With a pink posterior, you big baboon
Your just a (*sound of a elephant yelling*)

Now Bremerton's a city right outside of mine
Most girls there are ducks, but a few are fine
But the ones that I speak about
Used their face for catching trout
Vacuum cleaners for a mouth
You know what I'm talking about
Mud ducks, hockey pucks, drivers of Mack trucks
Lame brains, diesel trains, pick 'em up you have to strain
Big butt, crew cut, extraordinary gut
Big momma, kinda buff, facial hairs are kinda rough

Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
Girl's a Bremelo
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck

Rippin’,Swass,1988.0,"I... Got a real fine freak with a real big butt
She gets real ill when she hears my cuts
Got two Cadillacs, one blue one gold
Got straps on the back with a fresh set of Vogues
Wheel in the back with a grill in the front
24-k strap on my trunk
Got a big gold rope cold laying on my neck
Got my freak in my arm cold kicking on set
Never get ill cause I'm too damn swass
Got a funky Trans-Am with a dual exhaust
T-town is live but Seattle is my home
Hood ornament is gold cause I don't like chrome

 That's rippn'  

I'm... Chillin' never illin' in the place to be
Down with m-i-x-a-l-o-t
On the west coast driving big Cadillacs
Snow white paint job with the wheel in the back
Suckas  cause they cannot hang
But you got to have a brain in the computerized game
You're getting jealous cause your girl wants to play my song
You know you want to hear it, put the record back on

That's rippn'
(Here in my car) Rolling down the avenue
(Here in my car) Picking up points
(Here in my car) Rolling in the Nissan
(Here in my car) Kicking my beats
(Here in my car) Wheel in the back
(Here in my car) Grill in the front
(Here in my car) Big Cadillac
(Here in my car) Bass in the back

I'm... I'm a real estate investor, hardcore dresser
Money counting brother and I hate polyester
Walking in my Gore-Tex steppin on 
Steel toed boots hate to do it like that
Cruise Broadway on my cellular phone
Spend a hundred thousand dollars on my number two home
Dog in the front yard, fence in the back
Ex-girl getting mad cause my paycheck's fat

That's rippn'

Rolling in my IROC kicking my beat
With my girl by my side looking oh so sweet
Gore-Tex on my feet, gold rope for my neck
Cold carry cash and I never write checks
Bankroll so big I can hardly hold it
You once had a dream that your grandma stole it
Punched her in the eye took my bank back
You ever wonder why I'm like that

Cause I'm rippn'

Yeah... You like this beat but it's time to change
Not gonna get ill but I'm gonna get strange
Push your partner throw 'em in the aisle
Gonna kick it live with the square dance style
I'm a ripping motherfucker that's my last name
When I pull tip freaks go insane
Benz on the left with a Caddy on the right
Gore-Tex in effect with my freaks tonight
Sucker on tip tried to get up in my face
Steel-toed rambo put the sucker in his place

I Got Game,Seminar,1989.0,"""Man I wish I could find me a brother with some game""
To the rescue!
Here's a little somethin' for you whacked out suckers
Rollin' twenty-third, sellin' dope to cluckers
Your bank is thick, but you got no game
Spittin' at freaks runnin' superfly slang
I'm comin' up the ave' hard as hell
In a droptop 'Vette with a greenwood tail
Girls are jockin', lookin' for a knockin'
Smart investments, keep me clockin'
You know a 'Vette only got two seats
Just enough room for a player and a freak
Rollin' in the park, 'n I seen this cutey
L.A. face, with the Oakland booty
She's on tip, but I'm playin' that role
Talkin' to the home boys, showin' my gold
Skeez on bell, Levi's swell
I'm spittin' that game, and I'm spittin' it well
Rolled up, pulled up on the girly
""Girl you wanna ride in my 'Vette?""
""Why surely!""
That's right baby, blowin' me a kiss
Thinkin' Mixalot gonna make you rich
Highside, highside, vapors that's right
Can't get play cause my games so tight
Now she's wit' it, skirts in effect
Layin' on the back-a my 'vette
I got game, I got game, You know I got game, I got game
POP THAT GAME
Bye-bye baby, Mix gotta roll
Switch to the Benz and I gotta get mo'
Hit the strip, seen this skinny
Butt shook like a 426 Hemi
Not just butt, baby hadda motor
Stacked to the max, hair to the shoulders
She's older but I can mold 'er
Dropped that game and it hit like boulders
Now she's sprung, sittin' in my Benz
Rollin' up the tint so you can't see in
Playin' this tape of old Luther stuff
""You wanna get with me, this ain't wild enough""
That's a cue, sorry Luther
Brother you can sing, but I just can't use ya
Thought she was cool, but the girl likes beat
Freak freak freak freak, baby wanna freak
Def 'n dope, ""You slangin'"" Nope
Callin' me a dealer cause I sport fat rope
Kept poppin' that game, knowin' I can get it
""Take me to the lake Mix, so we can get wit' it""
Oh no, time for the ramble, bring a jimmy hat
Cause I hate to gamble
Huffed 'n puffed 'n I just got in
Messin' up the backa my Benz
I got game girl - I got game
Two down, two to go
Can't live my night right if I don't knock four
I'm in a big 500SEL
Interior hot, with a perfume smell
Took it on home, hit the shower
'Bout to get busy in one more hour
Ducks look, but they never will find me
Hopped in my number two Benz 190
Here a skirt, there a skirt
Everywhere a skirt, skirt
Gotta have game, if you wanna get work
""Ah, you ain't nothin'""
Some suckers wanna crush me
Smooth, wit' a move, baby girl. Rush me
Here it is, from the wizard of hip-hop
A lesson in game, make the girls get hot
Picked up a girl named Mattie
Caught static from the sucker in a seven-two caddy
Mattie was hot, but her name was ""not""
I ain't worried 'bout that, I ain't tyin' no knot
Took her to the hotel, game went strong
She thought I spent bank, but I really spent coupons
But it's cool, cause my rhyme went smooth
Savin' my money, cause my mouth is a tool
Rolled up close, when I hit the spit
I ain't worried 'bout my breath, cause I brush my teeth
Popped that game, freak got weak
Hit that jackpot, swept them feet
Mattie got busy with the bedroom eyes
Layin' on the big king-sized
I got game - I got game, girl - I got game - I got game
Yeah that's right home cut, I got G A M E, snatchin' up girlies
An' rollin' up suckers, know whatta I mean
Through with Mattie that makes three
""I'm gonna miss you babe, you gonna miss me?""
Got loose cause the girl hadda big caboose
Hadda break down cause the girl had juice
""I'm gonna miss you baby""
Smooth ain't it? Girls so sprung that she almost fainted
Headin' for the crib, tired brother
Thinking I was through when I spotted me another
Baby looks good so you know what the means
Drive around the block with the gangsta lean
Open that sun roof, crank that beat
Bumpin' up the avenue, impressin' them freaks
What's up baby, rump so big? The girl's on tip like funk on pigs
Runnin that game, cause I wanna get work
Sit don't rip rap home girl shirt
Here she comes, hopped in my car
Somethin' 'bout my Benzo's star and bars
Spit, spit, runnin' that game
I'm feelin' confident about another thick dame
All of a sudden, my game got crushed
Some sucker pulled up and his ride was plush
Rolled up smooth, the girls was waitin'
5.0, 24K Daytons
Oh-oh, think quick cause my girls jumpin' on home boy's tip
Better change my game, try another lure
Cause home boy's lookin' like Al B. Sure
But it's cool, cause I whipped out bank
Big dead presidents made her think
Back in effect, situation in hand
I'm the brother that the others can't stand

""Yeah, that's right. You, the fly hustler.""
""Ya'll still sellin' that fake Louie, huh?""
""Hey! Don't be turnin' the highside up in here. You don't even got the Dope...""
""Oh, baby, I don't need the highside, just give me some khakis and I'm straight.""
""Tryin' dis me, ole raggy rooty-poot runned-up gangsta? Who you think you are? M.C. Hammer? You can't afford this Louis Vuitton!""
""What you mean I can't afford it?! Why would I wanna afford some old fake Louie, baby?! If that's real Louie, I'm Tom Cruise.""
 ""Excuse me, I'd like to buy some.""
""You don't know jack about this Louie. Take your sorry self over to booth Number 2 for the crack pipe.""
""Yeah, awreit. I got your crack pipe right here baby. Get on my...""

Wooah, Louis Vuitton never made a sweatsuit
But you're swearin' up and down, that you got the Louie boots
So you roll to the swap meet, girlfriend buttless
Ripped phantom top on your seven six Cutlass
In the shop Louis Vee is what you seek
Black Knight Cortez slippin' on your feet
You're saggin', droop like a bawla
Your girl starts walkin' towards the counter, so you call her
 Oooh, this is on. Why don't you get this for me?
Every time you hit the swap meet, it's gimme, gimme, gimme
A little old lady in the back starts to creep, she's deep
That's right
Through Cazaly's she peeks
Her name is Mary Pong and she's got it going on
Swap meet weave, with the swap meet thongs
Leather miniskirt with the oriental draw
Little Mary Pong is RAW
She says ""I wanna make your girlfriend look good
Start buying all your Louie in the hood""
And your sprung, on the two for one
Fake Louie at the swap meet, son
Now you know brown Louie is played
But you're drunk and you just got paid
So you bought the gear, little Mary says ""See ya""
Little did you know it was ""Made in Korea?""

Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
That's right, tell em homeys
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
Right here baby
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
What you need?
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
You don't know jack about this Louie

Victim number two, a rich young couple from Bellevue
Welcome to the swap meet
Another dumb couple 'bout to get beat
Out came little Mary Pong, she had the big Louie Vee gear on
The couple got sprung and the wife want some
Louie Vee hat with the diamonds
Shes thinkin' she got that deal, 2 for 1 is a steal
The hat mighta had a L V on the back
But at the swap meet that ain't jack
But she bought it, cost about three hun
Mary Pong said you're the one
But when the girls Louie got wet she started complainin'
Baby girl's 'Louie' started fadin'
Now she's tryin' to take it back
But the swap meet don't play that
Cause when a customer tries to intimidate
Mary Pong pulls a .38
She ain't about to get bum rushed
She's strapped an' she's ready to bust
But at the swap meet you don't pay tax
They're movin' out fake Louie by the batch

Swap Meet Louie, clockin' lotsa dolla's
Swap Meet Louie, we all got gold
Swap Meet Louie, black silk jackets
Swap Meet Louie, rich flaunt clout
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie

Me an' Attitude Adjuster stepped smooth at a swap meet
Buyin' much gear for the feet
When we spot Mary Pong with a blank face
Sellin' bootleg Mix-a-lot tapes
The brother bought the tape and kept steppin'
Mary Pong starts lookin' for a weapon
I got a plan 'n I'm about to use it
What's up with the bootleg music?
Mary Pong is about to get jacked
She had a stack of big bootleg racks
Me and Attitude creeped like snakes
Grabbed the tapes and the Louie and break
The whole swap meet went crazy
I'm sockin' more fools than Patrick Swayze
Toss a mess of fake Louie in the trunk
Hit the gas and the tach just sunk
Like that, I'm outta there
Swift brothers like to roll in pairs
So we jet, to the boulevard fast
Slingin' swap meet Louie for cash

Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
That's right, tell em homeys
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie

Sir Mix-A-Lot Ray, the ultimate freak
I'm so cute in a suit, my beats conceit
Intelligent freak, wardrobe complete
You can fold my robe if you be my freak
I got a big Cadillac with the bass in the back
Try to take my freak, boy you must be whack
Bicep's flex, so kiss my neck
Buying pounds of gold with royalty checks
And I'm Swass

Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass)
Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass)
Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass)
Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me

Cold gettin' live in a fresh fruit vest
I'm the king of the beat in the great Northwest
Packin' more dollars than Chase Manhattan
After each show my billfold fattens (yup)
My phone be ringin' like you wish yours would
But my girl stays cool cause she looks so good
Punk mother *puh-hicka* called me weak
Just turn up the bass and feel this beat
Feel my bass drum

Stop it, get silly, swass
Stop it, get silly, swass

Suckers in the crowd think the boy be fakin'

Check it out ...

Hit bigger!

23 points when I count my bank
All imitators I will spank
I'm a freak and I know it, so why not show it
I design my rhymes like a worldwide poet
NEW freaks every week in my contract
So cold with the rap you'll get contact
Innovative beats with a brand new twist
Don't you wish your man could rock like this
Break it down


Eighty dollar slippers to wash my car
It attracts more freaks than a beach lifeguard
Imitate me, it can bring about pain
Better wear dark shades when you look at my chain
Swass points, no deduction
I come complete with free instructions
I work for myself, don't have no boss
Boy you gotta have brains if you wanna be swass
And I'm swass ...

Kickin live in a four door Benzo
Ripped, with muscles I'm furious

Don't chill, not 'til the song ends
There's the more, now I know you hear it
Grit my teeth when I write my lyrics
You jump, I attack like a animal
No pity, no show at your funeral
Punk, your rap's illiterate
Wanna box boy don't consider it
Ingenius, used to be a good boy
Nine millimeter gat my new toy

You wanna throw, let's go for the floor man

Buckle up for the pain you will endure
Movin, runnin, slick plus cunnin
Girlies on my straw cause I rap so stunnin
Loaded with ambition, uzi ammunition
Tongue lashin suckers, black it like a statistican
Satisfied never, nothin could be better
Roll a gold Caddy, wearin white troop leather
Packin dual handguns, rippin up the nation
Droppin enemies so hard, they type, they wouldn't want none
Inhale (*inhaling noise*) here we go again
The story of my life, everyday's a perfect ten
Always gettin caught with tactical equipment
Bringin in my uzi on the UPS shipment
Cut 'em, droppin 'em, no one says I copy 'em
Skeesos in my posse always tell me that I'm rockin 'em
Old school, new school, make no, never mind
Your foundation's just been undermind
Slice, roast those big boys
Banks don't matter you will be destroyed

The radio rotation dominated by your flow

No mercy on the stars, and that includes you

Man, why I gotta be Jerome man? Why can't I be Tommy or Philbert or something?
Just put your hands on the hood Muhammad

It's the man that you love to hate
Coming outta Washington state
Cops don't like my profile
Cause Mixalot kicks much style
So the man is on my trail
He wanna take Mix to jail
If he does, I'll make the bail
Cause I know alot of rich females
I'm shakin' 'em just like this
Keepin' that Porsche in fifth
King County cops don't quit
Even when a young brothers legit
So they follow me wherever I go
I hear 'em on the radio
With a scanner that I bought from the sto'
Cause a brother like Mix gotta know
I'm checkin' them cops with radar
They don't believe I'm a rap star
That my brain is up to par
An I'm ready when they follow my car
I know they wanna spray me with mace
Cause my trunk keeps pumpin' much bass
But they best get outta my face
Cause one-times got no case, give it to me

One-times got no case

The police think I'm movin' them keys
They trip cause I clock much D
They pull a gat an' they yell out ""Freeze!""
I'm whippin' out my I.D
My gat sits under my seat
The cops throw me out in the street
They found my gun like thieves
Officer Friendly has got a new beat
So I show him my gun permit
I told him I roll legit
Give me a test to see if I'm drinkin'
They claim my breath was stinkin'
They had me walk on the line
I walked backwards stopped on a dime
My female just reclines
Cause she knows I know the time
I'm hip to the cop procedure
They get ya everytime they see ya
They stop ya, they cuff ya
They roll ya an' they rough ya
They ask what I do for a livin'
Should this information be given?
This is what keeps me driven
Some cops want a brother in prison
So I got me a few attorneys
Just in case a cop wanna burn me
They protect me from the state
Cause one-time's got no case, break it on down


A cop asks me ""What's my name, and don't lie""
And I'm askin' officer ""Why?
Why ya wanna mess with a brother like Mix
When you know I'm livin' legit?""
The cop said ""Don't get smart
I tear soul-brothers apart""
I said ""Well take off your gun, if you wanna get done
An' I'll show you that I ain't the one""
The cop rolled up his fist
Puts the handcuffs on my wrists
Then he threw a straight jab and he missed
A female cop pulls up and she's pissed
But this cop had K-9
A soul sister, yes she's fine
I said ""Won't ya help a brother outta bind?""
But that badge was going to her mind
So she stuck a billy club in my back
She said ""Don't think because you're black
That I won't beat you"", crack, ""hit you with the gat""
Her partner starts to laugh
Oooh, hit 'em again. Hit 'em again
So they took me on down to the jail
P.L.B. came to pay my bail
Then we called Goldstein and Claire
Them's my lawyers walkin' up the stairs
To the courtroom dressed in suits
'Bout to give a couple cops the boot
So the female cop takes the stand
Took her oath with the wrong damn hand
My lawyers ate her up like catfish
The other cop pleads the fifth
She lost her job, I seen a few tears on her face

 Huh, sellout
 Boy this is the S-E-A-T-O-W-N, clown
 Forever (Seatown)!  Yeah, and that's from the motherfuckin heart!  So if you ain't down witcha hometown, STEP OFF PUNK!  Mix, tell these fakes what the deal is

I was raised in the S-E-A-double T-L-E
Seattle, born in the C.D. nigga
19th and Yesler boy da pimpin' was hard
Cadillac was the car I wanted
And I got that seven-seven Coupe with the trues and straps
I couldn't roll no hubcaps, huh, it wasn't easy
Tryin' to compete, with my homies in the C.D
Here's my plan, funky-ass sedan
Laid down with the vogues, money in my hand
Hair all whipped up
Carload full of freaks with the butts
I used to cruise around Seward Park
Flip the funky eighty-one, and La Vista
Lookin' for freaks to be G'd
Most mini-skirts wanted please
In them days boy you had to be pimpin'
Just to keep motherfuckers from trippin'
Now punks wanna run up pokin'
With a nine double-M, is you jokin'?
Cause I'm packin' - a HK-91 son
308's is what I run
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin'

It ain't nothin' but the real up in the Northwest (real deal nigga)
So don't step to the 2-0-6 tryin to kick up dust
Or you might get floored, sucka (get FUCKED UP), think about it
This is from the Attitude Adjustor

Do we got gangs? Hell yeah, brothers gotta get paid
Mickey D's ain't payin' no way
So they take to the streets with gats
And they'll put 'em on ya just like that
So I'm undercover, when I'm rollin' through the C.D
A lot of niggas wanna get me
I see a freak in front of Garfield, I swoop around the block
Gang of niggas yellin' out, ""Fuck Mix-A-Lot!""
Do I hate 'em? Naw, I gotta love 'em
They think my head is big, and I'm tryin to be above 'em
Huh, but to the masses I'm just another coon
Gettin' paid for a little bit of boon
So even though a lot of niggas talk shit
I'm still down for the Northwest when I hit
The stage, anywhere U.S.A
I give Seattle and Tacoma much play
So here's a shot to the Criminal Nation
And the young brother Kid Sensation
I can't forget Maharaji and the Attitude Adjustor
And the hardcore brothers to the West of Seattle
Yeah, Westside
High Pointe, dippin' fo'-do' rides
And my homeboy Critical Mass in the back
With the bat to smack back all packs who try to jack me
Just because I'm in a S-E-C
Droptop A-M-G
The cops say Mix-A-Lot's a dope dealer
But I'm more like a dope deal sealer
I sell rap deals, not drug deals
Handin' out contracts like meals
The Rhyme Cartel, I own the muthafuckin' label
And Ricardo got the papers on the table
And I'm signin' 'em, just like that
No sluts so my pockets stay fat
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin'
 Huh, nigga this is MY town, what you talkin'?
 Punks tryin' to tell me where I come from!  Who the fuck you talkin' to, clown?
 Need to shut the Hell up, Seattle Tacoma strong
 Shit, you was a young lil' rudy poot muthafucka 'fore you picked up a nine millimeter!
 Who you smokin'?
 Punk ass, cake, faggot ass nigga!

Let's take a trip to the South end, we go West
Hit Rainier Ave and bust left
I'm in a funky-ass Porsche Gemballa
No bitches, just women on my collar
S-E-A-T-O-W-N
Yo' nigga is back again
Huh, who you callin' sellout fool?
I was puttin' caps in clowns when you was still in school
But I choose not to talk about that
So many gangsta crews now, I'd rather kick back
So I drop my own style
Fuck bitin' somebody else, and jumpin' on a pile
But that's another subject, gettin' back to the hood
Me and my boys is up to no good
A big line of cars, rollin' DEEP through the South end
Made a left on Henderson
Clowns talkin' shit in the Southshore parkin' lot
Critical Mass is beggin' to box
But we keep on goin' because down the streets
A bunch of freaks in front of Rainier Beach, was lookin' at US
They missed that bus, and they figured that they could trust us
Six cars in a line and the girls was fine
I had ""The Wicked One"" playin' on my Alpine
Two Porsches, two Benzes, a Ferrari Testarossa
And a Rolls Royce roaster
Miami Vice tried to get with this, but they didn't
Huh-huh, cause Seattle ain't bullshittin'!
Yeah I wanna whassup to my DJ Punish?
My boy Strange, across the water whassup LX?
Bookie, Mark P, MC Fury
The Group EQ, old forty ounce drinkin' A.D
Always Dangerous
PD2, Tribe, E.C.P. ready and willin'
Nasty Nes and Glen Boyd

Whassup Eightball? Kazzy D, Villains in Black

Why Mix-A-Lot cotton picker you freak skinnin' the cats
Why don't you bring the beat on in here, cotton picker so I can get down
Ha hee hee
Put it up
That's the way I like it there Mix-A-Lot
Ha hee hee
Hey Mix-A-Lot, picks me up cotton picker
Picks me up Mix-A-Lot

Now everybody's rapping 'bout
Everybody's rapping 'bout
Ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever

Now everybody's rapping 'bout welfare lines
I'm gonna bust me a brand new rhyme
Girls bend down and you start to freak
Shake your hips and act conceited
Throw your head high in the air
Grab your partner's derriere
Fellas in the crowd, I know you must be tripping
My boy's stop them there home girls flipping
Now grab your partner, take a bow
If you can't dance, I'll tell you how
Wave your hands and take two steps
Grab your hips and slide to the left
Get all in your partner's face
Swerve to the side and show your lace
If your a freak then let it show
And grab your partner dosey-doe
(Doe, doe, doe-doe-doe-doe-doe, doe-doe-doe-doe-doe, doe-doe-doe)

Now if you think your partner's fine
Grab her where the sun don't shine
If you can't dance, then tap your toes
If your stuck up, turn up your nose
Wave your hands from side to side
Lean to the left and take a slide
Other's DJs know their no match
Just look to the stage as I start to scratch
(*scratching*)

Rock me babe
Rock me babe
Rock me babe
Rock me babe

Freaks on the left and freaks on the right
Grab your partner, hold him tight
Put your hands in his Levi's
Hold his rear while he grips your thighs
The more you dance, the more I rap
The big fat beat makes your toes tap
Glen Campbell can't hang with this
All you freaks give your man a kiss
(Look good)

My beats are icky in the square dance rap
My beats are icky in the square dance rap
My beats are icky in the square dance rap
My beats are icky in the square dance rap

Beat box
Oh Mix-A-Lot I'm feeling it now, cotton picker
Yee-haw!

Now everybody on the floor clap your hands
Stomp to the beat of the one man band
Mix-A-Lot reigns on the drum machine
The bass line playing is ""oh, so mean""
Mix-A-Lot make a jam in his room
With a four track recorder you can bust jams too
Throw your partner across your thigh
Tickle her fancy, until she starts to cry
Whip her to the left, whip her to the right
But don't whip her to hard 'cause her jeans are tight
(Look good)

Get your hands off that girl, boy
Seattle rocks

L.A. rocks

Hey Mix-A-Lot, what in the world is that noise cotton picker?
Sound like the Grand Ole Opry, ha hee hee
Hear what I say Mix-A-Lot, say sound like Grand Ole Opry cotton picker
Now before we end this filthy cut, we got a few things we have to say
To the home girls sprung on the hum drum beat, check out Sir Mix-A-Lot's way
His style is fresh, so clean and new, he pulls so many tricks
If you give him ten bucks and a brand new tape, he'll put you in the mix

I'm hookin' up girls by fax
If you're stacked
You can rub a big mack
I gotta gas
So don't worry about scraps (No no)
Five-foot-eleven with a seven-foot game
Got a big mouthpiece and I shows no shame
Monster kinky have no morals
Monster love to get oral (ummmm!)
Got ten cars and the girls like that
I was born and bred to be a mack
""What's your sign?"" is played
You gotta put a little style in your game nowadays
In the sixties, girls was all high
LSD had 'em givin' up thighs
The baby boom was on and I dropped
No more Woodstock, but now you got Mix-A-Lot
So put me in your CD changer
Watch your girl, 'cause Mix'll rearrange her
Ooo, he's sexist!
Ooo, he's sexist!
Keepin' Rush Limbaugh restless
I'm da mack and that's monsta
Straight chase girls through the tail 'cause I wants ta
You can call it wack
But you respect this black
When it comes to game I'm a monsta mack

Strike the pose
But she ain't nasty as me
'Cause Mix-A-Lot is stuck on freaky
Can't stop tappin' that tweety
Give it to the needy
Nope, 'cause I'm too damn greedy
Here I go walking through the mall
Don't play ball
But I got game for 'em all
Focus on a victim, focus on a victim
Mr. Richard is hot, so let's sic 'em
And like a Tomahawk jumpin' on a SCUD
Girl, you got to gimme my pud
The pick-up king is back, buddy
Tryin' to give lessons to these thick-ass ballers and understudies
But I'm not tryin' to call you no bitch, girl
Don't give a damn if you're poor or rich, girl
And we can play a li'l pool
And I'm pokin' that 8-ball cool
And the booties
I still like the booties
She got a little waist, doin' squats just to keep me on my duty
Giant-size game's what I'm droppin'
Straight freaks with them thick ol' glutes is what I'm knockin'
Now the right-wing wanna test me
If likin' sex is a crime, then you arrest me
But don't tell me who to sing to, Jack
Cause a third of your life is in the sack

Hope this girl's feet ain't stinkin'
Here we go
Swingin' by Franglor's
And get a little soul food
Now you got a brother in the mood
Damn, gotta get her home with the quickness

No need to put my girls on tilt

Gold,Swass,1988.0,"Gold around his neck (8 ball rollin)
Gold around his neck (24-7)
Gold around his neck (8 ball rollin)
Gold around his neck (14k heaven)
Clockin' lots of dollars, cruisin' in his benz
Clockin' lots of dollars, got no place to go
Clockin' lots of dollars, rollin' with your posse
Clockin' lots of dollars, we all got gold

Listen up brothers it's the rhyme I can't repeat
I'm sportin' more gold than a rock n roll freak
Mix is my name, bustin' rhymes is my game
Don't disrespect me cause I kill then I take your chain
Life is pretty tough gettin' gold's kinda rough
Stealin' and you're dealin' but you just can't get enough
Now you're crying cause my rope is 20 millimeters fat
You're stealin' gold emblems down at Fredrick Cadillac
Walkin' round San Fran, rippin' up the set
Homeboys on the corner ask us where we rock next
I'm not in town to smoke dope
If you broke you can't go
We're back in San Francisco and we're looking for the gold rope
Saw the rock man and we tailed his Benz
He drove Powell Street to where the trolley cars end
He sipped his soda pop, came to a complete stop
Looked over to the left it was a... gold shop!
(Yo baby check out this big gold nugget ring!)

Walked into the shop and I had to stare
This freak was in the corner with the long blonde hair
I knocked her out the way cause she was standin' in my vision
I saw this gold rope and Maharashi started fishin'
Walked up to the counter and we hit the bell
We all had money for the big gold sale
From back behind the counter came the big gold mon
Last name, kinda funny, but his first name was Jahan
""Put your money down that's nothing to me
Got the real rock man buying my jewelry
So they got lots of money from American games""
The AMG kick on my 560 Mercedes
So I reached into my pocket and I pulled thick bank
I would have bought the store but my bank just sank
I know I got points cause my gold shines bright
Gonna sport it to the solar system Saturday night
Maharashi's up next for the big gold deal
Flipped dead presidents and cold got ill
Smile on his face with a grand in his hand
Bought a turkish gold rope with the 30 inch span
Kid Sensation was the next at bat
Bought a big nugget watch, face up a Cadillac
He saw this gold rope and said ""How much for that to go?""
Told him 700 dollars everybody said ""woooaaahhhh""
Security came over as the kid count bank
Gave him fourteen fifties and his face stayed blank
I grabbed the sack of gold and Jahan, we told em bye
We'd like to stay and kick it but we can't we gotta fly

Break!

We left the gold shop kinda broke but happy
Promoter put us up in an '86 caddy
Crossed the Golden Gate and headed for the Napa Valley
No liter in the car because we threw it in the alley
Everybody's trippin' off the Mix-a-lot crew
Pose fresh dipped all filas are through
Caddy pushin 80 like a big black rocket
We're looking for a posse with no money in their pockets
We made a right turn theres the pose on the left
Before we get busy just remember we're def
Maharashi took the bank roll, Larry took the car
Kid Sensation had a plan thinking he was the star
Step aside kid I control this jam
You are my partner and here's my scam
I'll take the homeboys you take the skeezer
The boys got gold but they ain't got filas
Larry made a move with the black briefcase
5000 dollars worth of fila in your face
They ain't got money but they had a lot of dope
I said I don't want drugs just give me your rope
To sell a suitcase of filas boy it ain't no thing
Just give me that gold that includes all rings
Maharashi snatched the gold out the homegirls nose
Man we would have took her bra if the sucka was gold

Cake Boy,Baby Got Back,UnKnown,"He's in a yellow Camaro, skin so smooth
A buttercup boy from the funny school
His hair's all nice and wavy
And mine is nappy so you call me crazy
And he's got them skin-tight spandex on
Straight cake to the bone
He'd cook a big meal like your mother would
A cake boy, up to no good
He'll take your girlfriend from ya
And he's makin' my homeboys wonder
His body's a trip, got a booty like Josephine Baker
And a touch of blush makeup
And why most fly girls gettin' hooked on this?
'Cause he ain't down for the French kiss
Girl, I'ma tell you what a cake boy is
(But he's so sensitive!)
Tossed salad is the hairdo
Cappuchino latte - his brew
And he's down to do what most girls tell him to
Brother, I'm scared of you!
His cash flow is low
And he ain't down to throw
But when he shakes that girl-like body on the floor
The girls go (boinggg!!)
Striaght cake boy!
Cake
Straight-up cake boy!  Huh, yeah
I'm workin' out at the gym, a cake boy walks in
And all the girls step to him
And I'm trippin' 'cause I'm hard as nails
And he's lookin' like a smoker from hell
Spandex suit, pink deer-foam boots
And a backpack full of juice
And all the girlies start rubbin' him, and lovin' him
Other cake boys huggin' him
Takin' off his shirt, the cake boy had no guns
So don't throw him up, son
His walkman radio was playin'
(You gotta have cake!) That's what the tape was sayin'
And he was shakin' that thang like a Chubby Checker nightmare
All the homies stare
I don't know what it is, hell -
He was takin' more women than a mall sale!
His spandex stuck right up in the place where the sun don't shine
But the girls don't mind
'Cause that cake boy starts to move
To the old disco groove
And your girlfriend likes that
You may not like that, but that's a fact, black
He likes to roller-skate, skip rocks on lakes
The bourgeois girls want straight-up cake boys
Huh
If your girl likes rhythm and blues, look out
'Cause that cake's in the house
But all singers ain't cake, though
Some stay black, while the others went yellow
Jump on stage like they never seen a ghetto
Singin' falsetto
Sayin' ""Oo, I want your touch
You know I just can't get enough!"" (giggle)
And your girl gets sprung, stickin' out her tongue
And you sittin' like you're dumb 'till the show is done?
Naw, brothers, you gotta roll like this:
Find a woman that wants a man's kiss
'Cause if you don't you're bound to lose your girl
To that cake boy world
'Cause that cake boy'll pull up quick
And say ""Does your man have a body like this?""
And you don't, 'cause you drink much 'brouhah'
Got a body like Buddah
And your game is strong, and your background is raw
Hit the cake boy dead in the jaw
And that cake boy broke down in tears
Now your girl is sho' nuff his
But don't sweat it, 'cause you ain't failin'
Get a 'round-the-way girl, and keep on bailin'
And if you're stuck with one of them stuck-up ducks
Huh, don't press your luck
'Cause she'll leave you for what she enjoys
It ain't a man, it's a straight-up cake boy!
Yeah
Cake boy
Don't lose your girl to one",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-cake-boy-lyrics

Bought crack from the dopeman, and got tossed
Livin on the streets, smoked out
Perfect individual for me to bust out
You can sniff me, or you can puff me
But the girl shoulda known, you can't trust me
She's only 98 pounds and lonely
She calls to her God for help, and that's me
COCAINE, go ahead n' use me, heh heh
Momma won't know you're a junkie
Just put me in your pipe, light and SUCK
*deep inhale* Cluck cluck cluck!
And while you're high, grab a 12 gauge
Jump back on the streets, in a crack rage
The only way out is the sucicide route
Put the gauge at your dome and TAKE IT OUT
Now I'm on the 6 o'clock news
All my movies get the rave reviews
60 Minutes had a special on me
The god called Crack is killin your society
Colombia is where I get picked
I can kill with a 90-10 split

Dope dealers would kill for me
Cause if ya sell me, I help ya live lovely
You want a Porsche?  Move a few ki's
Just remember that your God is me
The task force bum rushed one of my employees
A big score, 23 ki's
Now ya see another dopeman sink
And one young cop on the brink
The cop's thinkin bout pinchin
And alimony checks to his wife for the rent and
Kids, so the profit is slow
And he wants to make his bankroll grow
23 ki's just sittin in the back seat
I can make the best man weak
So the cop hits the streets to sell a little pain
Now the cop has a God
You can call me Cocaine

The only way I can be stopped is with intelligence
And you don't get it, so that's irrelevant
So you die, or else go to jail
And I'm happy as hell
I tried to get a young kid but he just said no
Because of some sports hero
So I entered the hero's house in the form of a line
And let him snort one time
Now he'd dead, cause my dose was pure
Got him too quick for the cure
So the headlines read, ""Dope Made Another Hit""
*sniff* Dead on the first sniff
Now the kid is lookin for another hero
I let him know the other fool was a zero
He hits the streets, lookin for a remedy
They introduce him to me
I don't need another junky, just a flunky
Besides, the little punk was spunky
So I put him in a fresh pair o' Dickies
Give him a beeper, and let him terrorize the city
Put him in a gang, teach him to slang
Another young punk deep in the game
He'll be lucky if he lives til' 18
And I'm his new God
You can call me Cocaine

Big long starters, black low tops

All the girls start pointin' at my hat
'N I'm a giggle wit' 'em, cause I just wanna get wit' 'em
I don't hit 'em, I just wanna stick 'em
So I pull baby girl to the side
She said she likes my car
I said take a ride
So we flipped up the doors on the Contach
But gettin' in a Lamborghini is hard
So I grabbed baby girl by the rear end
I thought she might need help gettin' in

Love to get freaky on the gloomiest nights

I got childhood scars in the streets of my life
Girls laughed, now they beggin' to be Mix-A-Lot's wife
The new breed is here, vigilante's of rap
Got eyes like fire, with my boys at my back
Now I'm back for revenge, all the rumors must end
Freaky breathin' is out, bold music is in
I lot of dummies gettin' money, just by clappin' their hands
Not the style or desire of a true Iron Man
(You know what I wanna hear)

A southside broola don't drink coolers
Big money maker, not a dumb drug user
It's real not drama, hate pet llamas
Met Clint Eastwood, slapped his momma
Billboard thriller, 
Avenue chiller
Hard rock lover, and soft rock killer
Girls in the house, watch your blouse
I'm the man your momma was warnin' you about
The bad boy of rap, givin' no slack
Talk behind my back, and you might get slapped
You might get paid, but your metal ain't real
Your rock's like mush, this rock's like steel

(uh, everybody now, *chanting*)

A big ego crushin', MC's fussin'
More lines in my face than a sunburned Russian
Hardly ever speakin', girl's be tweakin'
Buggin' off the drums, cause the snare be peakin'
World's most hated, too bad to be rated
Makin' you mad and I'm elated
Beat syncopater, your bad I'm greater
Tougher than Schwarzenegger in ""Terminator""
Guitar cord ripper, Perrier sipper
Transform scratchin' and not a needle skipper
Flesh like steel, MC's kneel
Mickey D's Shrimp Salad not part a my meal
Heavy drum hitter, can't stand kidders
Hate boss metal and I'm not a bullshitter
Girlies wanna kiss, suckers throw a fist
A lot of rappers try to rap, but it ain't like this

Ha haha ha, the true Iron Man of rap droppin' this big metal hammer
(*voice yelling over Sir Mix-A-Lot*)
Now that's true metal, posse up, yeah",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-iron-man-lyrics
Testarossa,Mack Daddy,1992.0,"I'm your Testarossa. First gear
Watch me go, keep 'em in fear
Rumble, young man rumble
Brother won't fumble, muthafukas just crumble
Gaskets crank, rappers get spank
Stripes get yank, a superior rank
Won't stop the jock in some American car use a lyrical radar
But I'm rolling, the cartel's tolling
For the D's keep folding
Most Cadillac rappers get look and disturb
By the jet black blur
Me, the Testarosa running like it suppose ta
Don't try to get closer
Cause you might get lost in the dual exhaust
Don't ever try to fuck wit' a boss
High octane there ain't no ping
When I swing on a lyrical speed king
And that's just first gear, listen for the upshift
Who can get wit' this
I'm your Testarossa
Second gear, look it here queer
I'm in here, hitting like spears
The rhyme cartel slings legalized dope
Some cope, others get (gunshot noises)
Lost on the boss, it's finish is flawless
12 cylinders listen to the horses
It accelerates smooth
Move or else get move
Run for cover my brother, suckers are getting smothered
The clutter you others mutter is rammed in the gutter
My rep is kept, muthafukas must step
The best get swept and let out to rest
Huuuu, look at that air intake
Second gear, passing fakes
Revolution per lyric get higher
How can I chill when my rhyme's on fire
As I approach the end of my tach
My lyrical horse power blows to the max
Red line is reached to the peak of my speech
And I told ya, I'm your Testarossa
Testarossa
Gear number three, get off the clutch and don't let 'em up
Keep 'em all down on these young bucks
Let 'em know big boss is just a bit quicker
Get the picture
Backtalk tolerated none, son
Left you at the gun when I hit gear one
Now I'm in third and you think that's quick
Huh, wait till I hit fifth
Me and my pack, we keep plenty of snackpacks
You said fat now I'm yo to the max
Want Mix-A-Lot for your next attack
Hey, yo, critical mass, yea, I got your gat
Two hundred sixty pounds of pure pain
Critical mass is my homeboy's name
My personal trainer, taking weight gainer
Got the bulk to crush and contain ya
On the tach, I'm like a wind ax
Cutting up air like Boeings aircraft
Time to shift and let my lyrical seatbelt hold ya
I'm your Testarossa
Up to fourth gear, the speed increase
Police got beef wit the word chief
Move or lose, I excuse the wack dudes
You light my fuse and clear out or get used
I go 100 in a 55
No need to lip synch, I'm straight out live
So I'm rough lust who wanna be tough
You fuss and cuss wearing that Raider's stuff
Fake fools from around the way
Knowing damn well, you ain't from LA
Ashamed where you come from son, so you rattle
Like it or not, I scream straight up Seattle
Rip up streets wit a lyrical sweet
Don't peep or creep or you lose your freak
The cam's growl, engine loud
My tongue keep beating 'em down
Rev it up, get ready for fifth
Just hit 'em wit a maximum dis
I roll ya, fold ya, mold ya, I told ya I control ya
And I'm your Testarossa
I'm your Testarossa
Yo Punish, show 'em what time it is
Gear number five, you're eyes get wide
So realize that I survive and I rhyme for mine
I rope the dope and is he coming up, nope
I ain't the joke so don't hope for my throat
There it is, the whiz gets his
The word quiz is what it is and Mix don't give
Sight to the wack who act like Max
And try to jack a pop rap to hit the map
That ain't like me, it ain't cool
To rob another fool them claim you rule
You boot but not me, troops, you like juice
So you hit the stage wearing my boots
Uh ,uh cupcake, I ain't about to get rape by fake
Just look at the tail light shrink and then think
How I left you pink in a lyrical kink
Time to drop to my gears and then stop
'Cause I lock the box on them clowns that jock
Turbo cone is 230 up on ya
I'm your Testarossa",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-testarossa-lyrics
Hip Hop Soldier,Swass,1988.0,"I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier
All you wannabe gangstas, drivin' Volkswagons
Chillin' at the high schools, broke but braggin'
Under educated, your style is dated
You talk behind my back and your rope's gold-plated
But I'm back to take revenge, my beef will never end
I'll tear your midsection, 'til your body start to bend
Like a pistol, I'm a smokin'
I'm crushin', not jokin'
Whippin' sissies for a past time, and no I'm never chokin'
I blow away suckers with the flicker of my index
Not brass monkey, it's a natural reflex
Cold ghetto tactics, makin' suckers holla
A vicious motherfucker with a rope around my collar
I carry lots a cash, I whip a sucker's ass
I drive a big Caddy, and I pull the trigger fast
Down at Arnold's on the Ave, I fight 'til the death
I let you sock me in my chest, and then I break your damn neck
I got the cold beats rippin', your needle's not skippin'
So many damn weapons that the military's trippin'
People in Seattle hate me, cause I'm not like a hood
But you rock heads wish that you could
Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier
Now let's get one thing straight, my weapons are great
You 22 automatic suckers are late
Got a quarter Moon clip, and a Smith and Wesson
I'm about to give you roody-poos a cold gun lesson
I'm the wizard of mayhem, master of destruction
Got a 44 mag, with the blunt instructions
Page 1 says open, page 2 says fill
Page 3 says cock, page 4 says kill
A mini 14, full combat dress
A thirty round clip, and I ain't takin' no mess
Cause I'm a rough agressor, a camouflage dresser
My M16 has a flash suppressor
My Sterling mark six , it's funny but it hits
It looks sideways but the sucker will kick
I pack of dangerous beretta, kinda small but its good
Some of you wannabes wish that you could
Be a hip hop soldier
I'm a hip hop soldier
Now I'm about to get go, so I better clean up
I'm not advocating crime, but you gotta get tough
I don't believe in gun control, the theory is proven
Give a criminal a gun, and your public is losin'
So you gotta fight back, cause the pigs ain't black
No protection in your section, now it's time to act
A 22 won't due, you need rapid fire
I’m an ammo collector not a dumb gun buyer
Big battle rifles, can make a suckers day
You mess around with Mix-a-lot, you might get blown away
Wearin' 5 gold rings, never intimidated
In Seattle they are jealous, cause a brother has made it
But they don't mess with me, cause they might get Iced
I'm not a gang rapper, I don't like to get knifed
The devil made me do it, and I wannabe good
Don't you roody-poos wish that you could
Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm runnin' hollow point bullets, in my 38
So if you plan to get ill, you better stay in your place
Cause I'm not a game player, I'm just a rhyme sayer
My vigilante group includes my mayor
I pack two uzis cause they stop all crime
You might get yours, but don't let me get mine
I never beat woman, romance is better
If a freak wants to leave, boy you might as well let her
West coast rappers we all bust hard
When we chillin' on the set, we never need a bodyguard
People in Seattle hate me, cause I'm not like a hood
Some of you wannabes wish that you could
Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-hip-hop-soldier-lyrics
The (Peek-A-Boo) Game,Seminar,1989.0,"(Peek a boo)
This is the true story about a young lady I know
(Peek a boo)
A walkin' zombie, product of the system
(Peek a boo)
Now she's play a game by her own rules
(Peek a boo)
The peak a boo game

Deceptive, her game is in the thick lane
Pick up tips, while you cause some pain
Hundred dollar bills, pot bellies on the prowl
Pick up your shirt to work is fly but foul
A nympho, I don't know but she can dance though
Start the show her system says go
Naked on the stage but lovin' the pay
Peek a boo is the game, the pure never play

(Peek a boo) The peep show
(Peek a boo)
(Peek a boo)
(Peek a boo)

She's seventeen, but claims to be eighteen
Boss on the tip in the back they do the wild thing
Sayin' please won't get this sleaze to skease
Goes this skease only G's for fees
Only works late, downtown 1st and Pike
Yours for the night, if the money's right
She's a stripper, an Avenol sipper
Down with the zipper, cause nobody wants to kiss her
She's the peek a boo pro, yeah you know
Sportin' high heels and swimsuits, dancin' at the strip show
Used to have a real name now they call her Cocoa
Cocoa went loco so they paid to see her solo
Dancin' on the stage, crowd's a rage
They fill up the garter belt to keep the girl paid
It's a trip cause the girl's clockin' dollars with her hips
Like a ape doin' flips for gratuity tips
Such a shame she's lookin' up the deep throat fame
A porno queen with a plastic name
Hot black babes meet chocolate men
That's the peek a boo game and you know the end

(Peek a boo) - 4X

Girls, girls, girls flesh for sale
But you ain't worried cause your pimp puts up the bail
That's the game, table dancin' led to prostitution
Payin' some punk to avoid prosecution
Sleepin' with cops, chasin' jocks
Twenty dollars a knock, now your smokin' the rock
You started out topless, but tricks want the bottom
Then the rock man got 'em
Rolled you, sold you, then the punk told you
Get on the strip, get me paid or I'm a fold you
Your sellin' yourself, but you say your just a stripper
Your mother's at home, alone, but you forget her
Never mind, your contemplatin' a suicide
Trippin' on black tar, trapped and you wanna hide
Strippin', but they would get you through college
Girl you know that whacked out game, ain't solid
But you chose it, and you got stuck wit it
Jump on a table for a dollar a minute
Gamble with AIDS when you ramble
But the Mobil's got your mind all scrambled
Bandits, but the song just a canvas
I paint a picture of life, cause some demand this
From here to Japan, freak show for pay
Peek a boo is the game your daughter just might play

(Peek a boo) - 4X

Now your big time, lookin' up to Hoochieoni
Your butt got bigger, your fingernails phony
Dollars for dames it's a game full a sellouts
I know your name, so I'm qualified to yell out
Baby, seventeen wit a child
Strippin' for perverts and drivin' 'em wild
But there's a man in the back, red eyes and a hat
He wants more than a dance, and a sit on the lap
He wants you Cocoa, he's gone crazy
He thinks pain is a pleasure for a lady
Why? Because your dancin' like a bimbo
Touchin' yourself, makin' love to a pencil
He's hot, turned on, wants to beat your brains out
And he'll pay if you let him just plain out
Beat you, like your some kind a pet
And yo wit it Cocoa, did you forget?
There's a killer on the loose, nickname Green River
Creative with the knife and a young girl's liver
Elusive, smooth, never been spotted
Lookin' for a girl with a Jones and you got it
Cash, the root of your sin
Opportunity knocked but you were never in
But now it's over Cocoa, forever you will sleep
It off, it all started when your father took a peek

A Rapper’s Reputation,Mack Daddy,1992.0,"I'm rollin' in a Nine-Oh van
California, that's my plan
Got memories Mix-a-lot left in limbo
First stop Sacramento
Here we go, hit a club called Bentley's
Want a skirt to git wit' me, hit me
There's a girl with a back like a Cadillac
I walked up and got pushed back
Her boyfriend tell her I'm a play-a
Dropped salt on a dope rhyme say-a
My reputation offends this man
Next day hit William Land Park
Creepin' like a shark
Spot a bad freak and I swoop like a hawk
""What up?"", ""Howya like to roll wit' a champ?""
""Please! All ya'll rappers is tramps""
My reputation is stoppin' my mission
Every freak in Sac is dissin'
Back on the four lane freeway
Next stop, the two-one-three, L.A
The two-one-three is rough
But the Mix-a-lot game is tough
Spot a young girl and I start that gamin'
Baby girl asks what set am I claimin'
""Just cuz I rap, I gotta be in gang?""
It ain't a black thang, it's a rap thang
Censorship is sweepin' the nation
Messin' up a rap stars reputation
A rappers reputation, that's what I got
I got a rapper's reputation
So I'm finished with the two-one-three
I knock, baby, but it's time to leave
Two days on the hard rock, boys is cruisin'
Interstate Ten, straight to Houston
They tell me 'bout the girls in the fifth ward
You know the boys must score
So we hit a fly club called Guchies
Lookin' for the skirts with the largest booties
Girlies in the club wasn't takin' no shorts
Showin' no remorse
For a brother like Mix, lookin' for the smooth
Didn't need a Houston skirt to get with me
But the nights still young
And the hunk ain't done
So we stepped to the van
Attitude's out of it
The next club, The Main Event
We never think about a dress code
Just step up in the club and let the game roll
But as soon as my boy Maharaji pulls up
Some punk starts runnin' up
He said you don't wanna be with a rap star
They play you for your money and your car
Well my boy got crushed but the girl stepped off
With a rap stars rep, the girls are lost
""Hey yo, what's up, this is Mix I had to make a run
Right quick, but leave your name and number 'n I'll
Getcha right back, peace.""
So the posse left Houston Texas
All the girls keep callin' us sexist
Houston media is givin' us rappers no pity
So we all hit Kansas City
In K.C. we go The Gates and Suns
Gotta get grub 'fore we run
Met a little freak named Stacy
I said I'm not just here for the Barbecue baby
She gave me that look, like Pebbles
I'm acked with bass not treble
So I say, Oogley-goo oogley-doo-goo-doo
""What'd you say?"" I ain't tellin' you
You see the Mix game is laced with riddles
It ain't Monie, it's Mix in the middle
In walked my ex named Wendy
She got a fresh Dooney Bag
Cause she's tired of Fendi
Oooh, could a brother be busted
Because Wendy trusted, Me?
An' ah told a lit'l lie 'n
Said I was a loyal guy
Wendy got mad and she wants to dis me
In Kansas City
Wendy starts to groovin'
Hands on her hips and her hair starts movin'
She said the Mix-a-lotgame is phony
Just cause I said I'm runnin' girls like ponies
But talkin' that stuff is my occupation
That's how I got this reputation
A rappers reputation, got a rappers reputation
Bring it on down. A rappers reputation, bring it back
A rappers reputation, that's what I got. A rappers
Reputation, peace",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-a-rappers-reputation-lyrics

And don't say I didn't warn ya
Go down to the beach
See the girls in bikini's
Wonder why you don't see me, brothers (Yeah)
Should I preach (Preach, preach)
Awreit, back to the beach
A O.G. from the hood
Went down to the beach but his game was weak
Met a sweet thing named Yolanda
She had the go mo-mo's on her brand new Honda
So my boy stepped up with a gangsta pitch
Better come on an' get wit' dis
A forty-dog in his hand and he's saggin'
But pretty soon the cat's goan tag him
Later that night, Yolanda got busy in the back
Of his big black Cadillac
The next day, the O.G. wasn't playin' no ball
Cause he took her to the mall
Buyin' everything from skirts to boots
Oh, speakin' a boots, yeah he knocked 'er boots
But in the end another fool got jack
Cause he was sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat, check it out
There's a brother named Dave in a Corvette
Had a job at the U.P.S
I ain't dissin' cause U.P.S. pays money
But Dave wants to kick it with the honeys, huh
He shoulda got 'em a girl 'n' settle down
But Dave wants to get around
Put the top down on the 'vette
Hit the south side of Seattle
Lookin' for sex
Got a full pack of Seagrams under the seat
And boom, there it is...three freaks
Thick, walkin' with a natural switch
And Dave starts getting that itch, huh
You know a 'vettes only got two seats
But Dave wasn't listening to me
All three of them jumped in the car
Hit Red Lobster and went straight to the bar
But them drinks ain't cheap out there son
Five dollars for one of them daiquiris
And Dave was treatin'
And the girls was sure 'nuff eatin'
Two hundred dollars worth of fish
And Dave wants to make a little wish
A little something that he'd seen in a porno movie
Play BBD and said do me
At Daves house they left him in a cold sweat
He gave 'em the keys to the 'vette
Ooh, that's the wrong move, black
You must be sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat
Old girl named Joyce tried to put that cat on me two weeks ago
You mean she DID put that cat on you, you're talkin' to
Attitude, be straight with me man
I'm cruisin incognito
850i with the smoked out windows
An' I'm thinkin' I'm raw
When it comes to girls I done seen it all
Then along came a girl named Joyce
She had a black Corniche Rolls Royce
At the stop sign she did something with her tongue
Could Mix be sprung?
Her cat was calling me
And I started rolling slowly
Pulled up to the bumper
Cause I wants to thump her
So she pulls up into Texaco
And I roll up slow and jump in the Rolls
Now I'm checkin' out the body
This hotty gotta body 'n' I wanna get naughty
Followed her to the motel
Yes, motel, I'm too cheap for a hotel
Room deuce deuce deuce and it's time to get loose
I dipped in the juice
So what's up with the Rolls
Checked the registration
And the Rolls was stole
Baby girl tried to break with my keys and gat
But I ain't sprung on the cat
Don't pet the cat, if you just met the cat
If you're sprung on the cat
You might as well eat the cat
Sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat

Something About My Benzo,Seminar,1989.0,"Tell y'all what I'm rollin
There's something about my Benzo with tinted windows
It's kinda slick, not made for bimbos
Cruisin down the street with this gip on my hood
I'm gettin points like a Benzo should
I said ""yo skeeze you lookin for the flesh?
You wanna ride, better dust off your dress""
I ain't dissin you . . . skeeze
But my Benzo's the ultimate tease
Walk into the Spectrum, some suckers wanna kick my rectum
Got up in my face, tellin me I was deaf
I slapped the boy cause he had bad breaf
Looked down at his rope, I saw ""V"" and a ""W""
What you tryin do, you dumb brother you
Call yourself a baller in a Volkswagen?
You better hush homes and squash that braggin

There's something about my Benzo
(Haha, yeah)
(Let's roll on top of these girlies)
(You know what's up)
(Mind if I be broke but ..)

Shut up Ron, it's the way I gotta do this
You on my tip boy, like Popeye on Brutus
Don't worry home cut I'm still chill
Just kinda twisted off a Benzo peel (ok)
Four door, I likes mine bigger (really)
I stay strapped for them Buffalo niggas (me too)
(*voice with accent*) ""Get these seats man they're two-tone""
I ain't no pimp but I'm ""Bad to the Bone""
Cellular phone in the middle
So many buttons on my dash, it's a riddle
Rollin up to Ave., I'm chillin

The kinda car jack artists don't mess with
Yes, my rollouts in effect
It's time to go, too many skirts want sex

(That's what I'm sayin)
(*laughing noises*)
There's something about my Benzo
(Oh yeah, that's right, sing it Mix, sing it)

Bought it in Miami, rode it to Cali
Hit 150, through the Fernando Valley
AMG down with the big gold grill
Tack jumps when it's time to get ill
15-inch woofers, boom in the trunk
""Posse on Broadway"" for maximum bump
Cruise like Deletho, playin my rhyme
Rewind the tape kid, that's the wrong line
Back to the car, automatic on the floor
Points with the skirts bought a Benzo, scores
Whole gold shot, that includes gold mirrors
The wipers on my lights make the word a bit clearer
Whip, dip, munchin barbeque chips
Honking at gimps as they flip for the tip
Roll up on baby I said ""aight, a-a aight""
Some old player riffin of big old players day
Baby dropped her vanity workin that makeup
Wavin at her friends, thinkin she's a taker
But I let it slide
You use me for the ride, I use you for the hide
You know whats up, that's the way the game rolls
Use me I use you, and so the story goes
Ho pimpin on pimpin, the chant the homies scream
Bring them skirts to the Benzo king

A ha haha, yeah
Just something about my Benzo

Not just one, I got three
I collect 'em you see
SEL, a 190, and a SEC
I ain't no dope man Mr. Lolly jump on TV tryin to diss
Brothers like you hate to see black success when it's legit
But it's real, check the latest Vibe
16x9s in the rear to make it fly
CD, cassette, big amps make it rock
Turn that AC off, girl, it's a drop top
SEC, hog of hogs
Hit the funky street lights when I'm rollin in the fog
Cruisin at a 100 when I spotted this car
It was a trap .. they call it radar
State Trooper in a 5.0
Will he catch my SEC, now you know
Gunnin 130 on the outskirts of Seattle
Ha, that's the end of that battle

Yeah, I wanna say what's up to all you brothers rollin in Benzos

Metal in the front, big stomp, crush neck
Punks on tip, call the boots, GoreTex
Laugh if you want, but you might get crushed
Walk through the dangerous Hilltop brush
Bullet-proof, steel-toed, down to kick butt
Roughing up characters who drop weak cuts
One twenty five was the price tag on 'em
Cool brothers buy 'em, even though they don't want 'em
Style is a must, but the style is rough
China Beach boots couldn't crush more stuff
Strap 'em down, lace 'em up, get in the bucket
Reach for the tongue, pull it out, then tuck it

Oliver North receives community service hours
For selling weapons to known terrorists
Tawana was brutally raped, but two fools said she did it to herself
A six hundred million dollar stealth bomber fails to fly successfully
And you say I should be proud of this song
Think about it AMERICA!

I'm living like hell in a world of death
Protectors of the people wear bullet-proof vests
Your little nephew, flipped him a Uzi
Took to the streets, shot em up and then ""Who me?""
Locked in a trunk by Republican villains
Pinstripe suits, experts at killin
Civil war, but some want out
Trapped in a box called the ghetto we shout
Headin for the strip cuz the squares ain't hip
Sell a couple keys, make the home boys trip
The president is a dope man's friend
The governments strong but the dope got in
Punish the accused, but the trial was short
A black man's dogged in a all white court
The jury dismissed, prosecutor says, ""Can em""
Now I'm ashamed of my national anthem

The pentagon had a plan for a rescue
They said intelligence never makes miscues
The thirty-first was a day of death
Lieutenant Colonel Higgins, you know the rest
No negotions with a terrorist force
But Iran's still buzzin' offa Oliver North
The Ayatollah's dead but the hearts not gone
The burning of the flag in Iran goes on
Anti-American, we're loved by few
We pay big money to the ones that do
The christian militia, they give us big knowledge
But the pentagon messed up and wouldn't acknowledge
Ollie took orders from the number one man
But the crap hit the fan and superiors ran
Democrats tripped, the committee said can em
Now I'm ashamed of my national anthem

Am I a communist? No. But my brain ain't slow
Not long ago, Mix-a-Lot was po'
Never helped out by the ones with clout
I was mad at the world cause I felt left out
Stealin hub caps, stereos, anything to get paid
I realize I'm a modern day slave
Posse downtown, the sight was set
I saw my home boys mother with a buggy and a bag
People walk by, laughin at poverty
I looked in her face and I soon saw me
College educated, but she can't get a job
The american dream once again got robbed
Vietnam vets on the street, that's a shame
Fight for the man, and the man plays games
Dogged by the hippies, dope smokin' critics
You blame it on the soldier, but your government did it
My national anthem
My national anthem
You gonna teach me now about the care and feedin of politicians

Bolivia, Columbia, the CIA
Any similarities, I won't say
But the dope gets in, uncut like P-Funk
Headin over borders in a scent-free trunk
Coffee over dope, but the dog can't sniff it
Remember that lady that was broke, she's widdit
Started with a key, clocked 17 G's
Then got another shipment, pure D
Headin for Brumlen, the money was betta
Rollin in a Porsche, in a cashmere sweater
Crime, revenge, I'm tellin you this
The people that laugh are the people that knows
Her community complained, callin the police
But where was the community when she was in the street
Dope's comin in, it's killin em at random
And I'm ashamed of my national anthem
My national anthem
My national anthem
My national anthem
I'm ashamed of my national anthem",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-national-anthem-lyrics
Lockjaw,Mack Daddy,1992.0,"{Your silence is my trade}
Lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Givin' MCs lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
I'm givin' MCs lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Here we go! Oh no
Another flow show from the young black dynamo
Lockin' up jaws, MCs pause -
No lyrical flaws
Hush, when the boss is talkin'
Lay down gats and get your weak knees walkin'
You ain't allowed to speak cause you've reached your peak
The elite don't get with the weak
Shut up, cause I'm burnin' this cut up
Boy, don't try to run up
Cause I chop up crops
A weak hip-hop boy tried to jock my spot and he flopped
He went down to the concrete ground
I'm a hound when I get down
And I'm back, the mack with a lyrical knack
To pack sacks and never pay tax
And when I leave they diss me
Knowin' they can never get with me
But he who laughs last gets the most cash
And lives the blast past of rap trash
Gone! Left ya, son
Gimme a call when you're done
Your silence is my trade, shut up!
{Your silence is my trade}
2x:
Lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Givin' MCs lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Run, run, run, your time is done, son
Move out for the well-hung young one
And I'm rackin' up stacks of greenbacks -
Dead presidents, black!
Peace to my fans and I love ya
And I got yo' cover
Cause I'm back to please
And cool off the hot MCs
Cause they're runnin' around like ants, tryin' to grab their pants
That shit don't make you dance!
What's this beat doin'?
Leavin' your posse ruined
Stuck my fist in his mouth
Caught him on a whole shout
No pity on the lyrically weak
Face defeat, retreat, but don't speak
Cause I ain't through, fool
And you ain't true to the Mix rules!
You try to flow so you go for what you know
But yo, bro, you ain't the flow pro
(Ohh!) I can't go slow
Gotta grow cause I wanna get mo' dough
Full blown, bad to the bone
And known to get it on with a microphone, homes
Leave my throne alone
I've been to the low zone
Your silence is my trade, shut up!
{Your silence is my trade}
2x:
Lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Givin' MCs lockjaw! (Shut up!) {Your silence is my trade}
Come on, Punish!
Punish!
Your host on the coast is known to boast
And roast most that choose to get close
Put 'em in a lyrical knot
My spot: the #1 slot
But I gotta have beats
When I lyrically de-feat the weak that try to compete
Get 'em up, if you wanna go head-up
What up? Do as I instruct, black
Cause my gat is jack-backed
And lookin' at your baseball hat
I rolled over that mess you stole
And took control, and then broke the mold!
Now here I stand, boss man
The NorthWest tip is where I am
And I'm runnin' this work like dope
Shippin' it in planes, trains and boats
Up the charts I go
Steppin' on toes and throwin' low bolos
My group is large, and hard
No need for a bodyguard
We flex, rippin' off MCs' necks
Run 'em into Critical's pecs
Your silence is my trade, shut up!
2x:
Lockjaw! {Your silence is my trade}
Givin' MCs lockjaw! {Your silence is my trade}

You Can’t Slip,Baby Got Back,UnKnown,"Verse 1:  Sir Mix-a-Lot
You can't slip, 'cause the pimpin' game is not about the sex
You gots to be a businessman to keep them thangs in check
I used to run some call girls and pimp 'em just for fun
But you should see how the gangsters can make us pimps r-r-run!
Back in '82 I used to roll a gold Caddy
Females were my business, you could call me the Mack Daddy
But pimpin' came so easy to me, I didn't have to hit 'em
Roll 'em up to Canada so Johnny's could wit 'em
Show them fake ID's so we could step across the border
We hit the nearest hotel, and like that, I'm takin' orders
Two thousand dollars and she'll make you lose your morals
We must increase the profit if the trick wants to get oral
Rappers like to claim 'bout how they know the pimpin' game
How can you run the ladies when you're only 17?
I speak from experience when I say ""Turn around!""
'Cause I was rollin' heavy 'till one female took me down
She was only 17 but she was lookin' 21
5'9"", street-tough and packin' guns
But I was slippin' 'cause the pimpin' game was soft
Baby took a trick out to the suite so he could toss
911 is flashin' crazy on my pager
I pushed the trunk button and I load the 12 gauge
Back to the 'tel 'cause I'm down to get my mail
Smoke a trick quick if he's beatin' on my female
Kickin' down the door and ain't nobody in the suite
I never let my agents take them tricks out on the street
If I wasn't slippin' then the psycho couldn't kill her
Body found face down, floatin' in the green river
You can't slip!  Not in this pimpin' game, chief!
No no, you can't slip!
You can't slip
Yo E-Dog, tell them what's up with that slangin' and bangin', chief!
Verse 2:  E-Dog (Mix-a-Lot)
You can't slip when you're rollin' through the hood without your strap (Hell
No!)
Especially when your rims are dipped in gold and lookin' phat (Yeah!)
'Cause it's the 1990's and you got to be prepared
Or a nigga like the E'll roll 'em up and keep 'em scared (Huhh??)
High sightin' nigga rollin danks through my set (Don't do it!)
Drops 6-4, gives my homies no respect (None!)
But when we starts the loc'in' up, the fool will start the chokin' up
And bones are gettin' broken up, a jack move! (Give it up!)
A straight jack on a fella with a fat sack
Comin' out missin' when you're slippin' on the fast track (Yeah!)
Came through servin' but you went out gettin' served (Peace!)
Got you for your Daytons then we beat you to the curb (Huh!)
Now it's time to slang them thangs and come up on a grip (Yeah!)
Trade him for some ounces so that I can clock my chips (Get paid!)
Say it's 'bout the dividends and not about the fame (Yep!)
But 'till I let you know, the E-D-O-G is my name (Word.)
So now I'm straight addicted to the jackin' and the slangin'
Cross court saggin' and my flag shows I'm bangin'
But if you think I'm gonna stop this life, well you're wrong!
I don't care about your muscles 'cause my 9 is pluggin' domes (Ha ha!)
So here we go again, another jack in effect (Yeah!)
A candy-painted Blazer chased the driver, make him wreck (Get him!)
And if he tries to run then I just smoke him on the spot
But little do I know, there's a lesson to be taught
The brother pulled an AK and now I'm yellin' ""Mayday!""
*gunshots* (""OH SHIT, HE GOT E-DOG!"") On the concrete I lay!
He walks up slowly, then he looks me in my eye
Barrel to my temple, so I know I'm gonna die!
(Lil' cake-ass gang nigga, you can't jack for these D's!  See ya!)
*gun cocking, shot* (C'mon, let's go, nigga!) *sirens*
(Shouldn't have been a sucka, nigga!) *door closing*
(Punk motherfucker!!  Yeah!) *car skids off*
You can't slip
You can't slip.  Oh, you better pull them pants up, champ.  Huh huh
You can't slip.  Gots to be a gangsta, huh?
Well, you can't slip!
*creepy organ music*
Yeah, a lot of young brothers is constantly tellin' me how they growin'
Well, I'm just tryin' to tell you where you're goin'
You can't slip.  Peace",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-you-cant-slip-lyrics

Kitty cat, kitty cat run, run, run
I'm the dog in the Benz with the big chrome gun
Lookin for a coochie proper
Hot mama, big dog, big game, no drama
Never make babies, can't get rabies
Makin head hit and it's crazy
And when I catch a little kitty lookin oh so tough (hmm)
Bring hot water cause I might get stuck
EW!, while I'mma stop in Cosmo
Cause my lyrical content is gando
Stickin to the mind of the critics
I'm still with it, dogs gotta get it (hey come here buddy)
Bow wow was the sound of the hound with the C town crown
I sniff around 'til I pin cats down
They like to run up trees
But I can bring 'em back down with a jingle of my car keys
Most men is dogs and most dogs is nasty
I can't let a cat run past me
Watch your skirt when your walkin through the mall
Cause I ain't nothin but a nasty dog

(""bow wow"" - repeated and mixed with a dog barking)
(Yeah)

(I ain't nothin) but a nasty dog ...

Woman #1: What you want?
Woman #2: Can Mix come out to play?
Woman #1: Nasty bitch

So I'm back puttin black kitty cats on their backs
Big macks never lag, on wax I'mma low down dog
I just stepped up and other dogs wanna flex up
I ain't tryna be the best rapper, just a big macker
So sit on down and watch the bank stacker
It still ain't easy G
But this dog's a Bentley
So I'mma chase that cat 'til I can't chase no mo'
There she goes in a drop top Rocko
What's up with your car sweetie?
Come on down and jump in the Black-ini
Another brother tryna diss and Mix ain't down
Oh no, hot sauce in my Dog Chow
Another brother can't see me
But he wants to be me
I'm layin these thangs on 'em freely
Now you got fo' fo' chromes, straight layin on your dome
And get your mangy ass on
Back to the kitty, cause she's kinda pretty
I'm couldn't stop lookin at her ta-ta-ta .. face
Me and cat mama rolled into the distant fog
Little did she know I'mma nasty dog
 - w/ ad libs
(old, stinky, rotten, ripe and old DOG)

I'm slingin that game like it ain't jack
She's fat, black cat but she won't look back
Rollin this Viper, tryna entice her
Don't need a front but I likes to
Get me an attitude, fightin over who pulls up
Two dogs in a sports car, playin old cuts
Turned down the James Brown
I said ""what's up girl"" but she still won't turn around
Attitude (what up), attitude (what's up)
When the girls are playin the role and what do we do? (call 'em stuck up)
Now we're both tryna front like we don't care
Whip a U-Turn to get a quick stare
But the face was hurtin (damn)
The girl's grill was tore up, mustache wasn't workin
Grandma old face with a nom ass body
""Mack Daddy"" didn't want this hotty
Flashback to the cryin game
I hate to see any parts of that poon-tang
Usually I'm quick to mack but that's road kill, back it up black
Quiz it, to giz it with the quick hiz its
For zeeze it, tazease it, it's hard for me to leave it
Not sexist, just sexy with my dia-logue
Cause I'mma nasty (*scratching*) (*dog bark*) (snapping and barking and

Old scandalous ass nigga with a pocket full of cash
Who dat? Rollin' in a Viper
Got much beef with the freeway sni-per
He wants me cause I bumped his girlfriend
Your suicidal tendencies are not my problem
Low life DOG, chasin these skirts through the motherfuckin fog
I'm that, black man with fourteen skirts in a black Scadan
A fool named Charles in a 7-6 Cut
Parked at the bench and left his girl on chuck
He said get out the car bitch, that's a mistake
Cause now I'm on the beach with a rake
The whole beach is smellin like indo
I'm in a drop top Benzo on three piece rimzos
Cranked up the bass just a little bit
She turned to the left with the (oooooh shit!)
""Mack Daddy"" is back and Charles is mad (* 2 gunshots *)
Show Charles what I had

Take another girl from a cryin ass man
Always askin her where she's been
She was rollin with me from six through ten (yep)
Got home at ten-thirty
You were smellin her neck, tryin to see if she's dirty
You wanna beat her down, but you got no proof
Now you shootin buckshot through the roof (yep)
To much emotion, somebody rub this sissy boy down with lotion
And now your tellin her to stay home
But she can still call Mix on the telephone
And there you go, slippin
You promised her another ass whippin
And you slap, slap, slap, now you feelin kinda macho
+I Got Game+ and I took your thing so
What you gonna do with a cake boy's nightmare
Bought you a nine but you still looked scared
AK-47? Nope
I run a HK-91 with the Leopold scope
So eat that 308, fool
Actin like a jake but Big Macks rule
You har her in check but boy I shot ya

I meet a girl named Gail at a soul food restaurant
Big fat rocks on her hand tryin flaunt
Tried to step to her in the hall
She said her ex-boyfriend plays pro football
But I hate quarterbacks, but I like throwback
On a young, fine brown skin snackpack
She got a black SL (SL), it was sittin on 19's lookin all swell
I really don't care about your boyfriend sweetness
Jealousy is every man's weakness
But I ain't no salt slinger, just a game slinger
And oh yes it's the bird banger
I followed Gail to the crib
Walked in straight trippin off a how the girl lives
Your man is a trick and his game is weak
I can pull you in a Benzo and a broke down jeep
Take notes off the shit I just wrote
Trick daddies get left in smoke
A lot of copycat niggas might jock ya
But the game came way with the Chief Boot Knocka

The Jack Back,Mack Daddy,1992.0,"""In this country a man's home is his castle..""

I've been jacked by the racist scum, and here I come
Klan, run - cause revenge is fun! And I'm that one
To make you tapdance with a shotgun
On Donahue they said they had weapons
Just to teach black people one lesson
But I ain't goin to your school of fools
So come here, and look at my tools!
You can meet and greet the Glock 19 in your nostrils
I'll splatter your dreams
Plans to overthrow are left in limbo
Cause one loco bro chose to dispose of you
And your skinhead crew
I ain't a house nigga with a twenty-two
I dump a hollow-point slug in your windpipe
Try to breathe {*choking*} believe the hype
Cause this ain't the jungle fool
And I don't throw SPEARS, and I ain't leavin here!
A Nazi and you ain't never SEEN Germany
But you was lookin for a enemy
So you found a young brother with cash
Crashed my glass, snatched my whole stash
Boy I'mma getcha back, like it ain't no thang
Show you what I learned from the gangs
Stack em up deep in a six-nine Deuce
Long range scopes for the whole damn group
Hangin outside a club called Moonshine
Waitin for the right time..
There he is, walkin in the Levi's blue cut
The Wicked One dropped two shots in his butt
I can't solve racism with a gat
But this is where my head's at - get em with a jack back!

""You ask me the niggers around here
Been treated awful bad for a long time..""

I've been sayin this, I gotta fix em
I wanna fix em with a crucifixion
Nail em to a cross and burn em
BURN EM BURN EM BURN EM!
It's been said that this would happen
Skanless skinheads jackin
All up in the crib insult for takin my force
I had to break North
The leader had a spraypaint can
And on my wall wrote, 'Death to the black man'
Burned a cross in front of the hideout
Hopin they could get my race to die out
I'mma cause em PAIN, physical and mental
I speak slowly - through the temple
The Wicked One is talkin trouble
Blastin skulls into pieces of puzzle
Damage em so bad, they can't stop me
Not enough body left to get an autopsy
Skinheads, stakin em out
Bloodshed, takin em out
Caught one of em, Mix said, ""Go ahead""
Thirty-eight, STRAIGHT to his forehead
I hit em hard and it hit the spot
I punish and plot with Mix-a-Lot
Now where's the leader at? Gotta get him back
Gotta get the gat, gotta get the axe
Call it a revengeful murderous pact..
Call it the jack back!

""Some things are worth killing for""

They burned a cross in my yard, caught a brother off guard
But I can't cry, cause I'm HARD!
They jacked another black, but this black wants payback
I rack up killin stats!
Now I'm on the hunt with a 12-gauge pump
Massive hardware's in my trunk
Creepin low.. and slow
There's one - roll down the window
Whassup, FOOL?!! (""Noooooooooo!!"") *buck buck buck*
It ain't done til the punk stops breathin;
Watch Kunta Kinte get even!
It goes like that when a brother stays strapped
Couldn't get a job so I learned to rap
Livin kinda large and the skinheads hate me
Run up in my house and they tried to take me
Now I got the metal to his dome
A Desert Eagle, dipped in chrome
I got a black stocking cap yanked over my face
Anger is takin rationality's place
Hitler's in the house and I'm takin him out
He shouts but the barrel's in his mouth
Before I shoot, he wants to know if I'm white or black
I yank my mask - this has been a jack back!

""These boys were trained activists..""

I'm not a slave but the Ku Klux Klan
And the Aryan Nation say I am!
What's behind the skinheads out to getcha?
The reincarnation of Hitler
Now I got a murderous attitude
I'm in a put em in a casket mood!
Remember the days of slavery?
They hung many black men from a tree
We fought to be free real hard
And the black man's freedom must not be scarred!
Callin me an African Sambo
But after this, ""American Psycho""
And I'll smoke any skinhead racist
With the black Glock that's in my fist
And the morgue'll be packed in body stacks
Memories due to the jack back
Caught the leader of the skinhead clan
You know the one with the spraypaint can
Drilled him with a crowbar {*gargling*} DIE!
In the left ear, out the right eye
Then I took a knife to his chest
Carved a wicked message in a bloody mess
It was a warning for the rest of his pack

Two can play the games in a fantasy thing

Big J Peg, beef strapped to his leg
No strings attached to the ride
Plus they only touch with they feminine side, so why try
But I bought tools from the tools store
I heard the revolutions per minute, can make up for dippin in it
Ain't no shame in my game, you could make to claim

Takin yo money if your game ain't real
Known to keep the ass on proper (proper)
Never gettin tickets from the horny ass coppers
There she go, walkin through the mall
4"" pumps, got her six feet tall
Switchin, I ain't thinkin bout stickin
Lookin like she never seen a kitchen
Just broke up with her boyfriend (boyfriend)
Lookin for a fool with the gripper ends (gripper ends)
Met one, boom, there he is
A rich young brother in showbiz, yeah
Big man, CEO, six-double-o are the letters on his Benzo
Big mack daddy, bad to the bone
But three months later it's on
He done took her to the beach, rubbed her feet
And brought baby girl a new jeep
Now she's gone, you can't buy love without game
The Shuga gotcha, lame!
Sweet Brown Shuga!
 Sweet Brown Shuga!
 Sweet Brown Shuga!
 Sweet Brown Shuga!

She's comin straight outta Encino
Hittin football players for the C-notes (yep)
Pickin em, gettin em, rarely ever kissin em
Takin for the bank and then quittin em
Went to the Raiders game and spotted this
Black quarterback with a big fat contract
Now she's on the visitors' sideline
The mackin is on when the coach calls ""Time""
Quick work, gotta do it slick so
Do it while the Raiders is kickin they field goal
Put the number on the bottom of a cup
Later that night, relaxin
The quarterback's thinkin he's waxin
But naw, the typical line:
 ""I just don't think it's the right time"" 
Ask yourself, who's the mack?
Baby starts buyin money sacks
Cause when the fool got to the next city
Western Union Street got busy
Four Gs a week and now baby got a condo sittin in Redondo
So the quarterback calls cause he wanna get naked
 Disconnected!
I'll tell ya, son, just because you can bench-press
Don't put ya past this test
You got pimped like a straight up sap
Paid money cause you're sprung on the cat
Huh! Bout 35 Gs and now you're through
Never got near the boots
See ya, but I never woulda been ya
Sweet Brown Shuga done went up in ya!
 Sweet Brown Shuga!
 Sweet Brown Shuga!
 Sweet Brown Shuga!

Baby starts goin to the weight room, that's trouble
Addin more curve to the bubble
The rump is pumped, ready for battle
Caught the next plane to Seattle
Welcome to the 206
She's lookin for the brother named Mix
Jumped in a rental car, rolled to the hood
Brown Shuga's up to no good
Got my digits, gave me a call
Have no fear, Mix-a-Lot don't fall
*phone rings on the other line* ""Yeah who dis?""
 ""38-24-38, Mix""
Clipped on my pager, grabbed my cellular
Eeny meeny miny mo and picked the number 8 car
Now I'm rollin in my NSX
Thinkin I'mma get some 
Met her at the Minimart, she was in the Escort
I'm kinda thinkin bout contact sports
When we get back to the Mix house
I'm knockin that kitty cat OUUUUT!
 Sweet Brown Shuga
 Sweet Brown Shuga
 Sweet Brown Shuga
 That's what I call this female!",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-brown-shuga-lyrics
The Boss is Back,Mack Daddy,1992.0,"{Boss}
{Boss}
We have such sights to show you
This isn't for your eyes...
AaaAAAA, the boss is back!
{Boss}
The boss is back!
{Boss}
{Boss}
So I took a one-year hiatus
Ain't nobody heard my latest
You thought Mix-a-Lot was through
But I'm back; this boot's on you
What happened to all the old homies?
When the money gets funny it's lonely
My ex turned into a slut
Down at the Hollywood, slangin' that butt
Cheap perfume and a mini-skirt
Girl, what's your line of work?
Now that I'm rollin', you wanna roll with me
But have you been to the clinic lately?
Yesterday you had six condoms, see
Today you got three
Tossed you out like a paper sack
This brother ain't Sprung On The Cat
What about all the old homies?
I got paid so they call me phony
But I refuse to lay it low
When a brother like you tells me I can't flow?
So here we go, bro, the leader of the Flow Show
Let you know, I roll and get mo'
I yank the bank and I ain't been ganked
Cause my back you're trying to shank, but no thanks!
My face shows pain and strain as I stand in the rain
With this fame, you go insane
The game I run is not fun to some
And now I love no one!
The boss is back!
{Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!} I'm back!
Your boss is back!
{Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!}
{Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!}
Tommy wants revenge
But I want your oxygen
When the game got thick you ran
Now in my face you stand
Beggin' for a few hun?
Son, your fun meets my gun!
Now you scream you're true black
Boy, you need to chill with that!
Cause I'm an e-qual op-por-tu-ni-ty de-stroyer
My gat's my lawyer
Last week you's a stick-up kid
And this week you're in show biz
Standin' on stage, another black wanna-be
Wanna get paid, so you're as balck as you gotta be
Throw up a peace sign, fakin' the rhymes
Run out of lyrics, scratch in a Malcom X line
Hypocrite, your hits break the bits
The boss of brain lays pain when I spit
Criticized, cause I'm takin' the dares
And now you're tryin' to tell another brother what to wear?
Come off that tip, you know how it goes
Another brother gets shot and punks blame it on gold
Gold ropes?  Naw, that ain't your problem
The job of a rapper is to find em and solve em
Now you're crying bout what a brother owns
King died so you could buy your throne
I ain't got time to take steps in reverse
You or the KKK, who's worse?
You told me to stay low in my ghetto
And so did the Klan, so wake up, bro
Why do you think brothers is sellin' dope, fool?
America, boy, the bankroll rules!
Play that hard role and say you ain't with that
And everything you're cryin' bout money on your contract
Talked about me bad, it's time for the payback, black
The boss is back!
{Boss} I'm back
I don't know the meaning of trust
I gotta live so I do what I must
Some girls'll cross you when you're soft
That's why I'm my own damn boss
They'll run you down with stress
If you're spring on the butt and chest
I'd rather be sprung on the ducat
And put another damn freak in my bucket
I deal with women, not girls
Cause them young ones'll shake your world
I got about two or three clowns
That try to kick me when I'm down
But when I come up, they all play dumb
All of a sudden, it's we, not one
I zip up lips when I spit these hits
I'm equipped to make misfits quit
Young bucks should all duck cause jaws are gettin' struck
The luck gets chuched, so wussup!
I ram and cram my jams in the mouth of a man
I'm kickin' quicker than Van Damme
Face the facts, two platinums stack
Step off, fool, or get cracked!
The boss is back!
{Who's the boss?}
I'm back!
{Who's the boss?}
The boss is back!
{Who's the boss?}

No Holds Barred,Mack Daddy,1992.0,"""The police, urge people, to keep their guns locked up and unloaded""
""Congress today, seems on the verge of approving gun control""

It's, time to fight back cause the new jack black macks
Ain't did SHIT about that, whack, jackin
And I'm packin
Cause I'm down for the bank I'm stackin
And in a straight up brawl I'll mall alla y'all
Ya try to crawl for Tylenol and I install
Big fists in your face, the blow is well placed
Spray 'em with mace in case mace is his taste
Throw up the dogs, the competition is fogged
Cause he was smokin the yang, iced and drink the 8-ball
Drunk, stumblin, threw him with the lean
I sweep him, then attack the spleen
Play the congas on his backbone
He's funk baritone until I twisted his dome
Creep up on my house and try to roll me up?
And got STUCK IN THE GUT with a black, Glock
And he starts to wobble
Self-defense is what I'm claimin, let's squabble
I pick up a pipe to take plenty of quick swipes
One grazed his dome and sliced his eye whites
I don't give a DAMN bout a stupid ass burgular
It's all circular
The dope dealer sells dope to the dope smoker
The smoker breaks in and tries to choke ya
But I ain't the one to run from ya son
This is MY HOUSE, and it's FULLA GUNS!
I'm down for mine and my choke is nice and hard
When you jack the boss there ain't no holds barred!
No holds barred
No holds barred
No holds barred

I'm crushin most hoods like Katie-dids(?)
I'm pleadin guilty for the damage I did
This ain't about random violence
The (?) crept into my house, FUCK SILENCE
Now most punks wanna run for the stun gun
Fuck a stun gun, I got the big one
Forty-four mag, automatic, CHROME
Mercury-tipped bullets, melt the dome
It's the 1990's, and crack is
Talkin to the criminals, ever so subliminal
Some crackhead wants Mix-A-Lot dead
A jack move instead, another fool bled
I can't cry cause my tears are nearly froze
My interior's cold, it posess my soul
I'm on the paranoid tip
And each of my socks got a clip!
When my house got robbed, a top notch job
Cops laughed while my mom just sobbed
9-1-1 only works for the rich ones
So I collect GUNS!
So step right through if you're down for the wrong move
Most crews are moved by my twelve gauge BOOM!
How can I love when I gotta
Protect my neck from a punk suspect?
Gun control - I ain't wit it
They banned the AK and any fool can STILL get it
The innocent have been beaten, bruised and scarred
But for this citizen, there ain't no holds barred
""It is an absolute infringement on my second amendment rights""
No holds barred
""When is this attack on gun owners going to end?""
No holds barred
""Education, versus restriction""

Hypothetical situation
Gun control starts sweepin the nation
Now you got a bunch of unarmed innocent victims
Gettin FUCKED by the system
Sittin at home with a butter knife, huh
Any fool could rape your wife
So what's up when the criminals can't be stopped?
The only one with guns are the COPS
But it's hard for a brother to trust police
Huh, so the shit don't cease
So I go downtown to buy a hot gun
I hated criminals, and now I'm one
Because I bought a gat to protect my house
The cops wanna bust me out?
So it's illegal to protect yourself?
Hell, you either get killed, or you in jail
So when you vote
You better think about what I just wrote
And FUCK writin a note to yo' Congressman!
You got the fool hired
Now help get the fool fired
A scary scenario
And I put it in your stereo
So when a fool tries to run up on my car
R.I.P., no holds barred
No holds barred
No holds barred
""They take aim, at the law abiding citizen, instead of the criminal""

You don't even know me
Well go ahead and get 'em up busta
Come on with it . . . Wahaa!

Y'all bustas just don't know
Y'all can't get with the Mix-A-Lot show
The man you love to hate ain't phased by the fakes
If you want to playa hate
Eat a big 'ole snake
(chorus #2: repeat 4X)
It's The Man You Love 2 Hate
The J.R. Ewing of Seattle

Me and Kid Sensation with that home away from home
In the fat butt dulie with the painted out chrome
15's whippin' in the backside
With the boom boom boom thats how I ride
And Cha Ching I'm a player making ballas holla
I got a girl in Mississippi, but I never call her
Cause it's like that I still got game
I can memorize your number, but I still don't know your name
The conservatives are thinking I'm a pimp (I'm a pimp)
Just because I kind of stroll with a limp (With a limp)
But I still got love for the few who stayed down
But some of my ex's ain't around
Why is that ??
Cause the rock man got them and their butt's just dropped
They started losing weight
Their grill's looking shot
So I switched her
I'm steadily keepin' 'em mixed up
I'm keeping, down and holding my crown and giving them hiccupps
Boo-Hooing (Boo-Hooing)
When you call me
But we was playing on each other so you are wrong, see
Sitting around anti-nails
Your disputing my sales
Fantasizing 'bout counting my mail
(chorus # 2) ( Repeat x4)

Lady listen, Do I really make your man that pissed ?? ( mmm-hmmm)
Flipped it around and tell your man like this (mmm-hmmm)
If you hate Mix, than why you talk about Mix ?
You say you ain't a trick, but you trippin' so she's splittin'
Now she's coming out to Mrs. Ponderosa
She drove a beater so I heard her getting closer
She got an old V-Dub (Volkswagen) with the damaged exaust
But she was fine, so I figured I could toss
And watch the 808 kick drum
Makes this girlie get dumb
She's grabbing on my bum tryin' to get one
And I'm taxing, waxing, I gotta take a note
Frrrtttt!!! Farted on the downstroke (ewwwwweeww)
Playa's in the house can you feel me
Got these playahaters lookin' at me silly
But with this mouthpiece a brother's gotta win
The ladies say you are fine, but your mackin' is kind of thin
No more Broadway, I'm hollering Rainier
Swoop around blocks dropping windows yelling, ""Come Here""
And you complain 'cause I mad a little change
Its all in the game, boy to hell with the fame
(Chorus #2) Repeat x4 Then falls into Chorus #1 (1x)

I got my buck on them rolling down to Cali
I got a brand new home out in the valley
Jumping off  I-5
I crack a left-eye, got to pick my homey up the attitude adjuster
Seven in a jet black truck with a deaf black G-Lock in case we out of luck
Cause with these haters you gotta keep your strap
Cause we taking all their sugars now they tryin to take us back (Yep)
So you got your and I got mine, so why do you whine about my grind ??
Sitting around blaming Mix-a-Lot for your situation
Boy get a job and quit player hatin'
It ain't about winning your respect
I'm just checking more mail than you check
So heres the finger next to my index
I'm all about your lady
Cause she's all abou the sizex (sex) haha

And it don't stop, cause a brother went pop
And I got a couple knots in my sock
One dough, one Glock
And I got me a cutie, buckin this 1992 Goolie
Will I come booty, who me
I thought you knew me
You come to the Boulevard newly
Take a look at this truck, got 'em sittin on stuck
Drop down to the ground, with them big sounds
Four twelves in the back, 'til the windshield cracks
Like that, with a fat bass track
And I love my horse, he try to ignore me
Scratch my back and you'll force me to dump
Dump, dump, dump, put 'em on stunt
And drive my horse into the sun

Buckin my horse, giddy up, hey yo, hey

When I want cause I got my cabbage like that
You know what I'm sayin?
Keep player hatin and watch the ass drop
(*car door slams and tires skid*)

I gotta get an Impala, pina colada
White cause the gold one's nada
Get the coke white seats, fill 'em up with heat
Six three with the bows on feet
Peanut butter top to match the guts
Droppin that butt, got 'em all sayin ""what!""
Yellow back with a profile, what's up now
Gotta give me ten points on style
And the paint ain't trippin, drippin
Look at this dippin, never caught slippin or missin
And in case you was doubtin my pimpin (what up fool)
My kitten, got the pearl white scopes to match my paint coat
Giddy up, here we go
Back to the Boulevard, rush with the horse to the test
I'mma park this next to the best
And flex like I'm poster, rollin this roaster
Hoein this holster, closer
Cause I'mma boaster, roaster, red light toaster
No remorse when I buck this horse

In a brand new horsie, call it my Porschey
Lookin hella fly and bossy
Sittin at a red light waitin, Porsche's shakin
Talkin more mess than Payton
And I got it in first, gettin ready for the worst
One point two turbo burst
Let it ride like a black tech
Bettin I'm gettin my sex while I'm passin up bets
Grab my horse by the reins and tame it
Watch where I aim it, so I don't flame it
I can't explain the insane left lane
Swing to the right, it's pain
Pass these busters, lookin like lusters
Sittin three deep in a dark blue Duster
Now I'm sittin on cruise tryna get my food
Eggs and number 102 and then popo spots me
The guys still watch me, big man needs teriyaki

Cause my white Gambala has no door handles
Gotta get met with force

Rippn’ (Original Version),Swass,1988.0,"I... Got a real fine freak with a real big butt
She gets real ill when she hears my cuts
Got two Cadillacs, one blue one gold
Got straps on the back with a 
fresh set of Vogues
Wheel in the back with a grill in the front
24-k strap on my trunk
Got a big gold rope cold laying on my neck
Got my freak in my arm cold kicking on set
Never get ill cause I'm too damn swass
Got a funky Trans-Am with a dual exhaust
T-town is live but Seattle is my home
Hood ornament is gold cause I don't like chrome

Suckas  cause they cannot hang
But you got to have a brain in the computerized game
You're getting jealous cause your girl wants to play my song
You know you want to hear it, put the record back on

(Here in my car) Big Cadillac
(Here in my car) Bass in the back

I'm... I'm a real estate investor, hardcore dresser
Money counting brother and I hate polyester
Walking in my Gore-Tex steppin on 
Steel toed boots hate to do it like that
Cruise Broadway on my cellular phone
Spend a hundred thousand dollars on my number two home
Dog in the front yard, fence in the back
Ex-girl getting mad cause my paycheck's fat

That's rippn'

Rolling in my IROC kicking my beat
With my girl by my side looking oh so sweet
Gore-Tex on my feet, gold rope for my neck
Cold carry cash and I never write checks
Bankroll so big I can hardly hold it
You once had a dream that your grandma stole it
Punched her in the eye took my bank back
You ever wonder why I'm like that

Cause I'm rippn'

Yeah... You like this beat but it's time to change
Not gonna get ill but I'm gonna get strange
Push your partner throw 'em in the aisle
Gonna kick it live with the square dance style
I'm a ripping motherfucker that's my last name
When I pull tip freaks go insane
Benz on the left with a Caddy on the right
Gore-Tex in effect with my freaks tonight
Sucker on tip tried to get up in my face
Steel-toed rambo put the sucker in his place
Seven days a week I'm on vacation
Let's get live with the Kid Sensation
Ichi Ni San Shi
Ichi Ni San Shi
Ichi Ni San Shi
Ichi Ni San Shi

Now... It's time to get illin' just one more time
Kid Sensation with a hardcore rhyme
Freaks on my tip cause my muscles are rip
Keep the girlies coming with my bullwhip
All sucker DJ's I will swat
Cold ill hip-hoppin' with Mix-A-Lot
I rock this poem and the girls are sprung
Cause I'm ripping that scale seventeen years young

That's rippn'

Rolling down the avenue picking up points
I like to count bank but I don't roll joints
I'm a hardcore b-boy sitting on a throne
Always hanging on the ave, cold grabbing that bone
Girlies in Cal like to feel my beat
Great big Gore-Tex get more freaks
Some sucker MC's say they can't feel it
But I bet you'd be happy if I let you steal it

That's rippn'

Freaks get your hands high in the air
The big bass drum gonna press your hair
We're ripping hip-hoppers on the hip-hop set
Saying rhyme after rhyme and still don't sweat
Paralyzing perpetrators, punching out punks
Got a funky sound that's a sure slam dunk
Funky fresh dressing never faking like a faker
Ripping it awake is the real big maker

I swore I had protection, got an erection
Must resist temptation
Girls flock, ride my jock

Met a young girl named Angel
She had a big long weave I'd love to mangle
So I'm puttin in work, lovin tight skirts
So you know a mack poppa gotta flirt (woo!)

Look at baby wiggle that big caboose
Got a little tiny waist, everything's in place
I'm pacin, facin the situation
It's on, put it on tape, troop
Got a little sex now I'm sittin on a lawsuit
Nine months later, little baby pops out
Blonde hair, blue eyes, with her feets in her mouth
Well that can't be me (nope)
Cause I'm a nappy haired black man, dressed like a O.G

And I don't sleep with the girls in my group
So Mack Daddy is strollin and patrollin
Big fat bank I'm holdin
Bus pulls up to the mini mart
And that's where Laurie works and my game starts
Laurie knows nothin bout rap though
And that peeled my superstar cap, so
I'll just go back to the basics
And even that game is stiff, baby, face it
So now Laurie and me is headed to the ?monkey dope?
Straight gettin to the ?monkey poke?

I kissed her cheek while Laurie was asleep
Let one more groupie use me (mm)

But I ain't the one to get played the sap (uh-uh)
When I hit the sack, big Richard is capped
Your man's a punk for leavin kids with you
The baby's cute, but don't call me Da Da!

 

Don't call me Da Da!
 


I'm sittin, in Long Beach Cali, eatin Popeyes' chicken
Thinkin bout the next snake charmer I'm hittin
Met a fly skirt, nickname was Kitten
And I start spittin
WhassUP with the brother in the passenger seat?
Homeboy bailed cause his game was weak
And he was callin her bitch, I was callin her baby
He got the finger, I got the lady
Me and Kitten left the place quickened (yep)
Busta, you and cousin Kitten need a stickin
TO THE 'TEL, TO THE 'TEL, TO THE 'TEL WE RUSH
(gasp) The jimmy-hat bust
I start sweatin, conscience bettin
That I'mma have to deal with bed wettin
But I'mma handle this thing like a man
Settle down and bring the kid up, that's the plan
Three weeks later I get this call though
Kitten sounds happy on the telephone
She said ""Go on and live your life, bro
Cause EPT said no,"" so don't call me Da Da!

 

Don't call me Da Da!
 


Don't call me Da Da!
 

Da da!

Don't call me Da Da! I ain't yo daddy, baby!

I Check My Bank,Trespass: Music From the Motion Picture,UnKnown,"I'm peelin off domes with a baseball bat
Forty-four Magnum, choice of gat
Mercury tip fillin up my clip
I can shoot him in the dome or I can get him in the hip
But boom, look at all the niggas runnin out the room
Just another soldier, causin doom
No I don't bang but I like to wound... my enemy
Who is the enemy, I'm glad you asked
Any motherfucker standin in my path
Got a Bentley Turbo, now you wanna jack
But remember, Mack Daddy is strapped
And when you're platinum, niggas start dissin
Record companies think you're missin
But I'm back *clap clap (gunfire)*
I'm back *clap clap (gunfire)*
I'm back and I got a bigger gat *click BOOM*
Now the positive rhymes is onnnn
And I'm positively hittin that dome
You might want mine but you can't get mine
Rather put a hot nine right up in your behind
I'm not the nigga that you wanna recoup
And I don't wear a Giorgio suit
But I'm down for my business so please don't step
You heard about my lawfirm's rep, I check my bank

Straight checkin my bank
""Cash money, cash-cash-cash-cash.... cash money""
In the magazine I look like a dope man
Cause I'm paid, and I'm suckin up to no man
And in the rap game I gets no respect
Cause I'm checkin more bank than the Heat check
Yeah I'm a pimp and my ho is the system
Uncle Sam might think I just dissed him
But nah I'm just pumpin straight facts
You either be a mack, or you get macked
Some of the jealous wanna roll on the boss
But this HK's keepin em tossed
Cause I duck them deuce deuce treys at point blank range
*automatic gunfire* Attitudes get changed
I'm about making these dividends
And every motherfucker ain't my friend
And I check my back when I count my snaps
And niggas that snatch get slapped
Girls wanna roll, that's cool
But I'm not to be played that fool
Some niggas think a brother with money is slippin
But I've be down, so quit trippin
My goal, to increase the size of this bank
I hold, and bring up the brothers whose down
To roll, and keep all the shit under my control
That's how I'm livin, I check my bank

A word to my enemies, I don't drop props
A word to the Klan, I don't pick crops
You can run up with your whip but you'll just run up and get popped
A word to the Tipper, rap won't fall
A word to the bourgeoise, fuck all y'all
A word to Apartheid you bouts to fall
You can kill a couple brothers but you'll never get us all
Straight laced game's what I'm poppin at the new jacks
Mack Daddy niggas like to snatch fat sacks
I used to be nice with my rhymes, and now I drop dimes
*Beastie Boys scratch ""What's the time?""*
It's time to get paid in the nine-two G
Recession never stopped a nigga like me
I'm breakin no laws but I'm livin on edge
Puttin CEO's to bed

It's like sellin dope, but the money ain't bent

...All this ill shit
This fuckin Sir Mix-A-Lot shit
What the fuck is this shit?
See the shit's video?
'PUT IT ON THE GLASS!'
'Put yo TITTIES on the glass'
This is like a pick-up line:
'How you doin?
I was wonderin, could you put yo BIG FUCKIN TITTIES on the glass?'
'No, I don't wanna go to a movie, could you PUT EM ON THE GLASS?!'
'Put your titties on the glass'?!
What happened to 'How ya doin? Whatcha doin later? Let's catch a movie'?
No, 'Put em on the glass'
'Put em on the fuckin glass'
What the fuck is this shit?
The girls got on bikinis - he got a fur coat on
What the fuck is the weather like in Seattle?
( Sir Mix-A-Lot )
All my ex's, eat this one
(You can have her)
( VERSE 1 )
I used to have this girl, let's say her name was Mona
Mona, fine young sugar comin out of Arizona
5 ft. 6 straight thick with a switch
And a set of them juicy-ass lips (Mmh...)
Kinky, just like me
She can take a straight gee
And put him down for the count 1, 2, 3
Needless to say I was kickin it
Cause I know when I'm the only one gettin it
But - ooh, things change when you don't maintain
The same game you got her with, mayn
Flew back home, and I was slippin
Cause as soon as I left, another brother starts spittin
Throwin drag about wantin a family
Tryin to front because he wanna be manly
Tellin my girl how I'm playin the field
Boy, you'se a jake for real
Now a player I like, but you know I can't stand no snitch
Tryin to front like he rich
Done shot your credit, cause you bought you a new E
320, and you wanna be a hoe like me
Now you done salted my game
Told my girl I'm a player, and you bought her a ring
You paid a lotta money just to grab her
I'ma tell you like this, trick: you can have her
(You can have her)
( VERSE 2 )
I gotta do what I gotta do
Baby girl's through, so I need somethin new
You can't keep a good mack down
I get around cause I got a tight thing up in Sea-Town
5'9"" with dimples
Caramel skin, straight fine, hella tight, no pimples
Thinkin my game was concrete
But I gotta watch for them other entertainers and athletes
Especially the ones who wanna settle down
Cause they'll beg and drink out your shoes and get they nose brown
Just the kinda man you wanted, ain't it, honey?
A big buff dumb-ass fool with hella money
Down to spend till his knees bend
Then the athlete's broke and his girl's in the wind
And my girl gets mad, cause I never spend time like I'm s'posed to
Plus I'm a boaster
Shaggin up too damn quick, now she's lookin for a sugar daddy
Just to get a '96 Caddy
A big truck she found
You young scrub on the bench for the Cleveland Browns
He never had nothin, thicker than a cheerleader
Now he got juice, so he eats her
And treats her to a big wad of cash
Too weak, so she left his ass
You can have her
(You can have her)
Just rollin by the Playboy Mansion...
( VERSE 3 )
I got me a, I got me a, I got me a, I got me a
Young bunny, young bunny in La-La Land
Wanna get freaky with the papa man
I smack her to the front, I smack her to the back
I smack it with the whiffle ball bat, remember that?
One happy black man I be
When my L.A. bunny wanna trip with me
Her name is Teresa
She was freakier than me, but I figured I could please her
She had the long braids
Chocolate sister, loved to cuff men like slaves
Arrived at the house at last
Seen two shades of lipstick on the same wine glass
Provocative artwork around me
Four pink slippers on the floor surround me
One pair's for her, the other pair's for who?
Plus she only lives in a one bedroom
Well hm - it might be on
Ménage-à-trois, open la bouche, taste la bomb
Teresa's roommate walks in
6 ft 2 with a wig and a stupid-ass grin
(Oh my goodness!)
(You can have her)
You done brought a big-ass man up in the room?
Girl, what's wrong with you?
Honey, that is gay
Yo partner, you can have her
Cause I don't want none of y'all

Hey yo, ain't you the one that was talkin crazy to me other day on Rain Ear
(Yeah that was me, what you gonna do about it Mix-A-Lot?)
(*gun blast*)

Rushin up the middle like a fullback
It's my drug, head to head contact
Mack 11, my best friend in full effect
That's the beat that you been lookin for, no pussy check
Come quietly the punishment awaits you
I'm playin games and I know you can't relate too
Surprise my rhyme hit you from the blind side
You better chill cause your messin with my bad side

(*Suckers getting tossed*)
""My, my, my, my, my bad side""
(*Suckers gettin tossed*)
(*Suckers gettin tossed*)
""*My, my, my, my, my bad side*""
(*Suckers gettin tossed*)
""*My, my, my, my, my bad side*""
""*My bad side*""

Drop the ""Square Dance"" punk I ain't bullshittin
Tell ya girl about how hard this shit's gettin
Shoot 'em down like the All World Crime Boss
Break soft and like a salad you'll get tossed
Voice like rock effects I don't need 'em
You drop for your boss, I'm like a pimp when I greet 'em
Role like son, your just another recruit
Salute roody poos to your king I'm in the black boots
The beat's runnin like a Benz in the fast lane
Over do it, put your speakers in a freeze frame
Watch the bunny while I inject the venom
Screams of pain cause my rhymes up in 'em
Rushin like a buffalo, and wild like a Navajo
Reckless like the PLO, bring it back and here we go
The bass drum dancin through to get dumb
Girls on my tip doin flips because I'm well hung
Never been a fan of yours, vapors say my game's slick
You find something then you hide it with a drum chick
Takin apart every rap that's on the charts
Mix there with yours, spin it back it ain't hard
Please, get up and take brown tip punk
Cause you might get dumped
Your producers are bitin, your gettin paid but your lame
And no two songs of mine sound the same
Fame is not needed to acquire great wealth
Pick pocket posse pick up the pace you need help
Sucker, you better step to the stand by
Because your messin with my Bad Side

*My, my, my, my, my bad side*
*My, my, my, my, my bad side*

I'm like thunder, a barbaric like warrior
And I got the beat for ya
Bumpin in your trunk like a hump of funk punk
You wanna jump but your jump got skunked
Pick 'em up ref, eight count his lights are out
Lookin for the jab but he caught my roundhouse
Stereo effect our words connect
Pick up the mic and check our muscles flex
Loosen up your belt so my rhyme is dealt
You might gain wealth but can you do it yourself, nope
You stole a beat from a old great record
Call my record weak, here it is now you break it
You say I'm broke but I'm ridin in a Benzo
What you rollin boy a Hugo?
Tryin to roll with the girls your callin Mix-A-Lot a sucker
Who you callin sucker, lip-synching motherfucker
Move the set boy how's this fiasco
I'm in your gutter and I'm singin like Tabasco, sucker
You better step to the stand by
Because your messin with my Bad Side

""*My, my, my, my, my bad side*""
""My Bad Side""
""*My, my, my Bad Side*""
""*My, my, my, my, my bad side*""

Gun in my nose, slap my girl in her face
Took both my beepers and my ill skin case
Snatched all my gold, sucker punk and he's gone
He made a break for the car and now the chase is on
Rollin up the Avenue high speed chase, yes
Caddy was back but my Benz was in his face
Left toward South Shore, wrong way homey
This street's for Mix-A-Lot's posse only
Looked in his mirror saw my big gold grill
Ain't no place to run so you might as well chill
Jumped from the car like he wanted to run
And Maharashi on the roof (yo drop the gun)
Punk dropped that, so I dropped mine
You see I'd rather box, than have to use my nine
Punk buckled up from a one, two punch
My girl stomped the sucker with a high heel pump
Cops on my jock, I broke round the block
Chase cars eat dust and G don't stop
Smoker, you needed drugs for your next high
You pull a gat on my Bad Side

Guy #1: Alright man, let's kick the door down and Break in their man
We can get all his stuff, man, he got gold, man (word)
The jewelry man and a old Corvette in the garage, I'm a get me in that man

Guy #2: I want him, I want Mix-A-Lot man
Guy: I know well listen, take him out man
Guy #2: He dissed my sister
Guy: Don't let him get away man, take his girl out man
Guy: I know my homeboy slapped his girl
Guy #2: I know, yeah, let's get it, let's get in, let's get in
Guy: Kick the door down, ready

I'm force feedin competition, more rebel shit
Rhymes on a roll, cold yet bold
I did ""Posse on Broadway"" in cruise control
Runnin like a wart, rap's my sport
Of course loss, and then you pick the part
But don't cry and say you wasn't warned
Cause my voice keeps comin like a STORM
Bass should it be let go, heck no
Want to be hard, cause you failed to be techno
Rugged, ripped and rough hittin like ""Thriller"" (boom)
My bass drum is a killer
Packed like a musket, tough to test it
Your arrested (Yo, was he in a trial?), you guessed it
His eyes are big, his crew ran away in the crunch
Then I hit 'em with the ""Batman"" punch
Laugh, if you want but don't approach
Cause most that approach get ate up like toast
But some do come, you wanna scrap or what?
If not stay back, cause I'll Roll You Up

I'll Roll You Up

I'm scannin the court, holdin the fort
Runnin your mind through a maze of pure lyrical tort
More real estate, keep my posse runnin to the bank
It's hardcore, breakin up armored tanks
Not dressed to impress, but dressed for pain
No cute sweatsuits, just sweat and chains
Step off strapped, I let off caps
Ha, Hitchcock couldn't write more wicked raps
Rip the Godfather, then you start that braggin
I never jumped on a James Brown bandwagon
A malla ralla, makin MC's holler
My rope's so big, your girl's callin me a baller
Bad is played, so I choose to use mean
Diabolical mind, the remorse is unseen
Quick to cut on any concert quack
Lip-synchin rhymes off a raggedy tracks
He claims to hate me, swears I can't beat 'em
I drop a new jam, the punks come like I beep 'em
Tried to jack, stepped up and got popped
Cause I'm takin out scum like ""Robocop""
Twistin off rhymes in a lyrical knot
The temporary, interuptin in your chain of thought
It's me so give it up, cause the gat is in your gut

How many Playboys we got in the house?

All you players from coast to coast

My bank is thick but it's legal, so I boast
Comin at a brother like a in sync cheap
I'm still down to (*banging noise*), if a sucker got beef
Roll him up, cause he's soft, kinda limp
I'm your worst nightmare, a sucker MC's pimp
Workin 'em hard with my hip hop force
My words so cold they known to freeze up warts
The scope is focused, notice no hocus pocus
Your girl's a square, but she'll tell ya I'm bogus
Saw you on the street, your middle finger was flippin
And your the victim of a drive-by lyrical whippin
Read my song, lyrics are strong
The critics were wrong, I kind to suckers like pong
Agression the lesson, pain is the ultimatum
Reachin and grabbin, hittin like Jack Tatum
They are crushed, turnin suckers to slush
Heavyweight beef for you punks that fuss
Whippin like handball, punishin the face
I'm all up in 'em like Section Eight
Logical rhymes, ahead of the time
Goin for mine, and fight time, still down to grind
Here's the white chalk, your next to get cut
But cross the white line and I'll Roll You Up

I'll Roll You Up ...
Bring it on down

I got my voice down pact, rock it up like crack
Smacked all the whack, with a loaded pack
Black Cross Courts is the chosen attire
Heavy with the lyrics, all balls are fire
Cause I'm (*scratched* - ""Dope, are great""*)
In the Pacific Time Zone, I'm considered the boss
A lyrical nightmare, it's me in your dreams
Feel the sweat, the smoke, get up and then scream
Loose is the noose, but I'm tightenin soon
My drum's steady hung, with enormous boom
I stomp all comp, for it's you I romp
My drum's kickin harder than paternity stomps
Hit it and with it, the posse's heavy and stiff

Suburbian Nightmare,Whoomp! Here It Is: Hip-Hop Hits,UnKnown,"(Verse 1)
You can check my blackness, fact is
I'm rough as a cactus
Now I gotta change what I practice
So I went to the suburbs and bought me a big house
And now they wanna run a brother out?
I'm a well-educated young maker of revenue
Rollin' in a big black BMW
So I'm supposed to fit because I'm straight legit
But the police STILL wanna trip
They accuse me of robbin' myself
Never seen a brother with wealth
Hell, I thought I was big, and now I'm trapped in the house
Cause the cops got my crib staked out
The police chief is runnin' for comissioner
But if I get outta this, chief, I'm gettin' ya
Cheif needs a cover-up plan cause he heard I'm famous
Called a crazy white boy, name was Amos
I thought Amos was a burglar
But when he saw me, he said I never heard of ya
He couldn't tell north from south
But Amos was my only way out
Of this suburbian nightmare
Huh
Yeah
My suburbian nightmare
(Verse 2)
I may not look like Beaver, but you don't either
I bought a big house for the breather
Even in the suburbs, cops are my enemy
And all the rich liberals ain't friendly
So Amos got a shotgun and I got a skillet
Anything movin', I'ma straight up kill it
I'm a black man on the come-up, I got done up
And roughed up by a cop tryin' to get hooked up
I got a meal and I just sealed two more deals
And now I'm runnin' from the cops? This ain't real!
You see, the cops sent Amos in to play that role
Be a burglar and rob my home?
They offered him a deal and then took it back
Ol' Amos should have signed them a contract
Cheif walks in talkin' that +nigga+ smack
*punch* ""oof!"" ""+nigga, take+ that!""
Now they want me for attempted murder
The craziest case that a brother ever heard of
The neighborhood fears me, they're scared to get near me
The cops wanna smear me
My suburbian nightmare
Suburbian nightmare
(Verse 3)
I used to eat pig feet, now I'm eatin' lobster
Gettin' my check, boy, the hell with them propers
Life still ain't changed cause I gotta get my hustle on
Just to get these cops gone
Four or five mil' can't make my race change
It can make the pace change, but it won't maintain
I can't go outside to jog
Cause my next-door neighbor got a prejudiced dog
But it's America, home of the free
Life in the 'burbs ain't nothin' like TV
Now I'm runnin' from the cop clan
Cause my neighborhood told the cops: ""It was a black man""
Mr. and Mrs. Gilman next door
Puffin' on a joint, kinky to the core
And that's the typical role model
White picket fence, big house and a bottle
Who can I blame for the stereotypical mix-up?
The innocent again get tricked up
Things is supposed to change when you grow to my size
Open your eyes to my suburbian nightmare

Checkin out the goodies that Mix (Mix) had
Trippin off the things that I bought (bought) cash
Tryin to send a brother up-state (state) fast
Yep (yep), livin on the edge, I swear
The government is tryin to keep a brother (brother) scared
Rappers wanna talk about, life's unfair?
Well I've seen the eyes of the big bad bear
TAXMAN COMETH, TAXMAN TAKETH
TAXMAN'S A PIMP, SO THE TAXMAN BREAK-ETH (yeah)
Audited my books, now who's the real crooks?
On the streets, now I'm gettin funny looks ('sup fool?)
Everybody's thinkin I'm broke (broke)
Do I smoke (smoke), or am I sellin the coke?
Now I'm keepin my receipts for the gas
Cause the IRS
Is tryin to take my stash

Why you wanna take my stash?
Why you wan' take my stash?
Why you wanna take my stash?

But +I Checks My Bank+ so I paid 'em (yep)
They put a tap on my phone and I made 'em (mmm)
I paid 'em, two hundred and eighty-five G's
And that was just the ninety-one fees (god damn)
I ain't tellin no lies, fool, cause I'm real with this
And muthafuckas can't deal with this
Some call me the sixty mil' man
And now I'm trippin off a uncle named Sam
But a mack just can't go bank (bank) rupt
Still paid well cause I make (make) cuts
Accountants on the regular, checkin my ends
Bought another fresh drop top (top) Benz
Yep yep yep, +Just Da Pimpin in Me+
Twenty G's on the block when I hit L.B
Stashed a lil' bread in the ninety-three
Bill collectors don't see me, G!
In this sport, I'm the man with the miracle torque
To pull through all sorts of them tax audits
In '94, I know I gotta think fast
Cause they'll be back, tryin to take my stash
(work too hard)
Why you wanna take my stash?
(work too hard)
Why you wan' take my stash?
(work too hard)
Break it on down!

Ha ha, bring it back!
Why you wanna take my stash?
Huh!
Why you wanna take my stash?
Why you wanna take my stash, fool?  Yuh!
Why you wanna take my stash?
Why you wanna take my stash?
Why you wanna take my stash ... mista guv' nah?

Sleepin Wit My Fonk,Chief Boot Knocka,1994.0,"How can a brother like Mix get played on?
Used to get my fade on, now I'm sprayin Raid on
Tryin to keep my game bug proof
Salt-N-Pepa said +Shoop+, now my girl done cut loose
One down, too many more to go
But when did my game slip, bro?
Cause I can't stand when a man reads my game plan
Took my number, two girl, then ran
Uhhh, now she got a brother named Dexter
In a drop-top, rollin down Yesler
But I'm the biggest mack in this town
Lose one girl and muthafuckas wanna trip now
Feel me, cause I'm about to get real, see
Mad suckas wanna get 'em up wit me
Get back, cause I bought me a big gat
Now I got him on flat back
Back to the brother named Dexter
Feelin kinda proud I betcha, but I won't let cha
Brag to the suckas in the hood though
When you's a black man lookin like Fabio
So when my girl comes back
Tryin to get nasty n' make Dr. Richard get fat
Get me sprung, you wish you could
Now Mix gotta get wit Dexter's goods

Don't funk with my fonk
That's a no-no, partner
Mmm-hm

Mista Dexter is kinda feelin like a hero
Watch Mix-a-Lot put him on zero
Hit the streets in my Benz
I'm lookin for Dexter's girlfriend
If he got mine, I'm about to get his
Cause that's the way it is in the mack biz
Dexter's girl said she was his wife
So now I gotta hit him with the mack knife
So I pulled up (uhh!) tough, to get my mack on
Baby girl tryin to show a little backbone
But it's all good when she's seen
That white 500 sittin in the front
And get dressed, c'mon we gotta head west
You can tell Mix what you wanna do next
She said roll on down to the Edgewater Inn
Aw, Mix done done it again
A gut check, operatin on the suspect
The object to make a girl's sex flex
Baby starts to squiggle n' squirm
And watch out baby, cause it's my turn
Now I'm takin baby back home
The rendezvous is straight ON
Cause this is the game that I'm playin
Now Dexter's bout to start sayin ...

Don't funk with my fonk
I done told ya, boy
Gotta watch it, Dexter!

Now I'm feelin like a champ, bumpin my amps
Rollin wit a pocket full o' green stamps
Picked up the cellular, callin my main thang
But the phone just rang
Uh oh!  Paranoia got me trippin
Am I slippin or is another brother spittin?
Backtrackin my game, I remember one loose end
Everybody's seen my Benz
Damn, now I'm pullin on my goatee
Jealousy'll make my enemies snitch, see
Too many mack rhymes, too many mack lines
Now it seems I'm about to get mine
Walk into the crib-ah
Check in like Virgil Tibbs-ah
Lookin up under the bed fah evidence of Dexter
Wonderin, wonderin if ...

Don't funk with my fonk
I done told ya, boy
It's a step, partner
Now walk it on down",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-sleepin-wit-my-fonk-lyrics
Let it Beaounce,Chief Boot Knocka,1994.0,"I love it when ya bounce bounce bounce
Shakin the top, shakin the bottom
Can I pounce pounce pounce
Chasin the boots and then I done got 'em
Can I go go go? As soon as you thinkin I'm done
I'm takin it slow, slow, SLOW
The butt-man's back puttin ?mauls on the mud ducks
Stab stab stab, Mitsubishis eat dust
Stabbin on the way to a club
They had a big butt contest so I know I got pub
SMOOTH, STROLL, step into the club
I got MO, DOUGH, some jealous brothers
Got BEEF, THOUGH, got fourteen mamas
On my HIP, SO, don't do it bro!
Five hundred dollars to the skirt wit the most bounce
Mix-a-Lot is judgin so they let it all out
Wet T-shirts, itty bitty skirts
All my homies straight puttin in work (much work)
I call it sexy, some call it sexist
Can't tell a lie, Mr. Richard is restless
Pump pump pump, now they got me on skids
The girly in the purple on the right is on hip
She got a body but she can't dance a ounce
To hell witcha dance moves girl, just let it beaounce

So baby in the purple got paid
Now she's sittin in my car so it's time to check the age
Baby girl's age is the same as her waist
Deuce-four ... my taste! (mmh)
Thick soul sista wit the dookie braids
Fine young princess flamin wit the self made boss
I paid the cost so I'm the big hoss
When the skirts start to bounce I'm lost
Crazy bout thickness, I get 'em with the quickness
My game is straight laced, no slickness
Witness the system pimp, never been simp
Other wanna-bes just LIMP
A THICK, RUMP, will make a +Nasty Dog+
Wanna STRAIGHT, HUMP, and if you make it bounce
I'mma ACT, DRUNK, and chase it all around
Until I BUMP, BUMP, no fronts in the grunts
A LITTLE, MISTAKE, she got into my car
Now the SHIRT, SHAKES, I'm hittin potholes
Like EARTH, QUAKES, nothin 'bout the game
Is FAKE, CAKE OR jake!
You can bounce ya sixty-four
But it can't hang with a hotty gettin wild on the dance floor
And if ya can't make Soul Train, girl, don't pout
Bring it to me baby, *slurrrp* and let it beaounce

I've been checkin out you other rappers' videos
Never lookin at the rapper, just the hotty in the skippy clothes
And I gotta admit this
Mix-a-Lot'll ZOOMA-ZOOM-ZOOM these skirts wit the quickness
All y'alls girls is fly so I'mma give ya props
LOOK AT THEM GIRLS IN THE DAISY DUKES POP
Shake that thang like a salt shaker
Indecent proposal from the bank maker
Doo-doo brown can make the girls in my group get down
They couldn't sit down, so let that booty bounce around
And they'll throw it in yo face, checkin yo manhood
Ya wanna touch it if you're only good
The SMOOTH, SKIN, on top of that
The booty is BOO-MIN, shakin like a leaf
To keep it MO-VIN, you disagree wit me
Then where have YOU, BEEN, livin on the end?
SIS BOOM BAH, I'm lovin to watch the body
Of a SOUL SISTAH, they're shakin they booties and makin em bounce
To OOH LA LA, tryin to get deep in they panties
Is the MACK PAPA, change up
IIIIIII'm the one to come undone and get all sprung
When her butt swung I'm gettin high-strung

Seminar,Seminar,1989.0,"(*breathing noises, bell ringing*)
Welcome to the seminar (go, go, go, go)

To the Seminar (go, go, go, go) - 3X

Sittin' at a table, lookin' like we Gods, we're dressed in white, for the rap so tight
Serious men with the strength of ten, comin' through like animals lookin' for a fight
Intelligent, packed, so inadequate, step back, Mix-A-Lot's here to inforce what's dope
A brand new album, better than the last one, listen up close or you might get smoked
Some say rap has become repititious, mixin' up beats of a old great jams
Some hate me, some imitate me, but take me out, I'll be damned
This album is a demonstration of various styles of a hip hop art
I got paid, but I do it cause I love it, all enemies hush, let the seminar start
(go, go, go, go)

To the seminar (go, go, go, go) - 3X
(The seminar)

Break it up, the rebel of rap is about to toss up with a brand new style
Your host on the whole west coast rippin' up bedposts when I work that pile
A meetin' of the minds to elevate hardcore, take it to a level where few have been
You brag but your brain's like mush, hush learn somethin' my friend
Seminar dope, smoke you cope, nope, ha I got 'em in the scope
Scramble, run and hit 'em like Op, chope, goin' for the throat
Rustle up revenue pack it in a gunny sack
Settin' up a trap for a new snack pack (*echo*)
A snack pack is a girl with the thickness, little in the middle, but she got much back
Runnin' like a Rolex, stuck in the hype mode, track after track, keep it real for a fact
I paid my posse unlike you boy, they all roll tough and they all stay strapped
Get up in my face, shake my hand, saw you on the screen and your head got fat
Forgot where your from, but I'll tell ya where you at
Lip synchin', lyin' and about to get slapped
Smoke some of this, suck it up then think
If your group's not paid then you might get backstabbed
You's a brother, but you actin' like another
Who was tryin' to get rich, now he's workin' wit scabs
I'm a genius, brains are the new thing, knowledge is in, and I'm pour somethin' wit it
You attend my dope Seminar, and listen to the lyrics (*echo*), hit it

Debonair your nightmare, don't stare down when I clear from Greenpuff Square
Dare to squares, break 'em up into pears, yours boys got scared
I bang, bang hardware
Four four shoot 'em up, cock and pop pop
Desert Eagle Magnum and it stops
Waitin' for crime to roll and pick locks
Mauseburg pump blasts, he got dropped
That is the life of a 'Hip Hop Soldier', I'm hated in the hood so I gotta stay strapped
Rollin' in a drop top SEC, cops stop, wanderin' why I'm heavily packed
I'm legally armed and like dynamite I'm ready to blast on punks who play hard
I love to love, but I can't so I ain't, silence (*echo*) drop the Seminar

Ride,Chief Boot Knocka,1994.0,"Shake, to, my flow
Let it go when you shake that coco
I got game, so whatcha know
Get it up, gonna hit her with the Rambo
Oo-chie, coo-chie
Still lookin for the supa booty
Rump, chaser, rump snatcha
Huh, get 'em on camera
Call me a jockey
Cause I'm ridin' them skirts and I talk real cocky
Ol' mackin'-ass Mix is back
I'm slangin' that game on 28 tracks
Yep yep, pack 'em in a Benz
Take 'em to my house, straight let 'em all in
Call Mix-a-Lot a slut?
I might get banned, but I still like butts
Mmmmm! lay 'em on the table
Dr. Richard's willing and able
Not sexist, just sexy
Do I like sistas? Well, let's see
She's thick, walking with a switch
Carryin' a beeper, ya better not call her no bitch
When it comes to a snack-pack I can't lie
I wanna ride!

Can I ride?
I wanna ride! (2x)

Shake 'em up like you're playin them craps
Two snake eyes puttin fellas on tap
What I'm sayin ain't popular nowadays
But it ain't good without the mayonnaise
I, can-not dance
But I'm good when ya hit that stance
Wham, bam, met a girl named Pam
I poke and thank you ma'am
Ain't no, drag in my bag
Gotta do me cause I don't play tag
Six-double-o hoop, costs loot
Hit the gas she'll scoot
When ya dance, I'm on ya
When ya walk, I'm on ya
When ya moan, I'm on ya
I'm that nasty dog and I tried to warn ya
To the 'tel, to the 'tel we go
Don't need a bed cause I'm good on the floor
When a chocolate masterpiece walks by
I wanna ride!

Can I ride, baby?
I wanna ride!
Ride!

I'm like Tyrannosaurus Rex
I sense movement then I gotta wreck shop
I'm on top but down to flip-flop
*scratching* ""Don't stop""
So, I, won't stop
Love to see that thang go pop
Don't be, phony, baby show me
I can ride yo' pony
Saddle up n' go, you can show Bo
He don't know
You, can, put it on a man
Make me yo number one fan
Some brothers wanna claim they're down
Puttin on fronts like clowns
But I'm packin this 9 in my glove
Givin nothin but the females love, yeah!
Ain't no sissy in me
4-4 mags ain't never been friendly
But I like the girls
Cake boys get scared in the kitty-cat world
But I'm not the one to come cake
Baby this game is straight
Fellas in the house, you can't deny!
All y'all wants to ride!
I wanna ride! x3",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-ride-lyrics

Somethin different, the boy never sounds the same

Body by Nautilus and you ain't even with this

Crushin, killin, never beat stealin
But I'm hell when it comes to rhyme dealin
Death to competitors, long live Mix-A-Lot
You understand motherfucker I'ma hard rock
Beat 'em up and pick 'em up and make 'em miss the stick up
But my gat close range, take his wallet, kick him in his cup
Drop the games, cause they really ain't necessary
You can be a water rated, boy you ain't legendary
Sue it far in the Caddy, I'ma chillin
To your girlies I'ma hero, to you suckers I'ma villian
I've done, get me mad I might try

Serious and callous could be deadly to competitors

Swayed, raid in effect, my posse's with it
Put a fifty on the floor, like a punk you wouldn't get it
Neck snap, head crack, put you on a meat rack
I ain't playin with you boy, you know I mean that
Physical rhymes all meant to intimidate
All niggas take note, don't imitate
Rippin is the cut, freaks scurry for my T-I-P
Tryna get an autograph from M-I-X-A-L-O-T
Down for the title match and you know what I'm talkin about
Muscle bound, full of things, knock a sucker's lights out
Bring it to my level, boy you better start climbin
When she's grindin, I'm hardcore rhymin
Lyric to your gut and all your lines just buckle
When you make it to the top, I put these boots on your knuckles
Walk into the party like a mob, wearin jet black
""Swass"" skin in effect, sportin coon hat
Walk by sucker punk, look like eat crackers
He mumbled somethin, so my posse walked backwards
Catch 'em on the corner stone and hit 'em with the gat chrome
Let 'em know my posse's gettin bigger, when were back home
A big maulin, you know my beat is def
You know who you are, F the BS

Yeah boy, they rappin five slang
Cuttin, you know who it is
Comin back at ya, ain't gonna put your name on wax
I really don't wanna make you famous sucker

Reconnect my dialect with modified jargon
Heavy snaps, never lookin for a bargain
Tumble when the pressure's on, walkin like a movie clips
Slow mo, pants low, jeans layin off my hip

Real beat boy, leavin crowds in euphoria
Transform, super fast, nice slice, what a blast
Movin like the speed of light, so quick I shatter plexiglass

You like my tuning cabilities, admit it
It's the man with the westbound attitude

In the dome or I can get him in the hip
But boom, look at all the niggas runnin' out the room
Just another soldier, causin' doom, no, I don't bang
But I like to wound my enemy, who is the enemy?
I'm glad you asked any motherfucker standin' in my path
Got a Bentley Turbo, now you wanna jack
But remember, Mack Daddy is strapped
And when your platinum niggas start dissin'
Record companies think you're missin'
But I'm back, I'm back
I'm back and I got a bigger gat

But nah, I'm just pumpin' straight facts
You either be a mack or you get macked
Some of the jealous wanna roll on the boss
But this HK's keepin' 'em tossed
'Cause I duck them deuce, deuce treys
At point blank range, attitudes get changed
I'm about making these dividends
And every motherfucker ain't my friend
And I check my back when I count my snaps
And niggas that snatch get slapped
Girls wanna roll, that's cool
But I'm not to be played that fool
Some niggas think a brother with money is slippin'

	But you cannot make him drink	
	I'm just tryin to spit some game
	So you might wanna stop and think	(2x)

Okay, 'Lik's gon' come anew for '9-6
Lead yo ass to the aqua, but I can't make a brother rich
You gotta go for self, and then help others
Mama wasn't lyin when she put you up on game, brother
All up in the house gettin loud and disrespectin
'Lik steps in, regulatin and hoe-checkin
All them makes wishes, ain't already tryin to sympathize
Players stay paid all day, but yo ass stays broke and high
Oh my, kids and stuff all over like some roller skates
Still I keeps it on my pape and niggas be tryin to playa-hate
But that'll get you rolled up sideways
Whoever said crime pays never got 3 strikes in L.A
Makes you lonely, sayin, contributin to mines
You could be hella fine, but ain't nobody spendin mines
Mobbin with the Crowbar with some common sense
You can stay hella bent, I be at the water stackin presidents


One of these goddamn set-backs of havin your mail fat
Is some of these lax-ass wanna-be macks, and you hoes in black
They tracks sound booty, and they ain't doin they duty
In the studio, and only if you knew me, though
You'd see that I puts in work, and puts hurt
On your flirts that wanna wear skirts and try to jerk
But you'se in love with a fantasy, trick
You wanna 'sit on yo ass, collect checks and shit'
You was younger than me, so I schooled ya
Gave you the tools to come up and get down like a ruler
Took you to executive brunches, high-powered lunches
Gave you dough in bunches
So get your fried chicken and your watermelon
Start the yellin, Mix-A-Lot is why you ain't sellin
Old Uncle Tom nigga gettin mad
But you know you never worked for the shit you had
Start drinkin, bitch

Hey yo, 'Lik, fill in the blanks
What's up with these would-be gold diggers chasin entertainer niggas
Handin out sugar daddy contracts to big black macks in black pimp Caddies
I mean excuse me for pimpin, but ah...

Tryin to see a meal ticket like's they big goals
Rollin fat hoops and rollin gizzy stashin big loads
Jump your woman, but ain't handlin yo business
County aid plea, check so small you can't buy bisquits
Got you a family, still you all up in mines
Fuckin off's the hot rule, but see, 'Lik gon' fit to be fine
She ain't right, got her shorties runnin the streets with retardation
Bein barely sleep, puttin on that sneaky dick in her
Boys will be boys, that's how the game goes
Ask Mix-A-Lot, they all hoes, and this player knows
Better bumrush school and get your G.E.D
Cause welfare, homey, been cuttin back since '83
Two carts ??? and still be tryin to front
Use your diaper money to load up them philly blunts
Get a 9 to 5, change your whole mindframe
Cause doin without ain't what's happenin, put yourself up on game
Kill or hustle, somethin, gotta drink the water, girl

Romantic Interlude,Swass,1988.0,"You were in the crowd at my party girl
I did nothing but stare
I looked straight in your eyes and I sing lets do it
But you didn't even care, Oh girl!
But now we're all alone
And your looking Oh so fine
I like to whisper my two things in your ear
And try to blow your mind, baby doll oh!
Put your head up on my chest
Feel the pounds of my heart
Rest assured once I lay my foundation
We would never fall apart, girl!
These crowds are paths that haunt me at night
Call them romantic dreams
But its so realistic I toss and I turn
And I wake in a sweaty scream, ah!
A romantic interlude... 
While driving I was thinking, as you slept in my lap
I was thinking of the things we could be doing, baby
Back at my flat, You know what I mean? Oh!!
The sun was rising I had driven all night
And be weary at the wheel
I looked down at you while you were sleeping
Your beauty seems so unreal
You open your eyes and said 'Mix-a-lot's hours of sleep'
Cos you are on my mind
Why don't you search for my hidden treasure
There's no telling what you'd find
By this time I was tripping girl
You're such a tease
But it was love baby not a one night stand
You're not a sleaze girl, Oh!
A romantic interlude... 
You woke up with a worried look on your face
Something was on your mind
You got out of bed and walked towards the window
And stared through my venetian blinds
You would turn and look at me
As you stood wrapped in lace
I crept up behind you and held you tight
And a tear ran down your face, Oh baby!
You said 'Now you got what you want!'
'Don't you wanna leave?'
I said before its love girl not a one night stand
Your not a sleaze, ah!
That frown soon turned to a smile!
You realised I was deep
Deep in love in the holistic sample of sophistication
In other words, My Freak!
I knew this songs a hard bit too
But the test songs full of grief
Making songs full of heartbreaking regret
It's not my belief, girl
To see your smile is all I want
Your tears I exclude
The next time you see me you crave, whatever!
Romantic interlude

Game Don’t Get Old,Daddy’s Home,2003.0,"Men have died and shot folks for this game
All to get a rusty bucket of nails at the end of a platinum rainbow
No, game

Some have died and some just lied with it (game)
Some have cried and others tried to get it (game)
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old (this game won't ever get old)
I got no kids because of it (because the game)
And I got no wife because of it (because the game)
But I got this life because of it
Told ya, game don't never get old

East Lessler Way, Apartment D, see thee bad memories
Used to be the, one with no TV
Take back my soul, stole by one of these foes like Mack Moes
Puttin holes in my old clothes, even stole my pose
Got my sky, fly, who that guy?
Slip 'em my third eye, falsified
Don't lie, break with a girl, you cry
If you wants game, slip me some change
But you must refrain, from saltin my name
Now your girl's at my door, I told ya bro
Salt me, I take what's yours, that's the rules though
The big leagues, how can game go outta style
Boy you foul, slicin game with a mean ass scowl
Young stud ..

Some have died and some just lied with it (for the game)
Some have cried and others tried to get it (for the game)
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't ever get old
I got no kids because of it (kids because of it)
And I got no wife because of it (wife because of it)
But I got this life because of it (life because of it)
Told ya, game don't never get old

Seattle to Diego, big black El Dorados, my saddle
So straddle papa and babble until dada raddles
Let game resume, I assume using my room to boom boom
If not leave soon, let me retune
Big saloon, says ""oh, oh, I'm so low""
My old enzo flows, hey two Diablos to go
But whoa, oh, but wait, oh
You can't be serious partner
You used to be scared of girls, now you smell like my imposter
I seen your chicky poster, fake pose, gun in holster
Your girl gets to me closer, tryna post up on the clothes-ac
You toast her, boast her, get you closer, gettin hitched up
Bitched up, whipped up, lost your strikes when you switched up
Husband ..
 - w/ ad libs
I got no kids because of it
And I got no wife because of it
But I got this life because of it
Told ya, game don't never get old
Some have died and some just lied with it
Some have cried and others tried to get it
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old

So who's next to go pop face lock on my mack spot
Heads drop when my cuts flop, don't stop please Mix, don't stop
I saw his game it ain't the same, so don't cry baby
Just sit by Mixxy, but dimed us cam D
So I stack my backpack (for the raps), going to Cali (comin back)
Tricks up my sleeve (look at that), sisters with me (who the mack)
I rolls with real bosses, cuts my losses in my office
Hot tosses, gettin steamy in these marinatin sauces
Now these young kids is in my gravy, hella lazy
But they paid see, doin things to raise me
They game's a little hazy, but it's cool
Pat, pack, rack your stack
He's back, put check your hat
And your style at the door black

I got no kids because of it
And I got no wife because of it
But I got this life because of it
Told ya, game don't never get old
 - w/ ad libs
Some have died and some just lied with it
Some have cried and others tried to get it
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old
Some have died and some just lied with it
Some have cried and others tried to get it
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old
I got no kids because of it
And I got no wife because of it
But I got this life because of it
Told ya, game don't never get old

Yeah don't grab the game bull by the horns
Cause these horns hit balls, you know what I'm sayin?
Tears roll down your cheek and freeze
Before they reach concrete
Game's up, feelings gone
You graduate to stone

Some have died and some just lied with it
Some have cried and others tried to get it
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it

Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Big man is back, oh no, it's a brand new flow
Lettin' you Jakes and females know
Ain't a damn thing changed and I still got dough
Still gettin' watched by Po-Po
You know what a flow like, never grab a ol' mic
Never been down wit the slow life
Baby, I'm a low life, lookin' for the right type
To get it goin' on for the whole night
King of the backside, look at my rep
One of these West Coast veterans
Known to lay bone and make miniskirts moan
Young hotty got me sittin' like stone
So, I'm at the Magic City
So many freaks in one spot, I'm dizzy
I'm a playa, so you know I wanna play
It ain't nuthin' like the city Blacklanta, GA
Now, I start lookin' through the mist
Swangin' my game like this
Wassup wit the table poppin'?
Fine, 5 feet, 9 inches and I'm jockin'
But the girl won't dance
And I pinch me a 10, 'bout to wet my pants
She got body fo' days but the girl won't flaunt it
You betta bark like you want it
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby

Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Bow wow, bow wow, gimme my dog chow
Put me on a leash or else I'm gonna have to snap now
Humpin' yo' leg, this doggy don't beg
Got a tight rubber cap on my head
So, check this game when I'm comin' through the hood
Swingin' 'round blocks but I don't sell goods
Mad brothas mean mug 'cause they wish they would
Get a fine thang like I could
You bought a 6-4 wit the 3-wheel mo'
Got no females in ya passenger door
You wanna playa hate 'cause you just don't know
'Bout the fast track makin' yo hoe go
Damn baby, why don't you let me ride witchu? Here I go again
Done took yo' girl 'cause I don't like men
Got to the crib, romance don't phase me
Pulled to the house playin', freak me baby
Video check 1-2, 1-2
Me and baby girl's 'bout to get loose
And just when I thought I could palm it
You betta drop to yo' knees and bark like you want it
Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby
Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby

What’s Real,Chief Boot Knocka,1994.0,"1977 was a no cocaine in my hood-ject
The brothers was stuck on Chuck without a mind set
I got tired of watchin ""Good Times""
Feelin like J.J., I'm standin in the food bank line
My momma was ridin on the bus tryna get to work
Early in the morn', it's cold and her knees hurt
She got a .38 sittin in her purse
Cause my moms was the King County Jail nurse
So how in the hell could you tell Mix
That I never lived this, when you was just a snotty nose age six
Young buck, just graduate
And your lyin when you say your street educated
Cause I'mma veteran boy and you's a new booty
So stop frontin to your friends like you knew me
Cause you don't and you never did, kid
So FUCK your respect and the shit you claim ya did
To all ya real, when ya claimin ya gang bang
Doin everythin to gain fame and get yourself a name
But I done seen my homies gettin smoked over dice games
When you was still at home doin nice things
Back in the days of turtle wax on Cadillacs
Life to a brother was hoes and macks
I had to come up some way
Pimp daddies and ex-Black Panthers used to school me
Why moms was puttin in eight to twelve
I was in the hood gettin schooled on makin mail
I can't let my moms die a poor black sister
Gotta make her richer
So tell me what's real, partner

(Da-da-da-down for mine)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)
So what's real fool?
(Da-da-da-down for mine)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)

Back when MLK Way was Empire Way
I was stuck on broke, but I used to hear pimps say
Better get what you can get before you get got
Come up and snatch yours and buy yourself a nice spot
And that's stuck in my head 'til this day G
So I apply pimp game to life you see
But I ain't beatin on my sister in the streets
I'ma focus on my real enemy, yeah
So if I'm pimpin, then who's my hoeys
In D.C. livin in a big white house bro
Changes his name every four years
Mr. Carter caught me slippin, but Reagan wasn't gettin his
I never wanted a hand out young Jake
I never got jealous over how much a brother makes
So I was on my own, no love in the school zone
No blacks in the books, so I'm gone
And now the only color that I love is green see
Cause my history books never taught me about me
I may not like where I've been, but I'm lovin where I am
Prime rib, fuck Spam
So tell me what's real partner

(I fought back, then heat check)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)
So what's real fool
(I fought back, then heat check)
(You gon' buy me a motherfuckin car?)

Yeah, I'd much rather be behind the mic, then the gat
But the simple fact that my pockets is fat
Means I can't relax, you know what I'm sayin?
Haha

Criticized by the main stream
For not bein the house jig and keepin things squeaky clean
But I can't, so I ain't
But I won't play the hard role just because you think
That is real, to say you kill, when you never held steel
You try to sing when you rollin in cake-ville
Back in the days you was breakdancin see
I remember when you had tight pants G
So Mr. Rap Critic when you trys to check me
About my cars and my girls, claimin you never could respect me
You really think I give a damn partner?
The shit I've been through man
I used to roll with the hoes
Hit the Caddy, slam the doors
Livin alone, cellular phone
Havin no furniture in my home
Rollin to Canada, makin my mail
Givin a trick a piece of tail
Livin it large, keepin it hard
Life was kinda odd
And rat a tat tat with my gat, sat in my lap G
The Hilton Hotel was my spot, I'm runnin my things see
I went from hustlin cheese, to double platinum LPs
But you still can't feel me
Boy the head don't get fat if you know where your at
Instead of ridin my back, check your own dat and that's facts
Now what's real partner

Haha, so what's real?
Yeah and all you clown runnin around town
Tellin people me and yous was down
When I was doin parties at the Boy's Club
You was sellin match books of weed, partner
I was about handlin my business
And you was about smokin your gri-nass
So check yourself, you wanna see the big head champ
And that's real to the fullest and I'm out",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-whats-real-lyrics
Resonate,Daddy’s Home,2003.0,"How you like your game, baby?
You wanna sell hot?
I make this game resonate baby, yeah resonate
Chorus:
C'mon c'mon
I put the ball in balla I made it resonate
I put the pop in these girls and made 'em shake
I put the b in the game and kept it true
No cock blockin' this game for you
New star, big cars, some of this game with a big cigar
Cashmeire, cat fat, six foot broads standin' on stacks
I understand, no plan, you stole my banner, southern 'bama
Sellin lies when you was dumb and broke
You never had a topknot, joke!
It was the shit you spoke
No rhythm in your spittin'
I don't need no bling things to make my game swing
Your game is runnin' tight but your motor pings
I make it resonate
Chorus x2
You drive a nice truck, Escallade
Gotta show 'em all you're paid
But the truth is you're lackin' what you're mackin' if you're paper fed
Your payins last to fuck 'em
If you're broke then can you trust 'em
Give her diamonds and a beeper but you can't keep her
She gets the benefits
Go on, girl, treat that man like a bitch!
Takin' from the rich, Robin Hood
Get it back to your crib
Another rap star slaving to this game he claim he's saving
Cut his legs when he's shaving cause he bitch made
I make it resonate
Chorus x2
I make it resonate
Rap's first super-balla
Yeah, before y'all could spell balla, I was ballin', fool
Blew 15 large in the 80's, nickrally
You work a max scheme, clean
Bought her that Lexus, bought it in Texas
Just like Dada bought you a mansion in Nevada
Situation bleak, your girl got a new physique
You got a baby comin', wife naggin, bought a Taurus station wagon
Aha! Put em on the glass and made your ass a balla!
Now you got a naggin' wifey and a toddler, ahah!
Don't wanna be a playa no more?
Mack with your mouth and match your dollas
I swing a mean verb, big word, some if this game you've heard
I gotta hear it, your appearance shakin' Daddy's lyrics
I ain't an OG, I'm an OP, original player
Papi gran-D, I signed your wife's booty, remember me?!

Square Dance Rap (Original),UnKnown,1985.0,"Yee-haw
I think that's a country-type beat there, Mix-A-Lot, hyuk, hyuk, hyuk
I'ma bust me a square dance rap, Mix
Why don't you kick in the bass drum, cottonpicker? Let's get crackin', hyuk, hyuk
There it is, Mix-A-Lot, hyuk, hyuk, hyuk, hyuk
I'm gon' bust me a rap now, back up, cottonpicker
(You work here or somethin'?)

Now everybody's rappin' 'bout welfare lines
I'm gonna bust me a brand new rhyme
Girls bend down and you start to freak
Shake your hips and act conceit'
Throw your hands high in the air
Grab your partner's derriere
Fellas in the crowd, I know you must be trippin'
My voice got them-there homegirls flippin'
Now grab your partner, take a bow
If you can't dance, I'll tell you how
Wave your hands and take two steps
Grab your hips and slide to the left
Get all in your partner's face
Swerve to the side and show your lace
If you're a freak then let it show
And grab your partner, dosey-doe

Hot doggin' Mix-A-Lot, I think I'm gettin' a tad bit tired, hyuk-hyuk-hyuk-hyuk-hyuk-hyuk
You're gonna have to break it down a little bit there, Mix-A-Lot
There ya go
Okay, I'm gettin' my wind back
Now I can get back on this rap, Mix, hyuk-hyuk-hyuk
Gimme a little bit of snare right here
Good God

If you think your partner's fine
Grab her where the sun don't shine
If you can't dance, then tap your toes
If you're stuck up, turn up your nose
Wave your hands from side to side
Lean to the left and take a slide
Other DJs, no, they're no match
Just look to the stage as I start to scratch, hyuk, hyuk

A-good Lord and a quarter, Mix-A-Lot, go ahead, get on, cut it up (Rock— Rock— Rock— Rock— )
I'm gon' bust me a fast rap right on about now (Rock me babe)

Synthesized, digitized, totally computerized
Never fakin', no mistakin', keep the people's booties shakin'
Super-great, I'm no fake, hold the beat just like a rake
Spinnin' records, cuttin' jams, all you freaks know who I am
I'm Mix-A-Lot, on the spot, king of scratchin' and hip-hop
Quick scratchin', fast rappin', hand clappin', constant 
Syncopated, duplicated, I'm extremely complicated
Stimulated conversation guaranteed to rock the nation
Now freaks on the left and freaks on the right
Grab your partner, hold him tight
Put your hands in his Levi's
Hold his rear while he grips your thighs
The more you dance, the more I rap
The big fat beat makes your toes tap
Glen Campbell can't hang with this
All you freaks give your man a kiss, hyuk, hyuk
Rah

Sir Mix-A-Lot Ray on the wheels of steel
Baby, this square dance is for real
Freaks get loose and go bezerk
Homeboys, look down homegirl's shirt
Grab her wrist, give her a twist
Spin her 'round 'til she acts amiss
DJs talkin' all that smack
Mix-A-Lot is the king of the scratch, hyuk, hyuk

Hey, Mix-A-Lot, good Lord and a quarter, cottonpicker
Hyuk-hyuk-hyuk-hyuk
I think I wanna bust me another one of them fast ones
You know what I mean?
That was action, dude, hyuk-hyuk
Now back off, cottonpicker
Lemme get loose here, hyuk-hyuk

I'm quick, slick, full of tricks
Never touched a drum stick
Wired fuses, broken circuits
People come to watch me work it
Under pressure, never choke
Never take a backstroke
Mixin' cuts, spankin' butts
Always spendin' mucho bucks
Preppie shoes, Goobie slacks
That ain't where the money's at
I'm over here in the clear
Much too tough for you, my dear
Lotta class, spendin' cash
Any day I'll beat your—
Ain't no other scratchin' brother
Mix-A-Lot'll cut your mother

My beats are icky in the square dance rap
My beats are icky in the square dance rap (Yee-haw)
My beats are icky in the square dance rap
My beats are icky in the square dance rap

Now everybody on the floor, clap your hands
Stomp to the beat of the one man band
Mix-A-Lot Ray's on the drum machine
The bassline playin' is oh, so mean
Mix-A-Lot make a jam in his room
With a four track recorder you can bust jams, too
Throw your partner 'cross your thigh
Tickle her fancy 'til she starts to cry
Whip her to the left, whip her to the right
Don't whip her too hard 'cause her jeans are tight, hyuk, hyuk
I don't believe y'all heard me, hyuk-hyuk-hyuk-hyuk
Whip her to the left, whip her to the right
Don't whip her too hard 'cause her jeans are tight, hyuk, hyuk
I think they heard me, Mix, bring the beat on back, cottonpicker, hyuk, hyuk

Oh, good Lord and a quarter, Mix-A-Lot
When we get through bustin' this jam
We gon' go hop in the eighteen-wheeler, pick us up some chicks
You know what I mean?
We gon' hop in the eighteen-wheeler, Mix-A-Lot, hyuk, hyuk
I hope we get airplay on this here stuff, you know what I mean?

Now before we end this filthy cut, we got a few things we have to say
To the homegirls sprung on the hum-drum beat, check out Sir Mix-A-Lot Ray
His style is fresh, so clean and new, he pulls so many tricks
If you give him ten bucks and a brand new tape, he'll put you in the mix
Now grab—

Hey, Mix-A-Lot, what happened to the beat, cottonpicker?
Guess it's time to go, bye!",https://genius.com/Sir-mix-a-lot-square-dance-rap-original-lyrics
