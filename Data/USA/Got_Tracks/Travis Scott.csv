Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

I beat it, ain't no cuddlin', you down bad, you sufferin'
I don't give a fuck how hard it get, that lil' bitch know I started this
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, get to the cash, no layup
Spend a big bag, Rodeo, some may ride for the fresh cut
Hoes come through just to touch us, I'ma tell the truth like Usher
You already know how I bust her, slang my chop from Russia

Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop, pop my trunk, dip, dip, dip, dip
Swang—swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop, pop my trunk, dip

No, you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it goin' on?
I had to burn, I left ""skrrt"" marks, I had to dip
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim

Pornography,Rodeo (Expanded Edition),2015.0,"Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of ""Fuck this shit""
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say ""Fuck you""
To the ones who say ""Fuck you""

Who leads the charge of this young mob?

Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium
So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

Tours and shows and groupie whores
Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot, though he'd rather not
Forever been the elephant in the room
That everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group
That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
Will he make it? Was it worth it?
Did he win? Will he survive? The Rodeo",https://genius.com/Travis-scott-apple-pie-lyrics

Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it

All preachin' that they proud
I pull my zipper down and whip it out

It all started in the basement
Was an attic but we called that shit the basement

Gon' grab that fifth, grab that eighth, grab what you need
Blow that dope, don't get too high
From the Third Coast to the West Coast, come, take this ride
Let me tell the tale of how Jacques turned Scott
Over one lost trip to the sky
Let me tell the tale 'cause you told the tale
When you said I could make it this high
Who knew?
Goddammit, who knew?
The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue
You can really identify when you lookin' in your eyes
You ready to ride, that's true
When they look in my eyes, they see that real
How Scotty entired that juice, had my back against that wall
Every summer felt so cold, my daddy ain't comin' home 'til Fall
That's why my pimp game so moist, had that du-rag and all
Had a 20-year-old bitch in high school
Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do
On the south side of that H-O-U...
Hol' up, let's take it back to that room, no car but still had drive
Just a hundred niggas standin' outside
Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot

Never sit around, just workin', it was worth it
That's for certain, I deserve it
Lord knows we don't get tired, been through more dirt than a derby
Mama worked for AT&T, and we still ain't get that service
She stayed in/out the hospital, you know that made me nervous
Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent
If a bitch don't want me, don't need them still got my Jergens
And bitch, you can keep them herpes, go alert me

Wasted,Rodeo (Expanded Edition),2015.0,"Wasted or nah?
(Aw, aw, yeah, aw)
Are you wasted or nah? Wasted or nah? Wasted or nah?

Take a sip, drowning in this shit, coppers on my hip, I hold my head
I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now, it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accounts
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit-it
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like ""One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man""
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker
Young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yah

It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It-it-i-it's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end

There's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor
Can't handle these drugs
Wasted or nah?
It's only real niggas that can handle their shit, man
Wasted or nah?
Yeah (Wasted or nah?)
So, if you tryna get lit, wanna pour up?
Make sure you stay on our level, 'cause we go up
Let me see you up

Is you wasted, baby?
One shot, two shots and you still talking crazy (Trippy)
Three shots and you faded
Freaks coming out at night and they gettin' X rated
Four shots now she wanna do the clique
Any more shots she ain't gon' remember shit
Smoking on extendos, no clips
Project hoes going up in the Ritz (Trippy)
She gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bro
She just wanna fucking drink and chief all the weed up
Sexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime
Pour that purple over ice, call it turtle time
Shawty never been a hesitator
Got her going down on the elevator
Heard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her
Fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later
No magic trick, but I levitate her
With the magic stick, nothing less than great
When I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone
Don't text me later, no extra favors

It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It-it-i-it's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end

Hmm, weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say
All the products of a young man gone the long way
From the home that he knew, 'til he roamed where he at
And the phone break up, unknown wake up
Several one night stands, hung up phone, break up
If he fall, will he fly? Sure, wouldn't take much
For you to find out, jump, if you took that plunge
If not, we're in the same spot, how could you judge?
How could you judge? C-c-could you judge?",https://genius.com/Travis-scott-wasted-lyrics

With three hoes to a six-way?
Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that Ben-Gay
No more, goddamn
And Pops never gave me shit
But Pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where it looked so good outside
Like it ain't that serious
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killa tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous

500 dollars all we need, mama

All this gold on me, all these foes on us

Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving

All my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank
And a little more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top

Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait

Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine

Going nuts like a Payday, bitches thinking I'm crazy

I might need the distance, all I need is time, time
Can't even look at my phone line
Without a couple texts that I can't deny
Locked the phone, I had to close my eyes
Half the time, man, they tellin' lies
Who to trust? Man, I can't decide
Nowadays, we just don't reply
But they know my name, they compare it, still
We was busting seals before we had a mil'
We done had the grills before we had a deal
I'm a Houston nigga, that's what made me here
That's the curse, yeah

They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
But your momma always taught you put in work
Put in work, yeah, put in work, yeah

They might hit you with that Tyga, never do you right
Hit you with that Bill Cosby, thirty bitches overnight
I might have to hit my back up, hit that 713 side
I might have to pull a Tiger, I might have to crash my ride
Can't be like you niggas, no, can't be like you guys
I can't tell no stories, no, I can't tell no lies
All we do is money, do that money exercise
We just pay our taxes, pay our tax, don't pay no mind
That's the worst

They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah, yeah

Dance on the Moon,Owl Pharaoh,2013.0,"Where the weather is warm

Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn't working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can't wait
In the moonlight, you can't see my eyes
And when I'm off the things I can't think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can't choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don't wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I'm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy 'cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can't be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it can't fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
I'm headed to the moon 'cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain't no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and I'm doing my dance

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon

This where we find 'em
Same niggas that sniff Donna
And get drunk off the mimosa
Space green or designer
Hermes based off of drama
Call it spendin' yoda
Six years catch me trying yoga
In the Caesar Palace rocking a toga
Throwing a toga party
Chilling with your bitch and she extra naughty

Naked,Owl Pharaoh,2013.0,"I just wanna spread my wings
Life ain't what it seems
Someone in this cruel world
Escaping through the night
Look into my night, my thoughts
Naked in this cruel world

Tears dripping on my pillow, thoughts is in my head
See my dreams jump out my window, if I follow I'll be dead
And I been waiting all week to talk this shit but instead
Gon' have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand
And what we fucking for? For the lights in the night
The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
You can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga
I mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink
And she don't want to dance unless she drink
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?
Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links
Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E
Wonder why I see the stars in the afternoon
Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moon",https://genius.com/Travis-scott-naked-lyrics

Fuck moms think a nigga strung on dope, 
niggas thinkin' I can't
Shit you wanna know me?
Let me show your ass a little thing
Every time I walk in this bitch, fresh, feeling my fir for the fish
She want to hold a nigga dick for the piss
To the squat for the flick
Give me yo thoughts for a bit
Right, gon' hit the weed, gon' head just cough little bit

She want to get eloped, but I don't know yet
Pick up my fur after sitting, hanging in the coat check
Give me calls, she pick me off, I didn't hit the door yet
Damn, I'm sorry, but that bitch gon' be looking love sick
All on TV, crying to Maury, looking love sick
While I'm probably in the Rari, going Audi, fucking with molly
And we running on E, not the gas, but the molly
And she fucking with me so she came to have a party
Now she leaving with me, now you're love sick

So when you close your eyes
Do you picture us havin' a hell of a night? Oh

Dinner time, I'm dining out with a porn star
She remind me of home, L.A., our second home
See see we met at Leon, plenty empty bottles of Lonestar
Conversation was long, how she landed from Rome
Yeah, she did
Later on that night I got her back to the crib
Kicked off My Will&Rich and got her down to her skin
After all she got a little taste test of my kids
You know what, we used to dream about this
A couple models and cribs, way fresher than movies
Should of know it was fake, I could tell by the boobies
Treated life like a safe, load it up and then blew me
Yeah, she did
Head so good, it ain't even cost me
Woke up, she gone, look what I lost

Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told 'em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

Flashing neon lights trying to disturb and throw off my fucking judgment
Past, present, and future all melted in a nonending circle
Hear my words of temptation and redemption
They made me believe I could escape

It's parked outside been in the case
We walk outside feel like a mason
The preacher at the altar to tell you to have a taste
White wine, go ahead and sip your race
And walk in the closet and feel amazed
Ain't no retire, fall out of line and we get to pacin
And we gonna simply reside and fill up the space and
Took the travis may leave you around and place it
That's a classic, no other way to have it
Remember me and my brother slept on that mattress
And look how many bitches piled up on that mattress
I'm feeling too proud, cause all my niggas around
I gotta prove it right now waitin' for ‘em to feel it
It was cool for a second, but now might take a minute
Cause now I'm in the building, god damn, I'm about to kill it

Prada, Margiela or something hotter

A million dollars on my wardrobe, damier on my collars
Nothing short of an assassin, garments I stick my ass in
Kill niggas dead on the scene, no casket
Basking in my glory on the 37th story of a highrise
Ten hoes, nice thighs, mai tais
Serving umbrellas, but I knew the perfect fellow
So impressive, she would this Beretta if I let her
Have a blast of a lifetime, ass of a lifetime
I swear this dick I give her it'll last her a lifetime
A nice night selling hard rock in the pipeline
Put in their life and now they love a nigga longtime
Wednesday three freaks, Thursday four hoes
Five on Friday, yesterday six chicks
Today is the Sabbath I got seven going at it
On a mattress doing shit you can't imagine, I'm laughing

Had to leave from home, better off than hell
Skip the town somehow I ended up in jail
Loved the jail, it was better in the cell
Did a little crime, too that shit never ever tell
Somewhat I'm partying the third partying
First she started gargling, and end up swallowing
And went to class too and got some knowledge
You fucking with the devil like she over popping him
She love the pills too she over popping em'
She's standing in the line, just to do the line
Fuck is that fresher than a motherfucker
Tell me wanna fuck with us

Guess I gotta find the time just to do the crime
She did a lot of crimes sleepy hallow time
Headhunter been up for hours doing head crunches
Stop using your head and go head and just learn something
But her head is only as strong as her bread damn it

So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So let's rule the world tonight don't worry will show off

XXL Freshman Freestyle: Travis Scott,Freshman Freestyles (Class of 2013),2013.0,"Lifted, I'm feeling so gifted, tripping, I'm constantly falling
Channel view of the whole villa, plotting while burning a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whipping the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, since she's lamping with the trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line
Listen, pimping your bitches might visit my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit

Roll up the dub, club showin' us love

All my homies is here, so tell me who rollin' with us
From Chicago to Houston, to NY, yeah, we do this
We bumpin' the music, so get drunk and get stupid
You know nobody givin' a fuck 'bout (Last night)

You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about (If you don't give a fuck about)

Two twins and they naughty, they both ridin' shotty
It's a Friday and you know we ready to party
We hit the college in Malibu where it's hotties
They givin' us knowledge and while I'm drivin' they daddy's 'Raris
In the dark with no worries, we ain't in a hurry
I might just swerve and hit the curb (Skrrt)
We all too drunk to be scared (Skrrt)
Outta here, higher then the atmosphere
Yeah they ballin', but no Spalding
Make a killin', but no coffin
And when we make it, we gonna puke all over Vegas
And we were under the influence when we made this
So you gonna tell your DJ, ""DJ, DJ, play this"" (Last night)

It's the vendetta
No tarot cards, could tell me we trendsetters
Everybody out tonight, it couldn't have been better
Ain't nobody fight tonight except for the bartenders
We threw up our mom's dinner
So tell what you tryin' to do?
Me and my homies got the loot so we tryin' to boot
Her and her breast full off the booze, it's a party for two
Hotel room numbers and late night food runners
Summary of the whole summer, but can't seem to remember
From the fall of September, most of we can't remember
From the Spring to the Winter, couldn't tell you my dinner
Wish I could tell you what I did back in my past life
So how the hell you think I could tell you 'bout last night? (Last night)

Know they all throw they hands cause they fuck with us
So many bitches bob and weave but they don't bob enough
Now these bitches mad look what I done started up
Put that whip outside, I hit the key it started up
I told them kiss my ass while I hit the dust
I hit the weed then I hit the gas
So much gold you think a nigga broke
So we gon' pull of trunk first so that you niggas know
With an Irish centerfold but all she know is Adido
Damn my momma proud a nigga made it out the moat
Where the sun always shine yeah but not no more

Remember when my niggas told them owls came out at night
So now we bout to touch the sky, just to play in the night
Caught me standing now I'm in there standing, we staying the night
Daddy left but that nigga never said goodnight
Man that wasn't right, now I want all the power
Expected a lot from that coward
And any second I'm bound to wow ya, all them beats I dealt
For like two years momma all them beats I felt
I can massage my own dick I don't need your help
And I can crash my own whip, I don't need your belt
Tell me where the fuck was you when I couldn't feed myself
And all that wack shit help me be myself

So eager, to treat us like Caesars
I'mma catch amnesia, they gon' have they D's up

Had nobody to look to, older brother was iller
Seen the look in his eyes, then see straight to her soul

What I fantasize in due time that come alive
And we just pray to god we all be still alive
And we so fly tonight
Hope a nigga touch the sky tonight

Let 'em shine over you
And we dance across tonight

Shut the lights down when I’m in the place

I'm tryna' figure how I end up in these dry woods
About as high as I was, no clothes and I'm tied up
Look like life or death, and she staring me in eyes
So I had to wipe my eyes cause this shit ain't gone fly
So I had to go, broke out then I clocked out now it's time to roll
Should have know I shouldn't have boned but I had the dough
When I pulled out all the weed she pulled out the blow

But that ass might be outside
See all this gold right behind me, now that shit ain't no mirage
And she crazy like she Fonzy cause I won't have no menage
When I see me on the concrete man I swear I almost died
Somehow I jumped straight out my car seat not even I parked that shit outside

This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways

I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain’t what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world

Last week was the last week
I turned my back and let my ass greet you
Dropped out and subtracted some niggas
An' made more than my math teacher
Lookin' dead in the mirror, lookin' back how we did it
Makin' trips to them dealers, guess it paid off nigga
Sip this wine in fine clarity
Marijuana, the youth therapy
Swervin' on my old hoes that drove to insanity
I guess that was all straight out of vanity
To my kids, that was plan to be
That was all, the inhumanity
Life's an adventure, with a lot of action
Lucky I'm fresh, in the Dime fashion
A class act, called a class act
Funny, lookin' back, wonder where my class at

Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world

In the den, left it in the vessel

 fantasize  to blow girl

Scott, La Flame
Ill America baby

Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin'
Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, and Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your bitch just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'
In fact that nigga prolly missin'

In the lobby, then we 'dro codeinin', out in Abu Dhabi
Chain beamin', man, I hope you ain't anemic
Cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, it's just me and four women
And we all playin' hockey
Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane
Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass
Fuck up the flow, nothin' but fam cause niggas be hoes
You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ
When I stock it up and then go
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs
My nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho house
Spillin' booze where the Barbie at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga
Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at?
If Scottie ain't totin' or swimmin' in women
He writin', producin' and scorin' and filmin'

Lost a lot of money on this side
Had my first kiss on this side
Learned a lot of shit about this side
Lately I been thinking 'bout this side
Tryna get back on this side
Tryna get back what's been mine
I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feelin' of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner, had shit tight
Doin' all the drugs, had to get right
If I could bring my partner back, it'd be nice
He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice
He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side

This side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side

Always, always this side
This side, this side, this side

Cop lights, no lights, cause them bills it was overdue
Skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking walks to the side of the moon
Gotta take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, don’t wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I’m on some popular shit, come look in my eyes to get a fix
We just gon' cruise, hit the brews, don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
Got the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can’t be realer, me and my niggas by the villa
She in that white dress it can’t fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink it like she got no liver

Moonlight move when a nigga dance
They peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn’t working out
Kiss my momma for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can’t wait
In the moonlight you can’t see my eyes
And when I’m off the things I can’t think
Damn I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can’t choke
When they recognize a real nigga skill
Ride with me, down with me, kept me afloat

Cactus Trails Escape,UnKnown,2020.0,"Now, I’m lost, Jacques Berman Webster II, most definitely lost
I see the needle sway and they tell me I’m all I got. This is my name, so, this is who I must be, I should listen. This is just an intro to myself, that much is clear. And if I can go get away from myself, I might find something worth bringing back home, but my problem is that my mind is moving at max speed. The air is moving slower the faster my feet move. My Air Max 270s keep me grounded to this hypothetical floor. I’m hovering at the layer between what’s real and what I made up, which are the same being that much I know. And I should be lost on purpose, intention, made it across the universe like perfect, made you wish rehearsed it because it really does look so perfect. My imagination is a burden that has me lost and uncertain, but what nourishes me is Houston. What’s the difference between being lost and escaping? An attention. What’s the difference between a ladder and an elevator? Labor. Feel free to feel lost, it’s free, there’s no cost. The cacti fell over on the path, that’s how I noticed I can fly. The truth is, your always home. I create a city with no buildings or people, just deep breaths and daydreams, nightmares and ancestors’ energies fly and memory. I can get away, I can make it, whether it’s outdated and I’m Jaded, or I become the air and I made it. It maxed out our system like I twisted the mission and made the decision to be free or like other people who can’t see it, they call it, they say I’m lost now. When I laugh my breath mixes with clouds and causes a storm, because I’m not lost, I escaped. Keep your feet where you stand, everything else has escaped",https://genius.com/Travis-scott-cactus-trails-escape-lyrics
