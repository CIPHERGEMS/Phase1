Prince Ali,Aladdin (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2019.0,"Make way for Prince Ali!
Say hey! It's Prince Ali!

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a brand new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
You're gonna love this guy

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Show some respect, boy, genuflect, down on one knee
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Friday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He's faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali
Fellas, he's got

He's got seventy-five golden camels

Woo, uh-huh, now the ladies, what he got?

Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
When it comes to exotic-type mammals, everybody help me out!

He's got a zoo
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie
[GENIE & 
WOMEN

Prince Ali! Handsome is he
There's no question this Ali's alluring
Ali Ababwa
Never ordinary, never boring
That physique!
Everything about that man
How can I speak, weak at my knees
Just plain impresses
You yummy boy!
So, get on out in that square
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder
Adjust your veil and prepare
He's about to pull my heart asunder
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali, 
oops
And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys

He got the monkeys, a bunch of monkeys

And to view them he charges no fee

He's generous, so generous

He's got 10,000 servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him!
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!
Prince Ali!
Prince Aaa-

We waitin' for you!
We're not going 'til you go!
*SULTAN begins to move his hand.*
You can do it!
*SULTAN finally taps his hand.*
There it is!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa

Heard your princess was hot! Where is she?
And that, good people, is why he got all cute and dropped by

Arabian Nights (2019),Aladdin (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2019.0,"Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where you wander among every culture and tongue
It's chaotic, but hey, it's home

When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night


As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars
With the cardamom-cluttered stalls
You can smell every spice
While you haggle the price
Of the silks and the satin shawls

Oh, the music that plays
As you move through a maze
In the haze of your pure delight
You are caught in a dance
You are lost in the trance
Of another Arabian night

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
Like Arabian dreams
This mystical land of magic and sand
Is more than it seems

There's a road that may lead you
To good or to greed through
The power your wishing commands
Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold
Well, your destiny lies in your hands
Only one may enter here
One whose worth lies far within
A diamond in the rough

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They seem to excite, take off and take flight
To shock and amaze
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes",https://genius.com/Will-smith-arabian-nights-2019-lyrics

I got a powerful urge to help you out

Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this

Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly

Miami,Big Willie Style,1998.0,"Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play
, okay
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me n' Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

Just the Two of Us,Big Willie Style,1997.0,"Now Dad this is a very sensitive subject

Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me: MiB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there is now gone
Black suit with the black RayBans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back

On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like *BOOM* black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies

Mr. Nice Guy, 
relationship advice guy
Light on the vices, 
priceless smile
Look at the eyes, got the look
Of a survivor, husband, father
Dissed by Eminem, but did it bother him?
Yup, but he classy
Big Will just did another 20 mill', walk right past E
I'm a nice guy, why y'all harassin me, huh?
On the radio they be over-exaggeratin
So blase with they lies, they be aggravatin me
Agitatin me, but they be waitin and hatin
And they be makin me crazy but I be takin it patiently
People be messin with me, testin me, f'n with me
I wanna send a message to 'em, teach 'em a lesson quickly
They publically addressin me, disrespectin me heavily
They better be lucky the way my blessings affected me, but
{*deep breath*} Calm down Willie
You don't wanna go drop the bomb now Willie
Keep a nice flow for your mom down in Philly
On the news you go if you blow and act silly, y'know?

He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all

You're lucky I ain't make you the whole damn rhyme
Wendy Williams, you don't know me
I'm not your punchin bag, you gon' blow me
Off, girl, better leave me alone
Before I buy your radio station and send you home
Yo, it's a warnin shot over the bow
Truth be told, this ain't my style
You gotta understand some stuff a man can't allow
You better chill 'fore you climb a tree you can't get down
Okay - people dissing Will sat on a wall
People dissing Will had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put none of their careers together again
You get it?

It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something

When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm

To the Clique,UnKnown,2018.0,"Uh, uh, it's twenty years of swag, y'all just witnessed
Let me remind everybody who Will Smith is
Rappers make it rain, let they money hit ya
If I throw my money up, shit, I'd probably kill a stripper
The illest, realest, Big Will-est
Down with the man in charge of where Uncle Phil is
Everybody wanna do Will Smith numbers
I don't know if your life got that many summers
I got inspired, quickly, I unretired, the Fresh Prince just re-wired
I'm slightly modified, but still
People dancing and shaking and moving and wiling
I feel like I'm an alien, really, kind of an island
I might fly to China for nothing, find a designer
Fix up a crib with me, my mom and Obama
Murder all over the globe, guilty, your honor
Rather become a Mormon, marrying Halle, Rihanna
I'm an anomaly, do drama or comedy
I could play Muhammud Ali or a white lady probably
Still, twenty years of swag y'all just witnessed
Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business
Rebirth of the click track, ridiculous
What I charge for a feature, man, that's expensive
Cause y'all be doing features, I be doing Features
So many tickets that theaters need bleachers
More information from me than from most teachers
More inspiration from me than from most preachers
But wait, wait, wait, wait, truly, just for the record
Directors make movies, I make directors
Y'all dinner table: ""What y'all learn today?""
My dinner table: ""What y'all earn today?""

Here it comes the party of a lifetime
31st of December
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me
What's gonna happen?
Don't nobody know
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street
Man who the hell cares?
Just don't stop the beat
No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight

2-0-0-0, the Will 2 K
The new millennium, yo excuse me Willennium

Hold up it is

Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down
, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one

I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year 2G
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, 
waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor

Come on everyone, new millennium

And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock
At 12 o'clock

Party Starter,Lost and Found,2005.0,"Big Willie!
Get on the floor!

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

Dance, an afrodesiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulatin musical tracks
I thought I was just gon' come out at night and get a brew and relax
But no! Uh-uh, when you the party starter
It's like, you on call, you what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the border to the door and
Shock 'em when it's boring, get on the floor!
Uhh, it's the groovicide bomber
Mic in my vest tight, strapped to my chest like
I'm a run up in the party holla and
Be like, oh! Fulfilling my calling
Big, Will, that's my name
Writing, rhymes, that's my game
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same
Look, just write your number right next to your name girl

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

He was raised in the days when the roof was raised and
Every rap occasion, new and amazing
The back of the stage is amazed and gazing
Praying for the day they can one day praise him
Studied the ways of the game and made it
Came through the maze and the haze and played it
Perfect, dazed any person hated
And cursed 'em, he was unfazed, he waited
It was worth it, he never retaliated
He saved it, slaving, on the road blazing
Dazed when he was low, nothing could raise him
And came to the show and something uncaged in him
Like the pope of this party crusade
I'm like braids, that's never gon' fade, ya heard?
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade
Throw me into the rave like you threw a grenade, boom!

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know back when rap was smart and multi-layered
We can rap without A&R's and ultimatums, damn!
Now today I say the praise, I long for the good old days
When the party was all about partying
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I call my pen
The big question, should I run to mine a vittle
Food for thought or, dumb the rhyme a little?
But Will if you come too high
That'll alienate folks, and they won't buy it
Yo, look, people getting trapped in the track
And they be clapping, even when the rappin is wack
And what happened? When did we get happy with that?
He old-fashioned? Yup! Well let's be happy he back, ya heard me?

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning",https://genius.com/Will-smith-party-starter-lyrics

Michelangelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was countin me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes

September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin my time awakin, turnin my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said ""Daddy now we killin 'em back,"" right right

I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby

And why, did her uncles have to molest her
And why, did all them cops have to be shootin to kill?

Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate
And why the {bleep} can't love, seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say

Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be drivin you crazy

Trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depth of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray-Bans
I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hanging without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again
Monumental it's the black suits running in
Chorus 1:
(Nod Ya Head! The Black Suits Comin')
Let me see you (Nod Ya Head! The Black Suits Comin')

Yo it's this chick right
Serleena, making me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be tripping like
Threatening me and my mens
Trying to get the light
Thinking she's superwoman
But black kryptonite finishing whatever you start son
The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along
Cause K is back and he hype
What? Bring it on!
Wanna brawl with me? Trying to brawl with me?
Unh Unh What What
Yo... what what... then... lemme... see you just...

Like this, let me see you (Nod Ya Head!)
Check it, Check it
Yo, case closed
Erase my foes
Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now
Who you think you calling huh?
One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right there
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and proving they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you
Chorus 3:
(Nod Ya Head! the Black Suits Comin')
Come on! (Nod Ya Head! the Black Suits Comin')
Like this, let me see you (Nod Ya Head! the Black Suits Comin')

Candy,Big Willie Style,1997,"Excuse me Miss, can we chat for a second
I'd ask how you doin', but you fine I reckon
Wait, do you have a man, cause I ain't' into homewrecking
No? ...Aight cool just checking
Look, from a hundred yards you caught my eye
An all my boys said I didn't have the heart to say hi
I'd like to have your number you don't have ta give it now
But if you diss me while they lookin I'm a never live it down
Y'know what I mean, Aww damn, my name's Will
Maxine. Pleasure to meet you, look here's the deal
Can I sit? Thanks, now I don't mean to objectify
But this the metaphore that crossed my mind
You sweet, good enough to eat
Make a brother wanna TLC--Creep
A brother can't sleep
It's like a kid fallin for you
So here's my own private nickname, I'm a call you

Candy (no doubt, do you wanna bounce?)
It's the same feelin I always seem to get around you
Let's get this started now
Let's get this started now

I ain't gonna lie to you, I remember layin eyes on you
All I thought about was livin life beside you, Boo
All I wanna do is be the perfect guy to you
Tell you the truth, it's like (Candy) cause I'm feelin like its callin me
You're tryin ta hold on, but fallin
Seem quite far ta me
I stay strong but it's hard to be
Cause somethin bringin out the dog in me
(It's like Candy) when I'm keepin my zone
Chat on the phone, I lower my tone
Steady plottin on takin ya home
Gettin all inside of your dome, makin you moan
You shoulda known (It's like Candy)
As I'm seein you here, Mommy I know your peepin my stare
And feelin my glare, brother thinkin bout unrollin the bear
Strokin your hair, (Touchin me where?) Yeah there


I know the deal, I talked to Mary Jane and she said
Your ex-boyfriends Mike and Ike are both Lemonheads
I ain't tryin ta player hate girl I know
That you go with Bazooka Joe
Now you know he don't love you like that
He tryin ta get a Reeses piece of the Kit-Kat
Really hon, what he need is a jawbreaker
Cause I'm the one that'll love you baby Now and Later
Be my Peppermint Paddy with a Hundred wishes
An I'll be your Hershey daddy with a hundred kisses
Get the Twins M&M's, they booked all outta flights today
Me an you can Starburst to the Milky Way
I don't care what it cost, girl a Hundred Grand
We could snicker all night at my Jolly Ranch
Just me and you, I'll call your friends up too
Cause I could get my friends Babe Ruth and Charleston Chew",https://genius.com/Will-smith-candy-lyrics
So Fresh,Willennium,1999.0,"(let's listen to this dramatic show
Which was popular in the early days of radio)

Ha ha, unh, yeah yeah
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh
Little taste of the old school
Jazzy Jeff, yo, break it down one time
Say what?
Unh, unh, unh, unh

One for the treble, two for the bass
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince back up in your face
Me and Jeff again, ""Oh my"" you say
1985 to the Y2K
The new millenium, propehicies, I'm fulfillin' 'em
Everywhere I go, people be yelling ""yo, that's Will and them""
(so fresh)
I check the rhyme like Quest
Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L
King of swing, and I rock well
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher
Stature of a rapper slash actor
Back to the future on wax
The future of rap
Tap like Gregory Hines, read the headlines
Hip-hop's number one son still shines
Cause I'm (so fresh)

Big Will is (so fresh)
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh)
West Philly is (so fresh)
Ladies and Gentlemen
Biiiiiz... Marrrr... KIE!

Yes y'all and to the funky beat and
Everytime you hear me rhyme, y'all be freakin'
The B-I-Z will wreck it, R-O-C-K it
You're guaranteed to like me, for what I am sayin'
To all those other emcees that be tryin' to get the info
Forget the rest cause I'm the best, and I'm a nympho-
Maniac, insaniac, I'll put you in a trance and
Always keep it tight, cuz, no matter what type was
In, you know I'm fresh in flavor
Yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' 'bout me
The R-K-I-E in the place to be
I recognize and hypnotize, everytime I tenderize
I specialize and open eyes, to make you realize
That you've been rocked with Jeff's plain skills
The diobolocal, and my man Will
And we're (so fresh)

Ha, Big Will is (so fresh)
Biz Mark is (so fresh)
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh)
Biz, do it
Whoo, for the old school
Unh, unh, ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Rrricky... D!

Well once upon a time eccentric head shorty
Where people wore pijamas and went to bed early
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout
Tried to help lead black folk the right route
Delayed
Negative voices, many, once in prison for unwise choices that he once
Made*
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick)
So check the gift, everything no negative
That's what happens when you steer black folk away from
Negative*
Not to mention chasin' charts, killin' 'em
There'll be a member of the Biz-Mark, Will, and Rick
Demise sent, can't mess with the mindset
Come run with us, December 1999 said
It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just rainy days
I love you so, how much, you'll never know
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love, you took your love, you took your love
You took your love away from me

Will Smith
Biz Mark

Smoking from your unseen fire
Walk in the place

I made a beat to help you light it up
You need a beat to make you light it up

We smart and naughty and we get lit

Big Willie Style,Big Willie Style,1995.0,"This one goes out to all the big willies

Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you living this large
I be smooth like Debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad
And we be flossing down the fifteen
My whole aura gleaming
Who that kid in the green V?
Envy brother scheming
I ain't thinking bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m
With my speakers tweakin'
Freaking off this weekend
In Las Vegas, boss players all across the board
Move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight, rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight

Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

I'm in a five star casino shutting crap tables down (boom)
Non betting willie watchers standing around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes looking at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare having drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civilians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will, Nas, Escobar, J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit

Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representing like it's ladies night
Coming right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink
Rocks in the link, In the drop with a mink
Like my- don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam
Blowing up spots then running off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passing
Breaking you down like fractions
While we be rapping about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it platinum
With Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace
With a sweet smell
This female leading the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will, let the champagne spill
Is it a man's thing for real?
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal?

Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

Well now it's looking like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pulling up in the six making brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name, Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matching gators
Swerving lane
In pole position rolling deep like a coalition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew looking clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P
Eating grapes under the A.C
Big willie style is how we do it

Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?

Lost & Found,Lost and Found,2005.0,"Original - a first form from which varities arise
An authentic work of art as opposed to an imitation, or reproduction

Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
I spit heat rock, and I ain't talkin rollin
Soon as the beat knock I'm crown controllin
When I hear y'all that's an awful sound
I don't ride beats, I take 'em off the ground
Land 'em somewhere, show 'em the town
Even on foreign ground let 'em know I'm around
I don't follow e'rybody when it's time to rap
At one time e'rybody thought the world was flat
Sounds like you? That was my intention
I paid dues, now dudes pay attention
I live for it, even though the flicks is hittin
Crib's sick, you can see the booth from the kitchen
Speak on it, cause I saw it happen
This is hip-hop, dawg I ain't just rappin
Y'all lookin at a real MC man
You couldn't check a mic from me

Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around

Let's talk about rhyme capability
Let's talk about hip-hop versatility
Let's talk about takin the game beyond
How the hell we gon' have a battle of wits? Trick you unarmed
Let's talk about love for the game
I mean real love, back before there was fame
I'm real with it, I ain't claimin to reign
But when y'all talk about rap, y'all gon' start sayin my name
F'real though, I ain't playin
Plenty of y'all love a brother, just scared to say it
Yo, first ever rap Grammy
Let's talk about the only reason yo' ass went to Miami - yup!
Truck with rims - check; throwback jersey - check
Champagne bottles - check; lots of models - DAMN!
That's the list for 90% of y'all videos and songs
Am I WRONG?!

Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around

Lost - when you a slave to the biz
With no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids
Found is when your lyrics are a test of time
And your mind hear that your spirit is blessed divine
Lost is when you rhyme 'til your throat gets sore
But you don't even believe what you say no more
Found is when you bleed heart into the mic
And the pain you sustain it could change a life
Lost is when you hide behind the freedom of speech
Well sure you're free to do it, but what it mean to do it
Did you mean to do it? Did you need to do it?
Did you take time to think about the seed you ruined? (HUH?)
Found is Esco, Dead Prez and them
Found is Lauryn Hill
Found is Rakim
Found can be you if you felt the message
And ask yourself this question

Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now

Ms. Holy Roller,Lost and Found,2005.0,"Mic check, one two one two
This dedicated to an old friend of mine, Michelle
She a holy roller now, turned over a new leaf
Now e'rything old gon' burn (please help me not do it again)

Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell

Yo, I've been down with Jesus since Sunday school and Easter speeches
The, bible was survival that's what my grandma would teach us
Since I was 5 I've been dyin and tryin to read it
And when I did, it redefined it
Now you was 34 when you found Jesus after your life fell to pieces
Wife two times with two guys, now enlightened the speeches
Seem to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher
Took your whole life to reach ya, now I'm a triflin creature?

Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell

C'mon, if I die right this second, I reckon that God
Would simply check into my life and times, dissectin my rhymes
He'll see how I've been leadin his troops
You can't do dirt your whole life and say - OOPS!

Now where was Jesus when you was cheatin and you was deceivin me?
Where was Jesus when you was greedy, your lawyers was bleedin me?
Where was Jesus when every weekend, a new man was livin wit'chu
Oh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin you!
Now where was Jesus when you was lyin and you was betrayin me?
When I was tryin to make it and you was hatin delayin me huh?
Where was Jesus when the ICE was thrillin ya?
Oh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin ya!

If I ain't know Jesus, ain't no tellin where we'd be
It's been nights I felt like beasts, I needed to fight to release it
I'm in the limelight, it's hot and the heat is ceaseless and
Holdin my tongue while lil' bums cut me to pieces
The only reason's cause I studied the life of Jesus and
Ventin with my pen and intendin to write and release it
But when an ex-friend slight me and slam me pretendin
I hate it, I can't stand, damn it I really resent it
I always strive to be righteous, my version of God
The reason why I never write rap verses with curses inside
The reason I never purposely hurt person I've replied
Many teachers of God, searchin to reach as a God
Pondered the mysteries of why you be dissin me
I adore you, all I hope for you is freedom from mysery
You made mistakes and blunders, you breakin from under but yo
If I'm goin to hell, it's makin me wonder

The greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the name of God
This country was founded by the Puritans for the express purpose of oppressin free worship
Your attitude is the same arrogant fearful fundamentalism
That fueled the hatred, of the Crusades and the attacks of 9/11
If we are not allowed to worship God as groups and individuals free from persecution
And respect for tolerance, there's only one outcome

Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell, yo
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell",https://genius.com/Will-smith-ms-holy-roller-lyrics

Hot like nitro.. cool as ice though
That type of dichotomy, y'all know it's gotta be
Who else could it be BUT me?
Rub your eyes, behold the Big Williest
Dream supreme beam straight from Philly it's the
Eclectic female attractor
Rapper slash actor, right back at ya
And to the next millenium many come but few are chosen
See me servin like the U.S. Open
Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster
.. go and ask a movie usher
Who is he? He or she - SFP
Movies, CD's, and TV's, but uh-uh
Cause today I take a break from that
As I roll where a tank of gas'll take me at
I used to rock these red Iroc Z's
Now I rock the MB's with the twelves and V's
Today, sun high.. up in the sky
From N.Y. la la to M.I., just cruisin

Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)

Zero to sixty, flossin - 90 degrees
Sony cartridges, ten CD's each
Reach to the beach, Southside leanin
It ain't often I'm off and I'm feenin for the -
- top down, drop down got me hot now
Heated up can't stop now
What up cutie wop? Sure sure is cookin yo
I know I'm spoken for, can't hurt lookin though
Pop CD's, B-I-G's, then 2Pac's
While cruisin the blocks, hittin the hot spots
Got my celly on O-F-F
Golden Arches got my belly goin oh yes yes
So let's just - ease on down ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip as I'm rollin my whip
Cause today I'm on the solo creep
Man, why you think I be workin so hard all week?
I'm just cruisin

Sun settin in the S-K-Y
Must say I've had the best day I'm..
Tryin to find a exit, a place to chill
Not too hectic, so I can spend some time with Will
Let the, sunshine to the moonlight clear my mind
Soul search, see what I find
If I'm bein the best lover and friend
Am I being the best daddy I can?
I pray I am, and I feel good today
Reminisce as I'm cruisin around the way
Roll tight past the park where I used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin my way, still growin
Petrol blowin, moon soon showin
Gots to get goin, losin the light
And ""The Freaks Come Out at Night,"" right

Yeah see usually y'all stand off on the side
Y'know you're a lil' embarrased or whatever
But this one of them joints for e'rybody
So get up on up, but keep it simple, slide

If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide - that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide - that's all you gotta do

Now we all know the boy at the club, all liquored up
Or with the bub tryin to pick 'em up
Whack dancin, wookin pa nub
His shirt too bright, pants too tight, boy settle down
Now I ain't just messin wit'chu
I got better things to do, I'm tryin to help
I got a lesson for you, I know you do the best you could do
Wanna get next to boo? Then the less you do, the better
Cause women equate dance with sex
They gon' see you, and be like - next
But you gon' be like, hold up ma! - next
But she gon' be like, uh-uh pah! - next
Now looka here, rule number one, know your name
It ain't Usher, Justin, Hammer? Then we can touch ya
Rule number two, never do a dance you can't do
Why stupid? You can't do it


So I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night right
And this dude out on the floor OD'n, just way overdancin
You know so his mami wanna holla at me

She thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie
She said she watched my TV show and I was very silly
Told her I was from Philly, she looked at me said really?
And judgin from her t-shirt I could tell that she was chilly
So I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta
She said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta
She said she glad I met her, let's go somewhere together
She said she'd ride in my car, cause she knew my car was better
The conversation cookin, attention gettin tooken
My Spidey Sense is tinglin, I felt somebody lookin
Now who this brother lookin, and now he runnin bookin
I'm mad I'm like the fisherman I almost had my hook in
I figured I should get up, and quickly clear my head up
Rosetta got a man, got me feelin kinda set up
Now dude was really fed up, and yo he wouldn't let up
Homey if I hit you you might never ever get up
Now he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome
Comin like Mel Gibson like I had his girl from ransom
Pedro wanna go outside
Yo amigo, tranquilo, slide


Now rule number three is easy
Please re-member that you ain't on Beach Street
The sweet beat you ain't tryin to win no TV
Another dude get a move no need to outdo it
Rule number four, out on the floor
Don't be doin moves that don't nobody do no more
Draw too much attention it be adventureous on the floor
There's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?
This may be hilarious
But rule number five is SERIOUS, uh
It's a shame to even have to discuss
But it's no lip bitin or pelvic thrusts, I mean
You think that move'll put the sting on her?
You too close, tryin to put a ring on her?
You don't know that girl, don't cling on her
And don't put your thing on her, cool?",https://genius.com/Will-smith-if-u-cant-dance-slide-lyrics
Chasing Forever,Big Willie Style,1997.0,"Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin through the venitian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question, if the pradda dressin and the Gucci
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever

I wanna stay with you forever
I wanna spend all my life with only you
I wanna stay, lets stay together
Chasing forever, with only you

Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene
Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream
Or casin' the scene
Fore I die I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever


Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad
Havin more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever",https://genius.com/Will-smith-chasing-forever-lyrics
I Wish I Made That/Swagga,Lost and Found,2005.0,"Yo, ain't no better man for this hype track
Just the veteran taking the mic back
David Letterman even said he like that track man
Even though he ain't a rap fan
Black radio, they won't play though
Ever since ""Summertime,"" they ain't liked none of mine
Even though the fans went out and bought enough
I guess they think Will ain't hard enough
Maybe I should just have a shootout
Run up in the bank, bustin', grabbin' all the loot out
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
Right on TV so y'all can see me
Just ignorant, attacking, actin' rough
I mean, then, will I be Black enough?
Oh wait, maybe I'll jack a truck
Full of cigarettes, guns and drugs and stuff

Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to ""drop it like it's hot""
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to ""drop it like it's hot""
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got

I always envied how y'all rocked with Dre and The Chronic
The way that 2Pac, Biggie, 50 and Jigga got it
A lot like L.L., Chuck D, Slick and Dougie
I think y'all love me, but y'all place other rappers above me
And I don't know if you feel my flow
And be at my show and you'll see where I should go
On the charts of rhyme, arts and thoughts in rap form
Damn it, I expanded the platform
Damn it, this cat's on a rap song
Yeah, it ain't no braids or plaits on
Ain't on stage with no gats on
You know I'm afraid, getting' my act on
It might have stunted my growth but I wanted them both
And I hope that it would be less tougher
You do two things and then they both gonna suffer
I chose to act and it broke my heart not to rap
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back

Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to ""drop it like it's hot""

Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
Do you see the little drop to the left, huh, yo
Baseball cap, Timbs when I walk
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
Do you see me sorta glide when I slide
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
Fish still bite just like this. right, right
Do you know what it mean
When you see a dude's chick on TV gleamin', huh?
Know what it mean to be on the screen
And in the audience, Ali beamin', yo!
I must have a 'S' on my chest
I recovered from the Wild Wild West, yes!
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle
Now I'm back on the saddle

All you see that you see when you seeing me
You ain't seeing all to be seen
Cause there's more for you to see
Than when you see me on the scene in my media machine
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
I had a bonafide downside frown
With the swagga not around in my life
Bank account found minimal amounts
When countin' cause of my now ex-wife
I had to bore thick walls and all that
Endure pitfalls and all that, fallin', callin' for help
With no call back, 
where was ya'll at, gimme the ball back
I got my swagga back

(Show 'em how to do it, Will)

Observe the high roller, mic controller
Number one hip-hop son, call me solar
Why? 'Cause I shine, praise the Big Willie, I'm
Raised in Philly, I, daze and thrillin' ya
Don't be silly, ya, can't see me
Again I'm killin' ya on MTV
Just get with it my friend (Damn another award?)
Dat kid done did it again (Oh my Lord!)
Da fantastic, boombastic
Gettin' ten times hotter than any you other cats get
Practice, you lack this, I'm the real McCoy
First with Jeff I was startin'
Then with Martin I'm a Badboy
See more green than David Banner
More juice than Tropicana
You hawkin' me like Atlanta
MCs just flee, they rightfully concerned
Big Will wants the mic back, it's my turn to burn

Baby, uh, baby, uh
Verse two, verse two

I'm back attackin' the mic, hype like a Viking
Strikin' like a python, blaze like Jon
A hip-hop icon, MC radical
Back on track from my rap/act sabbatical
Nine-point-six on the richter, kicked her
Yeah so slick the, chicks quick to, flip tha
Bright glance and the tight pants for the slight chance
""Big Willie can we get one dance?""
Why yes, you may an', I'm just sayin'
That dress you playin', is A-Okay an'
This is your chance for, at least it could be
Me, you an your girlfriend on the dancefloor, ménage-boogie
On the scene I fronts and dashin', fashion
Lost my cream once, now I'm stashin', cashin'
Countries and currencies, like a true Don
It's a new time and it's mine, watch me shine
The way I blaze through the days and nights
How I deal with the craze, my momma raised me right
Whether I'm on stage or in the studio booth
A hundred proof, raisin' the roof, raisin' the roof

(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me

(He know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me

(Y'all know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me

Seven continents I bruise all cruise
Adidas, kilts, or bamboos and no shoes
Eskimos to Aborigines
I'll test the flows of the world's MCs
I'll hit you out the ball park, you just all talk
Don't be lookin' at my script, you can't play my part
See I'm a rapper that's a actor, you act rap with no heart
The way that I compose those flows like Mozart
Gets somthing like a symphony, when I'm orchestratin' 'em
Ever since the days of me and Jeff at the Paladium
All my life I've been the cream of the crop
Shoppin' a dream, now I got a crop full of cream
I raise mics for the flow of it, you know the show of it
Not the Benz 600 four door of it
I'm a rhyme regardless of earnin'
Long as my heart keeps yearnin' I gots to keep burnin'

Here come the butter baby
(Bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby

What? What? What? What?

Here come the butter baby
Bringing it smooth and hot
Got the staff from K-B
Singing this groove a lot
So I got my spiral notebook
Drink and pen
And then abracadabra y'all, done it again
Married but I flirt a little
Siking the ladies
In the videos I be bringing it like Mike in the 80s
Level of success based on my level of risk
You've been yelling for the lyricist
Then reveling this
Old school hip-hop a beat and a rhyme
Some chapters and some verses, you seek and you find
Look no further here I go, Big Will, Johnny Inferno
Flame by hip-hop burns eternal
All aboard on my train to fame
Rappers hoping that it'd rain
Trying to stop the game
But rain can't stop me
I got a coat in the crib
Hey look y'all yellow bricks quit beefin' at the whiz, what?

Lil' Kim, Big Will give a damn how y'all feel
Hate, but on the real, Big Will is seven mill
If I wasn't on top I'd have a lot less ends
I'd most likely have a lot less friends
You know what I learned, let them keep talking
Uh-huh, pull up in an Azure and watch them keep walking
Kim haters be making me wanna flip and react
No-no-no, chill Will and let me do that (alright)
Huh, I gotta eat can't get with broke cats
You know the queen like to be where the money at
I'm the mother, y'all like adopted in this
Call us Mr. and Mrs. Papadapolis
When will y'all learn?
Y'all just interns
You gon' get what you earn, just wait your turn
I rock telephones with the TV screens
So I can have real phone sex
Know what I mean?

It's the fun king, I've been doing one thing
Running things for years, give me one swing
And it's out of here, crack!
Over the fence ladies and gents
Keeping rappers impressed but depressed by my current events
Yes Lord!
Big Will swinging the best sword
What'cha flexing for, don't be testing me boy
Messing with me boy, you're stepping on the root of a daisy
I have you're girl saying
Will why you do that to my baby?
Yo Will, what they looking stupid in the face for?
What? I can't have rocks the size of a baseball
Trust me when I cop I make sure mine cut glass
Never spend my last, like a crack head for the blast
Y'all can kiss my ass acting like you know me
You ain't got a Rolley, take this one here you owe me
All in together now, wrists looking better now
Screw greyhound bound, I'm getting cheddar now
Burrrr! When she step up in the scene!
Who! Ice gleam, y'all scream, ""Bow to the Queen!""
Ring on her finger mad phat

I’m dying not faecitious
I was drinking, she was drinking
We was dancing wasn’t thinking
It’s not excuses
Look the truth is
I just cut loose is
Just what grey goose produced this?
I swear if we get through this
I’ll never ever do this again
Baby let me prove it
Please don’t throw me deuces
Look at me
Boo pleas look at me
My words keep coming out crookedly
But they can’t capture look and see
I’ll do anything

I’m passionate

Loretta,Lost and Found,2005.0,"This is a true story
{*""Ms. Loretta""* - 2X}

Loretta, wrote a love letter to a stranger
Thought that he would change her life
Thought she would be his wife
Ohhh Loretta, never ever met him no danger
Her love for him sustain her
Thought that he would change her life

Ms. Loretta, a young girl, I never really met her
A fun girl, a real go-getter I heard
A gold Jetta a fool with books a nerd
And so I'm told hooked on my every word
Oh so bold, a love letter, cleverly worded
In her jacket pocket, wrapped inside a platinum locket
In the shape of a heart, with pictures of me
Had it inscribed, no us - no him - then no me
She fell in love with ""The Prince of Bel-Air""
Fantasy was to see me and to be with me there
So she wrote a love letter to me, and then she signed it Loretta
She said I gotta go get him, Will is my soul mate
We gotta be together, how could we not be together?
Oh wait, if I send the letter
I mean how will I be sure that they give it to him
What if they don't give it to him, that'd ruin everything
I gotta take it to him myself


She packed all that she owned into the back of her Jetta
Her backpack and her cell phone and her love letter
Most of her stuff was done up with, pictures of me on it
With the phrase ""it's gonna be"" on it
Her mother beggin her, please come home
And then, Loretta resentin her, leave me alone ma
I won't leave my destiny unfilled
You just jealous because daddy ain't as sweet as my Will, click
To the front gate at NBC
In June or July, backstage at MTV
She would drive any place that they mentioned I'd be
Told herself strive for love and God eventually
Would give me to her, and her to me
This was meant to be
14 months outside every event that I be at
She still keep missin me
And now she, gettin high with more frequency now
Rage rumblin inside, got to be with me now
Then she heard I married Jada - she took her love letter out
And she wrote down P.S. - I hate her


Kodak Center, where the Oscars is at
She sleep, gettin woke up by the cops in the back
By a dumpster, didn't even greet 'em with fear
Grinnin ear to ear, said my husband meetin me here
You know him, he nominated for his flick Ali
And it'll be hell to pay if y'all pick on me
Don't put that stick on me, hell no I'm not leavin
Get your hands off, don't make them things click on me
Kickin and screamin, you intervenin
This is fate, Mr. what you mean that I ain't?
What you mean it seem like I ain't? Ooh you like my mom
And our love gon' survive y'all hate
God gon' take, me to my destiny
Y'all only are seein one side of me, Will gon' see the rest of me
He gon' see the best of me if I could only get him next to me
He gon' bring my blessings to me, I know it!

Eclipses, shooting stars, turn ya head
Volcanoes erupted, rage in the sea
Ain't the second coming of Christ
It's the first coming of me
They say if you damn up the Nile
It would throw off the rotation of the Earth
Well, messing with me is worse
Feel the rain, button up you overcoat
Watch the illadelph bad boy go quote for quote
Well, ya'll want the best, well, I'm right here
You looking for competition, ain't no one there
Ya'll in the stands dissin', kickin' dirt and missin'
My heavenly flow put MC's in hell's kitchen, ugh
And I'm so, I'm so hot, hot, ya'll burnin' up, HOT

My lifestats makes Jordan's six rings look common
Ya'll hate, I retaliate, just by being great

With the same rhyme I used to burn your idol in a battle
To screw you into saying, ""Look, I don't wanna battle""

WB mad respect
Black stealthbombarama, radar can't detect that
I'm comin' is what I screamed
As a teen armed with discipline, faith, and a dream
After smoke clears, after life's roller coasters
See who stands putting his mic into his holster, what!

Batton down the hatches and latch the doors
You wanna try to match my whits with yours
Three hits, I hit you, you hit the floor
This track is the third hit, that's for sure
Beat thick reminiscin' of a bodacelli
I'm like a cheetah huntin' out on the Serengeti
I got my X-ray vision through all in my way
No Plan B, it distracts from Plan A
Stay splitting in half, earthquake style
Evacuate your premises, the hardcore nemesis
I never miss, my flow never flawed
Grab mics and send electric shocks through the cord
Quest for the rings my only weapon's intuition
My future position is determined by past decisions
So young George Bush, I'm thinking bout runnin'
Maybe not this time, but trust dude, uh

Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)

Verse two 'bout to slay you worst than the first verse
Packin' my purse but yo without one curse
I survive in ratified air where only few can live
Thoughts in my brain like that train in The Fugitive
I pledge allegiance to the soul of the game
Stepped away as Fresh Prince came back with my real name
A rose by any other still beautifies the room
So don't get consumed when a brother's known to gloom
It's semantics but yo it's really good to be back
Never racing the rap just lacing the track
Not serendipity with me it was a plan B
'Bout to have an Oscar standin' next to my Grammys
Plural, mucho, no need to talk though
I'm a just do so
I'm comin' at ya with the smoothest slickness
Behold the style lick of this, kickin'...

Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)

A GQ cover twice
This brother's nice
Vanity Fair you saw me there
I discovered life
Outside of rap got the cream and all that
But kinda left a void in me
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
Said my mic, aight
Pump your radio you could record
As they place my welcome mat at the music awards
Coming through America, tinted in high beams
Rose petals at my feet like I'm Prince Akeem
So to all you player haters while y'all sayin' y'all rhyme
Please stop sayin' Jada 'cause that name's mine
I rocked the Philly fade with the divin' waves
Yes y'allin' 'til I'm bald like Issac Hayes
Bad eyes or greys, back pain or bad legs
I'm a get better with age, trust

Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)

Don’t Say Nothin’,Big Willie Style,1997.0,"Yo, 
when I released my first single back in like '86
People was like, ""Oh you know, that's popcorn"" and you know, ""they weak""
You know, then I mess around, I go World Trade on them
Bangin' out them multi-plats
, they still got negativity to bring
My thing is you can't say nothing nice, don't say nothing

Take your place, allow me to flex a taste
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like Mase
Face me the star of stage and TV
My face be seen in almost every country
Grammy winner, soon to be Oscar nominee
Who he? ""That's dressed Jiggy, straight from West Philly""
Thought I was whack 'cause I wanted to act
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that
The ill kid, hundred million dollar bill kid
The one you love to chill with; come on, keep it real, kid!
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek
You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me, really, don't act silly
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly
Took a break from the rap thing, went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas, chatting with Oprah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados, chillin' with Jada
Vertex is me, the magnanamous
Got you sayin' ""Damn, I've always been a fan of his!""
Y'all know how it is, oh wait, hold up, y'all don't!
Look here, y'all don't say nothing, then I won't

Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)

Man, I love being me ready to rock the block
With some more hot top notch **** for you to cop
No more Mr. Nice Guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
(He soft, he whack; man, that ain't real rap!)
You believe that? It hurt me at first, but it's cool
Took the insults feed it to my ego used it for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out, ""Oh my lord!
Did you see it's that brother from 
ID4?
""
""Now, can I please get (a picture and your signature?)"" ""Sure you can, miss""
""Oh my god, my girlfriends, they ain't gonna believe this!""
Worldwide, wait! Nah, hold up, galactic
Hear my name, don't nothing change but the accent
Bangok to Madagascar, they wanna see me
Prince epe in Spain; Japan, I'm cota eshe
I like my steaks thick and my jets private
And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know he's only four, taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip
Man, who'd've thought my life would be such an interesting topic?
Well y'all know how it is, wait, hold up, y'all don't!
Well look here, y'all don't say nothing, then I won't

Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)

Go ahead, adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters
I'm about to show you how a man like me works
Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
Four five chromed out former two seater
Fifty inch Sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs, ten toes
One knee and probably a couple of elbows
'Cause yo, I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film festivals and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
My so-called friends, who been nothing but actors
You're way outta character, but now, who's the bomb?
It's Will from West Phil', just slightly transformed
Y'all know what it is
Ah damn, that's right, y'all don't!
But look here, y'all don't say nothing, then trust me, I won't!

Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)",https://genius.com/Will-smith-dont-say-nothin-lyrics
Pump Ya Brakes,Lost and Found,2005.0,"Snoop Dogg, Big Will
Ay lil' homey you need to pump ya brakes
Real talk, we came to have a good time
We ain't got all that time for all that
Man homey look pump ya brakes
Now slide right, and just pump ya brakes
We'll holla at you in a minute
F'real, ha ha pump ya brakes

All this excess stress I can't take it
Slow that thing down, pump ya brakes kid
Why you gotta be all up in the face kid?
The ABS'll get you numbers and a name, kid
I mean really, houndin' on girl
Was that really necessary, see your itinerary
Is all off, you need to be hauled off
She start flippin, she ain't trippin, it's your loss
This a simple case of a anti-brake pumper
You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper
That mighta got you a couple numbers when you were younger
But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper
Be a gentleman and try to be gentle man
The essence of stimulation mental man
But if you actin like you just got out a kennel man
Put your foot on the pedal and, pump

If your girl in your face then she out of place
What you need to tell her is pump ya brakes
Now if you out but your girls they pressin' you hard
What you need to tell 'em is pump ya brakes
Now if you underage and you actin all grown
What you need to do is pump ya brakes
If you offended by this record and you know it's you
What you need to do is pump ya brakes

Outside the restaurant, girl sees boy
Girl likes boy, girl meets boy (boy)
Boy doesn't know that girl thinks he's fly (fly)
Boy's a nice guy so boy says hi (hi)
Boy's girlfriend returns from goin to park
She sees them together this ignites a spark (what?)
Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark
Now this is where the pumping of the brakes should start
Girlfriend thinks that somethin's goin' on
Girl tells girlfriend nothin's goin' on
Boy in the middle of the commotion beginnin'
Girlfriend mad cause boy keeps grinnin'
Now why is he grinnin'? But that's beside the point
Girlfriend she chill 'fore they rolled up in the joint
Jumpin to conclusions get you nowhere honey
Pump ya brakes or be a crash test dummy

If your girl in your face then she out of place
What you need to tell her is pump ya brakes
Now if you out but your girls they pressin' you hard
What you need to tell 'em is pump ya brakes
Now if you underage and you actin all grown
What you need to do is pump ya brakes
If you offended by this record and you know it's you
What you need to do is pump ya brakes

Rule #1, is just like 2
The who-dos and what-nots and what you should dizzoo
No loud talkin', no back talkin'
If you do either believe it you back walkin'
I hate to sound rude but then again I have to
My rap bang and my mack game it'll smack you
Click-clack you, spit at you
I don't do it cause I want to, I do it cause I get to
I gotta question to ask you
Would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let him smash you?
If I was you, and you was I
Would you keep it G, or would you stay fly?
If you was rich, in a ditch, livin low, would you push the button
Keep it cuttin, or would you just let it go?
Calm down lil' homie
And know what you dealin wit before you run up on me

If your girl in your face then she out of place
What you need to tell her is pump ya brakes
Now if you out but your girls they pressin' you hard
What you need to tell 'em is pump ya brakes
Now if you underage and you actin all grown
What you need to do is pump ya brakes
If you offended by this record and you know it's you
What you need to do is pump ya brakes",https://genius.com/Will-smith-pump-ya-brakes-lyrics

An when I'm on tour, he be mad I'm gone
But then he smile an come runnin screamin ""daddy's home""
Then he hold me, slightly tightly
Mom, your wish came true-I got one just like me
My life be so good, so good
Ka-chicka-chicka Ka-chicka-chicka-good
Things come to those who wait
But too late, my life's to great to wait
I wanna celebrate
Good times, c'mon

Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good

I wake up every morning in the canopy bed
Slip a kiss to the Miss, you the man she says
Mirror, mirror, need I call?
You know, uno, bad breath an all
Times I been fed up, still didn't let up
'Stead a doin dirt, did work and kept my head up
Set up
For the future, much love to my girl
North Pole got my butt cold 
(sittin on top of the world)
An I'm feelin (so high)
Touch the ceiling (the sky)
You say I smile cause I'm on top of the pie
But yo, the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
My grin got longevity, got family backin me
That's why I'm livin happily
Ever after, love and laughter
Hussle cause I wants to, not cause I have to
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt?
FP,
 the phenomenon, 
true Don Juan

The Fonz ain't seen my Happy Days
The track plays, I'm in the shades, singin a phrase

They say the clothes don't make the man, take my hand
Watch me freak this, hot mommies tryna creep this
Sleep with this, 
tryna entice me to let it off
But nah (why not?,) c'mon baby, you saw ""Set It Off""
Proposition by a trio in Rio
Ménage à trois
 down at the Marde Gras
But nah, my clothes by Versace
My attitude cocky, 
The scent, Issy Miyaki
Like a felon, no tellin what I do next
I don't front cause I'm paid, but I do flex
Southwestern, crib like a villa
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla
An it's real clear
Y'all talkin East and West, I'm talkin hemispheres
My papa raised no fool
So many zeros on my check it's like, ""ooooooooooooooooo""

Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good

Here He Comes,Lost and Found,2005.0,"Here he comes, he can rock
He can breakdance and he can pop
He can rap, and he can act
And if it come down to it he can scrap
Hey there, here come Big Will again

Here I come y'all, here I come y'all
Watch your back y'all, here I come y'all

For years I've been tryin to rip rhymes and get mine
And spit lines hot like lava this time
I don't got a sitcom to bother with
Or a time conflict with my sci-fi hits
I'm, contemplatin each statement's wit
And I'm, concentratin on makin hits
And I'm, fittin 'em, line by line
Teeth I'm grittin 'em, tryin to find the perfect rhyme
And scheme I'm dreamin, 'bout y'all gleam and doubt
He's back from actin he's screamin out
How he practice rappin now he's devout
Every album track packs what he's about
In the past he, passed with passion
Old fashioned boldly mashin totally crashin
Words up, in a disorderly fashion but
Back to the lab, and guess what happened?
KABOOM, ooh-WEE! Dude's resilient
Fresh Prince was hot, the movies killed him
Wait, hold up, STOP! You can rebuild him
Lock him back in hip-hop while dude's not filmin'
Shocked by the film and the TV money
Went from scenes with Uncle Phil to scenes with Sonny
It's so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20
But it's done, so come see the MC honey!

Here he comes, he can rock
He can breakdance and he can pop
He can rap, and he can act
And if it come down to it he can scrap
Hey there, here come Big Will again

Every time he touch the mic
He close his eyes and he hope to shine
And like a streak of light
Intro his name, they be like ahhhh!

Here he comes, he can rock
He can breakdance and he can pop
He can rap, and he can act
And if it come down to it he can scrap
Hey there, here come Big Will again

The Rain,Willennium,1999,"The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The rain gon' come through the window, pain will come
Black, white, rich, poor, it's the same old drum
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'
Let the children feel the rain, cause if they feel the rain
From the wetness, they stand to gain
I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm, artists, like flowers, they bloom
Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine, did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pops said ""rain gon' come"", to him I said ""never""
Chedder in the genes, face on screens
Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'
Platinumn, grammys, famous, but still broke and
Not having cash put me in check
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then, the rain I never felt
Deal wit' it


At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurrcaine
Her first name still conjuers the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept
Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan, from it I never ran
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand
I'm Noah, life's my ark
Forty days and forty nights, still can't take my heart
Seen the fallen man
To dope and liquor brands
The devil'll dance to make it rain
Bringing the pain
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace
Through grey skies, I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt
Since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it


Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind
Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds
See kids in the streets, runnin' around
It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down
I wondered how, with my mouth wide
Reminisce of the key, said I wanna go outside
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time, God started rappin' to me
He said ""pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow
So the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid, find shelter in me
The road to greatness, through the valley of adversity""
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem
These little children, the world we must receive like them
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He delt
And since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it",https://genius.com/Will-smith-the-rain-lyrics
Born to Reign,Born to Reign,2002,"(Will Smith talking)
I believe in God
I believe in destiny
Not destiny in the sense of all of our actions being pre-determined
But destiny in the sense, of our ability to choose
Our ability to choose, who we are and who we're supposed to be
(Will Smith rapping)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I was born to reign
Point blank my name, to be etched in stone, destiny pre-ordained
Tryin' to live righteous, fighting for life
This my life, and that's why I go lite on my vices
Tighten the vices of truth, on the ruthless
This rhyme and the crime is they minds is just useless
The path of the poison, the 
Genesis of the genocide
You and your boys, tryin' to decide
What to write, but your pen is a sword
And the blade has been forged, young minds gettin' gorged
States have been altered, by liquor, by weed
And then hate gets exalted, as art falls to greed
Choices is made, as the voices is laid
On the track, contract, ya souls the wage, sold ya wage
Did you see his new Benz, but your mic a syringe
Now you proud of your binge, gotta lot of new friends, gotta lot of new ends
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen
Giving false accounts, of your accounts amounts
Amounts of fans treason, stands to reason
Since your inception, laced with deception
And bred false affection, it must parish
From a terrace, I see the fire burning the streets
But I won't shield my eyes to the heat
Born to Reign
Oooooooooh
I was Born to Reign
Oooooooooh
I was Born to Reign",https://genius.com/Will-smith-born-to-reign-lyrics
Who Am I?,Willennium,1999,"Darkchild, Big Will, 2000
Bust out, shake it up now
Come on, come on
And shake it up now
Who am I?
You know, you know
Big Will, ya ready?
Come on

When I was a lad I used to dream that (one day)
I'd earned the cream that make the rocks gleam
Phat rhymes to make it seem that I was like Bill Gates
Writing lines, seal fates
Power to change the whole set
For exposure or forfeit
And with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence
Envisioned a hot life, hot wife
Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas
With lights simmer trees for the ambiance
I been up and down and high and low
Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo
My shiny glow definitely ain't cause of my Bentley
It's something that my fam put in me
Who am I? You ask
The guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz
In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life
Boom stitched up by my wife
Who am I?
It's suffice to say found gold in my heart
Put the ice away
Nicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay
Even when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day
Who am I?
That brother with the platinum plaque
With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack
The fact is that when that brother rap or act
Hold position, front of the pack
Who am I?

I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
Baby if you really wanna know about me
I'll tell you who I am
I'll tell you I be not the one for games
But if you're right with me
I know I'll do the same
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
(L-Y-T-E)

Who am I?
You dare to ask
The same female who hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass
I'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream
Break the bank papi cause we're coming for the cream
And while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe
Hold face, sell a million and you still won't equate
So who am I? It ain't hard to tell
Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell
See a lot know my face but a few know me well
Just who I am is the one to make you gel
Who am I? The chick that keeps spittin'
Taking back all my snip that was bitten
Rewritten dangerous laison
With the shades on
Making sure the track stays on
Days on end I'll be that one true friend
That will always be around when the world falls down
I'm honest to the bone
No question, suggestion
You don't wanna know
I give the truth, nothing less than
I'm sweet with a heart to fit
Smart as a whip
You feed me well but I'm still hard to get
I'm like a calculus problem you just can't solve
Study me well if you wanna get involved
And even after that I'm still unpredictable
Now who am I? I'm unforgettable

I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby

Scary Story,Lost and Found,2005.0,"Daddy can you tell me a story?

Oh you wanna hear a story? What kind of story you wanna hear baby?

A scary story

Oh, ok
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme
Almost like he was born in the rhyme
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
And he fought with his mom
His school getting caught with his rhyme book
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it
Teacher told him get it out of her class
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why he won't pass
Now if you shy you won't last, which he knew
So underneath his breath before he left he said
""I'm a be richer then you""
""What you say?"", she said
""What you mean?"", he said
""Boy don't you play"", she said
""What you mean?"", he said. Damnit
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son
""You testing me? You messin up again?
You done boy""

This is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game
A real scary story
Went from rags to riches it got goblins in it haters and witches. Uh


First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny
But they gave him the money so they played the record company
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal
But for real it wasn't like that then
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was
Havin Started antagonizing them guy's he was with
At the same time he started realizing
The deal that he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits
He called a meeting to find a solution
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution
The dude said we found a solution it's this .44
He ran for the door a little shaken
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you
Just do me a favor
Get your life in order",https://genius.com/Will-smith-scary-story-lyrics
Could U Love Me,Lost and Found,2008.0,"Uhh... hoo!
Uh, yo, Big Will, in the place to be
Mic check and uh, mic check and uh
Uh, uh, yo
Would you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Would you love me if my pants was hand-me-downs?
Hah, huh?
Yo, yo

Often times I hear a phrase when I'm out and about
8 to 80 all walks of life be shouting it out
Usually when it's time for an encore I hear it
But when I did something hot it broke in the spirit
It's weird, it's like a double-edged sword when y'all applaud
It's kinda wild, a peace sign, a smile
How do I respond to the phrase ""I love you Will!""
Kinda heavy when I hear it - be like ""Damn f'real?""
In a way it make me wanna stay strong and moral
But history, say I could be gone tomorrow
And though my future look floral, it feel like I'm open
For much pain, when people stop shouting my name
And doubting my game, liking  others better than me
Writing, letters to him instead of letters to me
A veteran B, I know the game, but do me this here
In your heart be clear before you bless my ear, c'mon

Could you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Could you love me if my pants was hand-me-down?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted?
Will my name be easier to forget it, huh?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?

I pray before I sit with a pen and a pad
A birth of a thought occurs, and it calls me dad
And to the universe an idea, released from me
Just a CD? Nah man, a piece of me
But you can't see it that when you be dancing B
As I asked you a question that's how you answer me
So when you don't dance it be like I'm choking from cancer
Like I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive, sure
I rationalize, like oh I see
But if you don't like my cut it's like you don't like me
Some stuff works, some works, not so well
It's like you work like hell, still get hurt like hell
Yo, it can tear you apart
But don't let your wins go to your head, your losses go to your heart
And if we ever get the pleasure to meet
Be clever wit and please measure what you yell in the street, c'mon

Could you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Could you love me if my pants was hand-me-down?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted?
Will my name be easier to forget it, huh?

If I approach you correctly
And step up to you respectfully
Will you please ma'am bless me with the next dance?
I don't intend to offend you
I only intend to befriend you
But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me
With those hot pants, not a chance
I'mma let you go without saying something
A little hotter in the bottom mama that's all that I'm wanting
No frontin' if it is illegal for you to be that fine
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me
Then it'll be dinner with me
Then it'll be back to my crib
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself
And I'm playing myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff
I'm saying the stuff
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance
On good behavior, maybe later
Maybe your apartment, your pad
Sike, joke, walking a tight rope
My foot in my mouth
Look, all I hope is that you'll dance with me
What's up?
Repeat 1
She was smiling I was kind wiling
Thinking I was dialin' in
She gave me the impression that she was getting my message
So I'm testing
I through it out there 'Let me buy you a drink'
Cause when I buy you I think it'd be fly if we link
What'cha think?
She responded with a grin and a glance
Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance
The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise
The other night I seen her dancing
Duty was over
She did a split into a spin
And put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancing
Mami can you feel me?
Still she said nothing
Why she be fronting?
Never seen another mami move like you
Groove like you
I'm saying I wanna dance with you
What's up?
Repeat 1
To me when I'm dancing it's aphrodisiatic
It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help fantasize
Some people dance socially not emotionally
Closer to me, come on close as you can be
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama cut me no slack
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama forward and back
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama as hard as you can
It's part of the plan
It happens when you start with the man
On your mark, ready set, baby let's go
Baby let's flow, baby let go
Baby no, no, gotta a lot more
Lettin' it rip, gimme some of that
*girl yells*
Yeah that's it
Sweatin' with me, getting it wetter with me
It's better with me
Gain it, other girls I dated ain't famous
So take it or leave it
Just the way that I eat it
I bring, I swing it
So you like that?

I Loved You,Big Willie Style,1997,"I thought you was the one hon yeah
When I met you at the freaknin'
Whoever thought you'd be the type to greet and keep secrets
My friends said don't sleep but I did so now I'm reapin'
Desease that I sold I can't believe you so deceivin'
Sneakin' out on the weekends with Michelle
One of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell
Half black and Indonesian the one that taught you treason
Cupid shoot me on my heart but damn why'd you leave it bleedin'
I gave you no reason to lie
But you choose to live untrue
Knowing how I feel inside
There's no telling what I might do
Cause I gave you
All my mind
All my soul
From the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build the future turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I can do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames yo
Why you playin' games yo?
As I think back to the beginning we was together
We both loved sports long walks and autumn weather
Both wanted kids and a family a strong personality
I liked the way you handled me
Candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet
That's what you said while you was massagin' my ??
Now look here I could never leave you lonely
Cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me
'member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see
Use your mind that's what you told me
Kissin' me slowly
Never was the loud type always on the low key
Pretty style but rugged
Damn I brother I loved her
The birds of a feather 'sposed to fly together
Guess that don't apply to birds of your kind
Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher
Came to steal my heart and leave me to die
(I ain't going out like that though)
All my mind
All my soul
From the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like

Been to the mountain top
Down to the valley
Philadelph to Cali
Y'all feel me like Harry felt Sally
Clothes exotic, flows erotic
No jewels that's for them fools who ain't got it
Rap to my own sitcom
Now I just sit calm
Watching y'all respond to my July 4th bomb (boom!)
Yeah I'm a nice kid
But here's some advice kid
Don't get me hyped
I'll set it off like my wife did
Playing down a path like Sajak
Wheel of a Fortune away
Price ain't right I don't play
Find yourself in Jeopardy
The first clue
What is Will Smith?
Hot to death not you
I'm like a Porsche, you a pinto
You like a tiny figurine, I'm monumental
You're like a small get together
On your neighbor's back porch
You know just a couple of y'all
I'm a million man march
Attack of the man in black
Like Jordan playing on a train
Yo my game on track
Mad ice for my wife
No care for what it costed
Had to ease up though
Her wrist got frost bit
My style, flava, delivery, my diction
Gettin' medieval like dude in Pulp Fiction
You want some bring it
Come one, come all, come in
Watch me take they heart away like Penny
I could take 12 rappers and put em' in line
Then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme
Then 12 more brothers that still ain't signed
Then don't do nothing just watch 'em decline
Gangsta hardcore, menace to society
Raps all the same
My pen spits variety
Eclecticism is a virtue
It may not be a word
But it's definitely a virtue
Rappers approaching me all across America
Believe me you don't wanna battle like Erykah
I was in the game before publishing was an issue
You're platinum now but next year I'm gonna miss you
Mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts
Wanna be mad check the charts any of them
Oh you don't see my name
You don't see my spot
Here's a hint
Look closer to the top

(Uuhhh)
Can you feel it baby?
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say

Make It hot, uh

Flow crazy
Make em' say

Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)

Uh, love and loyalty yo
Yo the flow spray, Vito say
I'm tryin' to live
And if I catch you out of bounds
It's cheap shots to the ribs
Love and loyalty dawg
Do it how Pac and Big did it
It's the Wild Wild East
And me keepin' me jig with it
Play no games
Thirst to heat the rhyme
Motivation cause procrastination is the thief of time
Holding a torch
I was programmed to scorch
Can't run with the big dawgs?
Then stay on the porch
These cats is craftmatic
Hand on the steering wheel
Rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic
Man-handle rappers, dismantle rappers
Y'all lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers
Any team posing a threat we defeat those
The wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough
As long as y'all play foul I'mma keep hittin' free throws
Crush Spanish mamis calling me Kellito
Remember Lego blocks?
All about the paper now
I use writers block to build sky scraper style
Catch rappers using the same flows everyday cause they lame
True players gotta change their uniform after the game
Y'all seen the flow
Like y'all never seen before
Don't stop for the door
Why do you think green mean gold?
Baby learn life's lessons
Scratch regression
Kel Spence the truth, the answer to all questions
Come on (Uuhhh)

Damn Kel, you kind of good",https://genius.com/Will-smith-uuhhh-lyrics
Tim Westwood Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"None of my lyrics are extraneous
Rhymes are spontaneous
I am the Fresh Prince and I am as brainy as
GALILEO
Wiser than Einstein
With the strength parallel to that of a land mine
I change to my surroundings, like
A CHA-ME-LE-ON
Sometimes I’m serious
And sometimes I’m silly
And in time you’ll see, my energy can’t be withheld
If it’s a sin to be a winner, then I’m going to hell
Setting the course for the tippy-tippy-top
And my goal is to be the undisputed king of hip-hop
Not trying to say that I’m the best, I swear it
But as the saying goes, if the shoe fits, then wear it
It’s not that I’m better than the rest, well, you see
It’s just that nobody is as good as me
SO I’M HUMBLE
When I’m complimented each day
I’m like, well, you know, what can I say?
My lyrics are praised, just like the scripture
The grammar is correct and they’re as vivid as a picture
I’m not the Messiah, the truth I must tell
I can’t walk on water, but I can swim like hell
I was taught by the world’s greatest MC
A man who undisputedly rules the whole rap industry
I was taught to be all that I can be
I was taught by a hell of a guy
ME
So don’t try to stop me, because I can’t be stopped
Don’t knock what I’m doing because I can’t be knocked

Hey this is me, I'm not in right now

I'll just might think about calling you back
Have a pleasant day

Pick up the phone girl, I know that you home
Please don't leave me all alone with just the sound of this tone
Come on pick up, pick up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
I know I don't deserve it cause of how I messed up
But alright cool, sit and listen
I'm missing your kiss and now a tear drop glistens
I had a bit to drink, kinda threw me
Things just happened, she didn't mean nuttin' to me
You know me baby, I'm still that same man
That asked for your hand, and still the same plan
Another brother falls by the wayside
Another brother falls by the play side
I knew ever since I was a kid
That I was going to pay the piper for the things I did
But now there is no more us, no more we
No more nuttin' girl damn and it's all cause of me

No more late nights watching tv
No more talks on the phone till three
No more playing in the leaves in the fall
No more piggy back rides in the mall
No more ice cream cones to share
No more sittin' just playin' in your hair
No more picnics out by the sea
There ain't no more nuttin' and it's all cause of me

Damn, some brothers yeah we huff and we puff
Cause when we're hurtin' inside, we gots to front like we tough
But that's dangerous, to cover hurt with hard
Because you still get scared through that feeble facade
Then the bonds of your ego, when the shackles of manhood
Makes you lose something thats damn good
A picture in my mind of us hand and hand walking
So alive, now I'm a dead man talking
Why can't you just pick it up so we can sit and just talk
Why can't you meet me somewhere so we can go take a walk
I can't hide, air, land, or sea
Cause everytime I turn around, there I be
When I was with you I felt free
Now I'm in a cage called me
Now I see, no more us, no more we
No more nuttin' girl damn, and it's all cause of me

No more late nights watching tv
No more talks on the phone till three
No more playing in the leaves in the fall

Nightmare on My Street,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know he had me scared as hell
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like the weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was alright because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin' cold havin' a ball
And somethin' about Elm St. was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent you know nuthin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred and this girl named Nancy
But word when it was over, I said yo that was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare on my street
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat and man I was bugging
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself yo this heaters the worst
But when I got downstairs I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone but the TV was on
I thought nothin' off it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice coming from behind It said
""You got my favorite letter but now you must die""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, ""So long, 'cuz""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screaming
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreaming""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I think that since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we gotta lotta work here
Me and you, the souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body and I've got the brain""
I said, ""Yo Fred I think you got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long
Look, I'll be honest man this team won't work
The girls won't be on you Fred, your face is all burnt""
Fred got mad and his head started steaming
But I've thought what the hell I'm only dreamin'
I said please leave Fred so I can get some sleep
But give me a call maybe we'll hang out next week
I patted him on the shoulder, said, ""Thanks for stopping by""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy""
He got mad, drew back his arm and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said
""Oh please do something with Fred""
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off and then silence
It was a whole new day I thought
""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?
Jeff, this is Prince, man Jeff, wake up, Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man, listen to me, Jeff
It three o'clock in the morning, what do you want?
Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me? Listen
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep
Man
Jeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff
Look, I'll talk to you tomorrow

Color of the mountains

Wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery
Feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind
Here I stand before you, the color of the night
Frozen by the potential of me: an Afro Angel
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh!)

Afro Angel off your pedestal from perchin above
You on the prowl now, downtown, searchin' for love
In all the wrong places, outside your radio stations
Hopin' he with new hit single, is tryin' to mingle
Today, he is me in your town, puttin' it down
You in the car with your friends, followin' my limo around
Puttin' a bug in my boy's ear, your ""S"" is for free
You'll do anything for Omar or Phil, bring you to me
And then me, hypnotized by the devil as well
Hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel
No need to RSVP, place your hand in my palm
As all your girlfriends getting jealous
""Damn, she landed the bomb!""
Willing to trade your spirit for some crass, whack wage
Something small, something simple as a pass back stage
But now I lay me, down to creep
And I... pray the Lord my soul to keep

Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved

Lil Bobby got a gun now, age fifteen
Destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems
Rage inside, pride, been denied respect
He can't take it though he gotta earn it
But he ain't learned that yet
Out on the town, reckless abandon he's been bullied before
But now he straps, and no more
Attitude high
Flexin on every guy that walk by
But don't start pal
Cuz if the gun came from the whiz, Cowardly Lion, got heart now
Let's pull it on a stranger
Ahh, fun for the crew
Surprised when he realized
""Damn, dude got one too!""
Smile's upside down now, games ain't so cute
Bobby's a deer in a headlights
""Punk, drop it or I'll shoot""
Then like a sniper, cleanin' his rifle, Bobby disobeys his commands
One shot rings out (*gunshot*) then only the stranger stands
Could of sworn Bobby's blood formed the shape of an angel's wings
But for what?

Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved

Back in high school, Tamika was the sweetest, the bomb
Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom
Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game
But had the cutest kid you ever seen
Then all the pressure from her mom
She stepped to Russ
Told him it's either them drugs or us
Either them thugs or us
The ultimatum, either continue bein' a thug in the world
Or start lovin' your girl
He said: ""God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin' ya dear
But to go from $50 Gees a week to $30 Gees a year?
That ain't happenin'...""
I guess he wasn't that strong
He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone
Yo, they straight moved away, without as little as a word
Well... needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed
Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn
And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone
Upstate Schenectady
Tamika answered the door
It was the last person she expected to be
They just stared... he said: ""You love me for me?
You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry?
Down with me? Period
Through life's stress and strife?""
She said: ""Yeah"", he said: ""In that case
Would you please be my wife?""
Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried
Like an angel sings
I love y'all more than anything

Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved
(Yeaahh, uhhh...)
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved",https://genius.com/Will-smith-afro-angel-lyrics

Well, you know I think will is very talented
And I think he'll be successful at anything he puts his mind too
Well, I been checking out his vertebrae
He don't look like he can slang it like no man
Man, I would tour your little, ah
If you would have read my motivational tapes
You wouldn't have done that it talks
About that on page thirty seven

Get your hands off me
Stop tryin to hold me down
Let me just move around
Girl somethin' done happened to me
Swear to God
Somethin' done snapped in me
I need the whole floor for us
I'm 'bout to bust, mami
And its glorious
I can't seem to stop my feet
You hear my heart beat, digga digga digga digga digga digga
Oh lord, I'mma 'bout to pass out
But when the night is over I'mma be the last out
Sweat pumpin' in my eyes
Vision a blur
But even though my eyes is closed I see visions of her
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart jumpin and pumpin its about to pop
But don't tell me nothin' back up

I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da

The way you press against me
You messin' with me
The way that dress is fittin'
It's got to be forbidden
No reason for security, ma
Feelin' secure
You gaurdin my body, baby
Come on and gimme some more
If all these people wasn't in here, flockin around
And how you in the middle of the floor, baby knockin you down
The dude who be talkin' bout
When I walk in the house cameras like click click click, gizz gizz gizz
A damn shame
How you do the damn thang
Girl you off the damn chain
But you 'bout to be tamed
Look at you
Laughin' and grinnin' and dancin' and spinnin'
It wasn't my intention
But you got me cringin' my linen, come on
Call me a doctor
Give me a respirator
Look into my eyes
Mama, pressure is rapidly rising
All around my naked leg, all around my thigh
Feels like Ecs. when you next to me getting me high
Girl you dancin' honey, that's how I like to play
I be Patrick Swaze, you be Jennifer Gray
High heels stiletto
Sexy straight out the ghetto
She fire
Its like I'm dancin with the devil
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart jumpin and pumpin its about to pop
But don't tell me nothin' back up

I can't stop, da da da da da da da
(baby don't hold me back, won't stop, don't stop)
I can't stop

Its like a dream or a TV show or a cinema scene
Brother only dancin' lambada
People treating me mean
Why they be flippin' and trippin' on me
Chasin' me down
Grippin' on me
Racin' around
Disgracin' the sound
Got me on the run
Runnin' for havin fun
They way they come and attack they act like I had a gun
Cops gimme room
Stop tryin' to gimme doom
They got me like roooooooooom
I don't care who it is
I ain't stoppin' for no helicopter
I ain't no fugitive
Bonnie and Clyde alive
Its me and my shortie
Get from in front of me
I don't want to hurt nobody

Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart pumpin' and jumpin its about to pop

Willow is a Player,Born to Reign,2002.0,"(Chorus)
Willow is a player
She's got me going crazy baby
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me going out of my mind
Playing all the the time
Willow is a player
She's got me going crazy baby
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me going out of my mind
Playing all the the time
(Verse 1)
Every time I see her
Can't help but to smile
And every time I touch her
She makes me feel like a child
She got me locked down
Got me locked, locked down
I'd do just about anything
To stay on her good side
And when she wants something
From me she won't be denied
Can't even go shopping
Without buying her a gift
Every eye tied to her
As she steps out the crib
She keep me up all night
On my knees as I pray
Cuz I can't sleep till
I know she's okay
She got me locked down
She got me locked, locked down
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
I saw another man hold her
Just a friendly hello
I know that it was nothing
But he took too long to let go
Boy you better let her go
OOOOHHHH!! Let my girl, girl go
I try to be tough y'all
Sometimes she make me so mad
Her eyes like diamonds
Make me forget she's so bad
She's my angel
This world she's not of
Sent from the upstairs
Taught me that new kind of love (Love, love, love)
I can't tell y'all
What she means in my life
What make it so crazy
I met her through my wife
She got me locked down
Got me locked, locked down

Block Party,Born to Reign,2002.0,"Yo, yo forget the club
Today we play in the block
It's goin' down and it's blazzin' hot
Jeff pop the new CD turn tables joints
You just got to get the amps from Boogie
Get the van from Rock and then
Call up 
Ishkabibble
's, 
Jim
's and 
Pat
's
And tell 'em we need cheese steaks for like, 300 cats
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sendin' 'em back
And get my mic right
If I get hyped, I might rap
Then take the speakers find a good spot
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top
Yo, you know where little John lives on the corner
The extension cord'll run perfectly to his crib
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block
Regardless what car you got, leave it up top
You wanna come, you got to come on your feet
Ain't nothin' like havin' a party
When it's out in the street, come on

Nine o'clock I'mma call my crew
And ten o'clock we gonna roll on through
I don't know what you gon do
But whatever you do, hit the block party tonight
All the ladies rollin' up with friends
And don't be late or you won't get in
Our party's packed from begining to end
Everybody tell a friend that the block party's tonight

It's ain't nothin' like
Havin' a party on the block
When everybody know everybody on the block
And everybody on the block
Come to the party on the block
And when the sun drop, (we don't stop)
Funny how fast they travel the word
A dozen divas from North Philly drove in when they heard
That it's a block party down in West Philly
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willy
Stand back, everybody come to see the man rap
Jeff got it... jam packed
Everybody, hands in the air
(Just get your hands in the air!)
Yo Philly! (dat's where the party's at!)
Uuh, D.C. y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)
A-T-L (dat's where the party's at!)
West side! (dat's where the party's at!)
Mid-west y'all (dat's where the party's at!)
Dirty South now (dat's where the party's at!)
Yo, I can't hear y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)
Where ever we at! (dat's where the party's at!)


Yo, yo and when the sun drop
Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stop
All it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on
All day long I been plottin' on this nice john
It's ten o'clock now Jeff is tryin' to hype me
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?
Hear the crowd cheer, broguht a little smile out
Mic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out
I know he's old, but
Mabye it's a slight chance
I could get my brother hype
Make him break dance- ha, maybe not
Lemme get the crowd jumpin'
Let me him 'em with the brand new funk or something
I'm like Rob Base- I wanna rock right now
Y'all know who run the block right now
All we need is a mic and a beat
And a couple of speakers
And some turn tables out in the street, come on!",https://genius.com/Will-smith-block-party-lyrics

You can witness, the glow from my entourage
Gravitate toward the ambience

Ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP

Comin of age, I invaded nations
On stage I seen Haitian or Asian faces
No vacations just more locations
I go places so chasin my vocation
So demonstratin the way to be patient
With life's test, through my IRS situation
My guess is my dedication don't faze ya
A public sensation, in private you hatin, why?
That's so last year, that's so not sexy
But I shall not let the hate stress me
I got bigger fish to fry
I can stand on my wallet probably kiss the sky
When, I close my eyes, I wish that I
Could change how you get pissed when I

Brand New Funk,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's new, it's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary
So yo bust this commentary
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together, and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk
Get down brand new funk-hit it
It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said
""What the ? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it""
He just smiled and said, ""Yeah def ain't it?""
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was
The {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin
And clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on
The microphone I was flowin
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, ""Yo keep goin"" So I continued to
Rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready
Rock
People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the
Brand new funk
Ge-Ge-Get down-hit it
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} *
Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the
Beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands }
Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat
Jeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around
The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling
Sensational, stupendous music
That has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated
But we have done it, so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief
This isn't a publicity stunt It's the raw untouched, pure, hard brand new funk
{Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat}

I Gotta Go Home,Born to Reign,2002.0,"Girl stop shaking
You got my will breaking
Lovin' Jamaica but I gotta go home
I got my girl waitin'
I'm spos' to land at eight and
If I'm not there then I can't go home
Ma you got me bakin'
I'm bout' to make a mistakin'
I'm bout' to ask you to take me home
Please stop shaking
You got my will breakin'
Lovin Jamaica but I gotta go home

Ten days I'm in Jamaica workin'
Ain't' had a chance to get out and do to much than nothin' else but workin'
It's killin' me
Ain't' had a chance to get that chicky jerkin'
Responsibility taste the victory but desire lerkin'
I been recording right and rappin' and ryming
Notin' but heat ain't' even had a chance to see the island
I need dat'
Me and the team we got a dream a' comin'
The spot we heard about through her mouth
This club of silam
Let's finish up
Then like a breeze off the sea's
When you arrive at the party
Host this
She Desserie flirtin' heavily with me
Got me thinkin' things I really probobly shouldn't be
Evertime she move she look at me
(Chorus)

(Everytime she moves)
I don't know how to act
Came to get my groove on
Not to get my groove back
Her eyes deep enough to swim in
She grinnin'
Her innersence inpire thoughts of sinnin'
Crazy right?
She got a  -  flower so long she smilin'
Her shakin' makin' Jamaica seem like temptation island
I'm wilin'
Cause' man she hot
What I'm gonna do?
Feelin' like the moment of truth
Fakin' my concience
Lovin the mood
What's a brother to do?
Makin' me think Desserie a Jamaican queen
Makin' me hatin' to leave cause' the shakin' is mean
Windin' hips
Got me growin' fond of this islandness but i'm manganese
So far y'all
(Chorus)

(Could it be that she's lookin' at me)
(Sendin' messages sweat Desserie)
(Try na' get away cause she was meant for me)
(Oh no I'm tryin' to get home)
(Tell me what else is a man's to do)
(When temptation is comin' at you)
(I love my girl but I see somthing new)
(Oh no I gotta get home)
If I want you so
Me want you so

If I want you so

Momma Knows,Born to Reign,2002.0,":
""Ew, ew, ew, ew, ewww""
* Sang in Intro, and picks up for the last two lines of Verse 1 *

Yo, at 17 years old I started runnin' the streets
Man I had some fun in the streets
11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets
By 18, I started seein' the sun in the streets
My mom started trippin' on me like ""Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully
Like I trust you, but please call me
And when you have kids of your own, you'll see
I'm gonna be here when all your friends won't""
But I was busy hollerin' ""Parents Just Don't Understand""
Now here I am with the family, runnin' the lines she ran on me
We ain't always see eye to eye, but Ma on your principles now I rely
You got me tastin' my toes

You go to trust in moms (haha) all day long (haha, haha)
I didn't know (didn't know but)
When my momma told me, don't go down that road (she told me don't go)
Don't go down that road, (but, but) but I gotta go, go (gotta go), where I gotta go, go
So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so
* Singing: ""ew, ew, ew,"" goes from last line of chorus, into 1st line of Verse 2

I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck (Chuck)
Rollin' in my car, with this dude named Chuck (Chuck)
My mom ain't really liked this dude named Chuck (Chuck)
She thought that he was really impolite (Chuck)
Chuck and me used to roll out faithfully
Inevitably you see Chuck, you gonna see me
Like we on TV, the bosomest of buddies
Share food, clothes, and money (ewww)
And hunnies (ewww) flocked like we was players from the NBA
Still hurts to recall the day, I heard him say
To this girl named Mya, I was datin'
He told her I was a liar, joker hatin'
He told her I be cheatin' on women
Breakin' hearts and grinnin'
He told her, her life would be better with him in it
That's the friend I chose

You go to trust in moms all day long (ew)
I didn't know (but)
When my momma told me, don't go (uh) down that road (she told me don't go)
Don't go, don't go down that road, (but, but) but I gotta go, go, where I gotta go, go (uh)
So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
* Solo of Tra-Knox singing: ""ew, ew, ew"" is mixed together with the beat *

Momma used to say, ""take your time young man
I ain't gonna always be there holdin' your hand
But you'll always know exactly where I am
And when I'm not there, in my place, the lord will stand
Will study the world, only the wise succeed
And when your eyes tell lies, your heart should leave
You gonna do dirt, we all gonna sin
But when you realize and apologize, and never do it again""
Ma told me, ""don't rush to get old
If you got youth, the truth clutched in your hold
It's like possibilities too much to behold
An emotional shield, from life's blustery cold""
Ma all the stuff was hard, you said was hard
Childish disregard, because my head was hard
Now no question to pose",https://genius.com/Will-smith-momma-knows-lyrics

Not makin' me hazy, just
Fillin' my mind up with all of these maybes
I'm trying to figure exactly the thing
It's like, got me wreckin' my brain
It's like, tryin' to put words to a smile (Smile, smile)
But like, trying to figure out, forget it- look

How ya smile been burnt in my brain (Oh ya)

Remember we met with shakin' T-shirt that first night?
That was the worst night, right?
Well, I mean, we had fun and all, ya, that's true
But you had somebody else and I did too
So it felt like karma and fate had formed a team
To keep me from the girl of my dreams
But in the end, I made friends with hope and destiny
And then, well, the rest is history
But yo, it wasn't easy though, trust
I mean, tryin' to turn you and me into us
You my hommie, my lover, my best friend
The White House to the ghetto
You blend right in and I dig that
I could never imagine this passion I feel
I mean, couldn't imagine it could last what I feel
But if somebody do something to you?
Shoooot, girl I might just.....


I must tell you how I love you
Maybe your my soul-mate
Maybe my best friend
You made me and molded me
A better man, yes I can believe in love

Here I come with the sound of the drummy drum drum
If you're really dumb, homie come and get some
Don't front on a top gun when you're not one
Ten top tens, you ain't even got one
Here I come with the sound of the drummy drum drum
If you're really dumb, homie come and get some
Don't front on a top gun when you're not one
Ten top tens, you ain't got none",https://genius.com/Will-smith-we-wont-lyrics
Give Me Tonite,Born to Reign,2002.0,"(Verse 1)(Will Smith)
Uh, check, check
Yo, yo, yo
Across the room shared a little gaze with me
Crazy mama how your scent played with me
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me
Didn't even say nothing I felt you wanna dance with me
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man
I put my finger up (Shhh) don't say nothing
He ain't here is he? We can play or something
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him
Us could be just a weekend thing
Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma
Look we can have everything else
But for tonite let me have you for myself
Girl holla at me
(Chorus)(Tra-Knox)
You can have the rest of your life
Give me tonite
You can have the rest of your life
Give me tonite
You can have the rest of your life
Just give me tonite
You can have the rest of your life
Just give me tonite, give me tonite

You know exactly what I want

Look in my eyes I'm telling you
All I'm tryna do is change your view
For a moment or two
Baby girl
I don't wanna break up your happy home
Baby I don't wanna be alone
So let me jump in the zone
Can't you feel the Jones
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)(Will Smith)
Thinking of living your life as a hundred yards long
Give me a quarter-inch thats all I'm asking
Do the math I'm the sun you the earth
Its U-N-I-verse and its the worst
Cuz I thirst to tape connect her
I know you got a life momma
Trust me I don't wanna bring your life drama
I can barely hear my think slide with me
Dip out the side door take a ride with me
Let me hear about (Uh)
What you think about (Uh)
What you need to do (Uh)
The things you dream about (Whoo)
Your Body with me but I know where your heart's at
(Phone rings) Let it ring ma call him back
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you
Am I gon' be at home alone with a glass slipper
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella
Midnight the story ends like Cinderella

Interlude,UnKnown,UnKnown,"So dad, like did you like have real good friends
And Potnas when you was growing up?

I had two real good friends all the way through high school
 Who you had?
 Thomas Jones and Jacob Curtis Jones
 Were they like brothers?
 Well they weren't brothers
They just had the same last name as Jones
And everybody thought that I was a Jones too
But I wasn't, of course, I was a Smith
 ...Right
 But they thought I was a Jones
They called us the ""Jones Boys"", we were so tight
Matter of fact I had a call from one of them...

Hey Dad listen, check this record out!


It was a dark night, I had just sparked the mic
Brought the light, to the crowd
In Hampton, it was amped when
I finished with, ""Brand New Funk""
They were screaming out, ""DO SUMMERTIME!!""
Some of them was drunk, some of the time
I like to chill after the show
But tonight, yo, I wanna get ILL after the show
And there she is
Five-sumthin', short hair, DAMN she live!
The girls get thicker further down '95
I expressed to her, sort of confessed to her
I wanted to get next to her
So I suggested to her, we ROLL...
To suite one ten, sweet ones in
My room, Jeff in one eleven with a friend then
BOOM BOOM BOOM, who dat?
(Open the door!!) Why they do that?
Threw back, by the noise
Some dude and his boys
You know them? Your boyfriend?
More like an annoyed friend
Peep through the peephole
Peeped him and all his peo-ple
That's when Charlie creep through
""Boy, you wanna see WHO?!
Don't nobody wanna meet you!""
Damn, here come the beef stew
""My beef ain't with you (uh-uh), my beef's with Will
So, 
see Mack
, ease back, 'fore yo' cap get peeled""
Charlie said, ""Any beef with Will is, plenty beef with me""
And whenever Charlie get mad, he step to the streets he see the...

Intro
Yo yo yo yo
Yo yo yo yo
(ring my bell, ring my bell)
Yo yo yo yo
Yo yo yo yo
(ring my bell, ring my bell)
Verse 1
I'm just a telephone call away
You can pick it up and call me any day
And ima listen to all you got to say
Cause I'm the type of man that never turn a woman away
Think of this as an invitation
Your heart to mine in a conversation
So when things get to much to bare like the jackson 5
""i'll be there""
Just call me up on the telephone
Call me up when you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell
Chorus
Ring my bell, ring my bell
(ring my bell, ring my bell)
Ring my bell, ring my bell
(ring my bell)
Ri-i-ing!!!
Verse 2
I hate to see you cry, tear after tear while this guy
Plays you like your life is a game
I've seen his type and there all the same
Breaking your heart without a care
Girl if I was in you shoes he'd be outta there
Your man is wak good for nothin' but flack
I'd tell him to pack and hit the road jack
Who loves ya baby I do you know
He doesn't care about you let him go
Where he at now? you don't know
Layin' up under some whole double waste
Just let me chill, no need for me to get ill
Cause yo I'm the best and yo time will tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell
Chorus
Verse 3
Now I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look at what the future holds for you
And if you lunch then you might ruin
Something great don't make a big mistake
Pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and downs
It's sort of a mission
Now you're on a rocky road
But you could get up just make that decision
That you want the one to love adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way
Baby you can ring my bell

A Willie,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Big Willie (repeated)

One for the treble, two for the bass
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince back up in your face
Me and Jeff again, ""Oh my"" you say
1985 to the Y2K
The new millenium, prophecies, I'm fulfillin' 'em
Everywhere I go, people be yelling ""yo, that's Will and them""
I check the rhyme like Quest
Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L
King of swing, and I rock well
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher
Stature of a rapper/actor
Back to the future on wax
The future of rap

Nothin’ on My Mind (Bonus Track),Born to Reign,2002.0,"Nothin's on my mind - 16X

Today I'm goin' freestyle
And everythin' is gonna be about me now
And I ain't doin' nothin', I'm gonna cool out
A little somethin' bumpin', but not too loud
Nothin' jumpin'
I'm gonna get my golf clubs
Or call me a masseuse, and get me a soft rub
Or noddin' with a mimosa, in my hot tub
Or two-way momma me, let's go and get a nice scrub
Yeah maybe that, or maybe I could swim some
Or rollin' in my Bentley, follow my rims some
Where? Yo, I don't know, care if none of my friends come
A hat and shades go out and try to blend some, yeah right
Days off is hard to come by
Especially for Hollywood's number one guy
So let me get to movin', while the sun is high
My cell is off, two-way is off
It's yearly crazy, today is gravy


Half awake and half asleep
As I watch the sun, it slightly moved a little past its peak
And I feel like Tom Hanks but it's perfect, I'm a ""Cast Away""
Agenda full of nothin' but stuff to pass today
My sister asked me to cook somethin'
But that would fall into the category of doin' somethin'
And I done already said to ya'll that I ain't doin' nothin'
So let me say it again to be clea,r I ain't doin' nothin'
Hmm, phew, a breather
I meant what I meant, when I said, when I said it's all leisure
Neither, chart toppin' crowd pleaser
Phone rang Jada said, ""Uhh he's uhh,"" I ain't home, so turn that phone off
Come and sit on my lap, and take a load off
And lay down into my arms, and we could doze off
To work as much as I work, I must be thrown off, what a day


Yo, yo, yo, mic check, mic check
Ah, that's cool

That's hot right

Yeah, alright I'm gonna do the umm

Hey Ramon help me out dog

This is hot

Nice flow, hot like nitro
Cool as ice though
That type of docodimy
Y'all know it's gotta be
Who else could it be, but me
Rub your eyes but hold the big billy
It's dream supreme bean straight from philly
It's the eclectic female attractor
Rapper slash actor, right back at ya
And to the next millinium
Many come but few are chosen
See me servin' like the u.s. open
Another type of hustler, listed at blockbuster
Go and ask a movie usher
Who is he, he or she, sfp, movies, cd's, and tv's
But uh uh, 'cause the day i take a break from that
As i rule where a tank of gas take me at
I used to rock these, red, i rock z's
Now i rock the mb's, with twelves and v's
Today sun high, up in the sky, from ny
La la, to mi
Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
Easy wrote a sixty
Flossin' ninety degrees
Sony cartridges, ten cd's each
Reach to the beach
South side leanin'
It ain't often i'm off and i'm feelin' for the top down, drop down
Got me hot now heated up can't stop now
What up cutie what sure sure is cooking now
Yo i know, i'm spoken for can't hurt lookin', no
Pop cd's, b.i.g.'s, and 2Pac's
While cruisin' on the blocks
Hittin' the hot spots
Got my celly on o-f-f
Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes
So let's just ease on down, ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip
As i'm rollin' my whip
'cause today i'm on the solo creek
Man, why you think i be workin' so hard all week?
I'm just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
Sun settin' in the s-k-y
Must say i've had the best day i
Tryin' to find an exit
A place to chill not to hectic
So i can spend some time with will
Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind
Soul search, see what i find
If i'm being the best lover and friend
Am i being the best daddy i can?
I pray i am
And i feel good today
Reminiece as i'm cruisin' around the way
Roll tight passed the park where i used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin' my way
Still growin', petrol rowin', move soon showin'
Gots to get goin' losing the light
And the freaks come out at night
Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
I'm just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care

Lovely Daze,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's ten A. M. And I just woke up
Walked to the window and opened the shades up
Sun so bright that I can hardly see
But I'm a black man
So I pass on a tan
Dip to the bathroom take me a shower
But first called up my girl told her be ready in an hour
I was still a bit tired man I'm laggin'
Grabbed the tooth brush to kil the dragon
Ooh have mercy great day in the morning
Turn on the water and I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
Tryin' to get a blender to hot with the cold
Man I'm young but why I feel so old
Get it just right then step to the mirror
Rubbin' my eyes to make my vision get clearer
Everything looks a-o. K
And today is gonna be a lovely day
1 - (a lovely day)
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
So I jet out the crib and hop in the benzo
Today is my girls day and all of my friends go
Just me and her top down on the highway
If you're gonna do it then why not do it the fly way
First a car wash next the barber shop
Then off to my girls crib that's my next stop
A dozen roses a card and candy
I'm a true mackadocious mr. Romanty
She hoped in and she asked where we're goin'
Yo we like a twig in the nile we just flowin'
Maybe to the beach or maybe hook up a picnic
But yo it doesn't matter cause today we just kickin' it
I threw in my homemade slow tape
And off to the beach for some beautiful landscape
Man this is a bonafide lovers delight
Got the ocean on the left the mountains on the right
I said yeah cause that's the way I was feelin'
Free as a bird got the clouds for a ceiling
I wish that I could rest my gas and fly away
Today has been a lovely day
