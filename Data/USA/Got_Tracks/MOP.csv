Ante Up in the fucking background for the real niggas, you nah mean? Shout to Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Staten Island, Uptown Harlem, where the BX, all my real nigga with the 20 inches outside, you nah mean? Fake niggas get the FUCK out, and hold on to your shit, you nah mean? Funk Flex, one time for your motherfucking mind. One!

Take minks off! Take things off!
Take chains off! Take rings off!
Bracelets is yapped, Fame came off!
(Ante Up!) Everything off!
Fool what you want? We stifling fools
Fool what you want? Your life or your jewels?
The rules: (back 'em down) next thing: (pat 'em down)
Respect mine we Brooklyn bound, (bound!) now, (now!)

Brownsville, home of the brave
Put in work in the street like a slave
Keep a rugged dress code, always in distress mode
(That shit gon' send you to your grave!) So?
You think I don't know that? (BLAOW!) Nigga hold that!
(BLAOW!) Nigga hold that! (BLAOW!) Nigga hold that!
From the street cousin, you know the drill
I'm nine hundred and ninety-nine thou short of a mill

Ante Up! Yap that fool!
Ante Up! Kidnap that fool!
It's the perfect timing, you see the man shining
Get up off them god damn diamonds!
Ante Up! Yap that fool!
Ante Up! Kidnap that fool!
Get him, get him, get him! Hit him, hit him, hit him!
Yap him! Zap him! Yap him! Zap him!

Them thugs you know, ain't friendly
Them jewels you rock, make 'em envy
You thinking it's all good, you creep through a small hood
Goons coming up outta the cut for your goods and they all should
Ante Up! (Yap that fool!)
You want big money, kidnap that fool
If you up in the club, I've got your pis-tal money
Catch them fools at the bar for that Cristal money

The '87 stick up kids, (what you niggas saying?)
Get the fuck up out that 740 shorty I ain't playing
It's flash that thang time, (Bang!) bang time
(Ante Up!) Nigga, it's game time
Hand over the ring, kick over the chain
Gimme the fucking watch before I pop one in your brain
Stop playing these childish games with me
Representing 1-718 dangerously, nigga

Ante Up! Yap that fool!

Get him, get him, get him! Hit him, hit him, hit him!
Yap him! Yap him! Zap him!

I'm a street regulator, true player hater
Get back down make yo' ass a MAC sprayer hater
Things that we need; money, clothes, weed
Indeed, hot food, booze, essentials, credentials
Code of the streets, owners who creep
Slow when you sleep, holding the heat
Put holes in your Jeep, respect the streets
It's the L-I-L F A-M-E

Yeah, nigga Danze, gave you a chance
'Cause I blast a man I'm in the wrong?
He said he was strong, I had reason to
Believe he had some shit up his sleeve all along (So?)
Fuck you Your Honor! Check my persona
I’m strung out off of Old Gold and marijuana
I'mma do what I wanna, quiet as kept
(Raise hell!) Till I'm expired and stretched, yes lord

Ante Up! Yap that fool!
Ante Up! Kidnap that fool!
It's the perfect timing, you see the man shining
Go and get them god damn diamonds!

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice

I'd like to welcome mothafuckas to the back
Of the mind of Bill, see I'm for real
When delivering these M.O.P. tactics
I'll bury you bastards, I custom make caskets
The B.G. (Doja nigga) The Y.G. (Soldier nigga)
Even the O.G. (Cobra nigga) Told ya nigga
I may come, with my gun in my hand
To make sure you mothafuckas understand

Pardon me! How the fuck you gon' start with me?
I'm a heavyweight in this game, you just spar with me
You get laced down, from your face down, drop your shit
Niggas thought M.O.P. stand for ""mop"" and shit
Don't... don't... don't... get it twisted
I told you that we top of the line designed realistic for instance
Mash Out Posse will come through and clear your ass out
Dump and air your ass out, chump, we cold

One of the fastest at blasting flashes (Berk)
You seen my work, 
you know my steez
It's a slim chance that I'mma hesitate to squeeze, please
Money never made me, money never played me (No!!)
And Money bet' not make me wack his ass
Subtract his ass when I step through his hood
Fuck dropping you, I'm into stopping you for good

Stop him if you could (You're as cold as ice)
And you'll be, stiff as a log in a suit looking nice
You's a sinner nigga (You're as cold as ice)
But you ain't cold enough to freeze hot slugs when they run up in ya
You ain't in my class nigga, I'm the last nigga
You gon' fuck around and get blast, sucka-ass nigga
The soul survivor, survivor sole
Nigga you roll and I roll, let's stroll, I told you that I'm cold

Yo, I terrorize guys (Exercise!)
Street formula, our hip hop shows, cause pandemonium
Shit, I ain't concerned 'til it's my turn, I snatch a mic
Jump on the stage and show my ass like Howard Stern
But not in that form (Hell nah!)
I perform, lyrical heatwaves, that'll keep your brain warm
But when it's on, you fuck around and get ripped up
Or get placed in a bodybag, with that ass zipped up
Toe tag 'em! (Got 'em!)

Even ballistics won't be able to tell
How the fo'-fo' ragged 'em
Dragged 'em, halfway down the block, now you know
Where a nigga go when a nigga close up a nigga shop

Tell me something new, on behalf of the First Family staff
And homicide crews in control

When Death Becomes You,Get Rich Or Die Tryin’: Music From & Inspired by the Motion Picture,2005.0,"There's nowhere to run to, when death becomes you
Some say your soul may burn in the flame
Can front if you want too, but niggas who merk you
Will come to your tombstone and piss on your grave
You a rider right?, down to ride tonight?
Nigga you gone ride or you gone die tonight
Nigga cock the steel, it's kill or be killed
Nigga shit is real in the field

What's the procedures nigga, when you got a hammer in your mouth?
Will you lay down and cry? Will you stand up and die?
Like the man that I am 
I'm a legend in the town, now
Since your all gangstad up let's get the fuck down
Big Bill Danz and I'm reppin for buck town
Niggas see me dummin, I'm coming clutching the pound
Don't worry bout my whereabouts, we air 'em out clear 'em out 
The pressures on now, you need to get your hammers out 
You too tough nigga, you done wrap it up
Brownsville 
Fif put in the call, we ready to brawl with every one of you all 


You got these young niggas hollering' 
Copper tops on my block, like 
Niggas don't give a fuck
I seen a nigga shoot my moms
Right in front of my motherfucking face
See in the 'Ville' ain't no such thing as a stray bullet
When your index finger on the trigger and you pull it
Slugs ain't never out of season
All you gotta do is give a motherfucker one reason
Blood stains on the cement
Same place he stood, that's were you leave em'
And don't back it out unless your squeezing off with your gun
Cause you gone get your punk ass robbed for your gun
You know the drill
I'm a give your ass 3 seconds to bounce
And you better not jog, nigga run
 Fuck that , Dumb bitch, rest in piss",https://genius.com/Mop-when-death-becomes-you-lyrics
How About Some Hardcore,To the Death,1994.0,":
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

(Yeah, we like it raw in the streets)
For the fellas on the corner posted up 20 deep
With your fifth on your hip, ready to flip
Whenever you empty your clip, dip, trip your sidekick
You got skill, you best bet is to chill
And do yourself a favor, don't come nowhere near the Hill
With that bullshit, word, money grip, it'll cost ya
Make you reminisce of Frank Nitty 'The Enforcer'
I move with M.O.P.'s Last Generation
Straight up and down, act like you want a confrontation
I packs my gat, I gotta stay strapped
I bust mines, don't try to sneak up on me from behind
Don't sleep, I get deep when I creep
I see right now I got to show you it ain't nothin' sweet
Go get your muthafuckin' hammer
And act like you want drama
I send a message to your mama
'Hello, do you know your one son left?
I had license to kill and he had been marked for death
He's up the Hill in the back of the building with two in the dome
I left him stiffer than a tombstone'

How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

(Yeah, we like it rugged in the ghetto)
I used to pack sling shots, but now I'm packin heavy metal
A rugged underground freestyler
Is Li'l Fame, muthafucker, slap, Li'l Mallet
When I let off, it's a burning desire
Niggas increase the peace cause when I release it be rapid fire
For the cause I drop niggas like drawers
Niggas'll hit the floors from the muthafuckin .44's
I'm talkin titles when it's showtime
Fuck around, I have niggas call the injury help line
I bust words in my verse that'll serve
Even on my first nerve I put herbs to curbs
I ain't about givin niggas a chance
And I still write shit to make my brother wanna get up and dance
Front, I make it a thrill to kill
Bringin the ruckus, 
it's the neighborhood hoods for the Hill that's real
Me and mics, that's unlike niggas and dykes
So who wanna skate, cause I'm puttin niggas on ice
Whatever I drop must be rough, rugged and hard more
(Yeah!)
:
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)

Yo, here I am (So what up?) Get it on, cocksucker
That nigga Bill seem to be a ill black brother
I gets dough from the way I flow
And before I go
You muthafuckas gonna know
That I ain't nothin to fuck with - duck quick
I squeeze when I'm stressed
Them teflons'll tear through your vest
I love a bloodbath (niggas know the half)
You can feel the wrath (Saratoga/St. Marks Ave.)
B-i-l-l-y D-a-n-z-e
N-i-e, me, Billy Danzenie
(Knock, knock) Who's there? (Li'l Fame)
Li'l Fame who? (Li'l Fame, your nigga)
Boom! Ease up off the trigger
It's aight, me and shorty go to gunfights
Together we bring the ruckus, right?
We trump tight, aight?
I earned mine, so I'm entitled to a title
(7 fuckin' 30) that means I'm homicidal

How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
:
Yo, I scream on niggas like a rollercoaster
To them wack muthafuckas, go hang it up like a poster
Niggas get excited, but don't excite me
Don't invite me, I'm splittin niggas' heads to the white meat
Try to trash this, this little bastard'll blast it
Only puttin niggas in comas and caskets
I ain't a phony, I put the 'mack' in the -roni
I leave you lonely (Yeah, yeah, get on his ass, homie)
Up in your anus, I pack steel that's stainless
We came to claim this, and Li'l Fame'll make you famous
I mack hoes, rock shows and stack dough
Cause I'm in effect, knockin muthafuckas like five-o
I'm catchin other niggas peepin', shit, I ain't sleepin
I roll deep like a muthafuckin' Puerto-Rican
So when I write my competition looks sadly
For broke-ass niggas I make it happen like Mariah Carey
I got shit for niggas that roll bold
Li'l Fame is like a orthopedic shoe, I got mad soul
I'mma kill em before I duck em
Because yo, mother made em, mother had em and muthafuck em

Knowmsayin?
Li'l Fame up in this muthafucka
Givin shoutouts to my man D.R. Period

Lazy Laz
My man Broke Ass Moe
The whole Saratoga Ave
Youknowmsayin?
Representin for Brooklyn
Most of all my cousin Prince Leroy, Big Mal, rest in peace

Danzenie up in this muthafucka
I'd like to say what's up to the whole M.O.P
Brooklyn, period
Them niggas that just don't give a fuck
[ O.G. Bu-Bang
Bet yo ass, nigga

Stick To Ya Gunz,Firing Squad,1996.0,"Calling the police, calling the G men
Calling all americans to war on the underworld
All I need is money, and I'm getting that money tonight

Let's take a slide through the ill side of town with this B-Boy
Watch out for Jake, snakes and decoys
The streets keep you p-noid
Everyday's a new game, we do thangs for new thangs
This kid got stopped for like three G's and two chains
Yo, I know about these streets I was raised in
In my crib I heard villains outside blazin'
Mad shots was poppin' and, I see visions of droppin' men
Five minutes later some nigga was sprawled out on Hopkinson
That's why this Downtown Swinga
Ruckus bringa be packin bangers
That make your whole shit out of clothes hangers
It's only one life to give in, get in where ya fit in
The fo'-fo' will cold push ya shit in
So keep ya gun breezed for fuckin' with these New York Desperadoes
We'll bust open your head like avocados
Heavy artillery in my facility
For you snake ass ones I stick to my gunz

Yo what up? Ain't nuthin'; is it real? Yeah son
What's todays mathematics nigga?
 Stick to ya gunz!
What's the word? Ain't nuthin'; is it real? Yeah son
What's todays knowledge of self? Stick to ya gunz!

The most beautifullest thing in the world is a fo'-fo' Desert Eagle
Nigga, THAT SHIT IS DIESEL!!
Lethal hollow point slugs bust through any object
Squeeze it at rapid fire, clear the whole projects
I ain't gonna be beefin' or eyein' you
Silently I move violently
Me, ain't no reliable see
I been chasin' and lacin' tough guys for days
Findin' ways to erase 'em, and place 'em in the grave
If it happen the squad's cappin', I'm in the mix
And I'd rather be judged by twelve, than laid by six
My kind, on the front line still standin'
Mr. Billy Danze, and I'll work you with a mini cannon
Holdin' it down it's the drama lord
So you riff, you be lift and laid stiff as a fuckin' board
Firin' squad, niggas on the run
Get props from top notch niggas that ill bill, stick to they guns
 
Yo what up? Ain't nuthin'; is it real? Yeah son
What's todays mathematics nigga?
 Stick to ya gunz!
What's the word? Ain't nuthin'; is it real? Yeah son
What's todays knowledge of self? Stick to ya gunz!

Aiyyo, I represent Queens,
 on crime scenes a murder machine
Put M-16's in niggas spleens
So head for the hills, nigga 'cause when I get ill
It's blood spilled for real
I aim my fuckin' steel and shoot to kill
So grab your bodyshield get ready for the dustin
The biscuit that I'm clutchin'
Puffin' like cess but that's the fuckin' dutchman
Buckin' at all you sucka cluckin' niggas that want the ruckus
We'll be three niggas who's clappin' but we ain't applaudin' you motherfuckers
Keep my mack hid up under back, two shots to crack lids
Ain't gotta go rush to Toys R Us to get you Cabbage Patch Kids
Once I let the laser beams gleam and the red dots are seen
Your whole team is gettin' blown to smithereens
Queens on the motherfuckin' map nigga we stay strapped
In fact I let a AK cap push your toupee back
Runnin' with mad sons gunnin' shit up and leave your hit up for the funds
Niggas better stick to they guns
 
Yo what up? Ain't nuthin'; is it real? Yeah son

4 Alarm Blaze,First Family 4 Life,1998.0,"4/9/75
Raised on a strip called Hamburger Hill
Where guns pop and cops get killed
This is the place where paranoia destroyin' niggas
Catch cases, blow trial to flash they lawyers
We're losin' it, four fives and nines we be movin' with
Caught up in the things that the street game confused you with

Used my smarts and my secret all are firin' lead (Fire ya lead)

Aand jewels old-timer done fed me
Keep my grip steady, squeeze till they drop off
Make sure all other guns are popped off as heavy
Blowin some high-tech shit through your projects

It took me 24 years to figure out what makes this world go round
It's not a man holding ground with dope sound
We gots to ask
Why do you feel that a mill can make you real
When you know that Broke Bill can still
See right through your plastic ass
Before crack was a sport and we had thoughts of getting busy
Before Tef left, and Fame met his wizzie
The town: Brownsville
The place: The Hill
Follow the trail of fresh blood drips you'll end up on my bricks
The Marks: Home of the warrior throne
Home of true thugs that's dead and gone
In the hills most effective chrome
Return these pages
Showin youngsters what I'm facin
Cause we had trouble
We been strugglin since single shot gauges
That's straight ghetto bad luck
But, I done passed up more shit
Than you may ever touch
What, we on sacred grounds
Without the guidance of our fathers
All we know is how to double clutch revolvers
Me and my own staff flaunt a different path
I'm tryin to give Shania and your highness
The finest a kid could have

Go head nigga
A whole lot changed since my brother left
(I can feel you baby)
And since my mother's death
(I can feel you baby)
But as time past, I could see my life flash
Leavin the body and there's no breath
(I can feel ya)
I chose not to let my beretta swing
Cause I'm a veteran
And I'm livin for the better things
It's cold-hearted B
Check the majority of blacks
They slingin crack, livin in poverty
(True life testament)
What you gotta do is live what your life give
And make the best of it
(Try to see the rest of it)
Cause you could easily fall victim to these streets
And death's most definate
(Blood)
Is for the brothers that died
The mothers that cried
The brothers that tried
All we do is
(Sweat)
Steady puttin to work
Handling dirt
Holding your turf
We all shed
(Tears)
For the loved ones
The thug ones
And all deceased peers
And while these other cats play hard
Im'a praise god
And thank god that I'm here

Hustle,Street Certified,2014,"Same game, different players yo
Different players, same game yo
Same game, different players yo
But they don't hear me, listen

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle

Fuck a dollar and a dream, all I need is my Llama and a scheme
Some niggas sling their product to the fiends
But I'm in the stinking ass Lincoln like the one in Dead Presidents
Riding with a lean, out for dead presidents
St. Marxmen raised me, it's evident, I been thuggin' ever since
Now I ain't do a bunch of time with mothafuckas up north
But I push guns to the stomachs to them niggas that floss
They say: ""that boy Fame bad"" got 'em going mad
I don't use that word swag, it ain't in my vocab
To my CBR rider niggas, put it in the air
We don't push Katanas my nigga that's for them squares
I told the church lady put us in her prayers
Illuminati try to put us in the chair
It was a different game when I reminisce
So when a nigga hatin', I just tell him this

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle

I'm a sinner  I'm a sinner
Voted most likely to fail from the beginning
The high stakes, with no faith, and mo expectations to ever fit in with greatness
They see me as amazing in places I can't pronounce now
Forever gracious for that BK bounce now
This factory chrome untinted, en route to an immaculate home nigga, owned not rented
Since i'm in it, then I want it all, ain't no depression here
So yeah you haters will always have a job
I'm different from whatever you envision in the blog
I'm an extension of a traditional nigga going hard
This is Street Certified you don't wanna get involved
My past too deep to be deleted from the log
Don't see me as a rapper, the hood's where I fit
Don't underestimate me dawg, remember this

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle

So when I took through the bottom, no it's not a problem
I'm saluted in every hood, the goons know I got 'em
I ain't the one to stunt but when I do niggas notice
Blow through in that bitch like it's stolen
Back around the block, got one in the slide
All I got is my word, my balls and my pride
Get splashed to the first 48
Worst case scenario, catch me after the first 48
When the heat get hot, I stays in the fold
I rose with them wolves, that ride with them fo's
Collide with you foes and now you surprised at the road
That I chose, to survive and I rose
From casing the dope spot, to paper you can't fold
From beating a black top, to rocking these live shows
I'm Danze, I can never be deprived of this glow
I could tell you, but you already know

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle",https://genius.com/Mop-hustle-lyrics

Bring all your bling
You crawl outta here without a motherfuckin' thang
That Ferrari, that Buggati
The Rolls Royce the bitch with the nice body
His ?? coverin' around that after party
We'll youtube some shit and call it the after party
Home of Midi Capone and Gotti
The original Murder Ink you better ask somebody
We’ll tell you what it is, the murder ??
Niggas will never make the trip
I gotta admit it, my city is pretty
Down the red eye to JFK
You can see my city glow


Welcome to Vietnam, so be alarmed
We gorillas, we in the jungle like Viet Cong
Young killers with fire arms that fire on
Frustrated my niggas ready to pop on
Explodin', baby face grow man
First day album, parole, smell like the bull pen
Spazatic, I smack niggas that laugh at it
Still at it, we push keys in bad traffic
The ruler, 25 shooters
OG selling me, y’all re ??? ???
Grew up in the era of crack dealin' and boosters
Gold chains, diamonds, is on me baby I ??
I ain’t talking with a ?? player
Tell 'em welcome to this city
Where the tech spray and ya need a neck brace
Look deep and see the x-ray
The K.O.B. are good around M.O.P. way


Brooklyn, it ain’t just a burrow it's a blood type
So keep ya snub tight if it's thug life
You young boyz wild like you ain't love life
The OG's will tell ya what it was like
Get caught up in a slug fight (ya heard)
Ain't nothing changed down here but the drug price
Actually, they call me The Great Gatsby
I put ya chest where ya back be
If you ain't wid it then we're about it
It's BK verse everybody
We on the frontline, dippin' from the one time
Hit you with that Nick Cannon, give you the drumline
Stay wildin', up in the club
Puffin' on loud, y'all niggas puffin' on silence

 Watch niggas collapse
Perhaps, we could bust raps or bust caps
 ghetto hell we in, and if it's beef
You tell me and these vill-i-ans will go to war like Israelians
Once I catch ya, I'm guranteed to get ya
Duke, I bet ya, you leave this piece on a stretcher
Ain't nothing to kid about
I put one in your wig and bounce
Leave the rest for the autopsy to figure out
Now, who's that nigga that's tryin to take my spot
New jacks in rap must pay dues before they rock
Yo I run shit like Mr. Harper, because I'm proper
And I rip raps like crackheads strip copper
Partner, it's bug, fake thugs don't get no love
You could easily get got by hot sinking slugs
Nigga what, I take your pride and slide
And turn a rap cipher, into a motherfucking homicide

World Famous,Firing Squad,1996,"It's the world's famous MOP, Firing Squad
It's home team in the motherfucking house
No question

It's the world's famous MOP doing our thing
Recruiting and saluting real niggas like Boo Bang
Billy Danze, hard to notice when I'm mellow
Making moves smoother than Jimmy Fingers in Goodfellow
Never gassed to do
What I have to do
Splashing you, blasting you
Taking your stash from you
Internat-ional, bell ringa ruckus bringa
Downtown Swinga, exercising my index finga
Saying whassup to the people that though we'd desert em
Hardcore was raw but we got more to hurt em
Firing Squad all up in your district
Last album was foul
But yet some missed it
Bet they gon' get with this shit
Who's in the house
It's the last generation
Real ill niggas from the field you'll be facing
Ninety-six flavor for your neighbor, how you like us now?
Bluckka, bluckka, b-bluckka, b-bluckka, bluckka, bloaoow!


Bust it, who stepped out the woodworks and give
Villains Vietnam flashbacks of doin all that hood dirt
The M. O. P still banging
What's strange ain't nothing changed
Them bells still rangin
You wanna be drug dealing
Fuck killing, wack rappers are foul
And plus that shit you talk is out of bounds
Ask yourself is you ready for action packed in
Getting blasted with your whole ribcage crashed in
I'm outspoken
Niggas language is broken
Record labels need to stop that wack shit they be promoting
See me knowin me G I drop physical science
This lethal rap appliance'll fuck up your whole alliance
This is the way we bring things
Check out how we swing things
M.O.P. be having shit jumping way up in Sing-Sing
A new star is born, peace to Teflon
I'mma blow up the East when we release the bomb


Same niggas got my back and
Still blue steel we're packin
Same hardcore raps and
Still focused on makin it happen, whattup
They wanna see us
Tell em hold on
M.O.P. is back and, that's one to grow on
The four pound move
Rugged rounds that down fools
Rough enough to make the whole fucking ground move
Representing and it ain't playing War Games
With nothing to lose
I put him on snooze and blow out his brains
Kick back and watch how it go down
We here so beware, prepare for the throwdown
Crooklyn Crooks, is the ones that blew em
We live in it so I'mma give it to em
Bring it to em raw, that's how you bring it
Bring it to em raw, let the real nigga swing it
Bring it to em raw
Give it to em ruff rugged and fat

Face Off,Warriorz,2000,"Yo a lot of people depend on me (strongly)
I no longer wanna pursue situations wrongly
They say that a man's life, gon' be what it's gon' be
So I switched the game around, 
and now it's on me
(You control your destiny) You niggas keep testin me
Like you want me to show you how messy a mess can be
(You're still a bang-banger) 
One of Saratoga's finest
?? ?? attention now (??) makin your highness..
Yo Bill, what'd you stop for man, what'd you stop for?
Teach 'em, tell 'em how you feel!
As I struggle to get my hands, on a dollar today
I think back about cats, that have passed away
That's why I feel more cursed than blessed
And I wonder what in this world, more worse than stress
I'm a mess with stress, though I present it with finesse
Sometimes I feel as if my heart is comin out my chest
I smoke too many ciggarettes; and the Remi won't
Wash away the pain or get, strain off my brain
See it's the way, we, roll down here, stroll down here
A shootout, is like a common cold out here
That's why I sit back and I laugh at y'all
When it's crunchtime on the frontline, I will blast at y'all
I'm from Saratoga Avenue, I +HAD+ to brawl
It's where I realized it's a cold world, after all
You hear me talkin to ya? I'm on some grown Danze shit
(You'll be comin of age) My life is on a different page;
Able to tame my rage
A little bit different from the first time I picked up a gauge
A little bit different from the first time I stepped on a stage
Take a look at me now; a born winner
In a race against time, like Bruce Jenner
A natural born sinner, can't nobody tame me, or change me
(For no reason at all he's angry, he'll) kill again!
{*beat changes*}

You are now tuned in to the Works of Mart
Take two steps back it's gon' hurt you pah!
Who the fuck talkin that they gon' hurt Jamal?
This ain't no diamond-studded rapper, it's the lover-stutter-slapper
Unpretty type rapper, gritty type rapper
Fo'-five semi-automatic pipe clapper
With them O.G.'s in it, please don't get your shit twisted
Like bamboo with no trees in it
Fall back, motherfucker you can't beat me
It's the Womack, the extension of Danzini
We came into the game with some change for train fare
Two Phillies, a dime bag, and a forty ounce of beer
Now look at him, they hittin the scene slow
Who grindin, who thieves, but I'm lookin mean yo
With a gangster lean though, big dog in it
With my chrome ten inch hubcaps, but I keep 'em clean doe
I know the pros and cons so I married the game
Now it's mommy's little boy left to carry the name
I'm in the streets like a dopefiend with a shoppin cart filled up with copper
Who the fuck gon' stop Fame?
Y'all niggas keep waitin til they pop Fame
And hold your breath while you wait bitch, I got game
Niggas ain't feelin the Fame bitch? Stop dreamin
I'm the shit that felt good comin out of my pop's semen
Hit the streets and thug with me
No matter how disgruntled you sound nigga, you can't fuck with me
Too many dick riders that's quick to go blaow
But look bitch, I'mma let you know now
You fuckin with thugs, what the fuck you think this was?
I'm what you want me to be, stop fuckin with me
Cause I'm a nigga of the earth (earth) nigga of the sea (sea)
Nigga of the sky and fire, fling fire
Why don't I-ah, dump back at your men
It's M.O.P. and we at it again, ah-heh!
I ain't clappin over your head
I'mma make sure I pop somethin through ya
Givin motherfuckers ulcers with lead
Have your parents and the pastor huddled over your bed
May the Lord be with you, game over, you're dead

I talk more shit than Howard Cosell
'Cause your buzz is done, how the fuck you gon' sell?
M.O.P.'s the Mobb, we deep, on the job, we creep
I'm talking twenty-four-seven 'cause they starve the streets
This is ghetto gospel, right hand to Jesus
I'm the Apostle, Brownsville hostile

We still do it like we 'sposed to, street certified
Most of y'all switched up, but we prefer to ride

Acting like you didn't, you know it's better than that
M.O.P. and M.O.B., now what's better than that?
This that, ""Leave a nigga leaking on that club floor"" rap
Beat a nigga Kool-Aid purple out this bitch
Nigga always trying to show his ass around a bitch
I'm good money everywhere, you cowards counterfeit
Don't let your ass write a check you can't cash in
Body bags on deck you get wrapped in
Them guns busting like shit was going out of fashion
That N.Y.C. gritty nigga with a chip
On my shoulder, first nigga say I'm hating, getting hit
I'm the truth, truth heard 'em, give a fuck, I'm your burden
Least of your problems, fuck around, need a surgeon
'Cause we here thirsting, if you there splurging
Show over motherfucker, pull the curtain

Look how they try to play me on this playground
Try to force me to leave
They tried to X me out, good thing I held it down
I was taught to believe it's best to exchange rounds
And to remain down until my remains is found
I face criticism because of a dangerous sound
A lot of underhanded shit that never brought me down
I'm Billy Danze, I move freely through any town
I'm like a prophet, niggas see me and put it down
(Full responsibility when niggas O.D.)
O.G. in the trauma room is because of me
Every nigga in possession of a llama know me
The nigga sitting next to Obama know me
I'm in the street like street lights, never low key
M.O.P., M.O.B.B. is all the hood need
I don't get it through the pipe lines, I'ma go see
I'm positioned between an icon and an O.G

Cause niggas were born to kill

I bust off shots at fools
To avoid these obstacles
I roll deep, me and my nigga Llama
With about seven niggas thats up in the clip to bring the drama
Homicide, take a ride in the hearse
Enemies out to hit me, but I'mma see em first
I'm ready, steady, and deadly but yet nervous
Let my burner serve its purpose and remove him off the surface
Gunshots let off! My instincts was to get him
Make sure I hit him, then break North, shonuff!
Holding down my fort, taking no shorts of no sorts
My four five turn to a blowtorch
It's still cocked! I tried to get away safe
Yo that shit was hot as hell I still stuck it in my waist
Dud my dirt, YEAH, did murk, YEAH, murder was the case
Then it hit heart beating like a nigga on base
I found a spot, chilled, parlayed for a second
Fixed my weapon, then headed back to my section
Now I'm back home smoking and drinking I'm bent now
I meditate on flashbacks of how it went down
It's kill or be killed, thats a true fact
There ain't no telling when these niggas are coming to bust open your back
It's ill, it's real, but still I feel
If provoked murder, nigga I'm born to kill

Yo, it's the case of the state
Versus the great one seven one eight
Gun slinger from Brownsville
Where niggas were born to kill

You said you was across the street laying with the heat

What? That bitch lying
Here's a cocksucker I never heard of
I ain't doing time for no motherfucking murder
When Mr. Gonzalez was stretched in the mud
I was home with the dog dome taking down what's up
Therefore I'm innocent!

Mad shells were spit

They ain't mine
I do damage with an Imp, they found shells from a nine
This shit is crazy
Would you please contact Lazy
Tell him I need an attorney
To ride with me on this motherfucking journey
Now, ten months later, after being indicted
Third off of fifteen are clickin' shit so fuck it I'mma fight it
Me and the Jewboy lay back after D.A. spoke
Cross examination, Bernstein jumped up and broke no joke
Stepped over the judge's crown
Stepped on the D.A.'s ground
Looked at the snitch with a frown
Went to the jury and got down
Seventy-two hours later, creeping on some playing the wall shit
Toting the same Glock Mr. Gonzalez got knocked off with

Until you see his wig burst, before he flame his
You see a man gon' claim his
Duke a soldier gon' aim his, and try to kill yo' ass
Niggas see Burk''on the conduit
In the left lane doin his thang, whippin a Buick

They'll never be able to understand what we got son
We've been down a long time

""We don't rap, its not about rap we livin it what they talkin about
It's not about college or what you read in a newspaper or magazine. It's here its reality, this is our nature. It's how we live.""

Now everybody on Earth wanna rap, we birthed all of that
Knocked up the game, and cold broke its back
Gang Starr, with Billy Danze and Big Slap
Word to Laze, Big Scoob and big gats
You didn't whip it right so pick up the pace
Word to grimy niggas, they want to stick up the place
Word to hip hop, plus a crib that's laced
Primo's breaks, activate the mental to solve
We got credentials galore, fuck a small vending tour
Yet and still, I be at the around-the-way spots
Near where niggas be slinging innocent get hit by straight shots
And brave cops, protect the community
While corrupt cops, be harassing you and me
Pulling me over, in front of the crib, in front of my neighbors
Asking for favors, here's a cassette and why you
Question my behavior?
Pursuing me, trying to catch me off guard
I shrug scars, you see a lot of hoes at thug bars
I don't care what these beats might do
We'll sun you, plus I see right through
It's way it means to me and M.O.P
Just To Get a Rep, nigga, you best to step, nigga

As a soldier, I've done a lot of shit
To the so-called tough dude, I ain't mad at you
But I wish I wouldn't of had to do the shit I had to do
It's true, I would jump up in a Bamma
And travel miles of road to unload this hammer
(And I) Notice ?colors? when they glance
At the baby boy of Haddy and Frank Danze
I won't stress to blazin
But I will think about what size slug best for the occasion
(It's so amazing) That it never worry me
Pop shit like Windy Williams till you fuckers bury me
(Who we be!) What, what's wrong, nigga?
(First Family) Come, come on, nigga!
(Ain't nothin cute) My niggas is ready to shoot
For the love of the First Family thugs
Salute!


Before you slit your wrist, bitch, imagine this
M.O.P., Gang Starr (Damn!) hazardous
Thugs that got love for this hip hop and shit
Makin words rhyme at the same time poppin shit
I used to go to jams, and drop grammar
Before I left niggas told me (Boy take your hammer!)
Sure nuff, shit got rowdy
Dumped off my first clip at a house party
I love this rap shit, though, the love is clear
But fuck the parties, my nigga, I lost a brother there
Only if I'm gettin paid (That's right)
And the shit gon' benefit the trade
I snatch a mic, turn it out, bet
Even have you smooth niggas fuckin up yours shoes and your outfit
I be, the Brownsville slugger (Signing out)
Act like you know what I'm about

What the Future Holds,First Family 4 Life,1998,"A big city baby
Time to bend on some shit
Yall people dont understand
That shit is real out here
Im a tell yall a story
Now this story didn't happen too long ago
And it wasn't that far away
Its about some real niggas
Niggas doin real things aight
So let me get to the first page and Ill break it down like this
Chapter one

I was a young child, lost, went to church on Sundays
Walking a narrow road that lead me to gunplay
I was a good boy respect my mommy
Looked up to them OGs like Querto, Phil, and Donny
Felt good as a young nigga
Comin home from school gettin love from them neighborhood drug dealers
Wrote change, Cadillac Sevilles
But spoke real, was a tradition, Brownsville
That was the first chapter, passin these stages
But the book is wider and its a lot more pages
The game changed, people got foul
And the same little chuch boy is buckwild
Runnin wit my homeboys from three three nine
And one five four five, totin four fives
I kept dreams of being a rap dude
But I know the streets too well so I pack tools
I lost a lot of loved ones to these streets
And lost a lot of loved ones over beef
That goes to show these streets haunt ya
Look what society created now, a monsta

My day and age was a different role
Its when a slug take a niggas soul
(Slug take a niggas soul)
Follow your dreams and follow your goals
Cause who knows what the future holds?
(Who knows what the future holds?)
Our man died and was left cold
Because a slug took the niggas soul
(Slug took the niggas soul)
Follow your dreams and follow your goals
Cause who knows what your future holds
(This is what your future holds)

I wish somebody would lend a hand
So they could see how I fell inside
Im on an emotional roller coaster ride
Nothing to hide
A long time ago I set aside my pride
And used my past as a ghetto guide
A few good men died, several wept stood beside me
So I could smooth out the road for those that come behind me
You know where you can find me
Out on the back blocks
Grippin black Glocks in front of crack spots
Its just a hobby
And since I was a baby
Thuggin, smokin, drinkin, totin is how the first family raised me
( He who lives as a gangter, will perish in these streets )
I know thats deep
But I still shed tears for my mother, two years
After shed been laid to rest
And still some things I need to chisel off my chest
My remedy for stress, I conversate wit my oldest brother
Ten years after his death
I know theres nothin left
So Im forced to take a deep breath
Before I attempt to take another step
A lot of brothas slept
A lot of brothas was left cold in the street and told
This is what your future holds

So there you have it
You see, a lot of niggas talk about bullshit
Talkin about cars, jewels, and money
But in all reality, we all come out the same bag of shit
Some of us may never see tomorrow
So my niggas
Dont you never dont you ever forget where you come from

Got the Genovese sayin 'Who the fuck is that dude?'

Never the game, cause game is partially gift, but partially lame

You faggots ain't doin' it right
So here's the cup of brew from the firing squad, we're trigga nigga stripes
I'm fishin' the breeze but please, believe when you come, come right

With rough sounds to shut down your whole record label

Makin' soloist acts and rap crews retire
We bring it to 'em raw and my squad start to fire
It's a gunman's festival
Still turnin' all fools to vegetables
You're fuckin' with professionals

My people desire the line of fire. Kid, there's two options
You either get the fuck up out of Dodge or get to poppin'
I'm stoppin herbs from rockin' fake hip-hoppin'
Gangster boy boppin' is fuckin' up the game

Of them pissy ass lobbies and hallways

With a dusty-ass .38, increase the murder rate

My childhood friends gone, body after body
(DAMN!) But in the hood is where you find me
Hangin on like a kid to his mommy in tsunami
With hip-hop dreams, waitin for a nigga to sign me
Last of the Mo'Picans, new kids grimy grimy
Nobody to trust besides me

You pushed me, right out of your mind

YEAH! Uhh
Brooklyn, New York, forever and always
As a child I never thought I'd come out of the hallway
To focus and become a commodity someday
While stricken by poverty, sittin in gunplay
(Forever and always) perfectin the grind
While tryin to become one of those expected to shine
And that's a small percentage, it's vintage
For niggas to get into some shit, that have life-threatening endings
To show us they here for us, they sendin a prayer for us
The day of the death sentence, they ain't there for us
(NO!) They don't care for us (NO!) it's in the air for us
Yeah we do what we do, but somehow it's there for it
Here's the fatal attraction, they got us caged in
They offered us magnums and asked us to blaze 'em
Tell 'em I ain't sinnin for 'em no more
I'll sin if I gotta sin but I'm more into winnin the war

With the radio bumpin EPMD's (You a Customer)
When a nigga momma bought a block of cheese from a customer
Back when, I went to kindergarten with Smoothe Da Hustler
Before FIFTHS, before MACS, before TECS WITH MUFFLERS

The days before your boy Lazy Laze put his trust in us
Before dudes, from other crews was lovin us
Way before them people in Japan was discussin us
And like now, back then, niggas wasn't touchin us
Niggas wasn't budgin us, niggas couldn't fuck with us
The only way to get it done was pursuin the cover up

Then I'm gone

As far as rap go, I just happen to know how to flow
I just happened to be at it from the do'

Don't get yo' shit hit up, lit up
And your shirt painted burgundy, rushed off to emergency
Sheisty-ass cats like that, we leave 'em on the pavement
Same niggas that'll piss on you and tell you that it's rainin

This is for the old school niggas from back in the day
When bubblegum soul was legit wit waves
Slick Money was a popular phrase
And we learned to let the pistol spark, bark and blaze

This is for them cats from way, way back
When every pair of sneakers had to have a hat to match (damn)
Y'all look good in them sheep skins
Make noise in the middle of the street all week
Always had a plan, it only took a dime to reach out and touch a man
Can't be fuckin up them sneakers while you at ya jam
Get up on the speakers and your B-Boy stand
I remember the Beemer, I remember the Cadillac
I remember the seat broke back
I remember the chick wasn't legit unless her ass was fat
Uncle, I remember all that
When the main reason for squeezin was to let 'em know your got one
Pop shots at the party to see niggas run
When the 38 long, was the worst biggest gun
You niggas had a lotta fun



I used to them lean (lean) hard as fuck
Hit the scene (scene) hard as fuck
Spoke rims, white walls, cruisin the block
In them 98 Oldsmobile wit the rag top
Try to look these in your BVD
In the wind, wit ya Kangols, Puma's and Lee's
Used to drink private stock, Millers and Old Gold
Had the v-goose sweater when the weather got cold
Oh (oh) dirty 38's was the tool that'll bless you
(Saturday Night Special)
O.G. niggas, God damn I miss 'em
Pumpin Run-D.M.C. thru the goose neck system
It don't matter, up or down hill nigga
Nobody whoop ya ass like a Brownsville nigga
If you locked down, deceased or up in the bow
This is M.O.P., shout to your isle, for the love



Back in the days, back in the days

Back in the days, back in the days

Plenty birds on the curb when we (riding through)

Let me enlighten you motherfuckers on my conspiracy theory
THEY GOT US STUCK IN A BOTTLE so y'all can't hear me
THEY SAID THE HOMEY'S A PROBLEM that's just so y'all can fear me
And never break bread with this family who take care of me
Just keep in your head (SHALL WE BANG) dude we bang too
Don't make me pick up my shit and spit, none of these flames at you
(WE BREATHIN EASY) That's right, that's the thang to do
(WE KEEP IT GREASY) and we ride like the Rangers do
Dude believe me, the gangsters that I'm bringin through
Is down to bang a dude, maybe even hang a dude
Maybe even bring you to a town full of vultures
And cobras, and these niggas'll cut yo' ass homey
And the way we do our thang is somethin like a magic trick
You might wanna get in line or get killed in this faggot shit
You faggot bitch! Nigga you done got all flossy and glossy

At your tough ass, get the fuck from 'round here with that kind of talk
This is Brook-Nam nigga and I'm Mo' P'd up
G'd up, dude gon' fuck around and get beat up
Cause you treed up, intoxicated off the alcohol
Homey my niggas ain't worried 'bout y'all
Cause when it's on we gon' ride for the cause
And spit more than 16 at yo' ass and we ain't talkin 'bout bars

I was broke as hell and I ain't even come out with an album yet
I was drivin my moms little Chevette, and shit
And I knew, Scoob Lover and shit and Scrap Lover
And I bumped into Scrap Lover, in New York
Drivin around the Coca Cabana and shit
I was dolo, and he ran to the Chevette like he had beef
With somebody in the club
So he jumped in, like yo, and he brought his lil' man with him
And he was a rider, and that was Lil' Fame!
And we drove around the block and shit
Back around to the club, and uh Scrap Lover jumped out
Started buckin in the air like WHO WANNA JUMP ME NOW?
Cause I think some niggas tried to jump him
And Lil' Fame was in the back squattin with the hammer
Ready to let loose, and we ain't even know each other from door!
Then he came out with M.O.P
That's how I knew they were some hard ass niggas
That shit was real

You push to impress, and I leave you with less
It's real love for the mics that I bless, no quest'

Can't stop the love! I know you sayin I'mma young nigga
Don't get it fucked up cause I move with them thug niggas
From all walks of life we straight sparkin light
Bring light to the darkest nights

Make a move and them cats might bury ya
Now that your trapped and your fuckin with thugs
Let me tell your punk ass what I love
I love to see motherfuckers, that show no love
And start speakin out like a bitch when you catch em in the club
I love, when a slug cat shut down
And then try to post up when they damn near cut his ass down
I love, trying to reach all parts of the map
On a Ninja, with a big booty bitch on the back
I love, cats that rap and still grip techs
Like your man Lil' Fame, Bill Danze and triple X
Chorus

Aiyyo, you know what I love (What's that?)
It's when motherfuckers assume
That they ass can't get popped at 12 o'clock in the afternoon
I got the balls to come through your walls, like (Boooom!)
Have an orgasm every time I clear the fuckin room
(Niggas is gone) Nah, not just yet
I need to see you son of a bitches sweat
(I love) What I got, son, my shit is prop', son
With Prem' in the drivin seat and Freddie Foxxx ridin shotgun

Somethin I love is when thugs be bumpin my shit

Niggas that regulate the streets (sho' nuff)

On the homicide side, nigga slide

I love beats that are hardcore, dirty and raw
I love takin niggas burners when they scared to draw
I love plottin on my enemies, I love to attack
I love beatin niggas down when they rhymes is whack
I love seeing emcees struggle to make
Themselves something that us real niggas love to hate
It's too late, I love my Ninas and I love my fours
Blowin holes through the project doors in Nam wars
, nigga
I love the feeling, and the rush that I get
From saying ""Run the Rolex watch with the diamond begets""
I love, how my life was intact without a deal
How I kept the newest chromes on my automobile
I love the fact that rappers make the dough, without a flow
Soft niggas, that I stain, like piss in the snow
I love the fact that I survived through the roughest of times
And break the mic when I want, with the roughest of rhymes
Its a luxury to see me emcee
Its so hard, this lyrical brutality, feed's a nigga's mentality
I love, when you niggas claim to be great
Knowin your Mob ain't never Lynchin shit, what the fuck is this?
Niggas bustin shots on New York, I get my vest on
Twenty rhyme clips in my mic, I get my bless on
Loan soldier standin on the front line, I fear none
Excuses that you give me for your lyrics, I hear none
You niggs ain't no real emcee's
You Sam Goody ass niggas can't write without suckin down trees
So I love, laughin at you niggas, while you clappin at me
I slipping head shot from your man, while he's slappin at me
I feel the hits from your rounds
Your hollowpoints make a nigga wobble, but I won't fall down
*echoes*

Yeah, you motherfuckers see it, come on!

Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, for all them sucka ass niggas that don't know, when
I crawl up out the whole, and I got M.O.P. with me, baby, ain't nowhere

But now my game is changed and my pain's been felt
My hand's been dealt, but it was a missed deal
And words won't express the way a man William feel
I came up with them thugs, I grew up in that mud
Got my hands covered in blood, to stay above
The world (to see a better day)
Please my children need, and I can't find a fuckin way
What can I say, I'mma stressed ghetto soldier
I'm shell shocked from a back block off Saratoga
Remember what I told ya, I'm thirsty now
In fact I feel like everybody's out to hurt me now
Roll wit me now, am I the only cat that never see the

Thuggin, wit guns in they draws
Go against the grain, break all laws
And keep a bitch wit him, wit drugs in her bra

Every day is test so all we do is smoke weed and crack brews
Kid I ain't got Nothing 2 Lose
There comes a time in your life that get trife
And you're forced to pay dues
Kid I ain't got Nothing 2 Lose
Every day is a test so all we do is smoke weed and crack brews
Kid I ain't got Nothing 2 Lose
I seen it all and can't afford to fall so for all wack crews
Kid I ain't got Nothing 2 Lose

What I got to lose when my pops is gone
So many of my peeps died that my heart been torn
Too much pressure, stress ya, that's why I'm a young ass man
Grippin the trigga and not afraid to let my gun blast
My big Brother died from snakes, that is some snake shit to shoot 'em
Real niggas that knew him they must salute 'em
I try to hold my head, and keep on losing my grip
But things ain't legit, my moms passed that it
Here I am, 20 years old tryin to make it in a material world
Controlled by cash and gold
Criminals schemin if they ain't servin ya, they herbin ya
But I keep heat, cuz the streets told me to murder ya
I got some shit in the stash for your ass
That'll make a mathematician need a computer for the aftermath
Since you wake it's too scary G, but it don't worry me
Always wonderin if some fool out plottin to bury me
HOOK

Kid I ain't got Nothing 2 Lose, you know the Hill Street Blues
Make my people wanna flip, and fade they clips to eat
See we wit nothing to prove have Nothing 2 Lose
Never let a chump step on your black leather shoes
I seen my brother Rick slain in the massacre
I'll see his brains,  so I'm askin ya
Should I feel how I feel,  should I be ready to peel 
Shoud I be grippin steel,  is it kill or be killed
To the Death nigga, point blank range
Trained to aim, got my top slugs at your brain
Life don't really mean nothing
How could you think about the next day the way these niggas be bustin
You crazy, goin out, and I'll blaze the trupor
Firing Squad, raise more caine than Cuba 
Now let them hollow point slugs make you jump in the field
Where it's real, we still walk up and dump, nigga
HOOK

So my man, if you can understand the shit that we sent you
It's from the government set ups and shit that we been through
It's ghetto education, simple and plain
Some facts that keep me aware and ahead of the game

If the ghetto mentality keep you wildin G, then I ain't mad at ya
Still hittin for my people in Clinton and Attica
The code of the street is to get deep
And to let 'em know you lettin go your heat, Salute

Make a nigga dust off his automatic, and bang witchu young kids

We, made it easy to trace it, we back with the basics
It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is

Uhh M DOT, O DOT, we still hard with it
Yo' block, his block, we still armed with it
While y'all stopped hip-hop, we moved on with it
Got it on with it, spit it and rung alarms with it
And nowadays I've aged, so I'm calm with it
But I'm the reason Flex started droppin them bombs with it
Up by the club love thugs that's war with it
While the homies in the hood decided to go on, get it
And no, I ain't change lanes on you lil' dudes
I just upgraded my game on you lil' dudes

You better be cool, I give you the WOMP WOMP

It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is
(FOR THE FOUNDATION!) We suffered blood sweat and tears
And cleared all complications
Put it down, in many situations
Still, you are the last generation
So for the continuation
We, do what we do for the next generation
We, made it easy to trace it, we back with the basics
It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is

Run 'em down, gun 'em down, it's crazy when we come around
It's Fame from the underground, 200 and somethin pounds
You know my motto, both arms covered with body art
Don't catch a hollow, we keep arms, fuck a bodyguard
Let me remind you, how I do
If you think I'm just spittin a rhyme nigga you sick as the swine flu
Cause this ain't rap dummy, you get your fuckin face clapped
And they gon' have to fix yo' face back with putty (BOOM)
Get it ugly (BOOM) we do it 3-6-5
+Day 'N Nite+ but I ain't Kid Cudi, it's
M.O.!! Spittin devious thoughts, I'm from where niggas'll
Roundhouse kick your moms, snatched her beads and her cross
Where they hustle hard, tryin to get the keys to the Porsche
Just some of them young boys do it for no reason at all cause


We keep flippin it, we still bringin it
You be lovin what we do

And the rush that you felt from the nigga that you hit, now
How many niggas wanna ride with me, collide with me
Be accesoires to homicide with me

You will stop me, won't you, pop me, won't you

(We buss outta clutches on Magnum triggers) He know that
With the same cats that blaze DAT's on the boulevard
We remain strapped, then came back, doin' it hard
So send your soldiers cobra and I will send everyone of 'em back
With holes under they' hat, falls of through they' back
Damn with it motherfucker (BK!) All day real with it motherfucker
I'm not your average, I'm from a block where they trap cops
And made 'em holler ten-thirteen
It's the commander, Danze, hands, down
You need to know who you fucking with now
Now kill-a-kill again, with an unusual will to win
An unusual will to sin, stop fucking with me
 

It's an every day thing in a every day game
More day every day, motherfucker bang (BANG!)
It's the streets in me, and me, I'm staying tuned to this shit
It's music to my ears, I'm immune to this shit
I'm suffering, from a disease called 'Leave me the fuck alone'
In this full blown (blown), bitch
M.O.P., prepare for the ruckus
And we murder-murder-ma-murder-murder you motherfuckers

Allow me the way out, down out, pull my gun out
Run out in the middle of a street light (Bum, bum bum)
Ah, there you go, bastard, murder international, custom main caskets
Now could any of you cocksuckers turn to me
The way this streetgame is going is concerning me
Whatever happened to the old days
We all blaze, we all study criminal ways

Every night I sit and bask in the memories of Frank and
Sayin' to myself what the hell was he thinkin'
Usage of illegal drugs and heavy drinkin'
Had my old man sinkin'
Now you never seen the Danze cry
But the day that man died
My life came crumblin down like a landslide
Damn pride, now I'm in the zone
Wonderin how long before me and my moms would be alone
I remember what he said
Layin on his deathbed, rubbin his shiny bald head
Respect your sister, don't follow your brothers
Take care of your mother... I love ya 
He told me he believed in me
And he has given me
The strength to be as strong as I need to be
That's when I realized he was leavin' me
It wasn't just my heart or my eyes deceivin' me
At the age of fourteen
It was more than just a goal or dream
To take care of my queen
It's my turn to stand firm as I could stand
My father was a good man

Murderers that took lives just to survive, in 15-45

With thug niggas
Held down drugs for love niggas
Drug dealers bang out, gun shots rang out
Besides that EZ house, was the hang out
Niggas stole cars, and made the spot hot
Cause we parked 'em on the block
Like we copped 'em off the lot
Can't forget the older soldiers, Sput, Leon
Man mad poppin B, St Marks Saratoga!
Motherfuckers knew the block that was poppin them guns
They was like the first niggas in the hood wit M-1's
Some niggas got beat up, them niggas tore the street up
They do dirt, come back, 
Retaliation, niggas shootin for dead
They fucked around and mommy got hit in the leg
Same night, niggas out to get somethin
Malik ran up inside they spot, and hit somethin
I learned the game, stay concerned
So no matter how the world turn I'mma stand firm
Representin where I was born and where I was raised

That's why I tell motherfuckers to back up and play me feet

I walk around with the motherfuckin trey-pound
Just for my enemies so I can blow they chest in

Another basket, casket closin
They put away the Guns, then here come the motherfuckin Roses
Tags are promptly placed on your toes
You're just another nigga dead, gotta go, gotta go
The game is called survival when you play it to the end
Before you go out in a blaze, may the best man win

Dese are the niggas that I'm movin with G
To you snake-ass, two-faced ass niggas
You gon' make me grip and squeeze my shit

Only your life or you're chancin
Me I got a record like my man Charles Manson
Bill puttin niggas on chill, you know the deal
Quicker than a motherfuckin hit man will

Mostly because I never of (kid they tryin to herb ya)

Dead & Gone (Battle Version),Firing Squad,1996,"Intro:
Firing Squad...To the Death
Hook:
When I'm dead and gone, you won't be alone
When I'm dead and gone
Verse 1:
O.G. Boom Bang (that's my nigga), that's right
I told you knuckle Bill will still love you after life
And since your death, everythings changed
The family ain't the same, shit seems strange
I started beef with you, use to eat with you
Sleep with you, creep with you, I got use to seeing you
But heistmaster, I ain't mad at cha
I know some day we all all gonna be up in that pasture
But anyway, we finally got some ends
Princess Imani will be blessed with them diamonds and gems
Just like we always planned, so salute, to ya troop
Tribute from your man Billy Danz I love you
Hook:
When we get there you won't be alone, when I'm dead and gone
Verse 2:
Yo, the whole scenery is packed in, people dressed in black and
The whole place is flooded with tears, I'm surrounded by my peers
There I lay, day after day has been a struggle for the man
But when I'm put six feet under, will my son understand?
This is some, ILL shit, that we DEAL with, because
Caps get pealed QUICK, and we be dealin' with some real shit
It's like a universal cycle, I'm a disciple
You could be left not breathing even if you walking with your bible
So when m body hit that soil and sinkin'
I'm gonna be lookin' right over my son, even when I'm dead and stinkin'
A legacy is left behind, for mine
So he can stay strong, so that he can move on, when I'm dead and gone
Hook:
The way the world is going it won't be too long, when I'm dead and gone
I'm on my way home
Just give it up, just give it up, just give it up
Verse 3:
So kid, don't think you alone, when your daddy's all gone
Cause I won' be resting in peace till I see you grown
Carry on, nothing else could come above you
You best believe I love you, I wouldn't of brought you in this world of
Struggle
There's only two places to go, heaven or hell, well only God alone
Will know, where I dwell, so stay tight, keep your head right
It'll be alright, you'll never be alone, when I'm dead and gone
I be amoungst the fallen members of my family tree
(Baby Boy Brimmer) and my man Spuds McKenzy
Princly Roy and Big Mal, Lameef caught a beat
A cat with that Danzine smile
After I stopped breathing, I ain't leavin', cause I belive in
Achievin' goals, through spiritial soul (REMEMBER)
Death is just a heart beat away
And if you live by the gun, you gonna die by the gun I love you
Hook:
When I'm dead and gone, when I'm dead and gone
The way this world is going it won't be to long
I'm on my way home

That if you try to stand up his fuckin guts gon' spill on him
Play wit'cha kids, or a deck of cards
Me I go extra hard, still tryin to get it, like I'm Escobar
Only question I ask is cash or a check involved
Put me on my P's and Q's, let me know if death's involved
Like I give a shit, ignorant nigga
Yeah I pull the trigger quick, thought you woulda figured this
You want to know why the movement is rigorous
S.P. the Ghost, on some Y.O. killer shit, nigga! .. Bang time


Yo, somewhere in (BROOKLYN) is where you'll find this nigga, in my comfort zone
Semi circled by the grimiest niggas (c'mon!)
Walk with me, spread chalk with me sod
In the field where the real niggas are born (ghetto)
There's no surgeons here, we don't cut up body parts
We blast and leave yo' ass wherever it start
A half a block from the precinct, the homies are beyond thuggin and buggin
My whole borough's in judgment indecent
The thoroughest dimepieces straight out of action flicks
(Gangsta bitch!) Angela Jolie this
Notion, forward motion, do what you gotta do
To get what you gotta get to get your shit rollin
And keep closin, by any means

The nigga that you fake-ass gangstas can't see
I'm willin to die for my respect
If I have to I will let
So I walk with a fifth and I pray to a fuckin tec
In '93 I calmed down
But now these so-called gangsta-ass niggas got gased
Herbs are not ready, derelicts are petty
Nigga, I be your worst nightmare like I was Freddy
Niggas be actin sweet, claimin they packin heat
Get a rugged peek and wanna talk about the street
You niggas ain't livin trife
And rappers that's claimin that they underground
I put they ass under ground for life
Wait, I'mma set that ass straight

Here it is for you niggas that chastise the game
It's M.O.P., nigga, recognize the name
I'm beatin down punks and breakin down chumps
When he stroll I hit him with the old brown pump
Because we're goin all out, word to Miz
You niggas gotta get it like Jason got his
Nigga, your whole shit'll be rearranged
Because I'mma give em a buck fifty and let em keep the change
Another nigga smoked, oh Lord
Because he just finished watchin 'Menace', he musta thougth he was O-Dog
Ass out for the last nigga that wanted drama
Because I smoked him with the 9mm lama
You fake thugs ain't bustin slugs, please
A muthafucka like you deserve 12 to your mug piece
So all you niggas start makin tracks
Because there's too many phoney baloney muthafuckas fakin jacks
I go to work for my joint, muthafucka, you know me
It's the one and only, and M.O.P
Gunsmoke when I defeat a man
Because I smoke muthafuckaas like the 9mm man

Plow! You bitch-ass nigga, you better walk
Only with my muthafuckin burner will I talk
See, I'm from the Marks, and that makes me a marksman
Wanna know tonight? My fifth be talkin
Fake gangstas drive by and try to hit me with a clip full
What kinda shit is he tryin to pull?
All you bitch-ass niggas got to be jacked
Tryin to get wreck, squeezin out nothin when bustin your tec
I'm Billy Danz, overseer of the underground
Hillfigure, yo, bitch nigga, I get down
What I be on is the untold truth of a livin hell
So one of you bitch niggas is comin up out of his shell
M.O.P. goin out till the end
This is how we separate the boys from the men
Real niggas that's ill niggas that kill niggas
The beaver that sneak with his finger on the trigger
Fake gangstas got mad war stories to tell
About how many muthafuckas they blew up in jail
They said their camp was mad deep and they had crazy pull
That little bitch, but now he snitched like Sammy the Bull",https://genius.com/Mop-fag-fake-ass-gangstas-lyrics

To flare arms, whenever we fear harm

And the best way is to eliminate these faggots

Can't no motherfucker feel my pain  
My life is real nigga, I'm gon' ride  
For my homies on the block that died 
It's dedicated to my niggas that's locked
Who's OT on the run from the cops
We straight G's and we never gon' stop
For my street niggas gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep your head uuuuuuuuuup

Where the fuck is your love, y'all in the club poppin bub
Somebody told me that the block need a hug
Ain't nobody tell y'all that Slap need a hug
That's the reason I'm out here huggin the block
Same reason I'm out here thuggin the block
But niggas won't notice until a motherfucker get shot
And stretched out on the block, and the shit won't hit 'em
'til they like ""God damn, I was just now with him""
Now you missin a man that you used to call your man
Cause you didn't notice your man was fucked up in a jam
And your plan that you had for your man, you shoulda brought it to him sooner
Now he fucked up with his back all chewed up
21 gun salute up, to all the G's feelin pain
Like Fame; niggas fucked up in the game
Niggas try to maintain, even if nobody showed you
That they noticin what a nigga been goin through... nigga


Yeah, every day what we deal, we tend to blame it on the realness
Haters never cater to a 'Ville nigga feeling
Mixed up in the past and the present
A lot of shit, went down in the town am I destined, to win or not
That's the question, you can always count on Bill
To reveal the message, when givin a confession
In other words there's a blessing in the lesson
You ain't gotta stick to the script to catch it (catch it)
We had a whole platoon of goons to rep
Then it was like... BOOM, there's 7 of us left
Some got knocked and locked inside cages
A few got popped and stopped at young ages
Enables me to rock hip-hop with these rages
And boomerang pain through Fame when on stages
It's dark and it's bold
I keep a heater cause I'm smart and it's cold


I'm holdin on to thin air! (Look around homey)
Nobody there! (Look around homey)
Nobody care! (I bet you know now homey)
But life is still beautiful, that's what you do it for
Couldn't feel my pain; God forbid you had
To feel my pain I wouldn't wish that on nobody
Never ask why me? That's a stupid-ass question
Cause if not me, nigga then who?
We all deal with pain, and mine ain't no harder than yours
It's really all about how you deal with it
So a nigga can't judge me; I can't tell you how
To deal with yours, but don't kill me {*words fade* only makes me strong}

You man whore fuck bitch, +Deuce Bigalow+
You ain't a she or a he, you a shit rewind
When Fame spit it, you ain't fuckin with him, shit
I'll be around, you can find me where the dogs be at
With more motherfuckin machines than a laundromat

Once again from the hilltops
It's your boy Bill and boy do the boy Bill rock (the homey's so in)
The homey's so real, the true school'll pass over

And I'm trying so hard, to reach the top
Something so unpure.. in the air to catch

You win some, you lose some
It's two roads to choose from, choose one - muddy waters
If your family chose, the road of the old code
You bound to lose one - these muddy waters

To feed his family, it was sweet tears and blood
That's what I call love, what do you call love?
Picture the same man losin his life for some lame bitch
He was out on the grind for, long story short
For Father's Day she'll place flowers on his grave
Then head upstate, to visit the nigga that murdered him the next day
(Look at that) My fundamentals come from the Hill
Saratoga left love in the 'Ville
Still hear the sound of my footsteps, steppin away
From my childhood toward the physique and the frame of a nigga
But mentally I'm stuck in the past
Askin myself why I was walkin so fast
Muh'fuckers think I'm ballin, I ain't ballin
I'm drinkin wit'cha'll tryin to get heart to face Miss Starling
It's like my moms is the angel in the sky
And I can see tears comin down the West Indian lady eyes
But, I apologize, and those I've hurt
With my bullshit, please believe I ain't mean it

Post up at the biggest crack spots
Raised around killers so eventually I popped shots

I learned to survive with illegal guns that know how to hide
Homicide ties, baby, yea, I dominates what you tryin to do
I wear my hat broke down and play the war when I'm sliding through
I gotta crew (Original Hilfiger)
Plus triggers and some of Brooklyn's illest niggers

I keep in touch with myself so I can feel the real niggas pain

Lost in your track so I act innocent
But on the low, I can act real motherfucking ignorant
Raised by an army of THUGS
Who done it all from the smartest to the dumbest
And I, happen to be the youngest
Twenty-two years of being brave as a lion
And that's, with or without the iron
Fools wanna (STRESS YA), then they wanna (TEST YA)
Then you gotta get your steel (Deal with the pressure)

Oh you better know it baby (ill legit!)
But I try not to show it baby
Cause if I got to show skill, I will

Never gassed to do, what I have to do
Splashin' you, blastin' you, international!

Stand back when this nigga kick off, the black stallion
All-American slash Trinidadian
I make a dummy fold, dig him for his money roll
Take the dummy's soul, blast shots in his skullyhole (Gangsta!)
Mister fizzy Wo gettin' busy yo
Make motherfuckers ask, ""What the fuck is he yo?""
I tote the .45 when I feel I'm doomed
Fuck them cassettes I don't plan to die no time soon

Mash 'em out (no doubt) blast 'em out (no doubt)
When it's hammer time we crash the house (no doubt)
Regulate and clear the punk bastards out (no doubt)

Totin' heat and in the streets like yellow lines
And I'm here to represent for 'em

Sayin that WE are the niggas most likely to fail
They had the whole shit (mapped out) they wanted me to (act out)
Put obstacles in front of me hopin I wouldn't branch out
Raised me in a crack house, persuaded me to back out
Lash out, spaz out and blackout for nothin
And lame fucks with stains with a pair of dirty vials
Servin ass serpents with them devilish smiles
I'm on to you; c'mon dawg, I'm hostile on a good day
My only conversation is done in a HOOD way
HOOD play HOOD pray to a whole different God
While standin behind gates we got whole different odds
Try to focus on your cards, a spade ain't a spade
Now put your faith on your ace dependin on when it's played
And when you come face to face, with homey with the blade
You shoulda cased the place, cause homey ain't afraid
Old cutthroat-ass nigga, you need to be rewarded
And when I say rewarded, I mean slaughtered and ordered to die
Where you stand.. can't do it your owns, well I'm here for you homes

One way to survive on these streets 
Rip up, load your clip up, slip up, and 
Cops roll up on you son, got bodies on your gun
Caught up in some shit that your moms always warned you from

Get Yours,Sparta,2011.0,"(November 22nd Sparta - M.O.P. and the Snowgoons collaborated on what will be the greatest motherfucking hip hop album in the last ten years)

Your off-beat DJ
Everything he play
Is all punk shit
Tell him to bump this
That old gorilla in the trunk shit
Yo, I'm a chip off the old block
I'm all I got (Get yours!)
I'm calling shots (Get yours!)
You call cops
Them boys twat
When it's gon' stop?
Come on nigga you a warlock or not?
You ain't a real killer
You just talk a lot
(About) Your coke spots
(About) Your dope spots
(About) Picking up bricks from the boat dock
(About) Your bulletproof whips like the pope got

Get clipped on your own block
You hear the road blocked
It's like Fort Knox
This is Brownsville homie
Keep them both cocked
And we ain't worried
Legendary mean it won't stop (It don't stop!)
We fluid on the blacktop
And 1545 still the backdrop
Been there done that
So whatever you got locked, run that
Or get your snapshot sent back ugly

And they say New York City
What's that? (Get yours!)
What's that? (Get yours!)
What's that
And we say New York City
Fuck that! (Get yours!)
Fuck that! (Get yours!)
Fuck that!
'Cause a fifth with a fifth, shit we all be drunk
If there's something in your bottle nigga pour me some
If I ain't stand up you could call me punk
But I'm real so a bitch can't call me on (Come on!)

Dirty like a stolen black nine with a body on it
Don't nobody want it, I put my mama on it
Chrome tecs so what the hell you probably find me on it
Tools down to my kicks you know how I be on it
They say them niggas Fame and Bill too aggressive
They say them M.O.P. boys is too reckless
Y'all niggas is P.U. with 2 S's
And I ain't never buy the bar out for you heffers

You keep fucking around and we'll stretch ya
Saratoga Ave., bet it, whole different texture
We all in the mix of the blitz while y'all lecture
We in the thick of the shit with no pressure
Get it and go, you gettin' it raw, Fishscale
Top of the line, kept on the low M.O
We outshine them niggas in prime time
Deliver the bam! bam!. This undeniable grind

And they say New York City
What's that? (Get yours!)
What's that? (Get yours!)
What's that
And we say New York City
Fuck that! (Get yours!)
Fuck that! (Get yours!)
Fuck that!
'Cause a fifth with a fifth, shit we all be drunk
If there's something in your bottle nigga pour me some
If I ain't stand up you could call me punk
But I'm real so a bitch can't call me on (Come on!)

I still stay in touch with the streets and spit thuggery
I stay sucker free, who wan' rump me?
Salute to the die hard fans that fuck with me
Start a mosh pit, fuck around, loose a couple teeth
That's what people want so we designed it raw
With the Snowgoons behind the boards
The pallbearers of hip hop
We carry your whack ass off then bury y'all
This is real heavy y'all
(MARXMEN)

Three steps ahead of y'all
Three generations in so we bet it all
In the middle of the street where we set it off
Nigga really want a win he gotta get involved
M.O.P. dog we been AWOL
Big Hemi in my chest for the long haul
Turning a nigga to a mess is what I'm going for
Leaving hollows in his chest is what we cause

And they say New York City
What's that? (Get yours!)
What's that? (Get yours!)
What's that
And we say New York City
Fuck that! (Get yours!)
Fuck that! (Get yours!)
Fuck that!
'Cause a fifth with a fifth, shit we all be drunk
If there's something in your bottle nigga pour me some
If I ain't stand up you could call me punk

City,Dame Dash Present: Paid In Full Soundtrack,2002.0,"It's another night in the city of lights
I sit back and take it all in
Yo' city, my city our city baby
His city, her city our city baby
With another night in the city of lights
I close my eyes and the sun rises again
New York, New York, it's our city baby to yo' city baby

One do you want from me?
Are you saying I shouldn't raise Hell?
I give you true tales, you're concerned with who sells
Whether you benefits from who balls or who fail
(FIRST FAMILY) Will brawl and you'll bail
Time to unveil and climb in your hole
The homies do rap like black rock and roll
And ain't no party like a Mo P. party
Dawg a Mo P. party don't welcome e'rybody
Yo (AND WE GON' LAY IT DOWN) and show 'em how to party right
With trey bags and half pints of Bacardi Light
You start a fight, we do it as a ritual it's pitiful
Y'all cats ain't keeping rap traditional
You're listening to the words of me
I ain't trying to hit you with the third degree but you heard of me
I'm the original
Y'all wait for me to change
I just sit back, relax and nurse the game
Nigga


This is based on life stories
Yo, I illustrate a portrait of pain
On how we got lost in the game
I think back to the good times
The rise and fall
The sorrow and pain that come with the namew
Of those that did it to win
These are the days of my life
Wish I could live it again
But I can't, times over fast like BK
Motion picture I fast forward my life squeeze play
To the days of the 2 triple 0
And it's mad fake love
Snake cats and half fake thugs
God damn homie
What changed you?
Them birds in your hand?
Did you really have to murder your man?
With the greed to earn grams
Just a handful of real niggas that's left
That ain't dead they in jail and they gon' have to understand how
One nigga can fuck up a plan
And have a nigga mentally dead, confined in a can",https://genius.com/Mop-city-lyrics

It gets spooky at night, I saw fiends talkin to they shadows
Things done changed now I live in the meadows
Cribs so big when I speak you can hear a echo
But vanity is vanity (AY!) life in the Hamptons

My First Family in tact... for life (Marxmen!)

Yo! You ever look into the eyes of the Grim Reaper?
Watch a man die when the shots fly and the shit heat up?
You in deep but, it's too late to back out
And now it's like your whole life is under a black cloud
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
And you always swore before you wasn't scared to die
But take a look in your eyes, and see the fear in 'em
You know them niggas comin they came here to get him
And they ain't playin with him, they aim and spittin
Give him a closed casket, they plain sicker than Ol' Bastard
If only he can go backwards, to the days
And change when he used to throw those ratchets in nigga's face
Stole packages, from nigga's place of business
When they was tryin to make a livin, they ain't forgive him
And niggas stay forgettin, so as soon as he came home
From state prison niggas came and hit him

(Suicide, it's a suicide)
When you don't know who to try cause, even you could die cause
(Suicide, it's a suicide)
Gotta rely on your wits, can't get caught up in the mix kid
(Suicide) Right or left, choose a side
Life or death, you might be the next dude to die (Marxmen, Marxmen)
What's your next step? I'll let you decide
(Suicide... Marxmen)

Yo, it was a chick named Dawn, she used to get it on
Honey had niggas slippin money up in her thong
At the strip club givin dubs, 20 a song
And if the price was right she might come with him home
She was fuckin one of the customers, Asam Allah
Dude was a fool, used to walk with her under the arm
Used to take her to Jamaica, lay with her under the palm
Treat her like a queen, really all he was was a pawn
She only seen him as John, he ain't mean nothin to her
She was just leadin him on, he just feedin into the con
All along, and he felt that that was real and nobody could try it
She came home and gave homes the virus
She got nice, can't turn a ho to a housewife
And he stabbin it raw dog, gamblin without dice
Now he ready to snuff out her life
Cause the AIDS results back, they ain't come out right


They used to meet up every night, at the gamblin spot
After all the block business was finished of scramblin rock
They'll meet up at the spot, get a couple of drinks
All the fly cars in Bronx pullin up in they mix
Lock the door, buy the bar out, this is our house
Everybody's laughin, there's cash in large amounts
They tappin glasses, toutin it's a family thing
Catch a case won't nobody in the family sing
That's what they think, all along they all was wrong
It was a dude with a device strapped to him recordin
Every convo that they had, where they sellin, where they scorin
Dude got knocked before but said he got off with a warnin
And they ain't get the message 'til the next mornin
When detectives stormed in the door, arrest 'em and took 'em all in
Now what they wanna know is who put the call in
Toss him off the bridge and turn his kids to orphans

Drama Lord,To the Death,1994,"Drama lord

Billy Danzini is known to the world as a drama lord
Beat more bodies than Mr. Gotti, so I'm not a fraud
If you're clever, then you can put 2 and 2 together
Real niggas do real things, so that mean whatever
You was warned before you came
So I ain't to blame for your ass being torn out the frame
I get nuts off whenever beef occur
All I'm askin ya, is, are you ready for the massacre?
If you want it, then you can get it, homes
What you fail to realize, is, Danzenie is not alone
Come with your boys and roll with force
No need for your vest, cause I ain't in it for your chestboard
Tell my peoples that's real: Get your steel
Nigga slipped up, so grip up and meet me on the hill
Lil' Fame (Whatever) Ruff is with it
Shaq, call for Bang and tell him to bring the thang-thang
Danzenie will never have it, that's why I keep my automatic
In case I run into some static
Search all night, lookin for the gun fight
Troopin from dust to dawn, ready to get it on
Creep through the town, checkin out the scene
Index finger on the trigger of my serve machine
So don't ever harass me, or put nothin past me
Cause you'll be the next when I blast, gee
Bust caps back at your mac, and clap, this is the proper applause
For Billy Danzenie, the drama lord

Which one of you bitch niggas is ready to start static?
Who want it (I want it) Slap, let him have it!
Clack-clack-pow, buck him down somethin sweet
Cave in his chest, put him to rest on the concrete
M.O.P.'s ready to hurt a muthafucka
Bustin a nigga down with the Brownsville Sluggers
Punk niggas game, and I spot it
When I pack out my joint muthafuckas say: ""You got it!""
Once it's on nobody play fight
Shit jump off, and I pump that ass off broad daylight
Instead of a nigga hurtin me first
I put that shit in reverse and put that ass in a hearse
Though guys come with it and get it
Whenever I got my heat, man
I bring the beef like the meat man
Put him away, send his ass to Jesus
Put his ass to sleep, let him rest in pieces
Me and my peoples got all types of gats
12-gauge shotguns, Tec-9 nines, and Macs
4-pounds and tray-deuce, and a .44 bulldog
To set it off and let the dogs loose
Put up your shit and we can rumble
But if I'm in double trouble
Then I'mma bust a nigga like a bubble
See, the niggas that I roll with, they don't run
Niggas use every muthafuckin bullet in a gun
Son, we'll bring the terror to your territory
Pump em up, dump em off, and after that go get a 40
Word to mama, when it's drama I send em to the morgue
Niggas can't stand the reign of Lil' Fame, the drama lord",https://genius.com/Mop-drama-lord-lyrics

The Money Got Lost,M.O.P. Presents Marxmen Cinema,2004,"GUNS! MONEY! WEED! LUST!

The feature presentation you're now hearin out of your system
Is presented in a format for surround sound
Starring them, ultimate thug niggas from Bucktown
Watch the picture while you listen or GET THE FUCK OUT
This is Marxmen Cinema, motion picture made for the listeners
To vision with the special widescreen edition
Make sho' I hit that liquor when you pass it around
Now kick back, let me tell you how it all went down
It was the money (money) YUP! Money got lost
Nobody seemed to know how the MONEY GOT LOST
So Money switched sides after the MONEY GOT LOST
And they found him at the crossroads cause the money got crossed
He arrived like, Dean Johnson in Bucktown
To the same neighborhood his older brother got gunned down
With a plan to takeover the town and everything in it
The good, the bad, and whatever come with it
See; I know what y'all thinking, but he can't be moved
And he can't be pushed, and he can't be touched
Cause he got goons with necessary firepower
To move in the town and shoot it the FUCK up
But it's another crew of gangsters in the hood
And them niggas is mad (MAD) sick (SICK) head no good
And them niggas want parts of the scene, it's a war now
So the town explode like sparks in gasoline
No respect, disrespect, in all aspects
Some niggas don't know who they fuckin with, they should stop and check
And get a grip 'fore somebody get killed
Now they tossin bullets over Brownsville
It's all over the money (money) YUP! Money got lost
Nobody seemed to know how the MONEY GOT LOST
Money betrayed Money and then MONEY GOT LOST
Money gon' fuck around and get his mommy knocked off
Over this money (the money) YUP! Money got lost
Nobody seemed to know how the MONEY GOT LOST
When Money switched teams that's how MONEY GOT LOST
And they found him at the crossroads cause Money got crossed over this money

Welcome new players to these homicide layers to be slain
Look both ways before you cross a nigga
Decent families have lost a nigga, that came across a nigga

What I got to lose when my pops is gone
So many of my peeps died that my heart been torn
Too much pressure, stress ya, that's why I'm a young ass man
Grippin the trigga and not afraid to let my gun blast
My big brother died from snakes, y'all did some snake shit to shoot 'em
Real niggas that knew him must salute 'em
I try to hold my head, and to keep from losing my grip
But things ain't legit, my moms passed that's it
Here I am, 20 years old tryin to make it in a material world
Controlled by cash and gold
Criminals schemin if they ain't servin ya, they herbin ya
But I keep heat, cuz the streets told me to murder ya

Since you wake it's too scary G, but it don't worry me

Still hittin for my people in Clinton and Attica
The code of the street is to get deep
And to let 'em know you lettin go your heat, Salute

The nigga that you're hearin ain't the motherfuckin one
Now if you're real, motherfuckers, please stand

And anyway I think I do need a toy
I won't take nothin fake I need the real McCoy

Up the, Westside and take a ride in my rented
It's the, best time - you see the moon lookin right
It's somethin about the way the stars shine at night
And you can tell me how you think I should be treated
How my life is incomplete and how you feel you can complete it
There's no one to compete with, I never been conceited
What you sayin I believe it but I sho' would like to see it and..

That's why I do things that stay gettin you off often

By my side, like my pistol she'll ride
Even when the road is rocky, she holds me down properly

We ain't Bonnie & Clyde, c'mon ma, let's take a ride

You keep talkin like we side to side
And like you got me the Foxx all mesmerized nigga
I got pride, there will be no foolin around

C'mon ladies stand up and be a witness

Picture this I just met this kid, and he talkin game

Yo Bill, what'd you stop for man, what'd you stop for?
Teach 'em, tell 'em how you feel!
As I struggle to get my hands, on a dollar today
I think back about cats, that have passed away
That's why I feel more cursed than blessed
And I wonder what in this world, more worse than stress
I'm a mess with stress, though I present it with finesse
Sometimes I feel as if my heart is comin out my chest
I smoke too many ciggarettes; and the Remi won't
Wash away the pain or get, strain off my brain
See it's the way, we, roll down here, stroll down here
A shootout, is like a common cold out here
That's why I sit back and I laugh at y'all
When it's crunchtime on the frontline, I will blast at y'all
I'm from Saratoga Avenue, I +HAD+ to brawl
It's where I realized it's a cold world, after all
You hear me talkin to ya? I'm on some grown Danze shit

Able to tame my rage
A little bit different from the first time I picked up a gauge
A little bit different from the first time I stepped on a stage
Take a look at me now; a born winner
In a race against time, like Bruce Jenner
A natural born sinner, can't nobody tame me, or change me

Take two steps back it's gon' hurt you pah!

Two Phillies, a dime bag, and a forty ounce of beer
Now look at him, they hittin the scene slow
Who grindin, who thieves, but I'm lookin mean yo
With a gangster lean though, big dog in it
With my chrome ten inch hubcaps, but I keep 'em clean doe
I know the pros and cons so I married the game
Now it's mommy's little boy left to carry the name
I'm in the streets like a dopefiend with a shoppin cart filled up with copper
Who the fuck gon' stop Fame?
Y'all niggas keep waitin til they pop Fame
And hold your breath while you wait bitch, I got game
Niggas ain't feelin the Fame bitch? Stop dreamin
I'm the shit that felt good comin out of my pop's semen
Hit the streets and thug with me

Too many dick riders that's quick to go blaow

Strike a nigga chest, right in the pocket like Ryan Nolan
And I'll run you down, stomp yo' ass, and leave you swollen
Pick up your cash, take all your burners and keep it rollin'

With the stainless steel, we still claim the 'Ville

Monsta,"All Out War, Part 2",UnKnown,"A big city baby
Time to bend on some shit
Yall people dont understand
That shit is real out here
Im a tell yall a story
Now this story didn't happen too long ago
And it wasn't that far away
Its about some real niggas
Niggas doin real things aight
So let me get to the first page and Ill break it down like this
Chapter one

I was a young child, lost, went to church on Sundays
Walking a narrow road that lead me to gunplay
I was a good boy respect my mommy
Looked up to them OGs like Querto, Phil, and Donny
Felt good as a young nigga
Comin home from school gettin love from them neighborhood drug dealers
Wrote change, Cadillac Sevilles
But spoke real, was a tradition, Brownsville
That was the first chapter, passin these stages
But the book is wider and its a lot more pages
The game changed, people got foul
And the same little chuch boy is buckwild
Runnin wit my homeboys from three three nine
And one five four five, totin four fives
I kept dreams of being a rap dude
But I know the streets too well so I pack tools
I lost a lot of loved ones to these streets
And lost a lot of loved ones over beef
That goes to show these streets haunt ya
Look what society created now, a monsta

My day and age was a different role
Its when a slug take a niggas soul
(Slug take a niggas soul)
Follow your dreams and follow your goals
Cause who knows what the future holds?
(Who knows what the future holds?)
Our man died and was left cold
Because a slug took the niggas soul
(Slug took the niggas soul)
Follow your dreams and follow your goals
Cause who knows what your future holds
(This is what your future holds)

I wish somebody would lend a hand
So they could see how I fell inside
Im on an emotional roller coaster ride
Nothing to hide
A long time ago I set aside my pride
And used my past as a ghetto guide
A few good men died, several wept stood beside me
So I could smooth out the road for those that come behind me
You know where you can find me
Out on the back blocks
Grippin black Glocks in front of crack spots
Its just a hobby
And since I was a baby
Thuggin, smokin, drinkin, totin is how the first family raised me
( He who lives as a gangter, will perish in these streets )
I know thats deep
But I still shed tears for my mother, two years
After shed been laid to rest
And still some things I need to chisel off my chest
My remedy for stress, I conversate wit my oldest brother
Ten years after his death
I know theres nothin left
So Im forced to take a deep breath
Before I attempt to take another step
A lot of brothas slept
A lot of brothas was left cold in the street and told
This is what your future holds

So there you have it
You see, a lot of niggas talk about bullshit
Talkin about cars, jewels, and money
But in all reality, we all come out the same bag of shit
Some of us may never see tomorrow
So my niggas
Dont you never dont you ever forget where you come from
Salute
M.O.P. for life baby",https://genius.com/Mop-monsta-lyrics
Hussle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah Mr. Cheeks, M.O.P, Big Fame and Billy mother fucking Danze
Let's give these bitch niggas one more chance
Throw them shits up (Throw'em up)
Regulate the real (Regulate)
Ayo we basically know how us fuckers feel (Feel that)
How we running niggas
Ayo they gave me mad problems you won't amount to nothing
Well look at me now I did amount to something
The rap name in vain just like a four four
No matter were us niggas rock we watch out for popo
Still up in the struggle I see nothing changes
These niggas peep the way we roll so we holding bangers
Sport the jewelry cars and the shelto
Gamble for car money drink let the L blows
High school drop out got my G.E.D. though
Don't speak about what I got the d-low
Yo I know nothing but the hot shit creating
Up on the road trips and hot shit we scatting
From the slums stepping representing the jump off (jump off)
What we bump hard what you niggas bump soft
Lived in Red Hook my pops name is Rudy Chattman
My good times always started with whats happening
(Chorus)
Just call me a hustle
Grinding pies writing rhyme 9 to 5
Pimping chicks doing sticks just getting rich takes muscle
Saga of a every day struggle
Bottom line dolla signs we ain't got a dime we gotta hustle
Clip feeling strip stealing sick villain
Let of a lot of wip pealing gangsta type scuffle
Payback could mean is time to layback and bubble
But other times payback is trouble
Just call me a hustle
Lets give it up for the rusty 32's
And the day before Lymer
For the cold old gold and the loks marijuana
When the G's stood firm
Perfecting their concerns
And a nickel spot with a single shot ready to burn
Now shame on me it was cloudy I was blind
I was thinking that this young coward nigga had a slime
Your not LB your not M.O.P
I brought tripping from my whole different angle to spot me
I was blessed with a cursed
(Curse a blessing within this curse)
When curse became innershment encouragement
I'm immune to the pain now I'm loving it
I'm encourage to fakes the pain and
Everything else I consider is punishment
(Take it one day at a crime)
Sometimes I stare into the mirror
Asking my self we it all went wrong
Back on the grind bomb stash heat in my palm
Is a cold world my nigga so bundle and warm
(Chorus)
Ayo listen my daughter is getting older
I love to kiss'em hold'em
Daddys always gonna be there for you I told'em
The world is getting colder
But imma keep'em warm
Yall niggas wanna get it on I bring a deeper storm
Watch you niggas like a job if I got to
Fuck scrapping you gonna feel when I spot you
I grew up in this raised around the hard times
Did the thing hustle in boulevard dimes
The red tops yellow tops and the blue ones
Powerful always came through with some new one
I peep them niggas that was down but turn fuckiness
Ever since Tah pass
Yeah imma represent LB to the death of it
Even though you left kid I'm still gonna rep this shit
Track attacking bitch nigga smacking
Every time I think I'm out these niggas pull me back in
(Chorus) 2x's",https://genius.com/Mop-hussle-lyrics
