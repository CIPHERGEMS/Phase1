The Bridge Is Over,Criminal Minded,1987.0,"I say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over, biddy-bye-bye!
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, hey, hey!
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, biddy-bye-bye!
The bridge is over, the bridge is over

You see me coming in de dance with the spliff of sensei
Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well you must see me
You can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl dem a rhyming like they gay
Picking up the mic, man, dem don't know what to say
Saying Hip Hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, man, you know dem can't live
So I tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to tell them again!
Tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to tell them
Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
Bronx keeps creating it, and Queens keeps on faking it

Di-di di-da, di-di-di, dida di-day, aiy!
All you sucker MCs, won't you please come out to play (Cause)
Here's an example of KRS-One (Bo!)
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock
Cause we don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions comes in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shante is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said, “I tell you now, you ain't nothing”
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now man, I me say easy now man
To KRS-One, you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
The name of this routine is called ""Live At Union Square""
Square, square, square, ooooooooooooooooooooooo
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't know you know that he's out of touch
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking 'bout your wack Puma sneaker
'Cause Bronx created Hip-Hop, Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking 'bout the Juice Crew funny
But you're still telling lies to me",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-the-bridge-is-over-lyrics
My Philosophy,By All Means Necessary,1988.0,"(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

Let us begin, what, where, why or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
Pick the punk and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and diss you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol, something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T
I just laughed 'cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, ""My Philosophy""
Number one, was ""Poetry"" you know it's me
This is ""My Philosophy,"" many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
So please stop burning and learn to earn respect
'Cause that's just what KR collects
See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk?
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style and learn to be original
And everybody's gonna wanna diss you
Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucker MC had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
In real real life, we roll correctly
A lot of suckers would like to forget me
But they can't 'cause like a champ I have got a record
Of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I got juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just sekkle!

In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

I'll play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
Or should I say start this, teaching I'm the artist
Styles and new concepts at their hardest
Yo, 'cause I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckers with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black, I'm brown
From the Boogie Down
Productions, of course, our music be thumping
Others say they're bad, but they're bugging
Let me show you something now about Hip Hop
About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
Mainly, what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MCs be talking and talking
Trying to show how Black people are walking
But I don't walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothers eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug selling
See, I'm telling and teaching pure facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they don't care 'cause their company's selling it
It's my philosophy on the industry
Don't bother dissing me or even wishing we'd
Soften, dilute or commercialize all the lyrics
'Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from an intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
'Cause to me that's suicide, self-murder
Let us get back to what we call hip-hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock

(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

How many MCs must get dissed
Before somebody says, ""Don't f*** with Kris!""?
This is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny, that's Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker: the king or the teacher?
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along nor sing a song
'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?
I say yo, what's up? It's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
With 
Criminal Minded
, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checking
They take the album, take it home and start sweating
Why? Well, it's simple, to them, it's kind of vital
To take KRS-One's title
To them, I'm like an idol, some type of entity
In everybody's rhyme, they wanna mention me?
Or rather mention us, me and Scott La Rock
But they can get bust, get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around, nor do I eff around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sound, a little un-rational
A lot of MCs like to use the word ""dramatical""

Fresh for '88, you suckers",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-my-philosophy-lyrics
South Bronx,Criminal Minded,1987.0,"Yo what's up Blastmaster KRS-One, this jam is kicking
Word, yo what up D-Nice?
(Yo what's up Scott La Rock?)
Yo man we chilling just funky fresh jam
I want to tell you a little something about us
We're the Boogie Down Productions crew
And due to the fact that no-one else out there knew what time it was
We have to tell you a little story about where we we come from

South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx

Many people tell me this style is terrific
It is kinda different but let's get specific
KRS-One specialize in music
I'll only use this type of style when I choose it
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks
You got dropped off MCA 'cause the rhymes you wrote was wack
So you think that hip-hop had its start out in Queensbridge
If you pop that junk up in the Bronx you might not live
'Cause you're in

South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx

I came with Scott La Rock to express one thing
I am a teacher and others are kings
If that's the title they earn, well it's well deserved, but
Without a crown, see, I still burn
You settle for a pebble not a stone like a rebel
KRS-One is the holder of a boulder
Money folder
You want a fresh style let me show ya
Now way back in the days when Hip-Hop began
With Coke LaRock, Kool Herc and then Bam
B-boys ran to the latest jam
But when it got shot up they went home and said, ""Damn!""
There's got to be a better way to hear our music every day
B-boys getting blown away but coming outside anyway
They tried again outside in Cedar Park
Power from a street light made the place dark
But yo, they didn't care, they turned it out
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
Remember Bronx River, rolling thick
With Kool DJ Red Alert and Chuck Chillout on the mix
When Afrika Islam was rocking the jams
And on the other side of town was a kid named Flash
Patterson and Millbrook projects
Casanova all over, ya couldn't stop it
The Nine Lives Crew, the Cypress Boys
The real Rock Steady taking out these toys
As odd as it looked, as wild as it seem
I didn't hear a peep from a place called Queens
It was '76 to 1980
The dreads in Brooklyn was crazy
You couldn't bring out your set with no Hip-Hop
Because the pistols would go *shots*
So why don't you wise up, show all the people
In the place that you are wack
Instead of tryna take out LL
You need to take your homeboys off the crack
'Cause if you don't, well then
Their nerves will become shot
And that would leave the job up to my own Scott La Rock
And he's from

South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx

9mm Goes Bang,Criminal Minded,1987.0,"La la-la la-la la-la la...la...la...la
La la-la la-la la-la la..la..la...la...la
Buck! Buck!

Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
This is KRS-One...

Me knew a crack dealer by the name of Peter
Had to buck him down with my 9 millimeter
He said I had his girl, I said ""Now what are you? Stupid?""
But he tried to play me out and KRS-One knew it
He reached for his pistol but it was just a waste
Cos my 9 millimeter was up against his face
He pulled his pistol anyway and I filled him full of lead
But just before he fell to the ground this is what I said...

Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
This is KRS-One...

Seven days later I was chillin in the herb gate
But seven days too much when the gossip has to circulate
Puffin sensimilla I heard ""knock knock knock""
But the way that they knocked it did not sound like any cop
And if it were a customer they'd ask me for a nick
So suddenly I realized it had to be a trick
I dropped down to the floor and they did not waste no time
They shot right through the door so I had to go for mine
They pumped and shot again but the suckas kept on missin
Cos I was on the floor by now, I crawled into the kitchen
Thirty seconds later, boy, they bust the door down
The money and the sensemi' was lyin all around
But just as they put their pistols down to take a cut
Me jumped out the kitchen, went ""buck! buck! buck!""
They fall down to the floor but one was still alive
So I put my 9 millimeter right between his eyes
Looked at his partner and both of them were dead
So just before he joined his potnah this is what I said...


I gathered all the money and I ran up the block
I said ""This is a perfect time to meet with Scott LaRock""
But Scott is either psychic or he has a knack for trouble
Cos Scott LaRock showed up in a all-black BMW
I jumped inside the car and we screeched off in a hurry
And Scott said ""What is wrong? Relax, tell me the story""
I said ""You remember Peter? Well his posse tried to kill me
I'm all right now because the sensemi' fill me""
Scott just laughed, he said ""I know they're all dead
And just before you pulled the trigger this is what you said...""",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-9mm-goes-bang-lyrics
Criminal Minded,Criminal Minded,1987.0,"Boogie Down Productions will always get paid
We'll take the wackest song and make it better
Remember to let us into your skin
'Cause then you'll begin, to master
Rhymin' rhymin' rhymin'

Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me 'cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's 
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls

'Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready
I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go

I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher
You're a b-boy,
 I'm a scholar
If this was a class, well it would go right under drama
See 
kings lose crowns
 but teachers stay intelligent
Talking big words on the mic but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not college material
Wake up every morning to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott La Rock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Saying styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissing?
I am a musician
Rapping on the mic like this to me is fine
'Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott La Rock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both Criminal Minded

We're not promoting violence, we're just having some fun
He's Scott La Rock,
 
I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated, and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rocking the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics for your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Say a rhyme for 87 not no 1983
Well versed, to rehearse, in my rhymes I might curse
Originality is first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC,
 so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to making music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rocking parties now I picked up the knack
Because everything that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and 
bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm living in a city known as New York State
Sucker MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I haven't included, you can all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckers I be crushing
So now you are awakened to the music I be making
Never duplicated, 
and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated cause nothing has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ
You see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way

You Must Learn,Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop,1989.0,"Just like I told you, you must learn

It's calm yet wild the style that I speak
Just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart
In fact you'll start to illuminate, knowledge to others in a song
Let me demonstrate the force of knowledge
Knowledge reigned supreme
The ignorant is ripped to smithereens
What do you mean when you say I'm rebellious
Cause I don't accept everything that you're telling us
What are you selling us the creator dwellin' us
I sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us
I failed your class cause I ain't with your reasoning
You're tryin' make me you by seasoning
Up my mind with see Jane run, see John walk in a hardcore New York
Come on now, that's like a chocolate cow
It doesn't exist no way, no how
It seems to me that in a school that's ebony
African history should be pumped up steadily, but it's not
And this has got to stop, See Spot run, run get Spot
Insulting to a Black mentality, a Black way of life
Or a jet Black family, so I include with one concern, that
You must learn


I believe that if you're teaching history
Filled with straight up facts no mystery
Teach the student what needs to be taught
Cause Black and White kids both take shorts
When one doesn't know about the other ones' culture
Ignorance swoops down like a vulture
Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor
No one told you about Benjamin Banneker
A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac
Can't you see where KRS is coming at
With Eli Whitney, Haile Selassie
Granville Woods made the walkie-talkie
Lewis Latimer improved on Edison
Charles Drew did a lot for medicine
Garrett Morgan made the traffic lights
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves at night
Madam C.J. Walker made the straightening comb;
But you won't know this if you weren't shown
The point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh
Cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed
So what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man
We need the 89 school system
One that caters to a Black return because
You must learn


""Alkebulan"" is the original name
Of Africa, now stripped of it's fame
It's good to know that in ancient times
Egyptians developed all sciences of the mind
To the point where they ruled the planet
But Rome, Greece, and Persia wasn't havin' it
They attacked, and won the war
But it wasn't enough, they had to get to the core
Cause in that time it was Alkebulan
That ruled religion, politics, and man
In order to destroy the Egyptian race
They had to wipe the sciences from off the face of the planet
So they proceeded to ban it
Then replace it with Christianity
And it's, been that way, all the way to today
Learn what we teach; hear what we say
But here comes the K-the-R-the-S-the-O-the-N-the-E
The BDP and we rhyme intelligently
Let me continue with Theodosius
A Greek ruler not known to most of us
He, in the fourth century A.D.,
Closed the Egyptian schools you see
Two years later, Justinian rules
Six A.D., was it for schools
As a result, ignorance had swirled
Over Christian Europe and Greco-Roman worlds
This went on for a thousand years
Of ignorance, stupidity, and tears
Now comes the seventeenth century hardness
Europe, began to come out of it's darkness
So Johann F. Blumenbach, a German
Came out of nowhere and started confirming
White supremacy and men of colors
Before this time, all men were brothers
It was Johann, who went on to say
There are five different colors in the world today
That's caucasian, malayan, and mongolian
American-Indian, and ethiopian
Yet, the ignorance gets scarier
He believed whites were superior
According to his idiotic fountain
The purest whites were from the Caucas mountains
J. A. Blofener, and H. S. Chamberlain
Both supported this outrageous racism
This went on to what the master race should be
And why they killed the Jews in Germany
Here is the reason why I'm so concerned
Because you, must, learn!!!!",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-you-must-learn-lyrics
Love’s Gonna Get’cha (Material Love),Edutainment,1990.0,"You know, that's why, man, I've been telling you all the time, and you know, love, that word 'love' is a very serious thing, and if you don't watch out, I tell you that
(Love's gonna get you, love's gonna get you, love's gonna get you)
Because a lot of people out here, they say, ""I love my car"" or ""I love my chain"", or, or, ""I'm just in love with that girl over there"", so for all the people out there that fall in love with a material item, we're gonna pump the beat a little something like this:

I'm in junior high with a B plus grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I walk from school to my mom's apartment
I got to tell the suckas everyday ""Don't start it!""
'Cause where I'm at if you're soft you're lost
To stay on course means to roll with force
A boy named Rob, is chillin' in a Benz
In front of my building with the rest of his friends
I give him a pound, oh I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstair and hug my mother
Kiss my sister, and punch my brother
I sit down on my bed, to watch some TV
*machine gun fire* Do my ears deceive me?
Nope, that's the fourth time this week
Another fast brother shot dead in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My moms goes to work cold bustin' her ass
My sister's cute but she got no gear
I got three pairs of pants and with my brother I share
See there in school, see I'm made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants you ain't cool
But there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Everyday I see my mother strugglin'
Now it's time, I've got to do something
I look for work I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs and come home like a slob
So here comes Rob, his gold is shimmery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once, I do it twice
Now there's steak with the beans and rice
My mother's nervous but she knows the deal
My sister's gear now has sex appeal
My brother's my partner and we're gettin' paper
Three months later we run our own caper
My family's happy everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?

That's why, (love's gonna get you)
(love's gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)
You fall in love with your chain
You fall in love with your car
Love is gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind
So I want you to check the story out, as we go down the line
(love's gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)
(Let us move on)

Money's flowin', everythin' is fine
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
Business is boomin' everything is cool
I pull about a G a week; fuck school!
A year goes by and I begin to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet and begin to watch TV
'Cause now I got other people workin' for me
I got a 55 inch television, you know
And every once in awhile I hear ""Just Say No""
Or, the other commercial I love
Is when they say, ""This is your brain on drugs""
I pick up my remote control and just turn
'Cause with that bullshit I'm not concerned
See me and my brother jump in the BM
Drivin' around our territory again
I stop at the light like a superstar
And automatic weapons cold sprayed my car
I hit the accelerator scared as shit
And drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasn't dead but the blood was pourin'
And all I could think about was war and
Later I found that it was Rob and his crew
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?

You know, that's why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
That word ""Love"" is very, very serious
Very addictive
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
(Let us move on)

My brothers out of it, but I'm still in it
On top of that I'm in it to win it
I can't believe that Rob would diss me
That faggot, that punk, he's soft a sissy
I'm drivin' around now with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to his favorite hang out
Said ""Hello"" and then the bullets rang out
Some fired back so we took cover
And all I could think about was my brother
Rob jumped up and began to run
Bustin' shots hopin' to hit someone
So I just stopped, and let off three shots
Two hit him and one hit a cop
I threw the gun down and began to shout
""Come on I got him, it's time to break out!""
But as we ran there were the boys in blue
Pointin' their guns at my four man crew
They shot down one, they shot down two
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?

Thats why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)(love's gonna get you)
(Let us move on)

You know, a lot of people believe that that word ""Love"" is real soft, But when you use it in your vocabulary like you're addicted to it, It sneaks right up and takes you right out
So, for future reference, remember, it's alright to like or want a material item, But when you fall in love with it, and you start schemin' and carrying on for it, just remember:
It's gonna get you!",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-loves-gonna-getcha-material-love-lyrics

Y-O

Time and time again, as I pick up the pen
As my thoughts emerge, these are those words
I glance at the paper to know what's going on
Someone's doing wrong, the story goes on
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
The drama of the world shouldn't keep us so frustrated
I look, but it doesn't coincide with my books
Social studies will not speak upon political crooks
It's just the presidents, and all the money they spent
All the things they invent, and how their house is so immaculate
They create missiles, my family's eating gristle
Then they get upset when the press blows the whistle
Phone calls are made, profiles are kept low
You tamper with some jobs, 
now the press is controlled
Not only newspapers, but every single station
You only get to hear the president is on vacation
But uh, stay calm, there's no need for alarm
You say goodbye to your mom, and you're off to Vietnam
You shoot to kill, come back and you're a veteran
But how many veterans are out there peddling?
There's no telling, cause they continue selling
As quiet as it's kept, I won't go into depth
You could talk about Nigeria, people used to laugh at ya
Now I take a look, I see USA For Africa?

Huh
What's the solution, to stop all this confusion?
Rewrite the constitution, change the drug which you're using
Rewrite the constitution or the emancipation proclamation
We fight inflation, yet the president's still on vacation
BDP posse!


This might sound a little strange to you
Well here's the reason I came to you
We gotta put our heads together, and stop the violence
Cause real bad boys move in silence
When you're in a club, you come to chill out
Not watch someone's blood just spill out
That's what these other people want to see
Another race fight endlessly
You know we're being watched, you know we're being seen
Some wish to destroy this scene called hip-hop
But I won't drop
Not I or Scott LaRock
Well here is the message that we bring today
Hip-hop will surely decay
If we as a people don't stand up and say


BDP and me
We step into the party top celebrity
Say when we come in the dance, we never have to pay a fee
Cause that's cos we got R-E-S-P-E-C-T
I have this one wife, her name is 
Miss Melody
Although I'm from the Bronx,
 
she from the Brooklyn posse
I tell ya a little of this and then I tell you some of that
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I wear a hat
Sometimes I'm in a Mercedes and sometimes I'm in a plane
Sometimes I find myself upon the number two train
Some people look at me and see negativity
Some people look at me and see positivity
But when I see myself I see creativity
So if I can create, well then I make some money

Beef,Edutainment,1990.0,"Beef, what a relief
When will this poisonous product cease?
This is another public service announcement
You can believe it, or you can doubt it
Let us begin now with the cow
The way it gets to your plate and how
The cow doesn't grow fast enough for man
So through his greed he makes a faster plan
He has drugs to make the cow grow quicker
Through the stress the cow gets sicker
Twenty-one different drugs are pumped
Into the cow in one big lump
So just before it dies, it cries
In the slaughterhouse full of germs and flies
Off with the head, they pack it, drain it, and cart it
And there it is, in your local supermarket
Red and bloody, a corpse, neatly packed
And you wonder about heart attacks?
Come on now man let's be for real
You are what you eat is the way I feel
But, the Food and Drug Administration
Will tell you meat is the perfect combination
See cows live under fear and stress
Trying to think what's gonna happen next
Fear and stress can become a part of you
In your cells and blood, this is true
So when the cow is killed, believe it
You preserve those cells, you freeze it
Thaw it out with the blood and season it
Then you sit down and begin eatin it
In your body, it's structure becomes your structure
All the fear and stress of another
Any drug is addictive by any name
Even drugs in meat, they are the same
The FDA has America strung out
On drugs in beef no doubt
So if you think that what I say is a bunch of crock
Tell yourself you're gonna try and stop
Eatin meat and you'll see you can't compete
It's the number one drug on the street
Not crack, cause that was made for just black
But brown beef, for all American teeth
Life brings life and death brings death
Keep on eatin the dead and what's left
Absolute disease and negative
Read the book 'How to Eat to Live'
By Elijah Muhammad, it's a brown paperback
For anybody, either white or black
See how many cows must be pumped up fatter
How many rats gotta fall in the batter
How many chickens that eat shit you eat
How much high blood pressure you get from pig feet
See you'll consume, the FDA could care less
They'll sell you donkey meat and say it's
FRESH! For nineteen-ninety, you SUCKERS",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-beef-lyrics
Poetry,Criminal Minded,1987.0,"Well, now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson
Class is in session, so you can stop guessing
If this is a tape or a written down memo
See, I am a professional, this is not a demo
In fact, call it a lecture, a visual picture
Sort of a poetic and rhythm-like mixture
Listen, I'm not dissing, but there's something that you're missing
Maybe you should touch reality, stop wishing
For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest
I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it
It takes concentration for fresh communication
Observation, that is to see without speaking
Take off your coat, take notes, I am teaching
A class, or rather school, 'cause you need schooling
I am not a king or queen
, I'm not ruling
This is an introduction to poetry
A small dedication to those that might know of me
They might know of you and maybe your gang
But one thing's for sure, neither one of y'all can hang
'Cause, yo, I'm like a arrow, and Scott is the crossbow
Say something now... thought so
You seem to be the type that only understand
The annihilation and destruction of the next man
That's not poetry, that is insanity
It's simply fantasy, far from reality
Poetry is the language of imagination
Poetry is a form of positive creation
Difficult, isn't it? The point? You're missing it
Your face is in front of my hand so I'm dissing it

Scott La Rock is innovating, decorating hip-hop
The beat may drop but not like all the others
They just cover while I just smother
Every single stupid mother-- wait, wait, brother
KRS-One will have to show another
MC or self-proclaimed king or queen
Or gang or crew or solo or team that I mean
Business, so tell me, what is this?
See, I come from the Bronx, so just kiss this
Boogie Down Productions is somewhat an experiment
The antidote for sucker MC's and they're fearing it
It's self-explanatory, no one's writing for me
The poetry I'm rattling is really not for battling
But if you want, I will simply change the program
So when I'm done you will simply say ""Damn!""
So this conversation is somewhat hypothetical
Boogie Down Productions attempts to prove something
I say hypothetical because it's only theory
My theory, so take a minute now to hear me

So what's your problem?
It seems you want to be KRS too
From my point of view, backtrack, stop the attack
Cos KRS-One means simply one KRS
That's it, that's all, solo, single, no more, no less
I've built up my credential financially and mental
Anytime I rhyme I request the instrumental
I speak clearly and that's merely
Or should I say a mere, help to my career
I'm really not into fashion or craze
Just the one who pays and how soon I get a raise
You're probably in a daze, acting out of sympathy
Wrote a couple of rhymes and think that you can get with me
But what a pity, I'm rocking New York City
And everywhere else, you put the jams on the shelf
You as an amateur is outspoken
I'm looking at your face, you seem to be hoping
That I might stutter, stop, or just mess up
But everything's live that's why I don't dress up
""Blastmaster KRS"" a synonym for ""fresh""
I'm the teacher of the class, I do not pass no test
Got DJ Scott La Rock by my side, not in back of me
Cos we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew faculty
Get it right, or train yourself not to bite
Cos when you bite you have bitten, when I hear it, that's it
I do not contemplate a battle cause it really ain't worth it
I'd rather point a pistol at your head and try to burst it
I'm teaching poetry
I'm teaching poetry

We're teaching po-e-try",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-poetry-lyrics
Illegal Business,By All Means Necessary,1988.0,"{*40 seconds in: DJ scratches ""What can we get for 63 cents?""*}

Cocaine business controls America
Ganja business controls America
KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Illegal business controls America

One afternoon around eleven o'clock
It was freezin cold, he was standing on the block
Sellin cheeba, nick's and dimes
Sayin a rhyme just to pass the time
The cops passed by, but he stayed calm
Cause the leather trench coat was keepin him warm
But this time they walked by real slowly
He thought to himself, ""They look like they know me""
They drove away, but he didn't stay
He jumped in the cab and he paid his tab
But guess who he saw when he hit the block
It was the same cop car, the same two cops
They jumped out quick, they pulled a gun
They said, ""Don't try to fight and don't try to run
Cooperate and we will be your friend
Non-cooperation will be your end""
He jumped in the car, and while they rode
They ran down the list of things he owed
They said, ""You owe us some money, you owe us some product
Cause you could be right in the river tied up""
He thought for a second and he said, ""What is this?
You want me to pay you to stay in business
?""
They said, ""That's right, or you go to prison
Cause nobody out there is really gonna listen
To a hood,"" so he said, ""Good!
I'll pay you off for the whole neighborhood
""

Cocaine business controls America

{*DJ scratches ""What can we get for 63 cents?""*}

A guy named Jack, is sellin crack
The community, doesn't want him back
He sells at work, he sells in schools
He's not stupid, the cops are the fools
Cause everyone else seems to go to jail
But when it comes to Jack, the cops just fail
They can't arrest him, they cannot stop him
Cause even in jail the bail unlocks him
So here is the deal, and here is the facts
If you ever wonder why they can't stop crack
The police department, is like a crew
It does whatever they want to do
In society you have illegal and legal
We need both, to make things equal
So legal is tobacco, illegal is speed
Legal is aspirin, illegal is weed
Crack is illegal, 
cause they cannot stop ya
But cocaine is legal if it's owned by a doctor
Everything you do in private is illegal
Everything's legal if the government can see you
Don't get me wrong, America is great place to live
But listen to the knowledge I give
Cocaine business controls America

Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one

People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MCs
I try to tell them, ""We're all in this together!""
My album was raw because no one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue
What do you think makes up a KRS?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam!
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no one's from the Old School
Cuz Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no one's from the Old School cuz Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
Cuz we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
Cuz even then, I'm still number one

Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
Cuz I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur, or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise cuz the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, cuz I'm still number one

Why is That?,Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop,1989.0,"The day begins, with a grin
And a prayer to excuse my sins
I can walk anywhere I choose
'Cause everybody listens to the B.D.P. crew
We're not here for glamour or fashion
But here's the question I'm askin'
Why isn't young black kids taught black?
They're only taught how to read, write, and act
It's like teachin' a dog to be a cat
You don't teach white kids to be black
Why is that? Is it because we're the minority?
Well black kids follow me
Genesis chapter eleven verse ten
Explains the genealogy of Shem
Shem was a black man, in Africa
If you repeat this fact they can't laugh at ya
Genesis fourteen verse thirteen
Abraham steps on the scene
Being a descendant of Shem which is a fact
Means, Abraham too was black
Abraham born in the city of a black man
Called Nimrod grandson of Ham
Ham had four sons, one was named Canaan
Here, let me do some explaining
Abraham was the father of Isaac
Isaac was the father of Jacob
Jacob had twelve sons, for real
And these, were the children of Israel
According to Genesis chapter ten
Egyptians descended from Ham
Six hundred years later, my brother, read up
Moses was born in Egypt
In this era black Egyptians weren't right
They enslaved black Israelites
Moses had to be of the black race
Because he spent forty years in Pharaoh's place
He passed as the Pharaoh's grandson
So he had to look just like him
Yes my brothers and sisters take this here song
Yo, correct the wrong
The information we get today is just wack
But ask yourself, why is that?

The age of the ignorant rapper is done
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
The stereotype must be lost
That love and peace and knowledge is soft
Do away with that and understand one fact
For love, peace must attack
And attack real strong, stronger than war
To conquer it and its law
Mental pictures, stereotypes and fake history
Reinforces mystery
And when mystery is reinforced
That only means that knowledge has been lost
When you know who you really are
Peace and knowledge shines like a star
I'm only showin' you a simple fact
It takes a nation of millions to hold us people back
Which is wack, but we can correct that
Teach and learn what it is to be black
'Cause they're teaching birds to be a cat
But ask yourself homeboy, why is that?",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-why-is-that-lyrics

I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

My name is at the top of all of those that mix
Or turning poetry into cash for 87
Some did it got paid, some jams were never played
But I am just a poet who watched the whole parade
Go by, and why? Cos they wasn't fly
Others claim to be fresh, but they're not KRS
I cannot walk around the street with my head in the clouds
Either running on my gear or having colors too loud
Everything must coincide with the way I feel
And by the way it's Scott La Rock on the wheels of steel
So I take one step to adjust the mic
I get around the whole city so I do wear Nike
I like a funky beat, a studio like Unique
I write the crazy fresh lyrics and I don't eat meat
You can look me up and down and my DJ too
Because we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew
Taking out emcees on the 1, 2, 3
No matter who they claim to be in society
Because we know their games, we'll pull their file
If they need a different style we can get wild
He's I.C.U., he's out to kill
I'm KRS and we get ill
DJ Scott La Rock got his own beat
The extravagant life is what we seek
I will tell you like this cause I know for a fact
I will live a long life and I don't smoke crack
Captivating the crowd seven days a week

I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

For me to say again another verse of my rhyme
Means what you heard before must've blew up your mind
So now it's time to find poetry like mine
Do not waste all your time because I'm one of a kind
Cooling out and easy going cause the money be flowing
6'4"", brown eyes, and I'm always showing
Stupid emcees on the mic the way it's 'posed to be done
They study rhymes all week but I be rhyming for fun
When they lose they get upset, always pulling a gun
But they must snap out of that because I'm KRS-One
Not two, not three, but O-N-E
Get it right the first time I won't repeat this rhyme
If you think that you can burn me with your amateur ways
Keep in mind that I been out there from back in the days
I don't brag about the people I know
Because they're still bluffing, they're not givin me nothing
I can walk around the city with the rhymes I flaunt
Cos no matter how you front it's still the ones you want
See, I am funky fresh and poetry is my opinion
Taking out you suckers while the Scott La Rock is spinning

I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

My name is KRS-One, I'm still kinda young
I don't wear Adidas cos my name ain't Run
Got Nikes on my feet and to be complete
I can rock an American or reggae beat
Got rhymes for the 70's, 80's, and 90's
Not being conceited but it won't pay to try me
Out to any feud, any battle, any reason
Make the rhymes up every season, this style, I'm just teasing
Pick up the pace, homeboy, pick up the pace
You're way behind schedule, listen to what I'm telling you
This particular style may vary
The things I converse about are heard rarely
Some can't bear me, others try to scare me
Sounding intelligent but not yet equivalent
You know what?

Basses kick, fly girl jumps on my tip
The drink that I sip implies this it it
She looked to be about twenty-six, I ain't dizzy
It's time to get busy
Welcome, female is in my arms
Yes, overwhelmed by my playboy charms
We jumped in the ride, rushed to the crib
I ain't gotta explain what we did
Built to last, I simply waxed that
Ask the question, no need for guessin'
Hey baby, how old are you?
Twenty-six, twenty-one, maybe twenty-two?
I'm twenty five, she shucked and kinda neighed
And said, ""Hee hee hee I'm only thirteen""
Thirteen!? I need a quick escape

I said, ""Forget it, I need to get my life in order

Her cryin' turns into her replyin'
""Where's the phone?. I think it's time that I went home""

Your goin' to jail my daddy's a police chief
If I can't have you no one will and I ain't even on the pill""
But you was


Daddy comes through the door
Now I'm thinking I got at least one shot at his jaw
When he entered, the whole mood kinda changed
He grabbed his daughter and almost beat the girl insane
She's cryin' down the hall and now goin' home
He closed the door and, ""I'm happy we're all alone
Jump on the bed and look me straight into my eyes
I think your kinda cute,
 don't make me use my .45""
Daddy's lookin' for a lubricant
He pulled out a little piece of gum and started chewin' it
""For years I've been lookin' for a big strong man
I've got an apartment out in Brooklyn
Only my daughter and I are there
You can see my daughter anytime, anywhere

He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe


Scott LaRock is for now the main topic
Not looking at his cuts
 
or cash flow of the pocket
You may not realize it or you may not know
But, uh... (He is the Super-Hoe)
When I say super I'm not exaggeratin
Datin for a guy like Scott turns into matin
He seems to be quiet but I don't buy it
Proof is in the puddin, why don't you just try it
The Super-Hoe is loose in your section
And he's armed with a powerful erection
So grab your girl and run for protection
Your momma too, cause I like to dimension

Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe





Whatever you could do or say inside a bed
Scott LaRock has done and most likely said
He doesn't argue with a girl cause yes, he has others
Keep updated on all kind of rubbers
Got ones that are lambskin, others that are plastic
One day he'll open a school for prophylactics
They don't know... (He is the Super-Hoe)

WDKX, now DK-Sex
We were bein interviewed there live on air
Every girl in the city Scott had an affair

And one more time bust the fresh jingle

Scott LaRock had em all

Scott LaRock had em all

In the field of music I'll always pass by
Girls that claim to act so fly
They always act like it's all about them or their friends
But according to Scott, they all like to bend
Yes, fly girls,
 
shy girls,
 black girls, white girls
In eighty-seven it's got to be the right girl
If you claim to have a little problem
Well, Scott LaRock knows just how to solve em
If you're a guy a nine'll do the trick
But if you're a girl, you need some... 
flowers
I admit Scott has strange powers
Enticing girls in less than an hour
Or should I say minutes? I seen how he did it
He probably says ""I'm Scott LaRock"" and she's with it
So whether he's a gigolo, tramp, or pro... (He is the Super-Hoe)
Now many people have their ways of expressin
What they do best, for Scott it's undressin
Yes, either a girl or some date for the night
He doesn't want to hear that you're too tight
So do not think that Scott LaRock is mean
It's not his fault, he'll give you Vaseline
The Super-Hoe is loose in your area
Makin life for girls a little scarier
So if you got a radio tryin to tape this
Do not keep in mind that he is a rapist
For the Super-Hoe to be chillin
Another female out there has to be willin
So all you tramps and hoes raise your hand
Cos Super-Hoe Scott LaRock understands
If you're a guy we'll talk about hangin
And if you're a girl he'll talk about bangin
If your moms call up, well, I don't know
But uh... (He is the Super-Hoe)

Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe








Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe
Scott LaRock had em all
He is the Super-Hoe",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-super-hoe-lyrics
Jimmy,By All Means Necessary,1988.0,"The J, the I, the M, the M
The Y, the J, the I, the M
It's Jimmy! It's Jimmy!
(Repeat x2)

Here is a message to the super hoes
Just keep in mind when Jimmy grows
It grows and grows and grows, so let it
But keep in mind about the epidemic
When Jimmy releases, boy it pleases
But what do you do about all these diseases?
Jimmy is Jimmy, no matter what
So take care of Jimmy cos you know what's up
Cos now in winter AIDS attacks
So run out and get your Jimmy Hats
It costs so little for a pack of three
They're Jimmy Hats for the winter attack
Good for a present, great for lovers
Demonstrated by The Jungle Brothers
Protect your Jimmy and keep it fresh
They're Jimmy Hats by KRS

So, remember you're never too old (Jimmy is wearing a hat!)
Remember you're never too bold (Jimmy is wearing a hat!)
Do me a favour, wear your hat
So Jimmy will have the opportunity to come back

Well, Red Alert is down with BDP
Teaching you all about Jimbrowski
I don't wanna hear that you're not with it
Turn around and see your butt in a clinic
Having doctors just poke at Jimmy
Let me express what now what's in me
Too many people take too many risks
Too many people I see get dissed
Jimmy Hats are now in style
Cause you can't trust a big butt and a smile
Some are dry and some lubricated
Many companies make and made it
So all you super hoes, wear your hat
Cos dripping Jimmies is straight up wack
Keep in mind about Jimbrowski
Jimmy Hats by BDP",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-jimmy-lyrics
Blackman in Effect,Edutainment,1990.0,"Wake up!
Take the pillow from your head and put a book in it
It's time for the massive BDP crew at the top of the pile

In the morning I'm yawning, at noon is when I wake up
Make up my bed break up the bread and said
Scratching my head, why am I so damn intimidating?
Is it because of laws designed to keep us waiting and waiting
Thus aiding all forms of a setback
Get back if you can't understand a rap act
This is the language of the people ready to hear the truth
I've got no juice, cause I'm not getting juiced
To have juice means you kiss and lick a lot of booty
To have respect means you simply knew a Nubie
Heard what I had to say and felt as though you'd say that too
I'm not down with the Juice Crew
But anyway I say today the message I create is great
I don't preach hate, I simply get the record straight
It's not the fault of the black race that we are misplaced
We're robbing and killing, your own medicine you taste
You built up a race on the concept of violence
Now in '90 you want silence
Well, I want science, not silence but science
Scientific fact about black
The board of education acts as if its only reality
Is talking about a Tom, Dick and Harry
So now you learn your black history it's questions and answers
Every question but the Black Panthers
Timbuctu existed when the caveman existed
Why then isn't this listed
Is it because the blackman is the original man
Or does it mean humanity is African
I don't know but these sciences are hidden
For some strange reason it's forbidden
To talk about, or converse on a political outburst
I don't believe that I'm the first
Or should I say the first one, or the first one that's done
Music like I'm still number one
But music like that or this is the incredible uplift
Those that oppose get dissed
But who will oppose the teacher when society's a wreck
So check the blackman's in effect

Near the Tigris and Euphrates Valleys in Asia
Lies the Garden of Eden
Where Adam became a father to humanity
Now don't get mad at me
But according to facts, this seems just fantasy
Because man, the most ancient man
Was found thousands of years before Adam began
And where he was found, again they can't laugh at ya
It's right, dead, smack in Africa
But due to religious and political power
We must be denied the facts, every hour
We run to school, trying to get straight A's
Let's take a trip way back in the days
To the first civilization on Earth, the Egyptians
Giving birth to science, mathematics and music
Religion, the list goes on, you choose it
Egypt was the land of spiritual blessing
Egypt was the land of facts, not guessing
People from all over the world had come
To learn from Egypt, Egypt number one
So people that believe in Greek philosophy
Know your facts, Egypt was the monopoly;
Greeks had learned from Egyptian masters
You might say ""Prove it"", well here's the answers:
640 to 322 B.C. originates Greek philosophy
But in that era Greece was at war
With themselves and Persia once more.
Any philosopher at that time was a criminal;
He'd be killed very simple
This indicates that Greece had no respect
For science or intellect
So how the hell you created philosophy
When you killed philosophers constantly?!
The point is is that we descend from kings
Science, art and beautiful things
African history is the world's history
This is the missing link and mystery
Once we realize that all are African
White will sit down with black and laugh again
So judge not least ye may be judged
By the judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged
Matthew seven, first verse doesn't budge
No man should walk the Earth in sludge
If you don't believe, you can go and check
To see how and where the blackman's in effect",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-blackman-in-effect-lyrics
The Racist,Edutainment,1990.0,"Verse
I've been taught to respect my elders and behave
Even if when they were young they sold slaves
Truth and understandin' is what I crave
In the land of the thief, home of the slave
Turn your page to a brief demonstration
Cos now in '90 it's strictly information I'm givin'
Teachin' on a regular basis
Today's lecture is about The Racist
We're not out to exaggerate or diss him
But show the symptoms and facts of racism
Understand The Racist ain't equal
There's about five different types of racist people
First of the five different types of cases
Is the individual brought up racist
Here you have young men and women
Brought up in the Great White Way opinion
This opinion introduced by the parent
To the civilised becomes transparent
The civilised man could look through the faces
Make the analysis and see The Racist
Number two case which y'all must hear
Is the individual racist out of fear
Here you have people that fear the African
And conjure up new ways of trappin' him
Number three is the unconscious racist
Not knowin' they're racist they invade your spaces
They say, ""I'm not a racist, I'm not a bigot""
Yet they allow it to go on and won't admit it
Number four is the money racist
The one that used the topics of sheer economics
They say, ""Owning a business isn't for the black man
He don't want that"", yet they went and took his land
Damn, that's like a rock in a hard place
You don't have your land yet this ain't your space
America was built by every other race
Except the European that runs this place
What a waste, America's doomed
To be overthrown by the righteous real soon
But last but not least racial prejudice
Is the black man speakin' out of ignorance
Whitey this and Ching-Chow that
Is not how the intelligent man acts
You can't blame the whole white race
For slavery, cos this ain't the case
A large sum of white people died with black
Tryin' hard to fight racial attacks
The media wants you to think that no whites
Really fought and died for Civil Rights
But once we have a true sense of history
You'll see this too as a mystery
If black and white didn't argue the most
They could clearly see the government's screwin' 'em both",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-the-racist-lyrics
House Nigga’s,Edutainment,1990.0,"Excuse me oh sire
What?
We've found a place to bury the lies and the false histories
Where is this place? What shall it be called?
It's in every inner city, and we'll call it the library where we'll bury the lies
Splendid, splendid, but now--
Wait! Wait! Somebody's coming!
Who is that?
It's KRS One!
Get him out of here now--
(Sound of machine gun fire...)

Let me see, let me see, how shall I start
If I say stop the violence, I won't chart
Maybe I should write some songs like Mozart
'Cause many people don't believe rap is an art
Wake up, shake up, hypocrite look alive
Blastmaster KRS-One will revive
Four or five million still deprived
On how to survive, wake up and realize
Some people say I am a rap missionary
Some people say I am a walking dictionary
Some people say I am truly legendary
But what I am is simply a black revolutionary
I write rhymes on plain stationery
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Doesn't make sense in my vocabulary
Uncle Tom house niggas, do scare me
So they can't be around, I don't do this
For every Jesus, there must be a Judas
It's the concept of the house nigga, field nigga
The house nigga will sell you up the river
So to massa, he'll look bigger
And when ya beef under a rock, he'll slither
But I'll grab the tail of the house nigga
Pull the trigger and his head I'll deliver
To the court of righteous people
Black, white, or Indian, we're all equal
So all your racist codes I'll decode, explode
And eat you like apple pie a la mode
On a hot day, don't bring me no hamhocks
'Cause 'round the clock, I'll kick their buttocks
All afternoon in the classroom, in the living room, in the bathroom
In the swimming pool, on a footstool
Then I'll stop - nope, April fools!
Whip out the baseball bat and somehow
March your racist butt to Moscow

What can I say, o ye of little faith
To think that KRS-One has surely been erased
What a waste, my finger points at the face of the human race
They're confused and misplaced
My words are subliminal, sometimes metaphysical
I teach, not preach, you want a challenge, I'll start dissing you
I go philosophical, my topic'll
Turn the cold, ignorant hot and tropical
You want a palm tree and nice dope shade?
Only if the universal law's obeyed
Which is know thyself, for better mental health
Yet so many rappers are preoccupied with wealth
On my shelf, yeah, I got titles
Other artists want belts and idols
World cups from seminars and conventions
Competitions and not to mention
The award shows for pimps and hoes
And every other hypocrite that flaunt their clothes
KRS knows, so he just grows
Always saying something different from the average Joes
So they can front and wear the biggest chain
But it doesn't write albums, I believe it is the brain
So I'll remain plain, while you reign I'm loving it
You be the king and I'll overthrow your government
Send your crew, triple it or double it
I'll out-think 'em, choke 'em, and shrink 'em
Down to your size despite their cries
In the face of intelligence, ignorance dies
Yeah, it's simple edutainment
Rap needed a teacher, so I became it
Rough and ready, the beats are very steady
With lyrics sharp as a machete
Clap, there's another house nigga's neck
Now his soft Uncle Tom crew is in check
Ego wrecked and rhymes corrected
By KRS One, produced and directed",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-house-niggas-lyrics
Word From Our Sponsor,Criminal Minded,1987.0,"This is a test
Of the Boogie Down Production
Prevention Against Sucka MC's
In the event of a real emergency
You would have been instructed
On which jams to play
And how loud to blast your radio
And now, a word from our sponsor

I'm from the Bronx,
 Blastmaster KRS-One
Proving that my job ain't done until I get some
More, no need to roar or yell
'Cause I can still tell what will sell
And would have sold without yellin over a drum roll
That style is old
, so unfold
Blossom, bloom, you got the room
So go ahead and consume
A new era, KRS-One comes better
Bite another lyric? Never
'Cause I'm too clever, however, I own my own label
Partners with Scott LaRock, he's on the turntable
And partner Lee Smith
I'm exercising a true gift just to uplift
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop
My voice is like a monster and now a word from our sponsor


Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
I got to start this rhyme again
How many words can I find that rhyme
And still keep in mind every lyric must come out on time?
Not many but I have plenty
Scott La Rock sent me just to devastate any-
One, any daughter, any son that comes my way
Hey, you got to go the other way
I represent my DJ Scott LaRock, 
D-Nice the beat box
I only wear Nike's, not Adidas or Reeboks
Many people know me, yet I'm known by few
My name is KRS-One, son
Not two or three or four or five or six
The mix is on Scott LaRock and Scott LaRock is on the mix


Cool like the air we breathe
Inhale, exhale, perpetrators will fail
As sure as my name is Blastmaster KRS
Sit and listen to the very essence of this tale
From the days of prison I have uprisen
To my family members I'm marked down as missing
Listen, 
circumstances put me right in the street
With the will to survive, get paid, eat and sleep
Some weep or should I rather say some cry
Can't get by so later on they die
Because the strong will survive, the weak will perish
Ignorance is a poison and knowledge will nourish
I love what I got and like what I had
I'm glad, not sad and I don't even get mad
I get even, myself and some others I believe in
'Cause these others are my brothas and perfection we're achieving
Yes, my name is KRS, my brother is a Rasta
Let me pause and now a word from our sponsor",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-word-from-our-sponsor-lyrics
Ya Slippin’,By All Means Necessary,1988.0,"(Yo man, these people around here in '87 just slippin-dough, you know what
I'm sayin? Boogie Down Productions not slippin-dough, so hold ya hands-you
Know what I'm sayin? (word) Yo! What's goin' on? Mr. Magic-you know what
Happened? He slipped on us-he die. Pumpin KISS FM, we rock. To my man DJ
Red Alert- we chillin' (word). Yo man! Yo do, heard about, man, this shit
About this kid-Wearin' the, ah, Jheri Curls, man. Word up! He was slippin'
Yo dough, word up, word up. He had a yellow coat on, but no description was
Given)
Now what you just heard, people, was a little kickin
But let me tell you this while the clock is still tickin
This is the warning, known as the caution:
Do not attempt to dis, cause you'll soften
Just like a pillow, or better yet a mattress
You can't match this style or attack this
While I'm telling you, write on schedule
Fuck with K-R-S and I'll bury you
Deep in the dirt, or sand with a shovel
No fight, no scurry, or scuffle, just muffle
Total domination on stage
Kris is the name, 22 is the age
Those that wanna battle, I know who you are
You got a little girl, you drive a little car
You come into the place with that look on your face
Before you ran the mile, you lost the race
So assume you're doomed when you step in the room
I'll be the witch and you'll be the broom
I'll ride you, guide you into the concrete
I'll slide you to a funky beat
So what do we have here?
A sucka in fear
I snatched your heart
Put it way up on the chart
At ten you're fucked
At nine you suck
At eight you're a sucker
At seven-a mothafucka
At six you're slapped
At five you're just wacked
At four you're lost
At three, you're just soft
At two you're an ass
At one, you're a dick
But before you slip, I'll whip
Cuz homeboy, ya slippin'
(Yo get my slip on, I'm chillin on. A long time, ya see me slip on, crack dealer
And I'll slip on, everybody-I slip on. Sayin? I'll come back if I miss you
Sayin?)
I understand that music calms the savage beast
But keep in mind that I compose my music piece by piece
First a bass, a snare
A little cut over there
I add my name K-R-S
And the shit becomes fresh
I ask Moe and ICU for their thoughts
Lay it down at Power Play all the suckas are tought
One again, the tactics of original arts
We're gettin' payed to the end cuz we were down from the start
We're known as Boogie Down Productions, ain't no B-boy stance
Gauranteed to make ya dance, if you give us a chance
We're goin' off and of course all ya suckas are lost
You wanna hear a fresh rhyme? You've come to the source
Because I'm the type of guy who's not put up on a pedestal
Run my rhyme on time and on schedule
One after another, another to the next
Can't rhyme when you're tense, or your muscles won't flex
Check your larynx
It may get lower havin' sex
Or may get higher
When bustin' as a liar
These are the things I teach so be tought
To me you're kinda short, how many battles have you fought?
If you come up with a number, notebook, or list
It just doesn't matter, you can still get dissed
I'm bringin' back that ol' New York rap
That gets you jacked while you're hands still clap
It's funny
Just dissin' you I can make money
But no one's tippin'
My message is simple: Ya' slippin!
(They slippin'-dough-1987-they spippin', but we goin' all the way to the top
Man (word)-you know what I'm sayin? To my brother KRS-1, you're large, I'm
Sayin, large-everytime, man, large. They're slippin')
E-N-O, S-R-K
When you go through other albums, you're sure to say
""Goddamn, they all seem to sound alike!""
Till you hear the crew standin' over in the light
Showing, glowing, on the top growing
The lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
Just like a river, or better yet a stream
I'm proud to be down with the winning team
So don't ever in your life even think about a  arguement
Cuz you'll get walked on like carpet
We'll pick you up, and dust you off
Stamp BDP on your head and you're off
But you would even change that to say instead
""I'm down cuz I got a BDP on my head!""
So just before you inherit that ass kicking
I suggest you wake right up cuz ya slippin'
(Yo! They slippin'-dough, they slippin'-dough, they slippin'-word up, I
Don't care no more, man, I'm commin' out of the shell-dough, they slippin'
Man. B-boy Records, Magic, yo all the time they slippin-ya know what I'm
Saying? This other kid-I don't know what his name is, but you know what time
It is. (WORD UP!) He's slippin' too (everybody). Slippin', and everytime they dis ya?, he's slippin'. Slippin'.)",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-ya-slippin-lyrics
Elementary,Criminal Minded,1987.0,"I hear the same old rhyme, the same old style
The same old runner has ran the mile
See I don't know exactly what you know
But what I know is that stuff gotta go
Usually when I pick up the mic
Something ill jumps out my mouth for that night
I like to talk about fact not fiction
I got some fantasy rhymes but just listen
Everything I write is premeditated
Suckers wanna fake it, I just hate it
Biting routines or saying something kinda weak
My words are comprehended every time I speak
I have spoken, no I'm not joking
Please don't sleep, I hope you are awoken
Stop! Try this again, you had enough? Say when
I am the man with the six-pack of Heineken
I get tipsy
But never in your life try to dis me
Cos I don't battle with rhymes, I battle with guns
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
If you take the first letter of what I just sung
You spell my name KRS One
It's elementary

DJ Scott LaRock and I,
 
KRS One
A mother's first son and no, we'll never run
From complex situations like you T-O-Y-S's
Always talking junk, yet in jail, you're rocking dresses
I have a ride for the purpose of joy
Unlike any ordinary Bronx B-Bboy
I will volunteer my services and launch an attack
On you fake educators with your 
yakety-yak
This is a fact, 
the teacher
 is here now in the flesh
Consistently hounded by you MC pests
If you really want to learn from me
Don't waste time in burning me
Cos ignorance and inexperience does not concern me
I will emphasize so you will realize and come alive
Never close your eyes, never sleep or you might take a dive
Many people hate me, many people love me
Some are far below me
And you know there's some above me
But this, my hypothesis, to conclude the story
All you fake MC's on a mission, you bore me
I'm the Blastmaster KRS on the mic
Watching all these females rock their pants too tight
Cos there's no other creative composition on display
To give a full analysis and rock this way
You will pay, eventually you all will decay
While the DJ Scott LaRock will continue to play
Cutting records, driving cars, and you'll know who we are
Make a mix just for kicks
And you'll be on our tip
And, oh yes, there's a highlight to the show, of course
You hear DJ Scott La Rock (Go off! Go off!)

Boogie Down Productions, no reduction to its title
If you have a headache, toys, go and take a 
Midol
We have arrived for the purpose of enjoyment
You have arrived to make up for unemployment
You're on it only cos I learned just how to flaunt it
I breathed a rhyme upon you like a sickness and you caught it quick
Get off the tip, trick, you must be sick
Like a doctor here's my bill, 
I wrote it out with a Bic
Signed my name upon the bottle cos you know I just rocked 'em
But getting into battles really isn't my thing
You're probably thinking these are the rhymes for the century
But please don't mention me, it's only elementary",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-elementary-lyrics
Build and Destroy,Sex and Violence,1992.0," Yeah.. whoo! Aiyyo Will?
 Whassup Kenny?
 I got a serious problem man
 What's the problem?
 Yo after all these years of rippin shit
These suckers still try to front!
 But check this out we've been on tour
With everybody so I don't know why they frontin
 Everybody!
Y'all be in every party I be in every jam
I see they faces and they look at me and front
 They come to every show and know we
Break shit up all the time
 You know what.. yo Kris, what's your opinion?

Yo, 
I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me
Rearrange me, tame me, try to game me, you don't play me
When I grab the mic then SHOCK the party spot
Your rhymes are flip-flop, I'll rock, hip-hop
Non-stop, me nah stop rock
You CAN touch this, but you'll get shocked
Now what's this all about? 
Kris and humanity
In my face you're happy, on vinyl you're mad at me
Yo, pro-blackness is your solution
But I don't really know about that style you using yo
Too many Teachers in the class spoil the school
After awhile you got blabbering fucking fools
That's worse than always talking about sex
, let's build
It ain't enough to study Clarence 13X
The white man ain't the devil I promise
You want to see the devil take a look at Clarence Thomas
Now you're saying, 
""Who?"" like you a owl
Throw in the towel, the devil is Colin Powell
You talk about being African and being black
Colin Powell's black, but Libya he'll attack
Libya's in Africa, but a black man
Will lead a black man, to fight against his homeland
An accomplice to the devil is a devil too
The devil is 
anti-human, who the hell are you?
I lecture and rap without rehearsal
I manifest as a black man but I'm universal
The capital K, small R-I-S
Capital P, small A-R, capital K, small E-R
We are, the star
Without the use of a car we go far
I build and destroy!

 Yeah Kris, serve em man, serve em!
 Yo why're they so jealous of BDP?
 I don't know Will.. yo don't get mad, get fresh man!
 Word
 Don't ever try to challenge BDP!
 Man.. just shut the fuck up and listen!

This shit is crazy! Your remarks don't faze me!
People have a problem with me, cause I ain't lazy
I talk on vinyl then I act
What have you done, besides critique KRS-One?
I create organizations
Without organization, there'll be no black nation
What the fuck are you really saying?
You ain't a human while your music's boomin anti-human
I'm assumin -- if you ain't human you're a beast
The white man could be the devil all the day, that's the least
What are you doing for yourself black man?
Trying hard to be the original man - who?
The first man, with the first tan, on the first land
With the first clan, who gives a damn???!
In history KRS is WELL advised
But it's something that my brain won't memorize
I don't base my whole life on memory
I base my life on my spirit and body chemistry
Africa is the home of humanity
Which makes the African a humanist, challenge me
You gotta learn not to be so concerned
With the original man, and see the criminal man, yeah!
The now man, with the now plan, with the now tan
With the right now genocide master plan
Damn! We gotta think about stopping this
God is not any black man on the land; God is conciousness
When you understand this you'll see Kris
Until then, you can get dissed
I'm not your prophet, messiah, minister, or savior
Chill with that ill behavior
I zero in like a laser
You're cuttin your wrists with a razor
I got all type of flavors
Yes I am the original teacher
You gotta study the Qu'ran, Torah, Bhagavad Gita
The Bible, Five Baskets of Buddha Zen
And when you've read them shits, READ them shits again!
But watch what you're repeatin
If you don't know the history of the author
You don't know what you're reading!
Yeah I'm still the original
Leaving MC's lyrically miserable
Their criminal syllables are minimal, show me respect BOY
Cause I build and destroy!

Now.. after all that
If anybody out there STILL got beef, check it out
We rip the lecture tours, we rip the beats
We rip the jams, we'll straight up rip that ass
KnowhatI'msayin Will?
 Word!
 
Yeah it seems they all forgot
On the mic you'll get fucked up
In the clubs you'll get fucked up

Jack of Spades,Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop,1989.0,"Again we start, let me say my part
About the only guy who has some heart
It took some time for the heart to come
But it's HERE, and everybody's in fear
Crashin through the door of that WHORE
Bringin a end to this gold chain war
What you saw, KRS-One is now seeing
Another fly human being
Making, no excuses for the losers
Chain-snatchers, pimps, drug abusers
You don't like it but you gotta keep PUSHIN
Until somebody starts MUSHIN
All these suckers, claimin to rule the environment
(Nah man, I ain't buyin it)
You seem to think that everybody can be taught
That everyone else can be bought
But, you took a short, cause one guy hasn't been paid
He is the Jack of Spades!
* D-Nice scratches ""Jack.. Jack.."" *

He's a, calm kind of guy, courageous and loyal
But don't let the temper boil
Cause just like a pot when the whistle blows
(That's right boy, anything goes!)
The crime is commited and he's right on your tail
There's no bail, not thinkin bout jail
All the ends, are justified by the means
When Jack's on the scene
Track the movement, don't lose it
Cause if he come through the back, he ATTACKS
CRACK, cocaine, cops, and more fiends
Who all get the same in the heat of this gold chain GAME
Here is the aim --
Destroy all the stereotypes, hypes, and crack pipes
We don't like, criminals, and crime --
But we don't pay it any mind
So here comes Kung-Fu, Joe, and Fly Guy
Slade, Hammer, and Slammer
I, am a, renegade teacher and scholar
If you ain't up on it you GOTTA
Fall to the back of the line
Hear this rhyme, cause I'mma say it one more time
It's JACK'S theme song that KRS made
It's called the Jack of Spades!
* D-Nice scratches ""Jack.. Jack.."" *

You know, the Jack of Spades is now down with the BDP Posse
If you wanna see more, just watch me
MAN, do what I do, throw your hands in the air
And scream it out, ohh yeah ""OHH YEAHHH!!""
One more time! ""OHH YEAHHH!!""
(Flash the rhyme!)
Cool, guy, loud and quiet
If your head's in the way, he'll FLY IT
Don't try it, cause Jack of Spades doesn't BUY IT
He's a one man riot
Cleanin the community, of all it's debris
The C-R-I-M-E
The road was long and scary and some didn't make it
The average guy couldn't take it
But JACK, is not, the average guy
He took a piece of the pie and BIT IT
Got with it, for his brother he DID IT
So you gotta admit it
This is a martyr, a soldier, a hero
WHY? Because he started from zero
In this battle he clearly understands their power
They're payin people by the hour
To sell, to lie, to try, to stand up and deny
They are gettin everybody HIGH
High on a cable, cash under the table
Currency is how they're able
To buy the cops and props and keep the law PAID
But here comes the Jack of Spades!
* D-Nice scratches ""Jack.. Jack.."" *
 Break it down!
* D-Nice scratches ""Jack.. Jack.."" *

Fresh.. for Jack of Spades, you SUCKERS
Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah..",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-jack-of-spades-lyrics
Edutainment,Edutainment,1990.0,"Give it to em!
Nuff respect! And praise to the creator
Over the years it seems that I became a
Landmark, in the hip-hop field of art
I shed light, yet my skin is dark
I'm not concerned with climbin the chart
Cause why should you pay when it comes from the heart?
I'll start, cause only Jah will create it
I'll just name it
, 
Edutainment
People sit and they look at my album
Like a problem, they try to solve em
They don't know, it only leads the way
To a bright more positive day
By itself, it's NOT the bright day
Sit up straight, and hear what I say
Fear and ignorance, I'm down for stoppin this
But the bright day is your conciousness
I am poet, my words will heal you
I'm not a phony I'll really feel you
That's why I walk and talk to my nation
Wherever they are, in any situation
They usually ask for an autograph
And I'll whip out the pen and just write Blast-
-Master, K-R-S, O-N-E
BDP, Peace and Unity
But do not concentrate on the paper
Concentrate on the laws of the creator
Cause when the paper's gone, it will deceive you
But Allah will never leave you
Nothing I say now is hypothetical
These are the facts, a little metaphysical
We are one, every heart every lung
So why then was the black man hung?
He was hung by the so-called Christians
That went to church, and did not listen
See Jesus couldn't stand politics
So they nailed him to a crucifix
Then it was that way, today it's a trigger
So why is the Pope such a political figure?
I don't know, but it's really beyond me
But through knowledge, they'll NEVER con me
Cause from Jesus Christ to right now
Everytime a black man speaks up, KA-POW
See people concentrate on the leader
And not the message comin through the speaker
If the Christians really heard Christ
The black man never would've lived this life
My point is that do not concentrate
On what I state, create, or debate
I might be great, and you might admire
But what I say is to take you MUCH higher
MORE higher than the physical plane
To the plane of forces in the astral plane
The mental plane, and the final three
They're all around you, yet you can't see
So grab the sphere of life and aim it
And you'll be guided by Edutainment",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-edutainment-lyrics
Necessary,By All Means Necessary,1988.0,"When some get together and think of rap, they tend to think of violence
But when they are challenged on some rock groups, the result is always silence
Even before the Rock and Roll era, violence played a big part in music
It's all according to your meaning of violence and how or in which way you use it
Oh no, it's not violent to show in movies the destruction of the human body
But yes indeed it's very violent to protect yourself at a party
And, oh no, it's not violent when under the Christmas tree there's a look-alike gun
But, yes, of course it's violent to have an album like KRS-One
By all means necessary, it's time to end the hypocrisy
What I call violence, I can't do , but your kind of violence is stopping me
By all means necessary, the rap audience must grow up
The same type of fighting we do, they do, except we've got nothing to blow up
It doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's only how good you play the game
This is the oldest sneak attack, because it takes away our senses to gain
If all I do is play the game then I am just mediocre
We strive to be the best we can be, not to just get over
Some people say that life on a whole is serious and nothing is funny
But that's only if you base your life around competition and money
Yeah, I'm making some money, he's making some money, but none of these things are necessities
What I find to be a necessity is controlling a positive destiny
With this, money, fame, glory and credit will come in time
The people down with me know this, everyday they hear me saying rhymes
I got some friends, I got some allies like Stet and 
Big Daddy Kane
They know that by all means necessary that Peace is the name of this game
Whether peace by war, or peace by peace, the reality of peace is scary
But we must get there, one way or another, by all means necessary",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-necessary-lyrics
7 Dee Jays,Edutainment,1990.0,"YES! Chillin in the place right now
Harmony and Heather B, Ms. Melodie
DJ Jamal-Ski, 
DJ Kenny Parker
And of course we are gettin MUCH DARKER
Because the Africanism is in EFFECT
So check it out, MAN!
And try not to bite the lyrics
POI!
So come in now with the chorus of the day
Because we don't play

It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
It takes one soundsystem playin music loud
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
But D-Nice, you're gonna make the party live

Bust it, yo
I love to diss whores, I love to do tours
Makin young ladies just drop their drawers
And when they drop em, I don't kick em, check it
Like the Fat Boys said, I ""Brrrrrrrr, STICK EM!""
From that point on, I say we're on for the night
But I love it when the girl just call me D-Nice
And if she gets bold and try to ask for a fee
I say, ""Please ho, it's all about me""

It's not the star spangled banner or the red white and blue
But the underground sister from the Edutainment Crew
So what you do, is back up if you work for Bush
Cause all the Presidential prison pushin politicians
Gotta get MUSHED, gimme back my land you SUCKA
You beat down my father and you raped my mother Africa
And now you wanna laugh at her
I feel like pickin up a razor, and slashin ya
Snatch up Margaret Thatcher and unmaskin her
To find out she's a man without a manicure
Go to President DeKlerk without askin her
And BUST SOME SHOTS for South Africa
And if Margaret jumps in, I start bashin her
For every freedom fighter start crashin her
And then Heather B will get nastier
And pull out my two shot derringer
Cause yes, Heather B comes classier
Cause Heather B, Jamal-Ski, and KRS the trainer
Makes up the dope crew called, Edutainer
You'll find the law of balance on the two turntables
So look out for the FRESH Edutainer label

Got my wrap around your throat, like you're chokin on a gizzard
If someone said, well damn, who is it?
It's Ms. Melodie, the real, so get with it

Fatalistic pessimistic, a big conspiracy
The way they treat blacks, in white society
It's erection rebellion, revolution uprisin
Takin no shorts, because JAH is guidin
Government they try to manage and rule
Dictate, regulate, and perpetrate the fool
That's why I search, explore, inspect, investigate
Drop down knowledge, and KILL dub plates

Kill dub plate-ah mi say kill dub plate-ah

A-ya don't stop (BDP in the house) a-ya don't stop
(Check it out, check it out...Yo, D!)
Yo bust it, yo yo Kris hold on
Let me give a shout out to some people, aight bust it
A Scott LaRock, and ya don't stop
A Sammy B, and ya don't stop
A Mister Cee, and ya don't stop
A Cool V, and ya don't stop
Evil E, and ya don't stop
A Easylee, and ya don't stop
A DJ Scratch, and ya don't stop
A Spinderella, and ya don't stop
Jam Master Jay, and ya don't stop
A PA Mase, and ya don't stop
So yo Kris, my mellow my man yo
Get on the mic and do the best you can

Well, the teacher comes to you, in effect
From a different style, a whole different sect
I inject, force and intellect
When I hit the mic, suckers hit the deck
I come correct and practice what I preach
I don't pimp you or rule you I teach
Come through the doors and slap up whores
Ordering them to put back on their drawers
Cause, I run their pimp
When I leave he leaves with a limp
Shrimp, I got the tartar sauce
Never underestimate the power of the force
Of the intellectual KRS-One
I don't think yet my job is done, because
I stand alone while others have to verify
Just why they are thought to be fly
Makin' the public believe that they are way up in the sky
Sort of like a rap superguy
But I, horrify and terrify the super duper rap guy
Because you're SOFT as a lullaby
While they sit on their throne lookin
Well I'm walkin in the streets of Brooklyn
Or Harlem and Queens and Bronx and
I'm even out there walkin in Compton
Cause everywhere BDP is schoolin'
So anywhere, KRS is coolin'
I'm not foolin', cause no, I'm not a fool
Don't act stupid boy, you know the rules

Word, aiyyo Kris, they act like they don't know the rules
But yo, I tell you what
Yo get on the mic and tell em what makes up KRS-One
YaknowhatI'msayin? Huh, and ya don't stop

Yo, from off the sidewalk I grab the mic and talk
Born nineteen-sixty-five in the state of New York
My name is Kris Parker, KRS-One for short
I slap up crews and rock parties for sport
Lived on the streets about eight years straight
There I got my education and learned to debate
So when I pick up the microphone I know what I'm sayin
Education doesn't come from simply obeyin'
The curriculum, of the school criteria
In fact what I learned I found inferior
I'm not a Muslim but I do support them
My Father in heaven taught me and taught them
I'm not a Christian, but I won't diss em
I'm not a Jew, I don't practice Judaism
I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddha's a master
I don't eat beef pork nor Diet Shasta
Reason for this is very simple indeed
When it comes to music everybody's in need
You got wealthy artists spendin, money loosely
You ask about the culture, they talk 'bout Gucci
Metaphysics, the science of life
And how to live, free from strife
Walk with ease, and no disease
Understand that I am the breeze
And the trees, oceans and seas
And the B and the D and the P's
Suckers try it, but I don't buy it
When I speak you seek to stay quiet
Shut up! What what? You better stay cool
And heed the warning boy, you know the rules!

Ah one two yeah, and ya don't stop
Ah three four (say what?) and ya don't stop
Ah five six (pop pop) and ya don't stop
Ah seven eight (get down) and ya don't stop
Aiyyo yo Kris, this goes out to all them house nigga

Going to New York, New York
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York

Well
I'm driving my car, cross country
With a hundred guns and about six G
Me driving through a town, me see two cops
They're looking at me funny like they really want stop
Me just turn my head, 
and gwan on me way
Put hip-hop inna de tape and press play
Me get one block and me hear ""Pull over!""
The guns are in the trunk with a thin cover
They ask me for ID, driver's license prefer
Me ask them ""Was I breaking any law, officer?""
They said ""Oh yes, you passed county line
Niggers in these here parts now is a crime""
I said ""Is that so?"" and cocked back me nine
Bust two shots inna the bwoy head top
His knees just a-buckle and his body a-drop
Me put the car in drive and me did not stop
When I get to New York I'm gonna set up shop
Bwoy!


Me in a hotel, off 95 North
Everything's fine, and yes me on course
Me walk to a bathroom, take a lickle leak
But right out the window I can hear the cops speak
""We have the place surrounded we're about to move in""
That's when I pick up my nine and just begin
Pump! Pump! Pump!
 First cop a-hit the ground
Pump! Pump! Pump! Second cop a-go down
Me jump out the window trying not to make a sound
Me run to the car, gunfire all around
I start up the engine, bust the barricade
All because illegally I want to get paid
Pump! Pump! Pump! There goes my tire
Me spun out of control, the car caught on fire
Me jump out the car, put my hands in the air
Cops just surrounding me with pistols everywhere
They put me in the backseat of their car handcuffed
Pushed out them chests like they're big rough and tough
A cop come and said ""You'll never sell your guns now""
I said ""It doesn't matter, you'll sell them anyhow
You take the guns from me, you sell them for a fee
Any way you put it they'll get in the city""

Part Time Suckers,By All Means Necessary,1988.0,"Alright, now here we go

T'cha t'cha, that boy is a t'cha
I want you all to understand I'm down with BDP
I got so many styles, but I'm not an MC
I am a teacher teaching rap, and of course I am back
Because these other MC's out here are so weak and wack
So BDP will teach them, hey, we will teach them
BDP will teach them, hey, we will teach them
All about the guy who first is down but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker
Among thousands and thousands of very good MC's
A poet will flow like the breeze
Like the wind, air is all around us
From what I hear, it's a good thing you found us
And in a hurry, just in the nick of time
Cause I do four things: rhyme, produce, teach, and bring to you new styles
Well here's the first style, right out the pile
It's called vocabulary. Difficult, isn't it?
At least is looks that way when you witness it
Kill (kill?) meaning to deprive of life
Fiancee: future wife
Poet (poet): a person who writes poems
Wandering, meaning to roam
Everyone sees me when I walk into the public
Even the suckers, I just love it
When they get disgusted every time I prove
(Boogie Down Pro...) Boogie Down Productions will move
Meaning to motivate, lest rhyme straight
Hate is a very very big mistake
It rhymes with frustrate and aggravate
Let me just demonstrate why I won't abbreviate
Television, a view of scenes transmitted
Every single second you get it
Pepsi (what?) the choice of a new generation
Fired from work: termination
Quality: something special about an object or person
Can you rock a party without rehearsing?
I can, anytime, on the spot rhyme
Many recording artists can't do it, but I'm
More than just a recording artist kicking dust (who?)
I'm a sandstorm, taking human form
K plus R S equals one
I don't burn anymore, I just cook 'till you're done
And when you're done, then I serve
Like alphabet soup, (letters) letters, (words) words
Sentences, chunks of meat into a paragraph
Get the meaning then ask the question 'bout the guy
Who first is down but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker

Kewe-kewe-K, Arewa-arewa-R, Ewe-ewe-S, my rhymes are fresh
Please step back, let me progress
Meaning to advance, you only get a glance
Of me at a time, sayin' some rhyme
Or sayin' some rekkid, 
that should respect it, select it
I'm never ever wack or 
reject it
Challenge BDP and get's
 dissed, expect it
I travel the nation by mostly plane
I travel New York by either cab or the train
Some say that I'm insane, they say
Why would you want to ride the train
(But I) but I don't care, as long as I get there
I never used to pay my fare, but now I think I got to
Because from a jail cell I can't rock you
That's being incarcerated, meaning locked up
(A tool) a tool for holding water is a cup or pail
The opposite for fresh is stale
(The largest) the largest sea-mammal is a whale
Beer is called ale, or sometimes it is called brew
(A group a) a group of human beings is a crew
You know what I'm gonna do? 
Explain Criminal Minded
Cause much too many people still are blinded
Let me rewind it, and elaborate on blinded, meaning can't see through me
He he he he he, these people make me laugh
The way they like to change up the past
So when you're there in class, learning `his story'
Learn a little of your story, the real story
It doesn't pay to know the life and times of someone else
It doesn't benefit your wealth or your mental health
I go for self, but the real self is one with all
The self who's by himself does fall
Down, just like the guy who first was down, but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker

Alright, now here we go",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-part-time-suckers-lyrics
Who Protects Us From You?,Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop,1989.0,"(Fy-ah! Come down fas'...)
You were put here to protect us
But who protects us from you?
Every time you say ""That's illegal""
Doesn't mean that that's true (Uh-huh)
Your authority's never questioned
No-one questions you
If I hit you I'll be killed
But you hit me? I can sue (Order! Order!)
Lookin' through my history book
I've watched you as you grew
Killin' blacks and callin' it the law
(Bo! Bo! Bo!) And worshipping Jesus too
There was a time when a black man
Couldn't be down wit' your crew (Can I have a job please?)
Now you want all the help you can get
Scared? Well ain't that true (You goddamn right)
You were put here to protect us
But who protects us from you?
Or should I say, who are you protecting?
The rich? the poor? Who?
It seems that when you walk the ghetto
You walk wit' your own point of view (Look at that gold chain)
You judge a man by the car he drives
Or if his hat match his shoe (Yo, you lookin' kinda fresh)
Well, back in the days of Sherlock Holmes
A man was judged by a clue
Now he's judged by if he's Spanish
Black, Italian or Jew
So do not kick my door down and tie me up
While my wife cooks the stew (You're under arrest!)
Cos you were put here to protect us
But who protects us from you?

You're stuck up, your luck's up, you fucked up, you're mud up
You can't even jump up, so shut the fuck up
Whattup? Tough love, buck buck bucka
Is all you're gonna hear when KRS-One step up
I'm thick like syrup, no, I'm not corrupt
Sit back and relax and watch the KRS era
No I won't let up, because of how I'm set up
I come in the jam with the crazy fresh lyrics so you get up
MC's get wet up, they met up with atypical
Subliminal, I'm original metaphysical Criminal Minder
Fighter, petty gangster that flips em neither
I simply grab the mic and make the party get liver
I'ma, rhymer, with a tim-er attack
To your mind, a reminder of what kind of headliner
You'll see, when you come to the show
BlastMaster KRS-One, Leo -- the Lion
Cryin MC's they be cryin
When they sizzle in a big pot grease beggin, ""Please, please!""

Ripping up MC's with their meaningless words, y'know
There's more wit, to one of my turds of shit
You ain't shit, you never was shit
So I spit, on your number one hit, now quit!
Leave the poetry, it's just too strong for thee
Maybe we should rethink the strategy see
Poetry I speak, fluently I think youse a sucker
Cause the only word you know
Is motherfucker
Yo, you don't see a whole race in bondage
No, you grab the microphone and feed em garbage
Yo, everything about me is fresher than fresher
Than fresher than fresh, of COURSE it's KRS
Flashing lyrics, metaphysics, unlike you idiots
Be doing, I'm pursuing, chewing your whole crew
And what you feel like doin, your face they be ungluin

Drug Dealer,Sex and Violence,1992.0,"All over the world...

Black drug dealer, you have to wise up
And organize your business so that we can rise up
If your gonna sell crack then don't be a fool
Organize your money and open up a school

Drug dealer, understand historical fact
Every race got ahead from sellin' drugs except Black
We are under attack, here comes another cold fact
In the '30s and '40s a drug dealer wasn't black
They were Jewish, Italian, Irish, Polish, etc. etc
Now in '90 their live's a lot better
They'll sell you a sweater, a pair of pants, cold-hearted
But first sellin drugs and killin' people is how they started
Drug dealer, black and Hispanic, stop killin' one another
Cause in the ghetto we're all brothers
Organized economically, understand the psychology
America is the drug monopoly
They own the block and kill your brother for
Therefore, we got the same enemy - what's more, I go on tour
But who do you think picks up the bill?
A hard working fireman? Chill!


Eighty percent of American business is created illegally
This is a fact, I don't ask you to believe in me
If you're really in the drug game to win it
Eventually you're gonna get shot, open a clinic
Again, if you're really in the drug game to win it
Invest in a prison, therefore you can be put in it
Everyone else did it now they chillin'
Above the law, while your under the law still killin'
One another, wake up my Hispanic brother, my African brother
America's not your mother
Or your father, so don't bother with right or wrong
Just check out the logic in the song
Organize, realize, become unhypnotized
To the lies that youre livin' for the get high
See many people have forgotten the fact
That America was never ever built for Black
So when some people are gonna run and buy crack
Take the money and put it back into Black
It's only logic, see KRS-One will rock it
With knowledge, education for the people I'll never stop it
Organize and legitimize your business
Remember, everybody else did this",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-drug-dealer-lyrics
We in There,Sex and Violence,1992.0,"Yeah.. ahh, back to that old shit!
For all you FAKE-ass teachers out there
Aiyyo Kris.. break this shit up!

The type of lyrical terrorism I present
Educates people, at the same time pays my rent
You've been hearin me now for the past twelve semesters
When the suckers stepped up, I had to use the drastic measures
I know you want to step to me kid!
But you're thinkin, ""Damn, Kris is kinda big!""
Plus he rolls wit a crew that don't care
And drops a hit album, hit video, hit single every year
From your eye drops a tear
I don't play that shit, I play that hit
Your whole gangsta image is not legit
You heard Criminal Minded, and bit the whole shit
Now if I punch you in your face I'd be wrong
Don't even think about battling with a song
You'll be gone, your career ain't strong enough to call my bluff
You ain't rough, you ain't tough, you'll be handcuffed
With your ribcage crushed
Naked in a box, with multicolored tube socks
You know my FUCKIN name
Blastmaster KRS is thinkin LONG range!
Yeah we in there, yeah yeah (repeat 4X)

They are in there, like you'll soon be in prison
(You await and this is faggot, your ass you'll be given)
Who you kiddin? You're only tryin to rock a party
You ain't really down to shoot nobody
So why you frontin? Sayin from the cops you be runnin
In jail in a pair of panties you look just stunning
You pop all that wannabe shit on vinyl
Until your ass is bein pumped by some faggot named Lionel
In jail you ain't got respect
You a fairy, I'll be takin your commisary
And the picture of your sister, mister
As seamy as Pee-Wee Herman, I ain't trying to diss her
This ain't no bullshit game and I ain't changed
I'm just thinkin LONG range
People died so I can rhyme..
You think I'm gonna grab the mic and waste my nation's time?
Step off with that weak shit
You're psychologically, historically, and spiritually sick
Plus you're on my dick
Changin the subject, your rhyme style ain't correct

The only way to deal with racism if you're black
Well, seven in the morning I woke up to jog
Rushed out the door to inhale the smog
As I ran I began to wonder
Should I produce or should I tour this summer?
Well just that second I heard, ""Stay where you are""
Before I could stop I was hit by a cop car
I laid on the pavement like I was hurt
Then a redneck cop jumped out with a smirk
He said, ""Ah boy, you better watch where you run""
As he poked my side with the barrel of his shotgun
I said, ""Officer man, I ain't do nothin""
He said, ""What's that word you niggazs use, ya frontin?""
""Well ya frontin, 'cause why were you running down the street?""
At this time I had stood to my feet and said, ""Wait a minute""
And that's when he did it, he hit me in the face with his gun
I wasn't with it so
On the ground was a bottle of Snapple
I broke the bottle in his fucking Adam's apple
As he fell his partner called for backup, well, I had the shotgun
And began to act up with that

Well I threw down the gun and began to run
I got back in no time and loaded the nine
First I took two clips and then I took two more
I went out the window 'cause by now they were right at my door
I took three shots and then I laid
They rushed in shooting so I threw a quick grenade
It went boom, like a supernova
Badges, arms, legs, heads, cops were all over
I jumped out the fire escape down to the street
And I started to run you know I couldn't feel my feet
I was weak, I said to myself ""Holy shit""
My shirt had filled with blood I didn't know I got hit but
There's no time to stop, no time to explain man
I'm in too deep with this everyday ghetto game
Black men are judged by their clothes
Black women are looked at as hoes
So I as one of these uppity niggas
Can only rely on the sound of a trigger going

Get your street knowledge, every posse know that, come again

The only way to deal with racism if you're black
Well I staggered down the street to an old bookstore
Called 'The tree of life', yo D it ain't there no more
But when it was boy I was lucky
'Cause in the basement is where they stuck me
When I awoke at the 14th hour
Three black women had gave me a quick shower
I stayed a while and escaped in a truck
Driven by two guys, Rakim and Chuck
""What the fuck"" I asked as I laid there
""How many guys do you drive a day here?""
Chuck said, ""Many"" Rakim said, ""Plenty it's an everyday thing
When you're willing to sing a song""

Ya Strugglin’,Edutainment,1990.0,"Africans in America try to identify
Totally with their master in every respect
They are the only ones who can not do it
But they are the ones who will go to all extremes to do it
 (CHECK IT OUT) 
They can not be disguised
But they will attempt to disguise themselves

I'm on a search, not for a car or a miniskirt
But the words I wish to exert
Will hurt, damage or upset the ego
You wanna be macho, yeah, but we know the deal
Jheri curls just ain't gettin it
KRS-One is only down for pickin' it
Pick the afro, need no Soul Glo
Or Carefree Curls, that's just a no-no
Where oh where, are all the real men
The feminine look seems to be the trend
You got eyeliner on, chillin' and maxin'
See you're a man with a spine extraction
So what I'm askin' is plain to see
Are there any straight singers in R&B?
All I see, is the light-skinned buffy
Tryin hard, to be Mr. Tuffy
Yet in fact, you're Mr. Softie
With the beige contacts on, yo you lost me
I ain't with it, never will, never have
How can your son even call you dad?
Your skin is bleached and your nails you just buffin'
Take a look at yourself man, YA STRUGGLIN'

Africa is so strong, that once she puts a stamp on you
Four hundred years of cold weather, death
And all that fryin' your hair shall not disguise you
As a matter of fact, she is so strong
That no matter what chemicals you put in your hair
She will come back and snatch it up


Tell me
Are you proud man, of who you are?
Or does your pride come out of a jar
Cause if you bought it, put it on, or sprayed it on
I tell you right now, it won't stay long
Cause if it ain't natural, it ain't kosher
It's like buyin' and wearin' a culture
If that culture ain't yours naturally
It's his, not yours, actually
You better wake up and smell the coffee
Look in the mirror and think Mr. Softie
People change, when they are ashamed
Of how they look or from which they came
Are you ashamed, of original black?
If you're not, why does your hair look like that?
Why is your nose straighter, from surgery?
I think you're really in a state of emergency
You're not sane to the African aim
So you're insane, and you need to obtain
Any average rap album sculpture
And study it, just to learn your culture
Even though, you don't think it's music
It's the blackest you'll ever get so use it
The blue-eyed black man to me is buggin
Take a look at yourself man, YA STRUGGLIN'


Yess.. capitalism will confuse these people, have them totally confused
They will try every way to identify with their masters, every way
Go to extreme lengths , I'm telling you, seriously!
Capitalism will confuse them y'know tell them the truth's a lie
I saw a sister the other day and I spoke to her about her hair
She said, ""I don't care what you say, I'm still gonna get my perm!""
I told her, ""It's not a perm, it's a temporary""

Try in every possible way to identify..",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-ya-strugglin-lyrics

A few hit records got me started real quick
I represent the Bronx, but I am a New Yorker
All vegeterian, never eat pork or
Chicken in a battle yes my brain starts clickin
Just like the gears of a watch, tock-tickin
I never lose time cause the rhyme is all digital
For suckers like you, I turn the power up to critical
On every playlist, waxin that anus
Suckers or professionals, BRING DOWN THE DECIMAL
Point every time you subtract an emcee
People look at me, a P-O-E-T
Teachin suckers like you about the I.C.U
And the KRS-One, sounds like arithmetic
Very psychological; why are you on the dick?
Well, my evaluation is sudden
Takin me out, is somethin closer to impossible
You could try your best
But frankly I don't think it's logical
This is yes the DJ writer superproducer Kris
God gave me a talent, so let me flaunt the gift

Boogie Down Productions at the head of the raid
Always gettin brighter while the suckers will fade
Life is very serious, it's not an arcade
So everything you're hearing, KRS has made
MC's grab the microphone but don't know what to say
So DJ KRS has come to show dem the way
I always call you females by your name, not ""Hey!""
Cause ""Hey"" will only make a real woman turn away, GWAN
Unless the woman is the freak of the yearrrr
Well then you know that KRS don't carrrre
Unless the woman is the freak of the yearrrr, biddi-by-by
And then you know that KRS don't carrrre
You always call a freak, by the garment they wear
Instead of call it clothes they always callin it gear
Big derriere to make the next man stare
Attracted to the man with jheri curls in him hair
Always puffin cheeba with a forty of beer
But to a re-al wo-man freaks-a can-not compare, GWAN
Hold up ya han-ds if you a real wo-man, BO!
Hold up ya han-ds, if you do underst-and
The style that I'm sayin, without no delayin
Is Blastmaster KRS-One, just playin
It's really kinda easy for me, to do a style like this
It's kinda primitive, so please don't miss
The way I do this on the microphone, cause I was never shown
My mother wasn't into b-boyin at the Home
No one out can compete
And not another DJ rocks this type of beat
Come mi say
Chorus

Come mi say jump up when ya high, and jump up when ya low-ah
Boogie Down Productions make the lyrics just flow
With M-E-L-O-D-I-E and Manager Moe
We'll wrap up any MC in a ribbon or a bow
People takin pictures of me everywhere I go
Take out three MC's and call it Tic-Tac-Toe

Every single music, rock and roll down
Therefore; in a situation that has, all African music in it
All African music, uhh, exploiting itself of it, or coming out of it

The Kenny Parker Show,Edutainment,1990.0,"Indeed truly we are the mighty mighty BDP posse
This is our 4th album and we're STILL not takin no shorts
Yeah.. ha hah!
On the wheels of steel, is Kenny Parker
As we say he can't get no darker
All about action, not a fast talker
All the whick whack sucker DJ's
Gotta try much harder
My man Willie Willie Willie D
Taggin up BDP with a fat marker
And THIS, is what's on today's charter
Ha hah hah
All the ladies in the place throw your hands up in the air
BDP rockin without no fear
So Kenny Parker if you know what time it is
Throw the funky fresh beat in like this

C'mon!
Crowd chants ""go, go, go, go""

Ha hah
Well it's me, down with BDP
KRS-One rocks ANY party
Rocks the beats, and the breaks
Rock the socks off the frauds and the fakes
The suckers shake, while I'm creatin
They get together and they start debatin
""How can we take him out one time?""
So they push up the best with the freshest rhyme
I might go first, and he'll go second
I'll wreck him, deck him, say to him, ""just checkin' the mic""
Droppin' fresh styles I like
So throw up your hands and drop your mic
Cause I'll go third, and he'll go fourth
By the fifth you're dissed cause you lost
Six is your beat down, your title is seven
Takin' out your four man crew makes eleven
By the twelveth well I'll go for self
Rockin' New York like no one else
You can check any rapper from seventy-eight
A few have rocked their whole career straight
Some had dope twelve inches, count 'em
But not many crews had slammin' albums
BDP rocks CONSISTENTLY
From Criminal Minded to 1990
Why? Well that's my secret baby
Here's a hint: the public pays me
So you can call me a public servant
Not a King but a teacher, I'll believe I earned it
So I just walk, or ride my bike
If I walk to a jam well I'll rock the mic
Gimme a chance and I'll rock the house
But don't let a sucker try to take me out
Cause male or female, I will strangle
If it's a crew, they'll have to untangle
Adidas, Nike's, arms, mics
Turntables suckers in the wheel of my bike
Step right up if that's what you like
But watch your head cause it'll fly like a kite
In the night at a height, right for flight
Way out of sight, you bite, I recite
My style is bright, still you're sellin' out to white
As your faggot DJ would say, ""Well alllllright""
I am your mentor,
Victory is mine, it's time you surrender
Sucker! And just back up quickly
Your style is sickly, but you persist to get me
Or outwit me with the style that I created
Years ago when you was doing a dollar fifty show
Oh, all of a sudden you don't know
Or can't remember, can't recall, can't
Bring to mind
That rhyme that place do not chase
I run a marathon a race of rhymes in your face
In case you bass I'll erase your whole rap
Tell you right now I ain't TRYIN to hear that
I don't dress up to rap or keep a hairdo
I only grab the mic and bust holes in a crew
I deny your existence as artists
You're puttin out a record expectin to chart
But it's weak, but when you speak through the microphone
You fail to realize nope you're not alone
On the earth, the light comes forth as KRS
Intelligence, force, and love manifest in the flesh
I snatch the mic and shed light
Behave, you're still a 20th century slave
Headed for the grave in a wave
So save the microscopic miniature small talk and walk
And put a little pep in your step
KRS-One will destroy any ignorant reputation
In the nation, in creation
Princes, Kings, Queens, or any occupation
Like rappers with nuttin to say
I crush those idiots and throw em away
Cause no matter how fatter the wallet, I'd rather
Gather together and splatter whatever
Egotistic mystics, with macho poses
If you ain't for black you're down for Guns 'n' Roses
Yeah! C'mon!
Throw your hands in the sky
And wave em from side to side
And if you're in this life just gettin by
Somebody say, ALRIGHT! (ALRIGHT!)
ALRIGHT! (ALRIGHT!)
DJ Kenny Parker takin out these sucker DJ's

It feels good to grab the mic and just allow yourself to chat
The master of the microphone is here and he's black
Recitin poetry, beautifully articulated
Demonstrated by the never faded strong facial feature
Of the teacher, I am the teacher, you can check it
The styles they're doing, is from my old record
They bought my album, for $8.99
Studied the style, then wrote they own rhyme
I don't mind because I'm here to show
The lost MC's which way to go
So here's my rep, to those that slept
And didn't get the first concept in depth
I am the manifestation of study
NOT, the manifestation of money
Therefore I advance through thought
Not what's manufactured and bought
Concentration, and calculation
Goes into every song creation
The first and second album rocked you
Third album made you think and got through
Didn't you think I knew?
Number three, wasn't for the dance crew
But it gave me a chance to see
Who was REALLY down with BDP
I set the warm milk, in the glass
And the snakes came out the grass
They don't realize I'm not confined
Nor trapped by space and time
I am a rebel, an overthrower
Descendant of the black man Noah
Radio DJ's, all around
Constantly tell me how they are down
To uplift Africa and unite black
Yet they fronted when I dropped _Why Is That?_
It's a fact, I don't beg for juice, I just get loose
And demonstrate the truth
Many MC's can only rock the many
But I rock a few with my brother Kenny
From twenty-thousand to ten I'm housin
African culture is what I'm arousin
In your consciousness, soul and body
Pay attention while I rock the party
Cause now I'm gonna show ya how the East Coast rocks
Bumpin sucker MC's out the box
Rockin the dreadlocks and the flattops
I like these ops, so I'll try not to stop, but drop
The new hip-hop, and get props
Scott La, Scott La, Scott La, Scott LaRock
Spins in heaven, while the earth I rock
MC's adopt, the styles I drop
They got no direction, they got no direction, they got no direction
So they wanna go pop
Chasin the charts up and down like suckers
Totally ignoring their sisters and brothers
They're the ones to say you're number one
Not chart position, so pick up the drum and hum

So we're gonna do it like this now
Put up your hands if you love hip-hop music like I do, seen?
And we gonna do it like this now
Listen to the lyrics!  Bo!

Me say hip-hop rule, hip-hop rule
And these other industries out here cannot take it, come again!

And these other industries out here cannot take it, we want!
Rap music, we want the rap music, bo!
Rap music, we want the rap music, come again!
Rap music, we want the rap music, bo!
Rap music, we want the rap music

Way back in the days, 1979
Fatback Band made a record usin' rhyme
In the same year come the 
Sugarhill Gang
With the pow pow boogie, and the big bang bang
R&B, Disco, Pop Country Jazz
All thought Hip-Hop, was just a little fad
But here comes Grandmaster Flash nonstop
And right after Flash, Run-DMC dropped
Now, they had to pay attention to the scale
Where other music failed, hip-hop prevailed
See rap music has gone platinum from the start
So now in eighty-nine we gettin' present as an art
Me ask, is it because, we've got the eighty-nine vision?
Whoa whoa whoa!
Or is it because, it's a unanimous decision
Hey hey hey hey

That hip-hop rule, hip-hop rule
And these other industries out here cannot take it, come again!
Hip-hop rule, hip-hop rule
And these other industries out here cannot take it, we want!
Rap music, we want the rap music, bo!
Rap music, we want the rap music, come again!
Rap music, we want the rap music, come down!
Rap music, we want the rap music

I pick up the mic and put down crazy lyrics
I put it 'pon the phonograph so everyone can hear it
You want to sound like me bwoy, you can't come near it
'Cause when I flash a new style, the people dem a cheer it
You get so jealous 'til you just can't bear it
Jealous of Ms. Melodie, me and Derek
See Derek is D-Nice, and I'm KRS-One ah
We'll rock ya in the winter and we rocked ya last summer
You want to battle me you got to wake up in the morning
'Cause if you're still sleepin', then I'ma start yawnin'

Because ah hip-hop rule, hip-hop rule
And these other industries out here cannot take it, come again!
Hip-hop rule, hip-hop rule
And these other industries out here cannot take it, we want!
Rap music, we want the rap music, bo!
Rap music, we want the rap music, come again!
Rap music, we want the rap music, come down!
Rap music, we want the rap music

Just, put up your hands if you like rap music
Put up your hands if you like rap music
Ms. Melodie boy she always on the mixer
And D-Square, love rap music ah
DJ Doc boy yes he's on the mix and
KRS-One'll flash a lyric, we say
Here comes Yvette, on the lyric and
Big Kap, rockin' on the mix and

The Homeless,Edutainment,1990.0,"Yeah...
You could call a man a bum with disgust on your morning run
Cause he lives outside in the street, you don't know this
But you've failed to realise that the one you so despise
Reflects yourself cos every black man is homeless
You could take your Alka-Seltzer while you talk about shelter
You might even wanna talk about a little loan
Cause no matter how rich you become you'll always be two, not one
Cause believe it or not, America ain't your home
We've been taught to say our name, Afro-American, all the same
Not fully American but gettin' there very slowly
Cause to fully be American, you know, you gotta take out the word 'Afro'
Now they've relaxed I hear they might as well call us Toby
See, Afro and black are African,
 
while theft is American
So how can Afro-American make much sense?
Your ancestors come from Africa
By stealing them now you're born in America
So the black man is homeless even though he pays rent
Some black people say ""We built this place
So we are American, but of the black race""
Well let me make this little topic known
The Japanese also built this place
In technology and they're winnin' the race
But at the end of the day the Japanese can go home
Do you see the point that I'm getting at?
I'm not a racist, I'm statin' a fact
Blacks are actually prisoners of war
Cause while South Africa continues to fight
We try our best to look more and more white
Proof that the blacks have been stripped of their core
Well, I guess I didn't sing and dance enough
For black radio to play this stuff
But this ain't soft like ice-cream with a sugar cone
I'm only here to state one fact
Wake up African, your colour is black
And every black man is homeless cause he ain't got no home",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-the-homeless-lyrics
30 Cops or More,Edutainment,1990.0,"When they arrest a
Black man, they need 30 cops or more.. well now
When they arrest a
Black man, they need 30 cops or more.. well now hey

If you a black herb smuggler
They will, watch you by the hour
It only means that if you have more money
Then you have more power
They will come in the night
And they will read you your rights
There is no need to fight
If you're black there is no need to fight


Years ago a black man couldn't be a cop
They could only be great dancers
When the whole police department was white
Justice, was the Black Panthers
We've been robbed of our religion
Our government and social position
And you won't see no quick solution
Until you see the black revolution


""He's gonna get across the border before we can catch him""
*dogs barking*
""Just let me draw a bead on his black ass and he's dead""
*dogs barking*

They arrest us by the hour
Cause the black man in the ghetto has power
If he would wake up and unite
The police department would lose the fight


If you a black herb smuggler
They will, watch you by the hour
It only means that if you have more money
Then you have more power
They will come in the night
And they will read you your rights
There is no need to fight
If you're black there is no need to fight


""He's gonna get across the border before we can catch him""
*dogs barking*
""Just let me draw a bead on his black ass and he's dead""
*dogs barking*
""He's gonna make it""
""Let the dogs go!""
""No I won't do it!""

But, ah! Ah, this a KRS ménage à trois
When me open up to work, I put a cape on me back
Then me 
fly all around the MC world
KRS, the Article is not to be fucked with
Fucked with, tempered with, or tampered with
Don't give a fuck if you wanna riff, but when you
Say Kris—already derivative of Kris
My eyebrows lift and that ass I get with (
Huh!
)
As a matter of fact, I attack, hijack
Set back, your career, like a quarterback
That broke his back, my tongue is like a bat
Your eye'll get black, you'll need an icepack (
Ruff!
)
I'm all that, come with your whole pack
You'll be prayin to the god of Isaac
So Freddie Foxxx, it's time to get tough (
Uh huh?
)
Just get on the mic and get ruff! Ruff!

It's the return of the hip-hop master, Freddie the Foxxx
(Bo!) 
Rappers that see me don't even speak, just walk
'Cause I'm the maddest nigga in New York
 (Ah!)
I see a rapper in the crowd that I don't like
I wanna fight, so when I drop the mic
I'mma
 
jump
 
off the stage, bum-rush ya crowd of wimps
(Suckers) 
that wanna be pimps
I heard it said that a pimp'll sell his ass
If his ho won't, but Freddie Foxxx don't
Cover your chest G, you better wear a bulletproof vest, see
'Cause I'm about to leave this place a motherfuckin' mess
Open hearts on the floor as I explore
Rappers that wanted to be more than number four
Number one's a hard spot; either you fight
Or get shot, so this is what I got
 (Pump!)
Three TEC-9s, my uzi, ten grenades, my razor blades
And I aim to get 
paid!
So who wanna step to this? Don't come soft
'Cause I'mma straight up knock niggas off
 (Pump! Pump!)
And when the cops come to get me
I'mma take a dead body, and bout ten cops with me
I'm sick and tired of hearin' rappers talk smack
About who's nice, and who's wack—motherfuck that
They know my style, and my rep, every stage
That I stepped on—I was the rapper they slept on
But y'all rappers keep sleepin—'cause when 
I
 plant
Bombs in your house, I'mma wake you up and punch you
In your motherfuckin mouth, knock your wife out
Take your sons to safety, 'cause they're just kids
And I wanna raise 'em to face me
And when they get a little bigger
I'mma mop them little niggas, and put their fingerprints
On the trigger—double homicide, call the vice
Another rapper and his family with no life
Yeah, you're Mr. Tough and you're full of stuffin'
And Freddie Foxxx caught you bluffin'
I got you in my torture chamber and you scream
Oh, God damn, it's like
 Silence of the Lamb
But I don't mangle 'em and eat 'em
I take emcees to the war zone, and there I defeat 'em
It gets much worse, with every verse
As the F-R-E-D-D-I-E F-O-X-X-X 
hurts!

Before I start, peace to Scott La Rock! (

Now let me drop the style that has action
'Cause many emcees don't believe they're rappin'
They're lost, crazy mixed-up in their identity
This is not, what hip-hop is meant to be (
Word up

I come unique, I can't be beat, hardcore street
For the kids, with a hundred-and-fifty on their feet
(kick it) I don't compete, I defeat and delete ya
Then critique ya, all emcees retreat, here comes the teacher!
Chewin' suckers like Smuckers
Hittin' on, sittin' on, shittin' on, flippin' on motherfuckers
Yeah, I'm like the movie 
Aliens
I hide inside your right-hand man, when you think you got me
Bam! My head comes out your chest
A mutilated mess of nastiness
Chunks of bloody flesh, yes, KRS on the slaughter
Specialize in instant-rhyme style, you simply add water
Evian, or Poland Spring, then
Ring-ding-ding, ding-ding-ding-ding
Back in the days, I wrote South Bronx
The Juice Crew got stomped, lick two shot
Pump! Pump! Really it was Magic's fault
Always wanna diss somebody, he got put to a halt
It's wack, when a sucker DJ rattles on
Soupin' up emcees to battle on song
That's wrong, but in any event
I drop the classic in 1992 the original
It ain't plastic, everybody know, BDP
Is fantastic, burn like acid
Credit card plastic, stretch like elastic
Love and respect is the tactic

Bam! In your motherfuckin' face
KRS in the place
I never liked listening to bitches and hoes anyway
(Fi-yah!!)
Well you know I like hoes, 'cause I'm a mack
But I don't like the wack tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
And for all your suckers out there
That underestimate the militant mack, get the bozack
You know what I mean?

You can't succeed, you can't acheive

Stop reading from a dead book
Stop reading from a dead book for a live God!

With a Bible in his hand that you yourself can't do?

Take George Washington, as bad as he is
Put him in the middle of Valley Forge, by himself, surrounded
By the British, he can do nothing
*laughing and applause*
Mhmhmmmhmm
Take Martin Luther King as righteous as he is
Put him in the middle of Birmingham by himself, speaking out against racism
He would be lynched
But you take this same King, you take this same Washington
Put them in Valley Forge, put them in Alabama
Surround them with thousands of people who have the same ideas they do
Willing to make those ideas reality and the situation changes drastically",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-exhibit-b-lyrics
The Blueprint,Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop,1989.0,"The blueprint!

Musty, fusty, yet so crystal clear
The non-commercial set is now here
Brought to you, by the will of positive people
K-R-S plus One equals
Slammin' lyrics, and beats unquestionable
The professional, while I guess that you'll
Grab the album, that rocks the most, on the market
Strong hearted, with a target
--Bloo-- and the target is hit
I shot the lyric then reload the clip
--Bloo-- another shell hits the ground
Along with the shell my opponents weak crown
--Bloo Bloo-- the title comes after
What a disaster listen to the laughter
Your heart I capture
'Cause every lecture has texture
If you're wack I say ""Next, sir""
Who's next? 'Cause I've got no time for weakness
Only the teacher speaks this
Dialect, that gains 'nuff respect
Which money can't buy you yet
But I don't care, 'cause Boogie Down Productions has both
The most worldwide, coast to coast
We didn't do it with the soft commercial sound
Try the ghetto, 'cause I refuse to let go
You see you don't understand, I knew it
You got a copy I read from the blueprint

Keepin' it on, track
And never wack
Please step back
If you speak the wack rap
'Cause I alone can diss your whole pack or posse
Stupid! Sit there and watch me
You can't stop the original with a copy
Sloppy, very sloppy you slouch
Every time you bite I yell ""Ouch!""
Breakout, get lost your throat is hoarse
You lost 'cause I'm dope of course
--One and Two and Three and Four--
But that comes from, years of practice
Anti-slackness, anti-wackness
Throw on the glasses and teach the masses
Very simple, the question I ask is
How many MC's must get stomped
Before somebody says Kris has no comp?
Thousands, both here and overseas
If you're soft I say ""Please, leave""
Here's the door, there's your hat coat and mitt
'Cause here, we read the blueprint",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-the-blueprint-lyrics

Come in!

Many have claimed to attain levels in rhymin'
But when I listen to 'em I see they're only lyin'
They're tryin', but after some years if you ain't got it
Lay it down, put it down, find a way to try and stop it
Or change it, rearrange it, be a producer
Don't touch the microphone because you'll always be the loser
And laughed at, smirked on, you don't belong
With those that perform their song on and on
And on and on and on, yo, let's get specific
This style is for the gifted, poetically uplifted
I speak to you, not at you to attack you
Maybe when I'm through with this rhyme I'll get a statue
So now I ax you or tell you people literally
When it comes to rockin' funky lyrics few are better than me
Down with BDP, endlessly recitin' poetry
Any time I'm in the street, you hear my voice, you know it's me

I rocked the party, but oh! Gotta run
Cos only the suckers want a chance at that
To see if KRS-One is really all that
Instead of a rap I jap-slap all of 'em back
Because the teacher that you see is not wack
I'd like to stack up all the hits that I've made
Three albums, a triple-layer cake
And throw it in your face you waste
Pick up the pace and taste a poet from the black race
While I whip you whine, you're out of touch

Like a Throttle,Sex and Violence,1992.0,"*snapping fingers and singing*
Ha ha, hah hah! Da-doo-doo-doo, do-doo
You wanna test me are you stupid?
Gotta be out of your FUCKIN mind
KRS-One is the DON, seen?
Come down Kenny Park-ah!!
Hahaha, you know
I don't know what your management be tellin you
I don't know what your producers be tellin you
But yo, you step this way
You're gettin PLAYED, out of position
So let me give you a little style
Check it out
Everytime KRS-One steps in the jam
The party is packed, he got the mic in his hand
Brooklyn's ready Uptown's in the house
Kenny drops the beat and we turn the party out
That's it! 
None of the gimmicks, tricks
, oh it's
You either have the hits, or the crazy hype lyrics
But MC's come half-assed, and lookin pitiful
None of em lyrical but their ego is critical
Like I said I'm not a Muslim but to Allah I'm obedient
Some MC's on the mic become Muslims when it's CONVENIENT
And I've seen it!
Real Muslims praise Allah, and they mean it
Others are dreamin it with Sex Me and Do Me and
I'd rather listen to the Brand Nubians
You know it's funny everybody wants money
And material things from cars and chicken wings
When they sing, they sing for the cash
They fail to realize, respect will outlast cash
You get respect by bein creative
And yes 
a native to your audience, so you know reality
In other words, if you ain't a gangsta why play you a gangsta?
If you ain't a ho, why sell sex?
If you believe in Allah, how is it you can only work when there's a check?
All of this is incorrect
First should always come respect
The charts are not equal to the respect of the people
Their respect doesn't weeble or wobble
They know the difference from an artist and a lip-syncin model
Right on stage, you'll get a bottle
You're-holding-my-dick-like-a-throttle
I'm the freshest thing on the mic don't mess with me
I'm fresher than your grandmother's fried chicken recipe
Don't test me, you ain't a chemist and I sure ain't chemistry
You're not a mathematician and my name ain't geometry
You're no astronomer why see me as astronomy
But 
I'm a Parker so I'll play you like Monopoly
Don't entertain the thought of droppin me
To think of me as anything less than your teacher
Crazy you got to be
These type of lyrical styles cannot be said sloppily
I rip it up constantly
You're-holding-my-dick-like-a-throttle
The teacher will come, again and again and again and again
To set the trend and lend to other men a perfect blend
So-when-their-lyrics-finish-KRS-One-just-begin
RIPPING up sucker teachers put their courage to an end
So once again, the trendsetter comes a lot better
Forever too clever for a petty MC in leather
Whenever they decide, whatever I'm in sync
The lyrics I write, help me think
To guide ink off the paper through the air smack in your face
And erase in haste the rhymes you embrace
Just in case, get the FUCK out my face I run this place
You're lucky you're from the same race
A simple technique will keep you on beat
With the style from the street you compete with the elite
That's WEAK -- flashin gold and can't speak
I seek the direction of the brown complexion
So every year, I appear somewhere
That you hear my dear to get one thing clear
Whether on welfare or millionaire
Don't step to this here or you outta here
Allow me now to please change the gear
?And-pick-up-the-mic-you-missed-those-happen-around-me-have-me-feared, come!?
?We come in the dance we haffa likka of a shot an towah?
Let's get back to the hip-hop
You come into the place you can't LOOK in my face
Cause the light is bright and I'm towering in height
See there are millions of stars in the sky
When the sun appears none are visible to the eye
Why, the reason is the sun is the sun
You can't possibly rock, until I'm done
And finished, and like the evening I'll fade
But when I return you'll cry for more shade
So check the dancestyle cause I am not
Softening up it's time that I rock and sing
Not about my ding-a-ling-a-ling!
But instead bring intellect pon ting
Cause you can inject ignorance in rap
But Kenny Parker ain't tryin to hear that",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-like-a-throttle-lyrics

Act off your instinct
And think in a wink, or blink

My fans be telling me I'm the greatest
You hate this, original, metaphysical, criminal minded poet
Don't blow it, if it's lost, I'll show it
If its torn, I'll sew it
It's kinda off beat yeah I know it
The styles I originate, I don't wait for fate
I practice love not hate
But MCs get ate!
Because they wait and hesitate on the act
But always can debate on that trivial fact
This is KRS and I'm Black!
Same color as the brothers in Iraq
War is wack, especially when you die in vain
Bush invaded Panama, how can you really place blame on Hussein?
Regardless of the name, the insane economic game has got to change
Like a Range Rover over the plains
I come equipped to rip shit
Not ignorant, intelligent - artistic - inquisitive - positive and negative
The sedative is the poetry I give
How ya live? KRS is in the house!
The poisonous product (is) pimped out to poor people
Penetrates pieces of their thinking equal
It comes in peaceful through the ""TELL-LIE-VISION""
Distorts your vision
Now the lies got you wishin' thru transmission
You wanna be a better Christitan
You wake up Sunday mornin' to watch ""TELL-LIE-VISION""
Mission - Christians be sayin ""Accept Jesus in your life""
Christianity was founded 400 years after Christ
What do you accept in your life?
Christianity - or the teachings of Christ?
Make up your mind, they're not the same thing
In 1992 the blind leads the blind
Right into the ground they can't show you where God is
Because they haven't found!
First - put down your Bible and release your sins
The Bible is dead, god is alive
Within, metaphysically speaking, I'll go clearer
You wanna see God? Take a look in the mirror!
A tree is always known by its fruit
A human being can walk upright, or crawl like a brute
Yeah, now who do you salute? The barbarian teaches us to hate our roots!
Despise our culutre, look for culture in another man's existence
Resistance - resist this master plan...
To turn the Black man into a statistic
Why? Cuz he's materialistic
He wants to make a record but don't know the logistics of it

I wear Clarks 
and only Nike sneaker
In your speaker, is the new style
Dedicated to the intelligent child
In the front row, or behind me
We're gonna pull somebody file for the 90's
You want lyrics? We come correct
BDP, only movin with respect
The other MC's, they can't believe me
A when I rhyme it sound just like a CD
We don't lip-sync, we go all live
On stage, I bring about four or five
That's D-Nice,
 Sydney, and Melodie
And myself, Harmony, and Willie D
We come humble, we just grumble
While other MC's crew just crumble
They want dancers, they want lighting
They want effects, to make them look exciting
But it's frightening, cause without that
The whole crew, is whick whick whick whack
BDP comes, with the cheapest
And perform miracles like Jesus
The total respect, we achieve it
And the big head-liner can't believe it


Ha ha ha ha ha hah..
Well the styles I, usually dish out
Are so dope that you don't wanna miss out
We got pages, of the dope stuff
So in the record store, you can't pass by us
Get the album, hear the music
And hold on so you just don't lose it
As a reference, for any MC
That wanna test, K-R-S, O-N-E
Cause I've been watchin, these other rap groups
They walk around like they're some kinda big soup
You can't touch them, you only see them
In a arena or big coliseum
So when you watch them, for a second
Them sound nothing like they do on record
Them sound cheesy, them sound wheezy
For twenty dollars boy you know them never please me
So I see this, and prevent this
It's like goin for a checkup at the dentist
Cause when you come to a BDP performance
The microphone, had better have endurance
Cause we'll check it, and then wreck it
And then the soundman has got to accept it",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-breath-control-ii-lyrics

Question: Why everything you do is fresh?

Question: You only write reality, why?
Answer: No time to waste, our people are going to die
Question: Going to die? Please explain this topic
Answer: Some people are using ignorance to make a profit
Question: How do we stop it?
Answer: Throw em in a jail cell and lock it
Question: Why, are people so stupid?
Answer: They got a brain and fail to use it

Answer: Organized, revolution
Question: Revolution implies killing..

STILL SPILLING, and we're chilling

They too concerned about what you wearin
What kind of Benz you got, or BM
But I think this year
Since we knockin all these sucker frauds out
You might get some press
But when you talk that conciousness -
Nobody wants to listen
Word up, it's a crying shame though

Can be taught, when you're six years old

You walk around ignorant all day!
The pimp don't care, it's really your decision
Kick up that money ho!! Oh, I mean tuition

Question: Are you really all that fresh?
Answer: Yes, yes.. YES!

My manager Moe, he's down with us
Castle-D boy, he's down with us
D.J. Red Alert, he's down with us
Robocop boy, he's down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one
People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MCs
I try to tell them, ""We're all in this together!""
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue
What do you think makes up a KRS?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School
Cuz Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the Old School cuz Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
Cuz we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
Cuz even then, I'm still number one
(Verse 2)
Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
Cuz I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise cuz the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, cuz I'm still number one
Kool Moe Dee, he's down with us
Eric B. and Rakim, they're down with us
Stetsasonic, they're down with us
Dana Dane, he's down with us
Sleeping Bag Records, they're down with us
My lawyer Jay, he's down with us

Breath Control,Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop,1989.0," + 
Let me tell you bout a crew I know 
Called Boogie Down Productions and they steal the show 
With DJ Scott LaRock and KRS-One

With D-Nice you know the job is done
And I know  oh yes I know 
I know because I'm KRS-One, yo check this out


Breath control.. here's an example
I appeal, to the +Criminal Minded+
You can't find it, boy you're still blinded
Why don't you open your eyes and stop DISSIN
Get a prescription to listen
Sit in the class and ask real fast about a FRESH RAP
You're gettin left back, set back, kept back
Get back, I don't accept that material
Your rhymes are artificially flavored like cereal
I like clarity, so when you come here
Speak clear and concise and then I might give
A little slack to.. nah, wait - I take that back
If you're wack, I'll slap, FUCK THAT!
Boogie Down Productions back, simply cause we never left
The radical sounds of KRS
What a mess, to roll up and then 'fess
Wild guess huh, you thought you were the best?
But - yup yup - as it always turns out
You get burned out, your rhymes just run out
I immediately come out, BOOMIN dope and
Don't provoke, you're walkin a very thin rope
Not even rope, the word I'm lookin for is string
When I sing, I sing to try and bring
Enlightenment, yet the suckers be bitin it
Radio's fightin it, the fans be likin it
Your face I'm wipin it, cause your mouth is dirty
You're unworthy to THINK that you can serve me
You heard me?  These styles are universal
You need rehearsal, wait, first I'll
Beef up the system, rhyth, rhymin, timin, climbin
Then realizing
As producer of this dope record huh
I think it's time we break for a second
Breath control..

That's it, that's it, that's it
Break is over, back to the track
Resume attack, on the crews that are wack
We don't lack, I mean, we don't like
The played out styles when we're rockin the mic
The radical rebel at level fifteen
The amp only goes to ten, you know what I mean?
As it seems, it seems that you're doomed
Yes I'll boom and consume the WHOLE room
Not a part, not a fraction or a sum
But ALL, capital KRS-One
B-D-B-D-B-D-B-D-P
Takin MC's out constantly!
Because you're no big deal, you're no big wheel
You steal, come before me and kneel but
I'm not a king, I'm not a queen, I'm not a ace
I'm not a jack, I'm not a MC or a playboy
And I just ain't wack
I feel that you should get an understanding
You might be jamming, but KRS-One is slamming
Hypothetically, or in reality
Takin you out, is a SMALL technicality
Rhymes like these, or rhymes like THIS ONE
Comes in handy, while I diss some
Soft silly low budget sucker like yourself
I got the style you need, in my house on the shelf
Labelled, sucker boy style
I like to do it every once in a while..",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-breath-control-lyrics
Essays on BDP-ism,East Coast vs. West Coast (Jive compilation),UnKnown,"Am I supposed to stand here?
These bright lights, I'll probably get a tan here
Scott, turn up the master
So I can hear, and talk faster
I'm the Blastmaster, cos I'm blasted
I know a lot of y'all are shocked that I've lasted
But Blastmaster is a subtitle
KRS ONE is more vital
And more lethal and more vicious
As the suckers always say, ""He just dissed us!
He got a problem, yo, he's conceited""
I'm not conceited, they just couldn't beat it
Cos when I'm in a club I like to mingle
Seconds later they're playin' that single
Loud as a collision and pumped up dramatically
So the people in the place will automatically
Time it, and dance right behind it
Those that have it on tape will rewind it
It's not surprising, we rock parties
Anywhere, anyone, anybody
Some sound shoddy, like cardboard
But I'm blessed, praise the lord
You see I like to study, I like money
I like eatin' wheat bread with honey
But to none of these am I addicted
I like to remain free and unafflicted
With the sickness of attachment
The material road of entrapment
Those that walk this road become weak
They can't think, they can't speak
Unself-sufficient, cos they're leeching
I'm not dissin', I'm simply teachin'
Well if you notice, not once
Have I said Scott's name to gain fame
See it's a shame that they're blinded
If they had a piece of paper I'd sign it
That's called an autograph, this is called a class
I've only come to educate the mass
Of young people, to this there's no sequel
Just a message, be peaceful
And loving, but not a sucker
And stay away from negative motherfuckers
They only pull you down with their hate
But wait, here's somethin' to meditate...

Downratin' statements you always seem to make
You never wanna create cos b-boys you don't affiliate
You're self-whipped cos you claim it's not a gift
To execute the rhyme on time without a shift
You only utter negativity, never productivity
For the b-boy talent or b-boy productivity
Yet when all the currency comes in tax free
You wanna see me? My name is Kris and now you guessed this
I got X-ray vision and I'm lookin' through your game
It's the same, what a shame, now take aim on what I shall obtain
Absolute respect from you, con, cos now you know it
I'm Blastmaster KRS ONE, short for poet
I do not read the paper, I read the dictionary
Cos nuclear destruction, yeah, AIDS just doesn't scare me
The girls be lookin' sweeter, the cops be lookin' meaner
Carryin' bigger gun, shoot the people for fun
If you could realise this you won't be called a toy
But yet a b-boy, and I know you'll enjoy
Just coolin' out without a doubt, l ivin' life a little different
Yeah, different, never innocent, with a little dilligence
I am only 20, yet here's my present level
Just one of the Boogie Down Production crew rebels
Our reputation grows as the music gets vicious
I will succeed while you suckers make wishes
Time and time again I prove to be exciting
But time and time again you prove to be biting
I need no judge, no jury, no lawyers

Who are the Pimps?,Sex and Violence,1992.0,"Stick up!!!
All gwan put your hands up in de air
And turn around with your face to the ground
Stick up!!!

Here we go
Who are the pimps? Who are the pimps?
Wimps, sitting behind a desk
You only get a glimpse of the action or reaction
When you don't respond to them TAXING
You fuck a lot when you're tax exempt
Like with the church, the rules were somehow bent
The more money you make, the more money you can have
You lose your mind after a while trying to just
Grab and grab and grab and grab and grab
Until the pimps roll around real mad, what they say?
""Pick up that money ho!""
You done all the work, but now a part of the show
You're a ho, you pimped all around real fresh
Got letters on they chest spelling I, R, S
And they be taxing, asking, sitting back relaxing
Pimping asian, european, blacks and chicano
Hah hah! But they can't pimp a wino
Why? Because a wino don't want nuttin
It's when you try to get ahead they start frontin
Capitalism -- the system of pimps and hoes
I'm sorry that's the way it goes
In this particular system everyone's a slave
Racist is how they want us to behave
White Johnny, be fighting black Michael
Both are blind to the system's sick cycle
In a circle psychotically they slay each other
With a grin, because of color of a skin

Pick up that money, ho!
Pick up that money, ho!
Pick up that money, ho!

Now we don't want to get you all alarmed
A little education never did you no harm
When Africa's free the African will be free
Capitalism says we're ALL in slavery
They're not looking at the color of a human brother
April 15th they're looking at your mother!
""Pick up that money ho!""
You work all week, and now your money has to go
To a pimp, and it's you that limp
They cut your check and take a tenth
Don't wanna hear no lip, about support of family
Cause on a piece of paper that's a fantasy
They don't care if you're in a bad mood
Your wife needs shoes, your kids need food
Uh-uh, pick up that money honey
The pimps so serious they're funny!
They'll look you straight into your face
And tell you that your money's going to a good place
Like Social Security or Welfare
But if you go to the Bahamas you'll see them all there

Pick up that money, ho!
Pick up that money, ho!
Pick up that money, ho!
Pick up that money, ho!",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-who-are-the-pimps-lyrics

Ghetto music

Ghetto music
Ghetto music..
.. You're tuned into that easy listening sound
With a cap and gown, not a CROWN
No glitter, no makeup
Just smashin lyrics, that make up
The B, D, and the P
You pay for the hits, the advice is free
In this industry, we gotta grow
Commercial some go, but, y'know
Just as important as they are
So is the underground superstar (like me)
You gotta ask yourself one question
Do I speak facts, or do I start guessin?
Learn the lesson, before you plan your career
Commercial or underground, where
Do you fit, cause BOTH sides write hits
And all is rap, I'll admit
But what I've come to EXPLAIN
Is that these people LOVE to play a game
They wanna make it seem like YOU'RE WRONG
For writin the reality song
(Don't touch those issues, don't talk about dat
We don't take knowledge rap)
What?  They want you on their bases
Cause if you bring out the brown, you're racist
But if you bring out the pink, well wait, it's OK
Yeah, they won't stop it
I guess it's alright to act demonic
I guess it's alright to act demonic
But that's another chapter, in another book
I've come to show a different look
And that look is the WHOLE of rap
Not just the commercial pap
But the UNDERGROUND, that RAW ghetto sound
From which rap music was found
So you can't deny it, you cannot refuse it
I'll be rockin that GHETTO MUSIC
..
People keep tellin me, ""Kris!  You need more radio
Yeah man, that's the way to go!
You gotta be like so-and-so to go platinum,""
Then I attack em!
I rhyme for the ghetto, I teach the ghetto
I cannot let go, change up?  Heck no
In the ghetto, I stay mellow
We're in effect yo, ready, set, go
FRESH, for nineteen eighty-nine you suckers
Peace to P.E., and the Jungle Brothers
Others, have come, to master the art
They start, with heart, then fall apart
Like a dart I shoot for one target (BO BO)
Ghetto music, yeah they'll never chart it
Cause now in eighty-nine, the purpose of a rhyme
Is to strengthen and uplift the mind
Although I'll achieve and achieve and achieve
It's simple, I'll never leave
Cause every time you front for respect you LOSE it
I'll rock GHETTO MUSIC

We got to advance!
There's nothing in our lives ever happened by chance!
We got to advance!
We got to advance!
We have got to advance!

Every generation after every generation
The American nation is hit with starvation
The exploitation, the quick sensation
Can only lead your mind to destroy the creation
Creation with the mind - destruction with the knife
Can only lead this planet to this present way of life
As you analyze the words to read the situation
You find yourself well off with this useful information
Information granted but your brain goes bling
And like the lights in computers the brain now thinks
From the mind, the omnipresent, to the underpaid peasant
The brain can piece the problems from the past and present
Got celebrity three, the future unknown
Information give us 
As you plug into the senses, the knowledge of the brain
The wise of the brain represented by the vein
 down to the letter
The heart, liver, stomach, kidney, lungs, etcetera
As you put them all together systematically
You got the body composition for you and me
So party people analyze the way I walk
There's a systematic action to the way I talk
This can go for any verse 
 but it's too complex
So, what happens next as I elaborate
On the name and the crew that we create



The situation  reality
What's going on 
'Cause negative knowledge 
It's the knowledge of the fakers, wicked perpetrators
Living second lives as MC duplicators
They say  but it's all a dream
Losing  to the way things seem
You can bust these instructions with no interruption
The  function, its only destruction
 a fly reproduction
No sexy seduction to this introduction
 intellect
Jealous of the future, present and past
Pills, alcohol, cocaine and grass

It simply changes up on the way you feel
 for no one else
 ways to destroy themselves
Now what i'm tellin' you i know for a fact


The grand incredible Scott La Rock!

Every generation after every generation
All the world nation headed for annihilation
I say annihilation but I mean disintegration
An absolute wipe-off from the face of every nation
If you comprehend, you're allowed to ask a question
What could be the meaning of degeneration lesson
Lesson 1, lesson 2, lesson 3, lesson 4
A newly presented rap - a nuclear war
We have elevated far beyond the Rapper's Delight
So party people close your eyes and use the mind for the sight
We must understand the basic complications of life
Before the atom is split and the world is destroyed
If you're jamming to the sound, this is what I employ
To live it understand it and the knowledge of joy
This is the rhyme for the time, elevated from the mind
If you comprehend well it's a definite sign
Of the positive and negative electrical force
Of the whole world today, is on an advance course
C and O with the S H2O PO4
Can all be destroyed by a nuclear war
So to the black, white, Rican, Indian and Oriental
Muslims, Christians, Rastas, Jews, Gentiles
We've got to advance, we have got to advance
When the situation changes, we don't stand a chance
Cause every generation after every generation
We got to find ourselves in some worldwide celebration
Not with registration or a cotton plantation
But different presentation like more communication
The kids in graduation with lesser aggrivation
Will tell the other kids of this higher education
This higher education, which is really observation
Or more self-realization which will lead to relaxation
Not evacuation for fear of bomb mutation
Or packing helpless families send some army transportation
This army transportation has sent abbreviation
U.S.A., which means U Start Annihilation
I seem to read the phrase while I'm in this transportation
And those who think of war need to practice masturbation
I mean what I say cause I say what I mean
So listen to my voice, yes we have a choice

Because we got to advance!
We got to advance!
There's nothing in our lives ever happened by chance!
We got to advance!
We got to advance!
We have got to advance!

Because we got to advance!
We got to advance!
There's nothing in our lives ever happened by chance!

How Not to Get Jerked,Sex and Violence,1992.0,"""And now, a word from our sponsor..""

Now technically speakin I ain't 'sposed to be doin this
Like givin information to the ones that are new to this
You wanna make a record and get into the business?
Here's a little plan from a six-year witness
First you gotta understand the music game
It's not about fame, it's about a rich name
And who you're down with, and who you clown with
But most of all, you got to have a gift (""it's like that"")
Either music or the fresh lyrics
Or a vibe; people like to buy your spirit
Everybody knows KRS-One is dope
To really see it, you gotta use a telescope, hah!
There's no hope when you're shoppin for a deal
Either sex appeal, or the hard street feel
But if you don't have a lawyer you're a GONER
Don't even think about chillin in a sauna
You need a lawyer, and a good manager
Without this, the record companies won't be havin ya
So I'm grabbin ya now and showin ya how
Not to get jerked when you do hard work!
""It's like that y'all"" *16X*
""Jump on it!"" *4X*
""One, two, three, WHOO!""

Yo, there's more to it, but let's get through it
Many MC's reached the top and then BLEW it
You say, ""I knew it, that last jam was wack""
Either you're strung out on crack, or you don't wanna
Be black anymore, or, you don't wanna rap anymore
Or, you do a wack tour, or, you get in trouble with the law
Or, your fans you ignore, or, you get punched in the jaw
Cause, you're not hardcore!
What makes a jam isn't luck or fate
It's writin the jams that the people can relate to
Or else they'll HATE you
The public will mark you down as a fake crew
You don't need allathat
Just rap from the heart and you'll have a good start
But a lot of MC's want girls
And wanna live on top of the world
In the jam they wanna flirt
Here's how not to get jerked when you do hard work!
""It's like that y'all"" *16X*
""Jump on it!"" *4X*

Now understand, rap is rebellious music
Therefore, only the rebel should use it
But pop artists abuse it
When the audience hears real rap, they boo it
See rap music is a culture
And everyone outside that culture is a vulture
The vulture makes money on the culture
Understand, I ain't tryin to insult ya
But you're either usin rap like the devil
Or you're pushin rap to another level
So don't wait for your company's promotions staff
Promote yourself with your own cash!
But this might mean you can't buy gold
You might have to put that on hold
Cause if the artist falls, they diss him!
But if the company falls, the artist falls with them!
This ain't about a tight skirt
Here's how not to get jerked when you do hard work!

Crack that's exactly what this means
And to all the Gods in 86 who are impressed
You better sit right back and listen to this

Crack stay back, crack stay back, crack attack
I say the jumbo means dumbo
I say crack stay back, crack stay back, crack attack
I say the dime is a waste of time

Young, proud, middle class, beware yet
Crack infiltrating, it's that you can bet
Now is it politics or lack of leadership
That has a young baby selling her body for a hit
(I say the dime is a waste of time)
Why don't you wake up, girl, at your school
And get knowledge of yourself and the golden rule
Now woman don't you know you're the queen of the Earth
And your precious womb is the home of human birth
So don't sell your body for no crack or dirt
(I say the jumbo means dumbo)
You tell your mother a lie just to get high
And talk about the sneakers that you didn't buy
Just to get a fifty to get high, this new affliction
Some people say it's worst of all
There are no barriers, everyone will fall
First it was heroin from Kennedy to Luther
So now they're in the street just selling woolah woolah
(I say the jumbo means dumbo)
I'm gonna break it down to you if you don't know what I mean
I say cracks mixed with reefer taking over the scene
First it was coke, girl, now that's a brand new thing
Now let's pray to God and let's pray to God
And let's pray to God you don't get addicted to this scene
(I say the jumbo means dumbo)

So what do we say now my young people
What should we do
I say crack stay back, jumbo is a dumbo
And a dime is a waste of time
Young, proud, middle class, beware yet
Cause crack's an infiltration, you can bet
Is it politics or a lack of leadership
Who really knows
But after a blast of this stuff your soul, mind and body goes
Crack stay back, jumbo means dumbo, a dime is a waste of time
Even the upper class you must watch your set
With this stuff you'll lose all your gains, you may even lose your jet
First they gave us heron, they called it Boy
From Malcolm, John F Kennedy, right through Martin Luther King
But now it's cocaine in crack form, hey it's the same old thing
This new affliction's powerful, y'all, some say it is worst of all
There are no barriers this time, with crack everyone will fall
So what do you say now my young people
Black, white, hispanic alike, what do you say now
I say stay back with your crack
I'm no dumbo, keep your jumbo
I value my time, don't want to buy your silly dime
Cracks are the devil in a white disguise
Once you use them you are sure to die
I'm the brother who on TV said

Poisonous Product,UnKnown,1992.0,"Haha, you know, the real funny fuckin' world we live in. It was just yesterday, that we were takin' the rock'n'roll from the blacks. And now today in the ninetys when they use samples of rock'n'roll we're suing their asses
You gotta love it, hahaha!
So take it slow amigo... feeling ??? and laid back low
Make it sweet
Make it sweet
Now
Back off, crack off, slack off, act off your instinct
And think in a wink, or blink, I'll make your body shrink
I use ink and memory, my record companies selling me
My fans be telling me I'm the greatest
You hate this, rigid, metaphysical, criminal minded poet
Don't blow it, if it's lost, I'll show it
If its torn, I'll sew it
It's kinda off beat yeah I know it
The styles I originate, I don't wait for fate
I practice love not hate
But MCs get ache, because they wait and hesitate on the act
But always can debate on that trivial fact
This is KRS and I'm black!
Same color as the brothers in Iraq
War is wack, especially when you die in vain
Bush invaded Panama, how can you really place blame on Hussein?
Regardless of the name
The insane economic game has got to change
Like a range rover over the plains
I come equipped to rip shit
Not ignorant, intelligent - artistic -
Inquisitive - poisitive and negative
The sedative is the poetry I give
How yah live KRS is in the house!
Word up! And you don't stop...
So take it slow amigo... feeling ??? and laid back low
Make it sweet
Make it sweet
Now
The poisonous product (is) pimped out to poor people
Penetrates pieces of their thinking equal
It comes in peaceful thru the ""TELL-LIE-VISION""
Distorts your vision now the lies got you wishin' thru transmission
You wanna be a better Christitan
You wake up sunday mornin' to watch ""TELL-LIE-VISION""
Mission - Christians be sayin ""Accept Jesus in your life""
Christianaty was founded 400 years after Christ
What do you accept in your life?
Christianity or the teachings of Christ?
Make up your mind, they're not the same thing
In 1992 the blind leads the blind
Right into the ground they can't show you where god is
Because they haven't found!
First - put down the Bible and release your sins
The Bible is dead, god is alive
Within, metaphysically speaking, I'll be clearer
You wanna see god? Take a look in the mirror!
A tree is always known by its fruit
A human being can walk up right or crawl like a brute
Yeah, now who do you salute?
The barbarian teaches us to hate our roots!
Despise our culture, look for culture
In another man's existance. Resist this -
Resist this master plan...
To turn the black man into a statistic
Why? Cuz he's materialistic
He wants to make a record but thru none of the logistics
Of it - Love it or leave it alone
Blastmaster KRS is on the microphone
In the houuuuuseee...
So take it slow amigo... feeling ??? and laid back low
Make it sweet
Make it sweet

Exhibit F,Edutainment,1990.0,"When you realize you have this army, or one concept, one thought, one
Movement, one action; you have what is called a revolution.
 
But the
More we stay seperated, and the more we don't understand the concept of
The EYE, that is within all of us, then we will constantly constantly
Lose, every single battle, from day one to day forever.

This is a test
Of the Boogie Down Production
Prevention Against Sucka MC's
In the event of a real emergency
You would have been instructed
On which jams to play
And how loud to blast your radio
And now, a word from our sponsor
Verse One:
I'm from the Bronx, Blastmaster KRS-One
Provin that my job ain't done until I get some
More, no need to roar or yell
Cos I can still tell what will sell
And would have sold without yellin over a drum roll
That style is old, so unfold
Blossom, bloom, you got the room
So go ahead and consume
A new era, KRS-One comes better
Bite another lyric? Never
Cos I'm too clever, however
I own my own label
Partners with Scott LaRock, he's on the turntable
And partner Lee Smith
I'm exercising a true gift just to uplift
Hip-hop, hip-hop
My voice is like a monster
And now a word from our sponsor
Verse Two:
Two, three, four, five, sex, seven, eight, nine, ten
I gotta start this rhyme again
How many words can I find that rhyme
And still keep in mind every lyric must come out on time
Not many but I have plenty
Scott LaRock sent me just to devastate any-
One, any daughter, any son that comes my way
Hey, you got to go the other way
I represent my DJ Scott LaRock
D-Nice, the beat box
I only wear Nike's, not Adidas or Reeboks
Many people know me, yet I'm known by few
My name is KRS-One, son
Not two or three or four or five or six
The mix is on Scott LaRock and Scott LaRock is on the mix
Verse Three:
Cool like the air we breathe
Inhale, exhale, perpetrators will fail
As sure as my name is ""Blastmaster KRS""
Sit and listen to the very essence of this tale
From the days of prison I have uprisen
To my family members I'm marked down as missin
Listen, circumstances put me right in the street
With the will to survive, get paid, eat, and sleep
Some weep, or should I rather say some cry
Can't get by so later on they die
Because the strong will survive
The weak will perish
Ignorance is a poison and knowledge will nourish
I love what I got and like what I had
I'm glad, not sad, and I don't even get mad
I get even, myself and some others I believe in
Cos these others are my brothas and perfection we're achievin

"Feel The Vibe, Feel The Beat",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Check it out, check it out
There's something I must address
This crossover sugar-free rap has got to rest
It causes death, real rap tells you stand tall
Phony rap has you thinkin' you a paper doll
Cut the bullshit, let's get down to facts
Boogie Down Productions ain't no crossover act
Cause we don't rock just rap, we rock hip-hop
The original rebel attitude has come to rip shop
Without glamour and glitter, without the mic and the cord
Without BET, MTV or Billboard
I grab the mic and recite what the crowd like
Are you the ones payin' the bills? You motherfuckin' right
Therefore if you want more, I give more
And to the same people that looked out before
Cause no way if my core audience say I'm fresh
I'm gonna cross over and try to get the rest
The one-hit artist touches the mic without permission
The fresh MC stays silent first and then listens
The one-hit artist never goes to any parties
The fresh MC rocks all jams for everybody
The one-hit artist is the type to cop a plea
When you say, ""let's go battle, lyric for lyric right now on MTV!""
The one-hit artist wants rap without hip-hop
Pays no dues and expects not to get dropped
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Lately a lot of people wanna debate me
They hate me, cause KRS-ONE ain't flaky or shaky
They wanna label me like oil or Del Monte
This is Blastmaster KRS-ONE, not Gandhi
You can't jump Kris, kick Kris, or stomp Kris
So you try to say, ""Kris ain't really conscious""
You people are funny, you hear what you wanna hear
And try to make me into what you want me to be, get outta here!
I share the pure scientific extra terrific lyric
Usin' revolution as the one solution
But keep in my mind, my message might be positive
Positive I give while everyone else is kickin' negative
Everyone else is kickin' violent effects and sex
And you got the nerve to diss the KRS?
How did I become the master of the blast?
I mastered the art of blastin' an MC's ass
At this task I am the master blaster
The Blasmaster, blastin' off ass like NASA
Am I the best or the worst, that doesn't matter here
I'm gonna recite a quick verse, and then I'm outta here
You got to flip flap blip bap fast and slow
Watch me flow as I blast you a new asshole yo
Lyrics just a fro you know In the show I'm a pro ta-to blow, blow! Your style is so-so
Get better in your letterin'
Never test a veteran, you'll be screamin' like the comedian Sam Kinison
Kris is like medicine
I cut your lights off quick like Con Edison
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Don't gimme da dis, don't gimme de dat
Don't gimme the lyrical miracle back
You flip your tongue to the front, to the back
Whatever you're mumblin' is wiggety-wack
What's all this rippin' and rippin' and beggin' and beggin' and
What you really sayin'?
Nuttin' your're frontin', huntin'
Frontin' for somethin'
I come Kris-stal clear to that ass
First class, you can't last the clash
Or the outlash, or the boom-bash, ending in a crash
Find PM Dawn and ask they ass
I am the Teacha, the undisputed Teacha
I latch on to your body like a beeper beepin' reachin'
Seekin' leapin' creepin'
But at the same time teachin'
This is our corporate meeting, greeting
I use a little of this, a little of that
Some lyrical razzle dazzle when I battle
I don't haggle fresh lyrical styles I rattle
The cat'll get your tongue I'm KRS-ONE
I bring a catastrophe to an MC
But I'm not exactly done
Who wants to test the respect?
Phrase for phrase it pays to look for other ways
I'm not the lyrical average, I'm all about damage
You in my face means your manager can't manage
And since he fucked your career havin' you here
Dumb move, you see I don't lose
I don't snooze, I don't bruise
I don't hang with fools, I chat lyrics not ""oooooo's!""

Who you kiddin'? You're only tryin' to rock a party
You ain't really down to shoot nobody
So why you frontin'? Sayin' from the cops you be runnin'
In jail in a pair of panties you look just stunning
You pop all that wannabe shit on vinyl
Until your ass is bein' pumped by some faggot named Lionel
In jail you ain't got respect
You a fairy, I'll be takin' your commissary
And the picture of your sister, mister
As seamy as Pee-Wee Herman, I ain't trying to diss her
This ain't no bullshit game and I ain't changed
I'm just thinkin' long range
People died so I can rhyme
You think I'm gonna grab the mic and waste my nation's time?
Step up with that weak shit
You're psychologically, historically, and spiritually sick
Plus you're on my dick
Changin' the subject, your rhyme style ain't correct
You know my fuckin' name!
Blastmaster KRS is thinking long range!
Yeah we in there, yeah yeah

For years they kept God hidden
Look for God in self, not in what's written
Turn this up and listen
If your slavemaster wasn't a Christian you wouldn't be a Christian
*whip cracks*
If your slavemaster wasn't a Christian you wouldn't be a Christian
*whip cracks*
If your slavemaster wasn't a Christian YOU wouldn't be a Christian!!!
*whip cracks twice*
Your whole culture's missing
Hebrews are African, see they originated Judaism
The belief in one God is monotheism, see the truth is not hard
All you gotta know is the facts
When religion mixes with politics... it ALL GETS WACK
You gotta know your history, or they'll tell you that God is a mystery
And when you're born, you're born in sin
That's bullshit. That's BULLSHIT!
They're only saying you can't win
You can't succeed, you can't acheive
Don't ask about God, just sit there and believe
Well I ain't tryin to hear that lesson
Cause one thing I know
Cause one thing I know
Cause one thing I know is that the truth can always be questioned
YEAH that's how I'm livin
Ask and ye shall be given
When you're lyin, hah hah hah, you got no answers
You got handclappers and a WHOLE lotta dancers
In the church or sanctuary
They all forgot Jesus was a revolutionary
They all forgot Jesus was a revolutionary
They all forgot Jesus was a revolutionary!!!
That hung out with criminals
I would say read the Bible but it's not the original
So it's really misleading
If you don't know the history of the author you don't know what you're reading
If you DON'T know the history of the author you don't know what you've read
You can't taste the nectar
That answers the question on why I do lectures
Cause where every MC claims to be the teacher, I be DISSIN professors
Keep that Bible on your shelf
God helps those that help themselves
Stop reading from a dead book
Stop reading from a dead book for a live God!
You know how stupid you look!
God reads the Bible with you
You both read the language of the devil that's dissing you
What can the next man do
With a Bible in his hand that you yourself can't do?
Whether Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, or Jew
Burning candles don't get you down with the universal crew
So why you dress up on Easter and worship a false Mary
That looks like Mona Lisa? Hah hah, damn you lost
On Christ-mas, what's the purpose of Santa Claus? *bells jingle*
On Christ-mas, what's the purpose of Santa Claus? *bells keep jingling*
On Christmas what's the purpose of Santa Claus!!!
Or Saint Nickalaus, I'm sick of this wickedness
All revolutionaries check this
I'm not synthetic
I'm not anti-Christian, anti-Muslim, anti-Buddhist, or anti-Semitic
But I will set it off in the temple
Cause the real holy place is mental
The real holy place is mental
The real holy place is mental *starts echoing*
The real holy place is mental *echoing a lot*
The real holy place is mental!
The real holy place is mental!!!

Riding one day on my freestyle fix
Jamming to a tape Scott La Rock had mixed
I said to myself ""This tape sound funky""
Riding past a 116th Street junkie
Thought I saw Denise but I was only assuming
Took another look and that butt was booming
Did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And I was right beside the girl, she was all on the tip
She said ""Hi, DJ KRS""
She kissed me on my neck so I gave her a peck
She said ""I'm really in a hurry so I cannot wait
If you give me a lift, while we ride we'll debate""
She jumped on my bike, I said ""Huh, what's your stop?""
She said ""Right around the corner to the crack spot
If you buy me a crack I'll know how to act
But if you don't, you might as well step back""
I said ""Now how the hell we jump off to this?
I'm doing you a favor, I'm giving you a lift""
She said ""KRS, you know it go""
I said ""Yeah, you little... it seems that you're a ho""
I did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And she was right on the ground looking after it
Because...


A girl tried to take me out one day
For a play, not your everyday trey
We walked to the spot, she says she want a rock
I looked in my pocket, didn't have a lot
I said... ""You better get yourself a job""
She tried to tell me that times were hard
I told the ho, I said ""Yo, that's not my fault
You need a vault"", I'm out to assault
Any girl I find who try to take me for mine
I'm gonna have to finish this another time
But...",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-p-is-free-original-1-lyrics

Class is in session so you can stop guessing
If this is a tape or a written down memo
See I am a professional, this is not a demo
In fact call it a lecture, a visual picture
Sort of a poetic and rhythm-like mixture
Listen, I'm not dissing but there's something that you're missing
Maybe you should touch reality, stop wishing
For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
If this meaning doesn't manifest put it to rest
I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it
It takes concentration for fresh communication
Observation, that is to see without speaking
Take off your coat, take notes, I am teaching
A class, or rather school, cause you need schooling
I am not a king or queen, I'm not ruling
This is an introduction to poetry

Yo what's up Blastmaster KRS-One, this jam is kicking
Word, yo what up D-Nice?
(Yo what's up Scott La Rock?)
Yo man we chilling just funky fresh jam
I want to tell you a little something about us
We're the Boogie Down Productions crew
And due to the fact that no-one else out there knew what time it was
We have to tell you a little story about where we we come from

South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx

Many people tell me this style is terrific
It is kinda different but let's get specific
KRS-One specialize in music
I'll only use this type of style when I choose it
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks
You got dropped off MCA 'cause the rhymes you wrote was wack
So you think that hip-hop had its start out in Queensbridge
If you pop that junk up in the Bronx you might not live
'Cause you're in

"The Bridge Is Over (Red Alert 12"" Version)",Blast Master Tapes: The Best of the B-Boy Sessions,2006.0,"I say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over, biddy-bye-bye!
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, hey, hey!
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, biddy-bye-bye!
The bridge is over, the bridge is over

You see me coming in de dance with the spliff of sensei
Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well you must see me
You can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl dem a rhyming like they gay
Picking up the mic, man, dem don't know what to say
Saying Hip Hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, man, you know dem can't live
So I tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to tell them again!
Tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to tell them
Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
Bronx keeps creating it, and Queens keeps on faking it

Di-di di-da, di-di-di, dida di-day, aiy!
All you sucker MCs, won't you please come out to play (Cause)
Here's an example of KRS-One (Bo!)
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock
Cause we don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions comes in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shante is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said “I tell you now, you ain't nothing”
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now man, I me say easy now man
To KRS-One, you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
The name of this routine is called ""Live At Union Square""
Square, square, square, ooooooooooooooooooooooo
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't know you know that he's out of touch
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking 'bout your wack Puma sneaker
Cause Bronx created hip-hop, Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking 'bout the Juice Crew funny
But you're still telling lies to me",https://genius.com/Boogie-down-productions-the-bridge-is-over-red-alert-12-version-lyrics
