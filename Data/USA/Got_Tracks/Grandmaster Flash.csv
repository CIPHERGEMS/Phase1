The Message,The Message,1982.0,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady livin' in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so, so saditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

My son said, ""Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say, 'You want some more?' Livin' on a see-saw""

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head (Say what?)
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool""
But then you wind up droppin' out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so

Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

Yo, Mel, you see that girl there?

Why is he doggin' us, man?",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-lyrics
Superappin’,The Enjoy! Story,1979.0,"It was a party night, everybody was breaking
The highs were screaming and the bass was shaking
And it won't be long till everybody knowin' that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going
And, and, and, and
Sha-na-na
Italian, Caucasian, Japanese
Spanish, Indian, Negro, Vi-et-namese
M.C's, disc jockeys
To all the fly kids and the young ladies
Introducing the crew ya got to see to believe
We're one, two, three, four, five M.C's
I'm Melle Mel and I rock it so well
And I'm Mr. Ness because I rocks the best
I'm Rahiem in all the ladies' dreams
And I'm Cowboy to make ya jump for joy
I'm Creole, solid gold
The Kid Creole playing the role
Dig this, we're the Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash
Giving you a blast and Sho'nuff class
So to prove to ya all, we're second to none
We're gonna make five M.C's sound like one
Ya gotta dip dip dive, so so socialize
Clean out your ears and then open your eyes
And then pay at the door as a donation
To hear the best sounds in creation
He's a disco dream of a mean machine
And when it comes to size, ya see what we mean
Ya see his name is not found in the hall of fame
But he'll shock and amaze and make ya feel shame
He takes a lime from a lemon
And from a lemon to a lime
He cuts the beat in half the time
And as sure is 3 times 2 is 6
You'll say Flash is the king of the quick mix
We're five M.C's and we're on our own
And we're the most well known, on the microphone
And we throw down hard and we aim to please
With finesse to impress all the young ladies
We got rhymes galore and that's a fact
And the satisfaction guaranteed to cause a heart attack
We are the best as you can see
So eliminate the possibility
That to be an e-m-c-e-e
Is not a threat to society
Say step by step
Stride by stride
I know the fly young lady would like to ride
In my Mercedes, 'young ladies'
In my Mercedes, 'young ladies'
If my Mercedes breakdown and dog my grill
I will ahh, drive up in a new Seville
If my Seville break down, I take it on back
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Cadillac
My Cadillac break down, i'm just too much
I will ahh, shock your mind in a new Star Stutz
And if a Stutz break down, I make another choice
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Rolls Royce
And if a Royce break down, I'll be out in the rain
And then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Huh, take the train
Take the train, take the train
Can't, won't, don't stop, rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I, I get down, cause I, I get down, cause I, I get down

Ladies who don't know my name
And you fellas who don't know my game
Yes I'm called the prince of soul
But others call me the Kid Creole
The M.C delight, young ladies bite
When I'm on the mike, I rock the house right
I'm the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold
Rockin to the rhythm while I'm playing the role
A cool calm customer, the master plan
It takes a sucker's man to try to jump my hand
And the things I do and what I say
Affect a lot of people in the strangest way
Makes them clap their hands and say 'all right'
Creole to the broad daylight
Mr. Ness, my mellow, what he look like
With ya on the mike

Let's a rock y'all, a let's a rock the house
Because the Furious Five are gonna turn it out
So young ladies, if you think ya heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Yes, it's true that we got the fuss
Because it can't be the best unless it came from us
There's five of us and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we coming through rough
We number one ain't nothin' you can do
And if you wanna get down we'll rock you too
So free-formin y'all, you don't stop
Come on, come on and let me see 'a rock rock
Cowboy, they say you're from the bronx
So why don't you rock the beat and add a little spunk

Yes yes, y'all, ya don't stop
Come on fly girls, I wanna hit the top
I am the c-o-w-b-o-y
Why the man so bad that ya can't deny
You better watch your woman cause I'll tell you why
Cause I'm Cowboy, I might give her a try
They call me Keith Keith
The young ladies' relief
Know as the man of romance and make you dance
Can any of you ladies stand a chance?
I'm Cowboy and I'm shockin the house
Ya say, ya say 1, 2, 1 more is 3
Ah, Melle Mel come on, whatcha got for me?

To the hip hop, a hip hop, a don't stop, don't stop that body rock
Ah, Just get up out your seat and get ready to clap
Because ah, Melle Mel is starting to rap
And ever since I talked at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself at the top of the chart
Rapping on the mic, making cold cold cash
With a jockey spinnin for me called DJ Flash
Signing autographs for the the young and old
Wearing big time silver and solid gold
My name on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on the TV screen
It's ain't like that yet, but -huh- you'll see
I got potential and you will agree
I'm coming up and I got a step above the rest
Cause I'm using that ladder they call success
You say 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
Rap like hell and make it sound like heaven
A 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 come on Rahiem come and get some

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, come on, come on, huh
I wanna hit the top
I'm a one of a kind, the man supreme
I know I'm in all, all the ladies' dreams
I'm the r-a-h and the i-e-m
I put a wiggle in your butt if a tell me when
I'm the son of a gun with the hell of a fire
Now gather, mess around i'll take ya all higher
My clientele climb the great big boost/boots
I'm the give it up and turn it loose, huh
All you fly girls that don't know my game
Come up and talk to me and we'll tell you all the same
When ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem
In all the ladies' dreams

And makin' more currency than any M.C
And if the dream will turn to reality
And Melle Mel'll be makin' money
Mr. Ness, make makin' money
Rahiem, makin' money
Cowboy , make makin' money
Creole, makin' money
DJ Flash, make makin' money
Hit it


Take your time and you will agree
That Black Door got good security
So when you walk through the door, just do me a favor
Be sure to be on your best behavior
Young man, what do you wanna do
When the party is through
And a young lady wanna go home with you
You search your pocket, ya soon aware
That you don't have enough for cab fare
Then you say to yourself what a mistake ya' made
Your heart start pumpin' that ol' Kool-Aid
When she walks to you and she starts to say
'Call one-double-o' it's down with O.J
And you pave the way....

Young ladies a like, young ladies galore, young ladies
We do adore
From the way they move and the way they smile
It make's me admire their grace and style
There is not room for disbelief
That's the only way that The Kid Creole can relieve
Or rock the house

I'm the Scorpio and I will not flow
I need 10 fly girls before I go
Now when the night is done
You come and get some
(Then you meet Mr. Ness
And you have some fun)
Till you walk up real soon
And you head for my place
And when you get in my room
You touch my face and then you start to chase
And then you grab em' by the waist
(And then I lay you right back I'm on a steady pace)

I'm the only go of the rodeo
Ya' say I ride in the rain till it's time to go
I'm the buckaroo of the boogaloo
(All the young ladies roll when he pass through)
I got 2 jazzy ladies in deep deep check
(Both ladies in the discotheque)
I got 1 in the front and 1 behind
I'm in the middle cause they're both mine

Yes yes y'all, you don't stop
Ah that body rock
From the shores of California to the streets of New York
Ain't nothing sweeter than ya walk
Cause thats the way you front
You got hair everywhere, skin so fair
A dynamic personality, (a lot of flair)
With your flashy clothes and your photogenic pose
You're as sharp as a thorn on the stem of a rose
So petite and elite you're huh, too sweet
So great I'm amazed that you can't be beat
The way you swerve your curves
It really wrecks my nerves
You're everything that a man deserves
So women of the world amen to thee
(Because women like you make men like me)

Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
Come on, come on, huh
I wanna hit the top
Young ladies out there I won't be surprised
If I catch you watchin' or starin' in my eyes
Come a little closer and you're sure to find that
I'm a helluva fella and I'm one of a kind
If you happen to stare for just about a hour
You sweet young thing you'll be in my power
Don't fight the feelin', it's nothin' you could do
Except watch your back (HUH) 'cause I'm gonna pursue
If you think that you can't contain yourself
Well put all the silly games right up on the shelf
Come here ya sexy figure, tell ya what I'm gonna do
(I got a hell of a proposition just for you)
Gonna stick the lovin' to ya, baby, later for a kiss
If you pass the chance up, you know you just missed
Beyond the shadow of a doubt, or anything you can believe
If you so deep in the forest that you can't see the trees
Creole, my mellow
It's on you so what you gonna do?

You say I rock the house because the MC's run
Place a bet with this devil, cheated for a hun'
Call any calm man, with bat or bowl
I go by the name of the Kid Creole
I'm the king of finesse, I'm here to rock the rest
All the young ladies I wanna impress
When I rap on the mic, I guarantee
A certain amount of consistency
Like Flash we'll cut the record to the bone
Creole will rock on the microphone
Mr. Ness, my mellow
Come and get some 'cause we're number one

Don't stop y'all, let me see ya rock
We gonna rock to the sounds around the clock
We gonna move to the beat but don't you dare stop
Come on everybody, stop playin' around
Because you got to get up so we can get down
Unless you too hot to trot and not ready to rock
Come on and dance give me what you got
'Cause you know by now you got to give me something
'Cause after all you sweeter than honey
Get down on your behalf
Because you gotta do it do for your calfs, Cowboy
They say you from the Bronx
So won'tchu rock and add a little spunk

Yes, yes y'all
You don't stop
A come on girl, let's hit the top
Like a .357 pointed towards your head
Cowboy just about ready for the bed
So pull back the covers and take down your pants
'Cause Cowboy will make you Patty Duke dance
A side to side and you pat ya foot
Get up out ya seat then you shake your butt
You say 1, 2, one more is 3
Melle Mel come on, whatchu got for me

You don't stop
That body rock
They say a child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
Your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps, and pushers, they're the big money makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket, peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool,"" huh, ""I'm no fool""
But you'll wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non void
Walkin' around like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, and look what you done did
Got sent up for an eight year bid
Now your manhood is took, you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Bein' used and abused, served like Hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad, song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
Say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Rap like Hell and make it sound like Heaven
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Now come on Raheem
A come and get some

Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
And let me see you rock
I'm only five-foot nine, you think I care?
I can pull a girl from anywhere
'Cause I'm bubblin' 'round, just the talk of the town
When they talk about me, they don't dare frown
I'm too hot to trot, to cold to walk, huh
To all the fly girls, I'm aimin' to talk
To all the fly girls, you got to beware
'Cause Raheim, huh, will be in yo hair
Just come over to the roast, listen to me
Because everybody knows Raheem is what it be
Melle Mel (Bang), rock the house (House)
Come on, help me turn it out
Mr. Ness (Bang), rock the house (House)
Come on, help me turn it out
Raheem, (Bang), rock the house (House)
Come on, help me turn it out
Cowboy, (Bang), rock the house (House)
Come on, help me turn it out

New York New York,Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1980,"Ah New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around, too much
Ah too many people, too much -- a ha hah
Too much, too many people, too much, rrrrrrrah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high
Built to shelter the rich and greedy
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows
Lookin down on the poor and the needy
Miles of people, marchin up the avenue
Doin what they gotta do, just to get by
I'm livin in the land of plenty and many
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, ah too many people, too much
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump""
Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street
He keeps hearin noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for women's lib

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Somethin's on my mind and I just can't shake it
I need some time, and I want some space
I gotta get away from the human race

Too much, ah too many people, too much... a-ha hah
Too much, ah too many people, too much! Rrrrrrrah!

Stand at a skyscraper reachin into heaven
When over in the ghetto I'm livin in hell
Just play ball or be an entertainer
Cause niggas like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin in a nightmare
Paranoid schitzo, set back, snowbound
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!
Hee, huh (16X) HUH!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes
I might find the strength to make another day
If I didn't have to get up, and do my thing
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin bout ice cream
Whipped cream fruits and a cherry on top
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh
The pressure is on it ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind
I don't wanna be kissin nobody's behind
Just standin on line lookin like a jerk
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash
Shoulda been thinkin and tried to fake whiplash
A crowd gathered round, they're callin me fat
Who you lookin at wit a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin for some action
Women standin on the corner sellin satisfaction
One young punk just leanin on the fence
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up
One dead punk, killed by the man

New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
Too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much! HUAHH!

A baby cries and a mother dies
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes because
In this room, on this day
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh
The gift of life really means a lot
And in the ghetto your life is all you got
So you take to the streets, tryin to exist
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch, on TV
A tells you what life is supposed to be
But when you look outside the only thing you see
Is the poverty stricken, reality, heh
Abandoned places, angry faces
Much hate and hunger throughout the races
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talkin on the phone
Doin ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone
They never took the time to tell you bout sex
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there
And the nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!""
You don't have enough money to help feed two
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was cryin, rain and hail
When you put yo' baby in the garbage pail
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid
And you tried to forget what you just did, huh
The muffled screams of a dyin baby
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy
So she ran in the rain tryin to ease the pain
Huh huh, and she drove herself insane

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Ah too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much! HUHHH!

Freedom,Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1980.0,"Somebody, a-somebody if you wanna party say party, say, ""Party""
(Party!)
Aay, ""Party""
(Party!)
A-C'mon
Heh heh, heh whoo!
Ah yeah
If you wanna party and that's a fact somebody say. ""And you know that""
(And you know that!)

We don't care if you're 8 to 10
Or if you're a senior citizen
Because we got a beat that just won't end
So you better get ready to rock my friend!
You see, we got some news
That you can use
An offer that you can't refuse
We're givin' up honey, and you got to come
Because you're the one!
Red, yellow, black, white, or brown
In our own way we can all get down
So just take your time and enjoy yourself
And you'll rock as good as anyone else
A-come on go to it, put your body into it
If the feelin' is good then you might as well do it
See it makes no sense a-just standin' around
Just boogie to the beat of the funky sound
You don't rock with us, you won't have a ball
And we might as well didn't rock at all
You see we can't rock if you don't have fun
Because you're the one that's number one
Now raise your hand up above your head
If you agree what I said
Then writhe your hands all in the air
Somebody say, ""Oh yeah""
(Oh yeah!)
Ha ha ha ha!
Flash! One time!

Melle Mel with the clientele
I'm gonna rock your chime and ring your bell
See I'm so bad and I'm so light
To write a rhyme on a dime to make the world turn twice

And I'm Mr. Ness, that rock the best
And I'm ready to rock at your request
Go on, go on with your bad self
Raheim is gonna do the rest

So my name is Raheim
I'm a son of a queen
I'm the king of my castle
Don't give me no hassle
Young ladies in the place, put me on
When I'm a part of your life, you can never go wrong

You say at first my name was Denny Den
The secret weapon, the master plan
I'm slick, I'm cool, I'm solid gold
They call me the Kid Creole

I'm the C.O.W.B.O.Y. (why)
The man's so bad that you can't deny
And when you ask the cowboy to play
I'm Cowboy, I never ran away

Grandmaster, cut faster
Than any known, stone to the bone
Full-grown he's a one of a kind
And Flash is gonna rock your mind, huh
Flash, two times
Beep beep, you in the crew, hold it
Why don't you find somebody and...party!
I like this part
Get down
Whoo! Yeah, alright, alright
Quickly now, quickly now
The bass was in your face
The highs that make your nature rise
Young ladies in the place
Feel the highs, feel the bass
If you wanna rock till the break of dawn somebody say, ""Come on""
(Come on!)

Melle Mel, right on time
Taurus the bull is my Zodiac sign
And I'm Mr Ness and I'm ready to go
And I go by the sign of Scorpio
My name is Raheim, I don't like to fuss
My Zodiac sign is Aquarius
The Kid Creole is the name of mine
And Pisces is my Zodiac sign
And I'm Cowboy and I'm runnin' this show
My Zodiac show is uh, Virgo
And Grandmaster Flash cuts so on
His Zodiac sign is Capricorn
We gon' try somethin new
(Whatchu gon' do!?)
We gon' try somethin new
(Whatchu gon' do!?)
Now that you heard our names and signs
Put your name into this rhyme
What's your name?
(All yell names)
I say what's your name?
(All yell names)
And gon' try somethin' else
Go for yourself
And gon' try somethin' else
Go for yourself
Gon' try this game, one more time
Now this time use your Zodiac sign
What's your sign!?
(All yell signs)
I say what's your sign!?
(All yell signs)
Ha ha ha ha!
Flash! Two times!
Beep beep, you in the crew, hold it
Hey, why don't you find somebody and...party!
Oohwee oohwee
Here come the kazoos, alright!
No doubt, get down, whoo! Heh
Young ladies in the place
Bass in your face
Ha ha ha ha, ugh

The ladies' action, the coming attraction
The man with the positive reaction
The man with the style on top of the pile
Melle Mel gonna rock a long, long while
I want a Rolls Royce, I got a golden voice
Gonna rock in the mic if you give me the choice
And I rock to the beat and I got it like that
And you couldn't beat that with a baseball bat

I could play a dumb game and I won't feel ashamed
Because I got more smarts than any slick git
I'm not the butcher, the baker, or the candlestick maker
But I'm Mr. Ness the woman's taker
When I talk to some girls, the girls think I'm dumb
But that's O.k. because they all get some
I'mma tell it like this, you will never discover
That Ness is, is a lover

I'm the force that keeps you on when you tend to stray
I'm the jester of the joust so heed what I say
This advice I give to you is for you to keep
All I want you to do is just sow what I reap
I'm 100% on all the time
I'm like Earl the Pearl when I'm saying a rhyme
I could get taped on like a magical wand
I make all the ladies' dreams and my word is bond

We're sick, we're bad and powerful
We fill you with five hours full
Of the music that's proclaimed the best
In town to the funky sound
Now clap your hands, do the freak dance
Become a victim of circumstance
'Cause everybody rocks with Flash and the Five
Get down RRAH!

The butter, the bread
The bread to the butter
C'mon everybody let's rock one and another
Hey ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Nobody rocks the mic like the five of us

You say the bread to the butter and the butter to the bread
Don't be misled by what I say
You say dust to dust and ashes to ashes
'Cause no man cuts are faster than Flash's
You're the one

You don't stop and everybody hiphop
You don't stop and then find your 
Just clap your hands and get on the go
Then you rock to the beat in stereo
And if you wanna help us get on the go
Scream it out and say, ""Ho""
(Ho!)
""Ho""
(Ho!)
You don't stop
And if you wanna rock into the broad daylight
Somebody say, ""What it look like""
(What it look like!)
""What it look like""
(What it look like!)
You don't stop
I'm gonna talk about the man that's the real McCoy
No other cool brother than Keith Cowboy
I wear a eight and a half, a 29 waist
A medium shirt take a look at my face
You check out my hair and then you look in my eyes
'Cause all I'm here to do girl is make you hypnotized
Till you hip hop the shoobop doobop take a look on your arm
And check your clock
Let's do it, let's do it
You know you got to do, do it
To the beat, y'all
You don't, you better not
Don't stop that body rock

The deans of clean inside the cool school
We're the chiefs of relief
Contained by wild beasts
The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East
Hah, the boss of course
As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies' thighs
Cause all the fly guys'
Natures to rise right before their eyes
We're the Earl of the world
And the heir of flair
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine

Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl
I just want you to always be easy
And keep on shaking that thing
And I want you
Swingin it swingin it swingin

I like the fly girls that don't say no
Hey girl, grab my hand, hold on tight
Don't you worry bout a thing, Rahiem'll do you right
I'm a man that's fresh huh, a woman's pet
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get
In the history books or the picture show
It's the golden voice on your radio
I'm the rapper never printed, voice is solid gold
I'm playin the role, they call me Kid Creole
And I'm the, the Romeo of the nasty show
All the ladies in the place, to my house we go
Freaking in the den just to make you move
Cause I'm Cowboy, and I got the groove
As DJ Flash cuts so mean
That he wanna know your favorite jean
Is it Jordache? (NO!) Gloria Vanderbilt? (NO!)
Maybe it's Sassoon? (NO!) How about Sergio? (I DON'T CARE!)
Could it be Calvin Klein? (NO!) Then what is it?
Back to the bridge y'all

Keep moving and grooving and screaming and shouting
And helping us turn it out
Is everybody sayin play? (PLAY!)
Say play! (PLAY!) Well OK!
Alright, woo!

I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha!
Just let us rock, you!

Got waterbed seats in my limousine
And everytime I'm seen I got to be clean
I tour around the world to make the people dance
And here's a little message for the ladies in France
Je m'appelle, Melle Mel
Donne moi la petit mademoiselle
Donne moi cinq, donne moi six
Donne moi huit, neuf, dix
I'm seeing this girl that I just adore
I'm seeing this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess
Rahiem in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Rahiem
Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my sleeve
Only one fine lady, that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game
Well I'mma Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest
Grandmaster Flash is willing and able
He's the king of the cuts on two turntables
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band
Rocks 45's and 33's
Rocks boys, men, women, and young ladies
He can slice so precise it's almost fun
And he makes better love than a mint makes money

Super Rappin’ No.2,The Enjoy! Story,1979,"Sha-na-na
Introducin’ the crew ya' got to see to believe
We’re one, two, three, four, five MC’s
I’m Melle Mel and I rock it so well
And I’m Mr.Ness because I rocks the best
I'm Rahiem hah, in all the ladies’ dreams
And I’m Cowboy to make ya jump for joy
I’m Creole, solid gold
The Kid Creole, playin’ the role
Dig this
We’re The Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash
Givin’ you a blast and show ’nuff class
So to prove to ya all, we’re second to none
We’re gonna make five MCs sound like one
Ya gotta dip with the dive
Get so socialize
Clean out your ears
And open your eyes
And then you pay at the door, as a donation
To hear the best sounds in creation
He’s a disco dream of a mean machine
And when it comes to size, ya see what we mean
Ya see his name is not found in the hall of fame
But he’ll shock and amaze and make ya feel shame
He takes a lime from a lemon
From a lemon to a lime
He cuts the beat in half the time
And as sure as 3 times 2 is 6
You’ll say flash is the king of the quick mix
We’re five MC’s and we’re on our own
And we’re the most well known on the microphone
And we throw down hard and we aim to please
With finesse to impress all the young ladies
We got rhymes galore and that’s a fact
And the satisfaction’s guaranteed to cause a heart attack
We are the best as you can see
So eliminate the possibility
That to be an E-M-C-E-E
Is not a threat to society
I say step by step
Stride by stride
I know the fly young lady would like to ride
In my Mercedes, young lady
In my Mercedes, young lady
If my Mercedes break down and dog my grill
I will ahh, drive up in a new Seville
If my Seville break down, I take it on back
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Cadillac
My Cadillac break down, i'm just too much
I will ahh, shock your mind in a new star Stutz
And if a Stutz break down, I make another choice
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Rolls Royce
And if a Royce break down, I’ll be out in the rain
And then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Huh, take the train
Take the train, take the train
Can’t, won’t, don’t stop rockin’ to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down, cause I get down
Young ladies who don’t know my name
And you fellas who don’t know my game, huh
Yes I’m called the Prince of Soul
But others call me the Kid Creole
The MC delight, young ladies bite
When I’m on the mic I rock the house right
I’m the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold
Rockin to the rhythm while I’m playin’ the roll
A cool calm custom of the master plan
It takes a sucker’s man to try to jump my hand
And the things I do, what I say
Affect a lot of people in the strangest way
Makes them clap their hands and say ""all right""
It's Creole to the broad daylight
Mister Ness, my mellow
Come and get some, cause we’re number 1
So go on, go on with your bad self
And let Flash just do the rest
Furious Five is gonna turn it out
So young ladies if you think ya heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Well yes it’s true that we gotta fuss
Because it can’t be the best unless it came from us
There’s five of us and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we coming too rough
We number one ain’t nothin’ you can do
And if you wanna get down we’ll rock you too
So get down, get down, get down, get down
Come on Cowboy get down
Yes yes, y’all, ya don’t stop
C’mon fly girls, I wanna' hit the top
‘Cause I’m the C-O-W-B-O-Y
Why the man so bad that ya can’t deny
You better watch your woman cause I’ll tell you why
Cause I’m Cowboy, I might give her a try
They call me Keith Keith
The young ladies’ relief
Know as the man of romance to make you dance
Can any of you ladies stand a chance
I’m cowboy and I’m shockin’ the house, ya see
Ya' say 1, 2, 1 more is 3
And Melle Mel rock the mic so viciously
Ah, to the, hip hop, the hip hop, and don’t stop
Don’t stop that body rock
Just get up out your seat, and get ready to clap
Because Melle Mel just about ready to rap
And ever since I talked at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself at the top of the chart
Rappin’ on the mic, makin’ cold cold cash
With a jock spinnin’ for me called D.J. Flash
Signin’ autographs for the the young and old
Wearin’ big time silver and solid gold
My name on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on the TV screen
It ain’t like that yet, but huh you’ll see
I got potential and you will agree
I’m comin’ up and I got a step above the rest
Cause I’m using that ladder they call success
You say  1-23-45-67
Rap it like hell and make it sound like heaven
7-65-43-21 c’mon Rahiem come and get some
I said my name is Rahiem
I’m the son of a queen
I’m the king of my castle, don’t gimme no hassle
I’m a one of a kind, the man supreme
I know I’m in all of the ladies’ dreams
I’m the R-A-H and the I-E-M
I put a wiggle in your butt if ya tell me when
I’m the son of a gun with the hell of a fire
Now gather mess around i'll take ya all higher
My clientele climb the great big boost
I’m the give it up and turn it loose, huh
All you fly girls that don’t know my game
Come up and talk to me and we’ll tell ya all the same
When ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem
In all the ladies’ dreams
And makin’ more currency than any MC
This dream will turn to reality
And Melle Mel, bang, rock the house, pow
C’mon, help me turn it out

The Message (Re-Recorded),UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Standing on the front stoop, hangin out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady, livin in a bag
Eating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag
Said, she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
Was circon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got Social Security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My brothers doin' bad, stole my mothers TV
Says, she watches to much, is just not healthy
""All my children"" in the daytime, ""Dallas"" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon king kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A midrange migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My son said, ""daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed the arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park, 'cause it's crazy after the dark
Keep my hand on the gun, 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say you want some more, livin on a seesaw
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
A child is born, with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you go through
You grow in the ghetto, living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place that you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way
You'll admire all the number book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpockets, peddlers and even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, I'm no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null 'n void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stickup kid, look what you done did
Got send up for a eight year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a may tag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Being used and abused and served like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
So, don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh

Contained by wild beasts
The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East
Hah, the boss of course
As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies thighs
Cause all the fly guys
Nature's to rise right before their eyes
We're the earl of the world
And the air of flair
The duke of dare
The mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine
(Chorus)
Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl
I just want you to always be easy, and keep on shakin that thing
And I want you - swingin it swingin it swingin

And here's a little message for the ladies in France
Huh huh, je m'appelle, Melle Mel
Ah donnez-moi la magique , mademoiselle
Donnez-moi cinq, donnez-moi six
Donnez moi huit, neuf, dix
I'm seein this girl that I just adore
I'm seein this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess
Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem
Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game
Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest

You Are,The Message,1982.0,"You have been so good to me
And you're very very wonderful
Lovely and beautiful to me
To me
The start of life is what I'm after
What does it take to capture
All the things
'Cause you're very very wonderful, yes you are
Lovely and beautiful to me, to me yeah
Yes, you're very very wonderful, yes you are lord
Lovely and beautiful to me, to me

You know, a lot of people don't realize it, but
Our lord, Jesus Christ, is the father
And everyone might not do the right thing in the father's eyes
But our father's very forgiving, and he loves everyone
And in this crazy mixed-up world of ours
Where things never seem to go right
As times goes on, we will have to surpass and overcome all these things
Which are negative and unjust
And I know that we will, and so does the father
God bless you all
Lovely and beautiful, to me
Yes, you're very very wonderful
Love, to me
Love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya

U Know What Time It Is,Ba-Dop-Boom-Bang,UnKnown,"Just get off the wall, let's have a ball
The 70's are gone, it's the 80's y'all
Grab a fly girl by the hand and ask her to dance
C'mon fellas don't be shy, just take a chance
You'll never know it might lead to romance
Cause the beat is cold stompin', it'll put you in a trance
You're so hypnotized that you stop and stare
I'm steppin out of this cuase I'm not with that there!
Get on the dancefloor c'mon take a stand
All the girlies in the place wanna dance with you my man
Get on the floor and work it out if you can
Here's my ulterior motive, I mean my game plan
It doesn't hurt to flirt, just go ahead and chase the skirt
You can't help it, it's your line of work
To get women on the floor
It's you they adore, you might as well
Chorus:
You know what time it is
Hang on party people cause here we go
We're gonna cold take the party to another plateau
But in order for us to achieve a new height
We wanna hear flash cut the beat up, ain't that right
While flash is choppin the mix like an ax on wood
You gotta dance cuase the beat is finger lickin good
Throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud
And if there's anything you want to say, say it loud
I know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim
And y'all are lettin me know we're cold blowin the rim
That's right , you're being served, served with a smile
And homeboy you don't like it, we can step in the aisle
Just show no shame, you know it's only right
And if there's anything you want to get off, get it off tonight
Chorus
A simple puch of the fade, a little flex of the wrist
Flash whoopin the mix while I'm kickin the gift
Yo like a double edge razor, the boy is nice
When he cuts, give him room, or you might get sliced
He's too cold to hold, to hot to be stopped
This jam that we got is good to the last drop
Weather you like it or not, we rock
Yo since the day we emerged, have you heard
That it was all about a party and yo' this is word
This party's rated ns for no suckers allowed
That's the scoop, hear me troop
So don't you come here actin' wild
But as you know there's always one in the crowd
You wanna party, then act like you know, can you dig it
And if you came to get ill, forget it, I ain't with it

With nothin to gain except killin your brain

A businessman is caught with 24 kilos
He's out on bail, and out of jail and that's the way it goes, rrrruh!

And if you wanna know why we're on top of the pile
Cuz we got style!

The ?, the ?, and the ?
Styles not Gucci or Louis Vuitton

Creole with a few words I'd like to voice
And I ? particular choice
Got style and finesse and I'm sure you'll agree
Nobody ever never ever rhymes quite like me

Well my name is Broadway and games I don't play
For me the mystical, the magical but you're okay
The young man supreme I got savoir faire
And you can come into my world if you dare
Raheim the lady dream is my claim to fame
Strictly emphasizing I posses true game
Got style all around me like drapes on a wall
Responding to my slightest whim when I'm takin' a call

He's Larry-Love and if you have any doubt
Come try your luck and he'll take you right out
He's making the moves others never thought of
Grindin' up the floors in all the nightclubs
That want the Grandmaster Flash that everybody knows
He leaves a trail of destruction wherever he goes
Gotta style like a young jock's never seen
Don't deny you're full of envy, boy your face is turning green!

Picture us stackin' down, shit we came too far
We done paid our dues, still in the game
Why these niggas actin' like they can't feel the pain
My thoughts is deep, Suburban slang up with heat
Talk is cheap, just show me money, them big faces
Been down since RUN-DMC with big laces
Tapes, diamond nigga we bout to hit that
Hit it at the club all y'all hoes gon' bizack
Big exec checks, bitch nothin' less
And I pull on the strip with Jets, Harley nigga


I'm a street nigga, load up my heat with hollow tips
Acknowledge this, go against the grain and feel stiff rain
We big stings, stackin' our safes to capacity
Force tragedies, a thug mentality
Test my heart pumps blood
We can throw slugs or shoot the fifth, call me
I'm all for it, I don't care bounce ya fair or where ya from
We can act dumb and leave niggas backs numb
I wanna eat on some legal and shit
But I was born on some evil shit
Ridin' ways, my childhood is far from forgotten days
See moms locked away, that's why I hate cops today
So I cop the yay, lock the block, pumpin' trays
If I reach and shoot, believe that niggas lay
But I went through my trigger phase
Now I want a bigger case
Fuck dippin' jakes now we sittin' great


Yo, it's a shame how these bitches wanna know if I'm holdin' a knot
Haters on the block, gassin' us from holdin' a Glock
And I'm looney too, Big K big way
My mental states I been through breakdown airway
Bottles or rat, nigga straight sleep with the fishes
My team is vicious, holla at the baddest bitches
Know what I got, hit the crib hot cold to rock
Steamin' off the top then my soldiers box
Flip the score, plot ways to hustle on tours
See these hit the pipe, fuck up they jaw

As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies thighs
Cause all the fly guys
Nature's to rise right before their eyes
We're the Earl of the world
And the Air of flair
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine

Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl

Hey girl, grab my hand, hold on tight
Don't you worry bout a thing Raheem'll do you right

There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get
In the history books or the picture show

I'm the rapper never printed voice is solid gold
I'm playin the role, they call me Kid Creole
And I'm the, the Romeo, of the nasty show

?Ah dome mal lamate mademoiselle?
?Done wa sing, done marseis?
?Done wa rik no dees!?

I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess
Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem
Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man

Only one fine lady that you better believe

The Message- Kroesche,UnKnown,1982.0,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-kroesche-lyrics
Leave Here,On the Strength,UnKnown,"Put your clothes on, and get your feet off my couch
I think it's time that you left my house
I tried to let you know that you have a friend
But now you're actin' like you wanna move in
You have problems, nowhere to go
But now you're stayin' like you're runnin' the show
And when I come in my house all I see
Is your back in my fridge (Got the back in your fridge!)
I don't like that eatin' up the food that I brought my girl
You just messin' up both our worlds
She can't even walk around, but you're always lookin'
You was horny, you stop 
 that you just can't have, and I'm mad
So get the  back and take out the trash
And on your way out
Ay yo, I think you better stay out

So you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
'Cause this is my house
Get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here, right now

You used to be my homeboy, I'll never forget you
But when you leave let the door knob hit you
In your back side, 'cause what's fair is fair
But please take those dirty underwear
Out the bathroom, I wonder what you been drinkin'
, the smell got your whole house stinkin'
I shoulda never let you get in here
Like Richard Pryor says, it smells like shit in here, word
Your underarms had a bad day and
Look like your Right Guard, all went the wrong way
Don't , don't need no deodorant
So drop the soap, 
You talk all the time, say rhymes 
The sneakers piled up, lookin' like a pyramid
Your girl stinks, she's just straight up jinx
She got missing teeth, like Leon Spinks
She might as well, go kiss Joe Frazier
She looks like a pitbull, but her in a cage

So you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
'Cause this is my house
So get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here

You, you're in violation
Actin' like you're on vacation
In the White House, but his my house
And you're 
Watch out, homeboy, I said you got no 
A buster in my kitchen, drinkin' my 
Wearing my clothes, for you they're too small
Always on the phone, you never paid for a call
And those lies, that you can't see
Homeboy, when you're gonna leave
All mistakes been made in a field that I made it
You can not , but I can't fake it
Opportunity's knockin', you know I gotta state again
Get out of my house 'cause I just can't take it

And you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
This is my house
Get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here, right now

You got bad feet, you don't get no sex
Corns and bunions (Don't blame )
Fungus, bacteria, your exterior
Your odour is superior, even my interior
Decorator told me that you had to move out
You don't blend with the cushions, you clash with the couch
Your girl came by, with extensions in her hair
Huh, and when she left, fake hair was everywhere

My bathroom, my kitchen, even my stash
I sat down, got up, and my butt had a mustache
The day you moved in, you didn't give me a 
To top it all off, you broke my favorite lamp
You screwed up the stereo and blew the amp
The next thing you know, you was settin' up camp
You said you wasn't stay here long, you're just a liar
I came in the living room, you made a camp fire
Roastin' marshmallows, beans, and franks
You ate, you burped, and you didn't say ""thanks""

So you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
'Cause this is my house
Get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here, right now",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-leave-here-lyrics
