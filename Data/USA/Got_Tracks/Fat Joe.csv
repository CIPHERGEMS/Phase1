Whenever you're in Dubai
We have a zoo in the house
We got tigers called Tyga and Kylie
We living life!

Yeah, uh
Pulled up in the big boy drop to the big boy yacht
Too many Patek Phillipes, I make the big boys watch
Villa suites in the Fendi chateau
Now ask Big Meech what he know about Joe
I'm fly like Ye, get mines with Jay
Got every pretty bitch tryna ride my wave
Gotta have slim waist and the face Sade
Lay up in the crib and menage all day
Went from nothin' to somethin', now I'm pushin' the button
To the Wraith and the jewelry like a safe
It's a hundred on the hate, but I'm zoned on the cake
When I'm gone I'm gonna miss y'all like the gold on the Cristal
Hit Avi, told him switch dials
Green prawns in Philippe Chow
It ain't shit to me
No Drake, but the P is free
She got cake, well it's somethin' to see, right

All I know is how to keep it super clear
Good head on your shoulder, damn it's super there
When you send a text, I get so excited
Yeah, I got a new flex and I think I like it
Yeah, all I know is how to keep it super clear
Good head on your shoulder, damn it's super there

You don't believe me? Then ask your girl, keep it a hundred
All she wanted was a real nigga
I'm prayin' every day not to kill niggas
Blocka!
Everything Fendi from the lights to the sofa
Everybody fly, put Fendi on the chauffeur
So sentimental, make her cry when it's over
Biggie, ""Hypnotize,"" still feel her thighs on my shoulder
Throw money at these hoes but I don't do dances
Keep threesomes on my mind like the hat on the Chance kid, woo!
Yeah we back at the Grammy's
And this time I'm bringin' back home three for the family, right

All I know is how to keep it super clear

Word to my nigga Joe Crack, you let her hold some stacks
Yeah, before we go to the club, she wanna go to Saks
Still my pride and joy, joy, joy
I let her get the gold card, I'mma hold the black
I let her get the black card, I couldn't hold her back
Cause back in the backyard she used to hold the crack
So I cut them other hoes off like the culdesac
Huh, now what cold is that?

You gon' have to show me more

What's goin' on with me and you, is real, for sure

And I love women, so she brings them under covers, yo
Fight then we fuck again, I swear I really love her though
But you're still my pride and joy, and joy, and joy
Don't wanna be a player, help her find another Joe
Just to prove I love her, I use rubbers on my other hoes
And if she ever find out it'd be another blow
And that only me that I'mma have to hit another store (
my pride and joy

Spend another knot, hit another lot
That's how you know if you are in love or not
Bought her moms a whip on Mother's Day
Now I gotta get her the same whip her mother got
Pass the Nuvo Mach

John Blaze,Don Cartagena,1998.0,"My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence, credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a No. 2 pencil
Stabbin' students, grabbin' teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label I earned
Like that nigga said in Dead Presidents, ""Money to burn""
Queensbridge, pay homage respect, Nas is a vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes
Niggas is this and that, I'm just the best
Puttin' all violence to rest between Latin Kings and blood
Los sangres, blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish
Unite the system to fight with inner street wisdom to help teach in prison

My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try
Now you know you done fucked up, right?
Hah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
¿Qué te pasa? You ain't even in my clase
I hate an actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa, everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial, college material, insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddy do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered, I would still sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter, your shit'll shatter
I'm the kid out of Bronx that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, 'cause one verse dead 'em all

J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed

Ayy yo, my attitude is subject to change
I mess around and spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
So take heed that not only can I flow I can aim
'Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only 'cause I know that faggots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get kicked out the yard for
Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell, I soap and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get Nathan's
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin

My son cool out (What)
Don't beef, yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make 'em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass
Keep the heat in the dash
Did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out, God, stackin' up joints, rack 'em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent here to Crenshaw
Hold my words stronger than a Benz store
Relentless, the anthology consolidated with the quickness Dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect, put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolrich collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar, don't snitch
That's why broke niggas who got heart, God, sign 'em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin, don up in the line up

J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed

It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
'Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns 'til it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster
With my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lock, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parley, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed

Fat Joe vs. George (Scary Movie 3 Rap Battle),UnKnown,2003.0,"These guys can't be serious right here
Stan and Mini-Me
A.K.A. I hope he ain't
The one you fight with
Hey, yo
This nigga's mad corny
And ain't got no skills
Cause he's all right, but he's not real
Don't mean to hurt your feelings, but you'll never get a deal
Cause he's all right, but he's not real
You're a needle in a haystack
I'm the don the city slicker
Forget cows and milk your moms
Her titties give ya
That elixir
Thought he wasn't?
Bet this nigga end up having kids with his cousin
Half-retarded
My number-one fan be like
(Stammers)
That means Fat Joe's the man
You're a liar in denial
Kill your ass quicker
Than I died in ""Empire""
How dare you want to joust with me?
Looking like you dying of SARS
 or mad cow disease
You fake B-Rabbit
Out to battle me
Eight Mile's down the road
The farm's that away
“drops mic”

(Note plays)
Bitch
(Lower note plays)
Ho
(Notes playing)
Now everybody in the 202
Throw your hands in the air cause Fat Joe is screwed
Now everybody in the 202
Throw 'em up
Check it out
I'm a white boy
But my neck is red
I put Miracle Whip
On my Wonder Bread
My face is pale
Nah, I've never been in jail
Me and Buffy spend every winter at Vail
How many bitches have I slapped?
Zero, unh
And Martha Stewart happens to be my hero
I grew up on a farm and I was born with no rhythm
Dr. Phil's my uncle and I like to hang with him
I can't dance
I wear khaki pants
My middle name's Lance
My grandma's from France
So maybe I'm wack
Cause my skin ain't black
But you can't talk smack
Cause whitey just struck back

Yo, control this rap like Napoleon, half-Mongolian
Hold it, you owe me in, rock 'em like linoleum, yeah
Lex, diamonds, shinin' like you rhymin', 929in'
Titanium glass, time to play that ass
Whirlwinds of French, come movin' intense
Time to pull again, release the shell, well, make 'em yell again
So sleek, but I'ma be maxin' in suites
Countin' your paper and countin' your sheeps, hittin' your chick in Jeeps
Miraculously attack your faculty
Who wanna tackle me? You jack mack, kidnap 'em for free
What? You got heat, you better pop those

Word ...life, I'll be the infamous
Who leaves no witnesses, crack's the wickedest
Run up in your crib, blast your kids
Ain't no myth in this, shit's official
I'll pistol-whip you with my Smith & Wesson
'Cause my obsession with sendin' rappers to heaven gives me an erection
You need protection from the smooth assassin
Who really moves at action, blastin' mothafuckas
Execution fashion
Now who's the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake, smack you
Then I'll wack you with my snub .38
It doesn't take much to make me restless
Look at my face and definite lose your breath
Truck my face is Lexus
You want to test this, so really?
I'll make one call and have the whole Wu comin' on the ferry
I'm very dangerous and well-connected
I puff an L with Method
Then try to decide who's next to fill his neck slit
So respected and admired the boss, retired, you lost

You lust for a part of us, you thrust but can't touch
Plus we far from any type of fellas you can trust
Put the pressure on the mic, I biz press to your chest
Sound like sweat on my back, we're having sex, tight-ass flex
Pretty Pocahontas pussy sweet like my new TEC
Sis' got curves like a GS, 300 Lex

Sosa diamonds, Getty, Lucci, blaze it up like Bonanza
Catch me in the cut, easy G's is burnin' my gut
As I Remember my menage au trois was mired by sluts
I questionmark your heart, punctuate your fate
All your version predicates

Advisin' financial advisors on franchisin' to widen their horizons
Divisin' ideas with masterminders
Movin' on a stash with Diamonds
First we get the cash, then we laugh like mynas
Don't get me wrong I'm a funny bastard
But when it come to money, dunn, I'm not the one to laugh with
I'm after for what cash can bring me, brothers
Me and my demon lovers blast and laugh like hyenas
Back to Ringling Brothers
Believe them others you're the best
Yes, and still I'm investin' mils on a hunch over lunch
Puffin' on a Chesterfield
Who wants to test the real scandalous?
I'm at the Sands in Los Angeles
Plannin' hits with anonymous philanthropists

Choppin' niggas up and makin' sandwiches....

And I don’t even got hoes, got this Instagramer what


They hoes all on my phone, ?
She want a nigga with cash so her questionnaire, I pass
Diamonds all on my fingers
Diamonds all on my Jesus
No miles on my Beemer, never disrespect my genius
20 rooms in home, plenty room for my shone
She posing all in my mirror, sendin pics to my phone
Givenchy all on my back
Versace all in my bag
Margiellas all on my feet
Never interfere feel my cash
Fountain blue, I floss
Prostitutes don’t charge
Empire on top, I Instagram my watch
Five days on my yacht
Cash money I talk
I just instagram my shit and let them broke haters just watch",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-instagram-that-hoe-lyrics
I Won’t Tell,The Elephant in the Room,2007.0,"Baby, you can keep a secret {*laughing*} Coca
Krills mania - ayy, AYY!
Uhh, uhh

Fresh off the runway, pair of white Nikes
Phantom top-drop on that I-9-5
Pink seersucker suit, who but I
On my way to party at Carew N-Y
Now I ain't gotta tell you that them boys pop bottles
And mami's lookin like America's Top Model
She says, ""Your earring - look at that thing~!
That's even bigger than the rock on my ring""
Now she got a man, plays for the Hawks
I like c'mon ma; you know me run New York
J's in the background, put you to bed
Says he got brains so I'm lookin a-head
Then I'm lookin for bread, I gotta eat on these streets
Shit seventeen-five, 'bout to holla at G's
I'm a real nigga, real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret is the song that I sing

Baby I (I) won't (won't) tell (tell)
If you don't want me to
Cause I got a thing for you
I'll do anything for ya (girl anything for ya)
Baby I (I) won't (won't) tell (tell)
I'll never do bad to youuuuu
Cause baby you got it, and you got me
I got a thing for ya

A material girl in a material world
Venus, Serena, my cereal girls
What you know about havin dinner on a jet?
Make it back before the DJ's finished with his set
Now they call me the bird man when them doors ajar
Ghostride the whip like I'm from Oakland y'all
It's the Crack Man and he ain't got a shot in the dark
The wrist is Jacob, earring Chapard
Went to Chao for chow's out and order the same thing
Bill's so high they throw in the champagne
I'm a real nigga, real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret is the song that I sing


Grown man B.I., millionaire frames, Perrier rods
Every day a different chain nigga get ya gear up
Name another fat guy fly like me
And get you right, lay pipe all night like me
Call you Fruity Pebbles cause you got so many spa bags
Purple ones, yellow ones, sky blue, the wine bag
Hermes shiy wherever you lay your eyes at
Red card, black card, I could buy that
Louis Vuitton I'm truly the don
Christian, Lou' Vuitton, the bluish charm
I'm a real nigga, real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret is the song that I sing

And girl I'm a bad boy so I gotta do what I gotta do
Risk my life (Risk my life)
In the late night (In the late night)
Cause girl I'm a bad boy yeahhhhhh

I know at times you feel stressed out
But I'm tryin' to set you up so later I can buy you up this guest house
But for now I gotta hug the block
I know you sick of visits from undercover cops
Runnin' to the kitchen tryin to hide the box
Just give me a minute and I'm gonna flood you with rocks
I gotta wicked jump shot but let's be real
Ain't no scouts gonna give a sad nigga a deal
I gotta do what I gotta do that's whats up
What's with this new attitude you know bitch that is what's up
I'm a Bad Boy like 'Mike Lawry'
How you think you got that rainbow Louis
Not with a legal job's salary


Ma' we got you stuck off the realness
You know the infamous
You heard of us
It's your Bad Boy business men
Me and Joey Crack gettin' benjamins
Sittin' in the Vanquish, the same color as cinnamon
Ma' I'm tryin' to be your knight and shinin'
To put you in the house on the Cayman Islands
Spend your whole life with stylin'
With that light that got me
Through it all you was right behind me
And ma' I know I gotta change
But right now a nigga is dealing with alot of things
It's not the same
Girl with me you can achieve whatever
But I can't change, I'm a Bad Boy forever
 + (adlibs from Fat Joe and P. Diddy)

Now we livin up in Ja-sery
In the t.v. in the car got the game on starrin' Marbury
And your ring gotta rock the size of strawberries
Everything that you want I got it don't worry
And I know it ain't about the chips
Just my way of sayin thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And I'm reminded why everytime we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head
It's more than a crush
It's all about us
It's love and trust
Took the time out to make things right
It may seem nice
But I'm gonna be a Bad Boy for life

We do maneuvers like Super Dave

Laying mami's out like Sugar Ray
'Cause Cuban Link don't play games, miss, I flip and do some strange 
Witchu like hit you with the whips and chains, check it
I get you naked like I'm mystic 'cause this  is
Thick as a brick, raw with big  that bend it
Now let's get, physical, my jiggable pie
Let this lyrical guy scuba dive right between your thighs
I satisfy like a Snickers bar 'cause I'm the bigger bar
That'll stick you quicker than a 'spic will strip a car
My repoitoire holds a four star performance with all women
Hittin more skins than Alec Baldwin
You're fallin in love and you can't get up
Now check the cut, I stripped ya, now you can't strut, word up

Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that)

Be like 'Who is he, lookin like a grizzly?'
While your girl watch me, you're busy drink pissy
Wanna lay your love, but your love wanna kiss me, huh
I got a fly team, me and my guys gleam like high beams
Makin the killin off of fiends with pipe dreams
It might seem like I'm conceited with the C.R.E.A.M. talk
But I got the kind of green that could bribe a Supreme Court
And when we talk, the whole world listen
Turn your back to T.S. for one second and find your girl missin

Baby make me holla, take it off, I give you dolla
We can party 'til mañana ain't nobody gotta know nada
Word to Allah, give me some Mississippi massana
I'll be in the sauna, chupin' the nalga like the chupacabra
Cool it mama, you gettin too hot, bust a shot
Boo-yaa! 
Rub it up and down like my oo-wops

Bury my beef, gettin your sweet cherry every week if necessary
I'm very nasty like Nas

Pass me those cheeks and I'll bring you joy like BlackSTREET
In the backseat of my Jeep, we can chill
Or creep like TLC but don't sleep, I keep it real
What the deal mami, you wanna feel on my steel salami?
Come and try me, I'll sign my name all over your punani

Ohh mami, you comin home with me
All night in my tub drinkin Hennessey
Gettin lyed up with your thighs up, I'ma surprise her

Bumping that Kanye, you can't tell me nothing, right?

Yo, Yo, I stand alone in this cold world, could you believe that?
I've seen some good men get blown over G-packs
In the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
And live niggas get it on with the D-techs, SHIT, my life's legendary
If I wrote down all in a book it would be very scary
What you know 16 Beamers and Benzes
Rope chain down to my dick, the beef looks tremendous
Me and my niggas flip holes in bitches
Back then, when I wouldn't even pose for bitches
A-YO, 
you can ask Dapper Dan who was the man
Back in 88, every other week tricked 30 grand
Even my bitches wore Gucci and Louie
My peeps already in the crowd looking for groupies to screw me
Exit the club, about to cruise up the block now
With the taj, stay frontin' with top down
See me in that new thing with my fiancee
Ass so fat, making you say ""Muchos GRANDE""
Don't blame me, blame them, the white folk
For giving me ten mil, for possessin' the tight flow

Toke the pistol for those who appose the issue
I hope I convinced you to back up, really you acted up, believe me
I could EASILY GET YOUR ASS TOUCHED

Pull a Suge move and make you take a bucket of piss

Got the fifth stuck in your ribs, don't make me...
Splash your lungs right in front of your kids
I'm a basketcase, don't ever give this bastard space
Or I'mma have your ass erased
I'm from the Bronx amongst corrupt cops, we mothered this rap shit
But still don't get enough props
All I hear is ""Gangsta"" you ain't build like that
Don't make me have to pull a tool and really tilt your cap

You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe

Bust it, check it, watch how I wreck it
Niggas watch your back, shit is gettin hectic
I catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me
I'm so much flavor you can taste me
I'm underground like a gutter
You never catch me stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter
I'm not the man with sensitivity
The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh
I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver
I'm burnin' hot, people think I have a fever, check it
If niggas wanna front, then come with it
If you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see
I dig in my crates, I don't perpatrates
I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate
Beware like Coco, yo I'm not a slow boat
Got so much dough I vacate in Acapulco
Crazy as they come I'm not the one
We can do this with the hands, or take it to the guns
You know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow

You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe
You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe

Everybody knows Fat Joe's in town
Nuff respect for the Boogie Down
I'm livin in the Bronx on an ave called Trinity
My name rings bells within the vicinity
Peace to the money makers always plottin' mono
Together we gettin' dough, just like Lucky Luciano
People always tell me, yo, you're dope Joe
But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco
Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker
Never liked ball, so to Hell with the Rucker
Always on my own, never sweatin' nobody
Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi
I can kick it this way, I can kick it that away
I kick a funky style, from New York to Piscataway
Suckers best scram
Now in ninety-three, it's all about the Fat Man
Peace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G
Gizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Mike-ski (say what?)
My crew from Uptown
And if you mess around, then you'll catch a beat down
See, I got this in a smash
If a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked like a blunt full of hash
My style of rap is legendary
Fuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetery
And that's word to Ma Duke
I never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop
So act like you know, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow

You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe
You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe

See, I rip the mic if you put me to a test
Troop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest
Cause I'm too hot to handle
Knockin' niggas out like Livingstone Bramble
Rappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton
I won't lose weight 'cause I'm not on the run
I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper
On the DL, overlooked by C-Cipher
Never get caught, I'm on top with my game
Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train
Rappers come close, but they just can't make it
When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it
Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex
And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next
The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin' Fat
Niggas gettin' jealous cause I got a contract
But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw
You can't compare me to a cornball
And you know I kick game like a hottie
Now in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti
If you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes
You know I got the flow

You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe
You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe

Twenty-four karat gold edible ice cream
That's a thousand dollar sundae
Met her at Liv
Then I scooped her on Monday
Now that's a hundred-thousand dollar Sunday
Birkin bags with the tri-colors
That's just something I can't deny lovers
But this more than just fashion
It's like knowing without asking
Simple things like your feet rub
Rose petals on the greek tub
Sign says slippery when wet
So I dives in, no life vest

Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible
I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
That's its real
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible
I love you to pieces

Caramel skin
Hair to her waistline
Porcelain grin
Every kiss like a taste wine
I know true love takes time
If you need a heart
You can take mine
Know you're beautiful
Girl, you're beautiful
Things I'd do to you
Things I'd do for you
Cause your love's the sweetest
You're the pieces to my puzzle
I love you to pieces

Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible
I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
That's its real
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible
I love you to pieces",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-love-you-to-pieces-lyrics
Watch Out,Jealous One’s Envy,1995.0,"Yeah!!
Straight out the heroin infested streets of the Bronx
Home of corrupt cops
Where niggas get they motherfuckin wigs pushed back
Even if they don't fake jax
Fat Joe, bringin forth the illest motherfuckers
In this whole rap game
Hey yo Armageddon, let these motherfuckers know

You look, I look, you invite it, I took
I forever wearin it, you know stone cold crook
What's truth, what's lie? Who's people, who spy?
It's life and death, choose live or die
Ultimates who made em why do we even exist?
When we die is there heaven or is it total blackness?
For any touch there's a feeling
Touch and y'all felt
We can exchange shots, until our chambers melt
There's mad tension in the air (mad tension in the air)
Over one man's stare, you wanna dare, yo Crack
Eject the Tech from the glove compartment
Lay out the lead spray, and flame him up like arson
It's dangerous business
Opposites, these strangers be bendin opposites
So put your face in mine, best brace your spine
Cause opposites may attract, but they don't combine
My impact so fat, you feel your vertabrates grind
Now delayed second thoughts run through your mind
When my slugs connect, and strike your major arteries
When my fists connect, they causin major injuries
What you know Junior? You not evil

Uhh, the South Bronx is the wrong place to visit
I don't know an MC who has enough balls to diss it
Whether rain or shine, we be bustin out nines
Hey yo Punisher, hit 'em with that ill-type rhyme

Yo, I cause a bloody bath to make my buddies laugh and gig'
My nutty wrath'll live as long as I'm a nasty kid
I blast a pig and slit his throat just for Toom and L
My skills' a human' I choke & puff shell puffin boom in Hell
I doom the world like I was God and throw my gun away
Then snatch the moon out the sky, and blow the sun away
Me and my brothers play hardball
Strictly hardcore, lyrics til I'm finished breakin God's laws
My job's raw but I gotta do it - I'm feelin high then buddhaed
So you might get shot and lose a lot of fluid
The spot I blew it at an early age, ever since the curly braids
I would earn a wage with the thirty gauge
There's dirty ways to get paid if you got the balls
Just load the Glock and cause the hardest cop to drop his drawers
Don't stop or pause, let the shotty go up his butt
To finish up, punchin body blows and uppercuts

The South Bronx is the wrong place to visit
I don't know an MC who has enough balls to diss it
Whether rain or shine, we be bustin out nines
Hey yo Keith Nut, hit 'em with that ill-type rhyme

Yo, I cause damage, rap's red-handed bandit
Well I'll be god damnit, I kick ass like I'm yo' parents
Prepare for the slaughter when my brain is out of order
Got kicked out my church cause I got caught fuckin my preacher's daughter
Menace like Dennis on the M.I.C
You best run son, I'm sendin emcees up shit's creek
So don't sleep, cause I creep, on New York streets
Like I'm a big fat dick, wack emcees is ass-cheeks
Yo, I'm that nigga that'll kidnap yo' kids
Take em home, fuck em good, then send em back to you in bandages
You lose, cause I got, the ill street, and still keep
The toast close, and rep-a, resent-a, the East coast
So watch your back black, Bronx niggas don't play
If you ever fake jax, I'll slit yo' throat like O.J

Yeah, that's my motherfuckin crew
Straight out the South Bronx
The livest motherfuckin corners of the Bronx
Keepin in realer, my motherfuckin nigga Keith Nut
Armageddon the Reddin
My nigga Big Dog Punisher
Straight out the Full Eclipse Camp
All you motherfuckers know the times, yeah
Watch your motherfuckin back
Blow out the back of your domepiece

Who you gonna trust?
(Oooooh)
Yeah, you could trust me, haha

I don't care about nothing else my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Oooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
Cuz all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)

To all the ladies in our lives, you heard
Strong independent women, come on
Yea, huh

What you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
I'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I'mma speed crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more then a scene
I adore you my wife my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray I'm on it everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)


Yea how I'm supposed to start this
First and first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that


Haha
This is going out to you, you and you and you

To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and

Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times who will always...
Always be my girl

For the love of drug dealin', bricks to the ceilin'
Tits on display, relatives on payroll
Put my moms in a mansion, mink draggin' off the yay
Got lifers ready to kill when I say so
C.O's slide me cellphones
Speak Italian with my capo, Jesus medallions, extravagant
Sittin' in the Porsche like I’m Tony M
Niggas tryna X me out, shoot me off the podium
From lux tees to Rugby's, my crime syndicate
I grind in the mix, you niggas rhymed into this
Pump cracks out the wall, back at us all
In Lil' Wayne’s crib writin' crack on the wall (Crack!)
Barcelona 9’s, but these squeeze all
23 shots off a hardened man jaws
For my Chi Town niggas, Joey need a statue
'Cause Joey played the goalie when them things is kickin' at you
Shoot like paparazzi, I go Kanye crazy
Then beat a nigga blue like Beyoncé baby
Uh, lifestyle of the realest
Step on Donatella when I’m coming out the villa

This shit separate me from the pack
I’m the reason why the Hip-Hop Cops came patrollin' the block
They must’ve heard I was cookin' with rock

Respective path made, the 850 roof is black suede
Hair slicked back like Pat
Drivin' glove zipped up, speedin' tickets gettin' ripped up
Eatin' chicken, gettin' my dick sucked, it's basic
Ronny Fieg Asics
This fucking beat make me feel like I’m in the basement
These fuckin' drugs make me feel like I’m in the Matrix
With a long trench and a motherfuckin' feather earring
You better cherish before I perish
Scuba divin' off the terrace
Utilizin' my athletics
Supersize me on the lettuce, you could keep the beef
'Cause I know you’re tryna keep your teeth
I like 'em Greek with a petite physique
She make me healthy things to eat and never feed me meat
So I keep Chanel on the feet, I’m a great man
Me and Joey sit at the table, then we ate lamb
Then we shake hands

I’m not a stranger to the court of law
That’s how you got the word for the numbers you sellin'
Niggas yellin' out the window “Joe’s at it again!!”
Joe's at it-Joe’s at it-Joe’s at it again!
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Niggas yellin' out the window “Joe’s at it again!”
Said Jojo crack shit’s all the same

We got broke niggas woke niggas who want smoke niggas
I fucked with Scott Storch so you know we got coke
Niggas fake with having I'm lacing karats
Darlings in the states and Paris amazed the fabrics
I was rich when they wasn't still rich when you was
Men it is what it is I'm a habitual plug
If I said it you say I was pathological
Got shot twice a night I checked myself out the hospital
I was pumping Keith Sweat had the gun in these sweats
Talks of killing his mom's I couldn't live with regrets
Coco
Yo-oh yo-oh
So many bitches I swear I'm a dickless
Now that the bags is different to talk different
Alright here we go
Yo here we go
Yo
So many bitches I swear I'm a dickless
Now that the bags is bigger they talk different
She want the best life now so here's your wish miss
We've been shitting or some about to do Christmas
Off white colored a truck to the hood love them toys
Ain't no future and there's some good love and joy
Skin brown color on the joy
We mashed potatoes on the arms to avoid the noise
I told flex I'm a thug man I'm a die fly
Chanel forego 60 bands New York's flag
I chop the top off the Porshe when it we convert
My Cleopatra in Dubai try make me convert, I'm saying
Salam alaykom my uni country you know listen
Um
Trendsetters pristine boys niggas their ice
We woke up at the awards every rapper just like me
I inspire the bosses
Shit I've been moving white like fire in crosses
No trump intended
Made me a menace that's work on the team playing when
Zach was on Memphis
When he win for the grounds real don't tell you how
There's some other motherfucking clown will
And you could think spike for the motion pictures
A couple Jesus ain't nice that's the frozen scriptures
Team rocking I mean Remi popping Drake popping
Pick and roll caught him (M)alone and I'm Stockton
And you wonder why them niggas depress
We selling the same dope I just picture the best, is coca

Uh-huh yeah
I done survive in the Bronx amongst killers and thieves
Hustled in the cold and below zero degrees
I'd have seen shit that most probably wouldn't believe
So the second time on Flex fitting to be a breeze
Yo Flex respect to all these MCs stepping this far
The lyrical MCs please keep rapping them bars
The bar set they reach now I'm resetting that bar
Promised y'all by tomorrow I'm gonna be mentioned with God
This is me catching the charge, premeditated murder one
The cheese like my son the truth you never heard a son
Huh you heard I'm fronting, then somebody lied
You heard somebody did something to me somebody died
And if they didn't kill him, bet somebody tried
So if he's still alive then God was on somebody's side
Somebody try to defined Myse no definition
One of the best cats that'spitting that get no recognition
I repping dudes sitting in prison when 90 something didn't numbers
And 90 summers to some of our closest friends from us
Dumb us we let these retreats not much
Jay Z tried tell us don't let this shit become us
What you see that's how they want us beef and fueling
Among us chasing the fame wearing the same chains that hung us
Then they lock us up for the same cane that brung us
We got to change the game but just maintain the hunger
The aim is getting younger they're shooting at our babies now
Feminizing men, dudes moving like ladies now
They said you sound like a hater sometimes I say
Nah I tell the truth is only hate when you lying
They've been waiting to find my kind
Divine being a shining McDonald's climax by just using my mind
Cuz nah I don't touch 'em see what they did to Russell
Some of these chicks done turning rape into hustle
Now have you really been assaulted and rape mind me I love you
I swear if I was there how to shot the coward for you
But listen I'm trying to tell you that shit is a scam
They trying to divide the black women and men
So as the black man I stand right up here and I apologize
For that pain and neglect that left ya traumatize
You see when my father died I swear my mama tried
To turn me to a man I ain't fell she is qualified
That's why I went outside and I witnessed the homicides
And the drug dealers whoever was shooting we idolize
That's why I despise when the rats got idolized
You played the game of snitch technical fault you disqualified
Nigga I defied them odds and I survived
I'm 2Pac Shakur meets knowledge is modernized
They say that I provide a feeling that's undenied
Barring nobody I am the realest nigga alive
Your feelings then you died or you just dealing with pride
Yeah I know that I be spreading all bullshit and decides
For the minute that y'all decide to celebrate authenticity
Every category you have it's gonna mention me nigga
I gave him history facts bars consistently
How the hell they don't respect that it's a mystery
So fuck y'all listen they don't mean shit to me
Seeing my people revolve is my victory
Harry Belafonte well I call him Mr. B
Said I had a gift God gave that gift to me
To lead the people from bondage and out of misery
Swami speak the truth to the Reaper come and visit me
You see my mission different that's why I see shit differently
Shit you might see a success I might disagree
Chick you might be paying for sex I might get for free
I think it's lame to pay for sex but it might just be me
Maybe it's just the grease, levels and different leagues
I'm war already that's why I'm always in fatigue
Listen please, don't get it confused because
I'm elevating them switching my views and I'm uplifting my dudes
I flip quick you get shit misconstrued
And I put a nigga in the clip on the news
So you're gonna choose which one you want me this preaching the unity
Or to me that be the reason your people reading your eulogy
I know it's a contradiction understand it's two of me
It's the goons Myse from the Bronx then it's the new of me
It's the whole of me that's comfortable where the shooters be then the revolutionary newer version of Huey P
Flex can you agree that I did what I told you
I came up here and I shifted the culture they listening closer
They robbed me different they don't switch they approach up
That bullshit spitting is over now and they listened to Hova
4:44 tell me I aspire death I'm flattered but I ain't really buying that
But what I will say is that they wasn't jacking that kind of rap
Before I came up here stop me where I'm lying at
Iron sharpens iron nigga I brought the fire back
I eat a tiger I brought lions that retired back
Real going admire that but the fake going down play
Swear these squares uncomfortable around me. Why?
Cuz I proudly point out they fraudulence
Then I expose these actors to their audience
Y'all be ignorant that they don't move according to that shit that they recording and y'all still applaud it, me?
I'm reporting it live from the corners
When they do crime and get more time than Warner
You see, I'm trying to warn you it's no more honor nah
They done trading these principles for designer
Your right-hand man might kill you for some vagina
And the so called jeez get pistols to the minors
And this will y'all be trying to compare to me
From where I swear this whole industry scared of me  it's clear
This shit it's just like breathing enemies I'm guard here
You should be making a prayer to me it's rare
You'll see another rapper that's this complete
That speak like a scholar while honor like Pistol Pete
When his drama I'm the piranha trying to get the meat pause
I'm kind of like white collar mixed with street on my momma
I'm just the lead I'm not heart beat her the streets
I am the place where life and art seem to meet
See first I palm heat then I laid on Palm Beach
Now I got the world on my palm my song speak
And they stop looking they listen, they pay attention
Because they be saying the same shit I just say it different
I just paint a picture of dimensions they can't mention
Cuz they ain't bended it when they spit it it ain't convincing
The image they predict ain't the position
The image they predictable bars ain't their position
Of course everybody gonna say they was in the kitchen
But what about the block getting locked facing that prison
When either you gonna tell what you won't sit in that cell
Everybody a G before that that's when it's real
Now that's when you can tell the morals have finished still
When your back against the wall your character get revealed
So either you gon' squeal and try to make you a deal
Or you're gonna pick 12 and you lose weight on the pill
I know that and going pill to a coward or civilian
With the Gs no I just kept with a million
Tell me how does it feel you sit witnessing greatness
The doubters is sick I know that haters gonna hate this
With the real rice been waiting for me to take this game
Back from the fake so please pardon my lateness but
I was busy fighting for freedom
These kids needed food for thought I had to feed them
They needed something to follow I had the lead 'em
Men of honour was becoming this thing I had to breed them
Chicks keep calling me God all in my DMs
No disrespect but God ain't that your BM
Guess she realized your fraud
See, a queen could tell the difference between a king
And the pawn when she see him
And yup I am here my motto is copper dim
Growing up in the Bronx and my heart darker than p.m
And pool full of sharks I learned to swim
They hid their hands after they threw the rocks that I turned into gems
Nigga we turning men way before puberty shit
By age ten it wasn't nothing y'all could do to me
America have ruined me. Poverty, real hunger
Oppression, pain, same shit that may kill Manga
And they still wonder what I'm marching for
To identify allies when it's time for war
Which I'll gonna do when they declare martial law
And then the soldier with guns knocking at your door, huh?
You ain't even prepared
The revolution done starting you ain't even aware
You see the Dred Scott case takes
We can't be free and these United States cause we ain't even from here
Long as I'm breathing this air until it's even and fair
I'ma fight cuz one thing I don't believe in it's fear
I guess the reason I'm here is to maintain the balance nigga
I'm the place between peace and balance
Between screaming and silence ignorance acknowledge nigga
Just fighting off these demons is a challenge
It is the talent just keepin my composure
While you beef with me knowing I could fold you
Knowing if I told my soldier he would mow you
Down like a lawn you see is pros vs. cons
Is knowing that I'm in the right but it's still wrong
It's chess why sacrifice the knight for a pawn
Yo flex I'm gone before I leave your residence
I hope you realize this is black excellence
This is black brilliance black power resilience
The Black Panther, not to film, the real shit
This black Wall Street time to rebuild this
We need a thousand Oprah's and a thousand Will Smith's
We need celebrities of a higher pedigree
To have some integrity that one to leave a legacy
Shit I'm fighting for I'm probably ain't gonna never see
But my kids will just hope today remember me
Hope today remember he defied the odds
He played the hand he was dealt never shuffle the cards
A-1 since day one he never fuck with no frauds
He frontlined and never get you nothing but bars
Nothing but the uncut raw shit they make your nose bleed
The Bible verses the shit that niggas souls need
The OG told me it was designed to divide us brother
Cuz even in Wakanda we is fighting each other
So just imagine if we was all fighting together
We all be winning and all of our lives would be better
Good people died just so I can have a life
And that's why I give my life as a sacrifice
Good people died just so I can have a life
And that's why I gave my life as a sacrifice",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-fat-joe-and-mysonne-freestyle-on-flex-freestyle-103-lyrics

Status, motherfuckers. Eat a dick!
Now who's the underated pro, they scared to play on the radio?
Who lives the lyrics, all my real niggas already know
Flow for flow, no crew can step to us
And blow for blow, I'm pretty sure that you heard the rumors
I give tumors to niggas and comas to bitches
No one's against us, roll with the riches
And float with the fishes
The revolution has started thats why I'm undercarded
My Squad will turn to the most feared into the dearly departed
As hard as they come, they all fall like the Great Wall
Make no mistake, I take you straight to the state morgue
Swarmin informers like cops at drug corners
Feds got the bugs on us, tryin to lay the law on us
They want us in jails, with bails too high to bond, but am I the Don?
Shit, I'll be out by the morn', word bond
My game is on lock, till you bawl cop
And its never ever gonna stop

Yo, yo, I play the game with caution
Sun changes, gave power creative activities
Bring fame and fortune
Why can't you live this? All day hands on bitches
With financial ventures, enhance the riches
Gotta hold the cake, my grandmoms had dreams
But it seems I couldn't graduate or go to Drake
It hurts at nights I gots to reimburse the vice
Niggas is worse than shiest for the merchandise
My words precise, cause if not I wouldn't speak it
I rock shit everyday of the week, especially the weekends
Outside, these pretty clothes I live, but with the titty-ho
Knock a nigga out, for the shit he stole
We already degraded, me and my family the most hated
Bitch were barely both made it
See the thinly related, to everything in the street
I'm sellin coke, crack, and dope, plus swingin the heat
Chorus: Armageddon
We got drug dealers and bug niggas, who love killin
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin, just for the thrillin
We bust feelins, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin
I thought you knew you had...
Drug dealers and bug niggas, who love killin
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin, just for the thrillin
We bust feelins, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin
(And it don't stop!)

I got rubies on my Uzi's and gems on my Mack 10's
Diamonds on my nines and golden bullets just to match them
Platinum magnums with silver clips, real begets
Shit, I'm gonna milk this bitch till I'm filthy rich
Filled with chips from the floor to the ceiling
Just flossin and chillin in a Porsche full-a-women
I'm one in a million, get on the deal already
My skills are sharper than a steel Machete
Realer than the military
Killin every track I'm on, Link and Joey Crack the Don
Flippin in my Cuban Caddy, wit the hazards on

So, come on if you gon' ride with us, live niggas
Hop with us, quick to try to triple five figures

Your style is unoffic', niggas like you stay on my wanted list
Pun the prince be barking on kings like a son-of-a-bitch
Fuckin' with this is hazardous to amateur battlers
Average niggas get lost in the course of embarrassment
Of course you don't have a chance, I'm the boss and your eminence
Get tossed in the ambulance with the force of an avalanche
I'll torture your fragile ass with rhetorical paragraphs
For all of you that'll laugh at an historical aftermath
I come equipped, my tongue and lips are like a hundred clips
Look behind you, I'll blind you like when the sun eclipse
Ain't no second chances, I glance at niggas
Make 'em wet they pants
The chances are slim if twins don't swing the rest of the ransom
The best and the champion, that means I'm far beyond
Dionne read my palm, told me to get on and put my army on
Come along, follow the Don, my motto and song
Live for tomorrow, cause today's almost already gone
Lets get on, split your belly with the machete, long
Tear your arms of your shoulders, and tell you to, hold on
I know it's wrong, but it feels so right
I used to bust steel all night, but now I gotta deal, alright
Chorus *2X*

Fuck a Toe to Toe, give me a forty-four and a foe to blow
To make it more dramatic, I quote Jehovah holding the scroll
Open your skull, show you shit you ain't supposed to know
Break the world in half and spit the ocean from coast to coast
(Just to let you know) That I'm zone coasted
And play the visuals from the top of my verse back in slow-motion
Assassinate the Pope with no emotions
So why should I hesitate to crush a campaign like I wasn't votin?
My brain floatin away, above you niggas like I make time pause
Checkin my Rollie watch my diamond Roman digits
Golden riches, better hold em bitches
Cause we robbin niggas way before
The translation of Holy Scriptures
I was Armageddon before the motion picture
The last nigga to drop his verse and have the globe shiftin
My Squad's hard and far from Puritans
Robbin and killin men like we proud to be Americans

""J-J-Joe Crack returns banging""

Yeah, uh
Yo it's the Don of rap, sipping Cognac, hit you on the back
With the MAC (clack, clack) slip you into cardiac
It's the art of rap at the illest form
From a killer's point of view, who thrives off the area jealous ones
You could tell it's on from my introduction
Hibernate the junction with killing something when you was barely dumping
You ain't even nuttin to worry about
I flurried your mouth, with about thirty right in front of your house
Then I'm hurrying out in the expedition, professional hit men
The vestibule shit from the credible disses
Federals is listening to my conversations, taping all the songs I'm making
Shaking down every ounce of my congregation
John Blazing, raising the stakes, changing your fate
Tied up in my basement with a gauge in your face
Make no mistake, that's how I do my thing
Blow out a lot of brains, I'm saying it's not a game

Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Take these words home and think it through

Joe Crack taking a L and make Tone roll over in his grave, never that
T.S. shatters dreams and discourage the brave, remember that
I been busting guns since the infamous days of leather hats
Varsity sweaters with big letters black
Pushin the illest whips down fifty-fifth
Where killers riff, without havin to split Phillies and sniff
And Willies who shift jobs from Chili willing to leave you stiff
Fulfilling my biggest wish, in this illegal shit
Quarter Maris stay slugger with karats, never offered marriage
When my corpse is carried my mom'll get all my cabbage
Terror Squad is savage, draped in the finest of fabrics
Floss like it's a habit, eight shot up in my Louis baggage
You knew we knew we had you, lay half your crew in gravel
Caught you slipping with your boo and started shooting at you
Out of captivity left Relativity
Now we on the Bigger Beat, Terror Squad trilogy, what?

Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Take these words home and think it through

Triplets,Don Cartagena,1998.0,"*phone conversation*

Since day one, niggas doubted the Don
Cause I was anon, now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond
Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated
Quadriplegic any squad that wanna squabble when I'm heated
Not even God can believe it, the way we regulate
And levitate heavyweight niggas like they was featherweight
Every day I do the same thing
It's the paid game, to amputate more body parts than gangrene

Yo this a man's game, it's a shame how niggas truly mock me
But who can stop me, from breakin' niggas off like Fujiyaki?
My crew's probably the only niggas that really live the lyrics
Niggas really fear us, they must've heard we really killers
We're Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters
And army colors, Willie niggas that laundry dollars
I'm Nostradamus predictin' the future, my position is crucial
With a non-fiction obsession addiction to shoot ya

Hey yo I'm better off dead than givin' the feds the satisfaction
Subtracting my freedom have me missin' in action

A fraction of y'all, raw like Colt to the jaw
The rest of y'all, fear war, and couldn't follow out the protocol

Joe the God is like the angel of death, strangle your neck
That's why Don Cartagena's the name you respect

I'll leave a pain in your chest that'll make you question your threshold
Flex like you bench four, still ""bless you"" like a chest cold
We destined to explode, that's why I stay on flip mode
You dick rode me long enough Dunn, now you can let go

Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf, dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm deadly and there ain't no gettin' rid of me

Uh, uh, uh, yo!
Somebody hold me back, Joey Crack's about to load the gat
And blow this track to the stars like the zodiac
Hold me back this max 'n' better, out for the ass 'n' cheddar
But fast cash don't last forever

I asked the felons, if I don't stay wrapped in leathers
And hats with feathers, I got all the ostriches acting jealous
Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras
Two hundred inch Mickey Thompson's, flown back from Paris

Dat dat's the illest, these body tracks make a rap killings
Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings
My destiny was to shine,  to climb
Especially in time, with the recipe in mind
From the jump start, they ain't have to pump heart in this
I was a part of this, and marvelous stats, it wasn't hard to miss
And yo, I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue
Whose on my menu? A record deal they couldn't lend you
I had to burn my Glock and earn my spot
The time flew by, had to turn my clock
And start with a new resume, I run into that bitch named Des'ree
She ain't believe my dream was a better way
Prospect'll have to collect dough
Diallin' 905 to L-A-X with somethin' I was trying to drive
A life that's trife for what I wore in the fuckin' 
A thug in pain, I swear to my little cousin's grave

Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf, dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm deadly and there ain't no gettin' rid of me
Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf, dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm dead in the middle of little Italy

Feds on my ass now, 'bout to catch a case
I'm about that ""makin money"" I'm alergic to poor
Shit, I done made some hoes out of the girls next door

I'm probly outside the forge gettin' brain in the Porsche
What Porsche? My Porsche yeah the GT Porsche
Of course I floss like them DC boys
Shit, right at club love I fucked at least three broads
In the middle of the dancefloor such a sleazy whore
Now, headed for paradise
Carlos Bengante, jazz in the background, Harry Belafonte
Seagul in the clouds look honey im comin'
Different strokes, different folks, you guessed it, Phillip Drummond
Now I'mma fuck the pussy 'till the pussy get numb and
Roll over naked then we kush kush puffin'
This is way too easy though, I am the magnifico
Cuban is pride, but I'm much more like eazy though

The Hidden Hand,Don Cartagena,1998.0,"Yea, time to educate the youth (Speak on it God)
Cause if we won't, then who will? (True)
Terror Squad style, yo
(Speak on it God)

Yo, I was a wild adolescent, blessed with the foul essence
Messin' around with the wrong crowd, I learned my lesson
Stressin' all the things that I have not
I pray to God I get my Uncle out the crack spot
I hear mad shots, homicide come and play Matlock
But never crack the case cause the defendant's a bad cop
You feel me fam? The devil's got a plan
That's why Farrakhan formed the Million Man up in Washington
The Hidden Hand even planned this man
Have me goin' hand to hand, killin' my own clan
But now I understand and see the big picture
Fuck cryin' about the struggle, I teach you how to get richer

Shit is a hassle in this rotten apple, kids robbin' coppin' capsules
Rockin' tattoos, boppin' with ankles locked in shackles
Got the cops joggin' at you, spittin' rounds of clips, they down wit it
New clowns'll make you feel as if the Bill of Rights is counterfeit
Now it's been written that all men are equal, but then it's legal
When they beat us and treat us as if we're different people
We go for delf, fuck the cop's health
I'd rather drop shelf and let off shots until my Glock melts
Cause God dealt us a helpless hand, they made us sell this land
So the palest man could build a selfish plan
You know we can't trust the government, cause Uncle Sam is smugglin'
Drugs for us to hustle all the stuff for him
Even McGruff is in it, gettin' a percentage
Takin' advantage, punishin' just blacks and hispanics

My heart is cold as ice, so I know I'm sheist, Big Pun was the kid
That no one liked, my whole life, is one big roll of the dice
Payin' a price twice as expensive as white kids
Destined for Rikers not knowin' my existence was priceless
It's like this, my soul was lifeless, I earned stripes
Fightin the nicest in the crisis I slice 'em in half and make 'em dash
Like hyphens, invitin' any rapper to Clash With the Titan
The writing's like fighting cause rappers be biting like Tyson
I'm hypin' the crowd, keepin' 'em Loud like my label
I'm proud I'm able to lift from the bowels of the ghetto
I found me a little sanity inside a career and a family
No more wars and renderin tears to insanity
So keep the salary and tear the mic, cause I love it
There's my life, you judge it, fuck it Seis, I don't want it

I'm a Dominican, stranded in New York like Gilligan
Don't wanna get locked up in the pen' again
But here they come, the faggots and cuffs, searchin' for guns
Turnin' they ride on the side of the curb to see who runs
They authorize the beast to walk the streets holdin' heat
Four deep, we puff production, my cheek, you know my steez
Fuck the police, usin' ""probable cause"" to break laws
Behind the badge you try to cover up your racial war
I got somethin' for you boys in blue
The system poisoned you, blew your cover, now what you supposed to do?
I never let the faggot pull the trig first
It won't be no American flag over my hearse
What's worse, you know they disperse for bucks
So take caution in the streets cause our protection sucks

This dude, he had the darkest pads
Who dressed up in the heart of brash
Forever talkin' trash
How he stacked niggas to almanac
Gunshots to corner four police informants
Stood like he modeled the latest fashions, sidewalk sideshow performance
He raised to pull a graceful razor, blew his face
Four is commissary plus a pack of da-dun-da-duns laced with toothpaste
Life ain't to be gambled son, you could get trampled
By people that act more like animals than mammals high off enamel
That's what his poppa said whose locked for droppin' Ahmed
In the candy store robbery probably to get his veins fed
He ain't listen, he became a braindead cocaine head
Older Mexicans knew, they killed him eatin' bacalaitos
But hey little kids, don't follow these dopes

What? Uh-huh, yea I can dig that
They call me Prospect, I just came back from New Paltz
Had this track on pause, now I'm back on course
It's lost on the Ave, tryin' to take my life from the past
Get this legal cash, look what I done grabbed without dad
Kinda sad how he got dragged down to negativity
Only if he had one love, trust for liberty
This world would be a better place, get what it takes
In a race to racism replace the snake in 'em
Bad ones, want to spend lives and discriminate
I'm tryin' to keep this positive vibe, and from that
I generate to the top, like Puffy won't stop
I'm mature now, with one knot, from tryin' to get locked
And to the shorties on the block, tryin' to twist 40 tops
Get your act together, do some carpentry with a Black n Decker
And stop speedin' like a Kawasaki
From my life to your life I'm touchin' everybody Twinz watch me

Everything we speak is the truth
From Prospect to Munroe, here in a hot second
The whole world run know, everything we speak is the truth

Verse One: Fat Joe
Now why the sad face, jealous for fellas that's diamond laced
Tryin to find a place to recline, shine my face
Under the sun where it's warm, runnin with Pun til I'm gone
That's word is bond on my moms
That's the squad motto, got beef we call Rallo
Dame Un Trago, he go to war wit a bottle
Simple as dat, flip out the mack and cripple a cat (""take that"" 4X)
Right through your back tissue with any pistol I pack (c'mon)

Long as niggas fear us you could never entirely dissapear us

Modesty'll get nowhere, that's why I go there (yeah, yeah)
Like lettin you know where to buy the new Fat Joe gear (that's right)

You better slide or catch this homicide
Ain't no match for Joey Crack I'm blowin backs out the other side
Brothers died and mother's cried at wakes, these are The Breaks
Kurtis Blow your head off like Jake (like Jake)
So take heed and read between the lines, ain't no cheatin mines
Player haters never wanna see my shine
Up in the Range or in the Lex Coupe
Rockin a fresh suit with dress shoes, on my way to Les Boo's
Let's choose the life we rather live, on the streets stabbin kids
Or livin mad sweet in lavish cribs
Fix marriages for my kids, six karats, I'm a whiz (mm, mmm)
Exotic tokin parrots on my wrist
It ain't shit but for sex, money, and drugs
True thugs with slugs and wrap bodies in rugs
What the fuck, Joe Crack, twist your cap back
Leave your heart rate flat, once Terror Squad attacks (yea yea yea)

Three's for all the 40 brews corner crews devour
Four's for the drugs, sex, and power
I be the top dolla scala, rocking gold collars
While you trying to sip the juice, I'm taking swallows
Step into my zone and get blown, my ways are internationally known
Yeah, in case you haven't heard or read
Have an appetite for beef and get hand-fed lead
Rapid-fire echoes through your vicinity
Why you messing with this nigga from Trinity?
For every shell that fell there's a story to tell
But it's a fine line between grapevines and pines
Knahmean? There's no room for snitches and loud bitches
But it's always room for riches and deep ditches
That's how it be in this everlasting game
Declaring war on cocks, and leaving chumps slain
So maintain, and put the fronting to a rest
Or today'll be the grand opening of your chest
Success, triple beam, knahmean?

If you don't organize your words right in your sentence
Twelve gauge holes take souls and lives are lost
Who said an arm and a leg was a high cost to toss?
Things are done different in my zip code
Hollow tips implode, dum-dums explode
Now your crew is screaming like they see demons when I reload
You can't comprehend, act like you want it for clarity
I'm pushing wigs, handing out jigs like charity
You best to get your groove on or get moved on
Or play the hot steppa, and die with your shoes on
I collects ass and cash
While my crew consumes liquor and hash and keep the stash
Whether hustling or dusting we get busy with ours
T.S., T.A.T., respect for miles
The Bronx is the turf, South is the area
Bring ten, bring twenty, the more guns the merrier
Nobody's bad as me, no cops nabbing me
Front if you dare and I'll change your whole anatomy

Bronx Tale,Jealous One’s Envy,1995.0,"Music please
Yes, welcome to 
Jealous One's Envy
We'd like to thank you in advance for purchasing this product
It is a Relativity Records product, artist Fat Joe
My name is KRS-One
And of course we're gonna bring THE noise
Cause we can never be toys
[Verse 1: KRS-One & 
Fat Joe
]
Yes I am the ultimate, uttering ultimatum's for the fun of it
It appears to me you don't know who you fucking with
You can't see this with bifocals 'cause you're local
Can't hang with my vocals, better you fuck with Sonny Bono
Or Yoko Ono, but KRS oh NO NO
You might think you all that but I don't give a fuck though
I'm rolling hard like God for the squad black
Packin them poppers bitch, where that money be at?
Aiyo I be the show stopper, as I shine like gold
Other rappers dull like copper, the certified fake nigga dropper
Which borough is the thorough
I know, do you know? Let me know I'm sayin though
The coke connector, sweating leathers with reflectors
Don't get caught up in my sector
Or I'ma have to inject ya with a slab of this lyrical dope shit
Fake MCs and wannabe's best to quote this
Fat Joe the true and living will prevail
Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale
Will I fail? I doubt it
I'm the nigga catching bodies, while other niggas fantasize about it
True indeed, behind my back MCs claim they can serve me
In my face they screaming, ""We're not worthy!""
Youse a has been, actually you ain't been
I be touring while you be home taping
So what punk, you could battle in a second
Frankly the bottom line is where's your hit record?
You claim I'm jocking, claim I'm on your dick, where's your witnesses?
If I'm on your dick my name has got to be syphilis

""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru
""Up up up and away cuz I don't play clown"" - Kool G Rap
""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru
""Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down"" - Kool G Rap

As we proceed to lock it down, don't get it fucked up
We be the kings of the Boogie Down
All we do is spark izm and get cash
Torturing MCs like that warden up in Alcatraz (bo! bo! bo! bo!)
It's Fat Joe, yo you know my steelo
Get so much love, I'm payin sixteen on a kilo
Sending niggas outta town, still got control of the Boogie Down
Now how the fuck you sound? (Yeahhh)
Ain't no army that could harm me or bomb me
C'mon G, you clowns ain't got a fucking thing on me
I'm flashy like white linen (tell 'em)
Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the 9th inning
I'm down with Kris and ain't no stopping me
I'm out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me
It's 
My Philosophy
, puffing Ls in the corridor
Slapping cops like  hitting whores in my laborator'
These motherfuckers don't want it
(Word to mother Joe, these niggas don't want it!)

Mercy, you wanna serve me but you ain't worthy
My style is too curvy, what you telling me?
Bet your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and fondle your balls
With KRS-One up in your memory
I know your kind, you act like
You're Mr. John Gotti the Don, but you're just another bwotty mon
Telecro bwotty mon, how you collect
Rap magazine dating back to 
Tougher than Leather
The only reason you got such an extensive rap collection
'Cause most of your rap mags are all stuck together
Watch what you say, watch what you said
When your skull gets cracked, what you gonna say crackhead?
Your file is dead, kneel to the rap God in bed
Before I slap you way 
Back in the Days
 like Ahmad
Don't get me fed up or vexed up 'cause you'll get set up

Me I chose the life of crime since day one
13 years old, already trying to cop a gun
I never understood why my pops would beat me
No matter what I did, yo he'd still mistreat me
That's why I never listened to a thing he said
And I wasn't just mad when I used to wish him dead
Instead, me and Ma Dukes kept tight
Promised that one day everything would be alright

Nobody dies of old age, but in the hands of another guy
That's why I keeps an alibi
Giuliani wants to see a brother fry
So I maintain to keep my mind peace focused
Keep the gat near in case a nigga wanna smoke this
Times are difficult on the streets of New York
It’s kinda hard trying to hold fort and not get caught
Blue eyes is on my back with intentions of arresting me
But they won't get the best of me
Cause riches are my destiny

Hey Joey, let's just get this money
Brothas just be wilin
Hey Joey, you can't trust nobody
Brothas they been triflin

No one expected me to blow like this
What was once hand me downs
Is now the best of Antonovich
Yukon Jeeps creepin through the streets
Catching the eye of every big booty cheek freak
Dayton rims so shiny you can see your reflection
Green plush interior, under the seat
The heat for protection
Momma look at me now
Got a house in Long Isle for my spouse and my child
DL condos for first impression hoes
No more holes in my gibros
Strictly tailor-made clothes
Airwaves blasting my latest single
All up in the Mecca Club
Making Lucci while I mingle
Jingle jewels in the face of past enemies
Eat your heart out son, you never was a friend to me

Hey Joey, let's just get this money
Brothas just be wilin
Hey Joey, you can't trust nobody
Brothas they been triflin

How Did We Get Here,The Darkside Vol. 1,2005.0,"(I don't know how we made it..)
January boy, Crack..

Yo, it was all a dream, couldn't save B.I.G. and Pac
Right in broad day watch the fiends bodies drop
And at night you gotta turn your TV volume up
'Cause the cop sirens blast up and down my block
Shit ain't been the same is what you hear on my block
Bunch of old school gangstas telling tales on my block
Came home tatted tears in a plan to get paid
You put it in a pot said a prayer and it came
What can make you smile'll be the thing to bring you pain
Is what my daddy told my momma going through her labor pains
Is what my momma told me as the cops took me away
Eazy-E said ""fuck 'em"", yeah I feel the same way
Another dead body is just another homicide
But niggas trying to kill us, why we call it Darkside
The streets is, ruthless, even sold to my own blood
No love, just a youngin' trying to blow up

So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where
Came up out these streets we made it, yeah
So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where, somebody tell me, how?

Me and my niggas taking pictures trying to freeze time
Jus' some lil' niggas doing shit we can't rewind
Know what I'm saying?
Shit is real, fuck what y'all thought
Too many niggas getting killed on the ball court
They was chasing hoop dreams and I was busting sawed offs
And if your jewels gleamed, I would take 'em all off
Extend my organization, the crib swarming with agents
Moms crying, we pacing like lions in cages
Mob giants turned into some clients with cases
Some niggas made statements
Some niggas made the papers, damn
What part of the game is that?
I mean to hustle all my life, but I do love rap
They got my knees straighten, put the battery in my back
This is around the same time Calderon got clapped
He told me put my life in music, ""Joey, broaden your dreams
You can do it, look at Finesse, it ain't as hard as it seems""

So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where
Came up out these streets we made it, yeah
So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where, somebody tell me, how?

Ain't this nice I'm bigger than life
In a Jacuzzi smoking a Cohiba but this ain't a movie
Before I wasn't attractive now I pack the house with groupies
Rubbing shoulders with actors just imagine how would you be
Rocking the latest fashion, this is Juicy, all over again
2010, its like B.I.G. is living through me
Chance (?) from crack to rap, now the paper's greater
Trying to see me on that block, I'll see you haters later
I'm so high, I defy gravity, nigga fuck a star, I'm a galaxy
So out of space they can't grab at me
Feds ain't nabbing me, I'm all legit
My bankroll much thicker blame it all on the hits
I started off with bricks, now I own offices
Who would have thought I got all this from talking slick
Yeah, we went from day-breakers to tax payers
It was once all a dream, now the labels pay us

So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where
Came up out these streets we made it, yeah
So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where, somebody tell me, how?

I was supposed to be dead
I was in them streets real bad (real bad)
Dreams of houses in the hills, I was hustling just to make it real
But now I came up and I'm number one
Y'all know the story, mo' money mo' problems
In these streets live or die, and I lived, I don't know why

So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where
Came up out these streets we made it, yeah
So tell me how did we, how did we, how did we get here?
From the middle of no where, somebody tell me, how?",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-how-did-we-get-here-lyrics
Shorty Gotta Fat Ass,Represent,1993.0,"Well it's Friday night, I'm in a club with a crew just maxing
Cuties and booties and yo I'm ready for action
Cause Fat Joe doesn't go to clubs for his health
It's too many skins, so every man for himself
I got me a Sex on the Beach from the bar
I know this girl was looking at me from afar
Plus she with a crew, they all got it going on
She came over and asked me if my name was John
I said, ""Yeah, John Doe, so what's it to you?""
She said ""Sorry yo, I just thought I knew you""
She walked away dissed because I had dropped the bomb
I felt bad so I reached out and snatched her arm
I pulled her back, gave her my apologies
She accepts it, but now she starts to follow me
Watching where I'm going, seeing who I know
Once she saw the Gucci, she said ""Oh, that's Fat Joe""
I could hear the conversation, Shorty was digging me
No way she was igging me, ayo she was big on me
Throughout the night she remained in my eyesight
My man Black Caese was telling me ""Yo she's fly, right?""
No that the jam is over there's no need to front
Cause she's leaving out the club and I'm right behind her
Now we in the deli butt naked catching wreck at last
Cause shorty gotta fat ass
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a big fat...
Driving in my Five on the live side of town
One of those days I just wanna ride around
With three deep, me Diamond D, and Peep
(Who's Peep?) That's my man that be whipping the white jeeps
So bust it, I hit Fordham road in the town
Cause I'm riffing in the front fool, Luther Vandross
Never too much, and what did I see?
Honeygrip had a little too much for me
Diamond said ""Damn!"" Peep said ""I know her!""
Yeah right, whatever, I'm still pulling over
Hey mamita, Spanish I'm assuming
A Spanish caught wreck and that ass was booming
I couldn't see her face cause she wouldn't turn around
Peep is out the window staring Five-O down (Bo bo bo!)
Chill with that, cause I wanna stop and chat
Like a diplomat, yo you're fucking up my rep
She wouldn't turn around so I reached for her pelvis
She turned around, ugly hound dog, and I felt this (God damn!)
Money grip was ugly, I had to find out at last
But shorty had a fat ass
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a big fat...
No need to be ill come all out my face
But the name is Fat Joe and in love I got good taste
Big butts come a dime a dozen in New York
I couldn't help but notice when I watch you walk
You got the booming system and I don't mean sound
I want to smack it up, flip it, and rub it down
I know girls try to say I'm living foul
But you know you can't trust a big but and a smile
I'm not concerned with the niggas in your past
But straight up and down, shorty gotta fat ass
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a biiiiiig...
Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)
She got a biiiig, ha ha",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-shorty-gotta-fat-ass-lyrics

Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens
California
LaBella Puerto Rico, wherever the fuck you from
KnowhatI'msayin? Yeah

This story takes place, back in the South Bronx
Where at the age of 14 I was already knockin off punks (yeah!)
And suckers were scared to death -- every time I walked by
I hear them niggas take their last breath (ahhh..)
See I just didn't give a fuck - and if you had a sheep skin
A leather bomber, you was gettin stuck (word!)
That was the way it was
One day I went to visit my aunt, and stuck up my cuz
See shit was fucked up back then
No matter what the fuck I did I never had no ends
And my moms was on wealthfare
Aiyyo I knew I had a father, but the nigga was never there
So what the fuck was I to do
I'm sick and tired of bein the bummiest nigga out the crew
I gotta get mine, I gotta get cash
I see an old man, I'm gonna rob him with the quick-fast
Give me your motherfuckin loot, papi
I'm gonna get paid, and can't a damn thing stop me
See, I'm tired of this poor shit
And who the cops? Well they can suck my motherfuckin dick
Cause all them niggas ever do is harass
That's why I get glad when I hear somebody smoked that ass (*gunshot*)
Just to let ya know how I feel
Word em up, the fuckin shit is real
Hey yo, it's real

Aiyyo the shit is real
Aiyyo it's real
Word up, the shit is real

Now I'm sixteen and there's a brand new scene
I'm makin mad loot, gettin paid off the dope fiends (word)
Keep the shit in check, in order
And my main man Tone was fuckin everybody else's daughter
See everybody knew in town
That Joe and Tone had shit locked down
And a nigga wouldn't test me
It seems like every other day the fuckin cops arrest me (yea!)
But the shit will never stick
I make one phone call and be out like quick
Cause Uncle Dan had my back
And now niggas gettin jealous cause they know I'm livin fat
Talkin shit around the way and on the block
But never in my face, cause they knew I packed a Glock
And my crew is mad deep
A bunch of crazy Puerto Ricans, so aiyyo don't sleep (word!)
And all you bitch ass niggas know the deal
Check it out, the fuckin shit is real
Hey yo, it's real

Aiyyo it's real
The fuckin shit is real
Yeah.. aiyyo it's real

Check it out
Let me let ya know why I made this song (why?)
Brothers can't deal with the real, word is bond
I'm sick and tired of these fake ass niggas
Sayin that they catchin bodies when they never pulled a trigga
I know your style, I've seen it before
You wear an army suit, now you think you're hardcore
Drinkin on your 40's, smokin on your blunts
Can't afford a chain so you wear gold fronts, yeah
You're fakin the funk, kid
And you'll be gettin it up the ass if you ever did a fuckin bid
It's time to separate the real from the phony
The name is Fat Joe, punk, act like you know me
I come equipped with the ruff shit
Nowadays I can't believe the bull rappers come up with
And all ya bitch-ass niggas know the deal
Check it out, the fuckin shit is real
Hey yo, it's real

I bet you thought I left you hangin, Joe Crack returns bangin
With somethin brand spankin, what the fuck was y'all thinkin?
Blow out your tweeters, have dinner with world leaders
Terror Squad so much they be cats with dark caesars
Fast cars and millimeters, gold cards and Visa's
Givin nonbelievers ways to fly with Jesus
Here's my thesis, enterprise break the block to pieces
Hustler and hard pool shark like Jack Gleason
The only reason I came back was for the platinum
With raps, ten times more deadly than saccharin
MC's be actin, I think somebody needs to slap em
Run up on em attack em, and ask em what's his passion
My love is rockin shows at the highest extremity
This star from Trinity got your mom sayin she's feelin me
Who's dealin ki's, that's peace, get your cheese, pack your G's
Pump this masterpiece at the loudest degree
Chorus: Fat Joe, Armageddon (repeat 2X)
Let me find out (find out) niggas is noddin out
Take some time out (time out) you wondered my whereabouts
The truth is I never left you, I kept my promise (what?)
Don Cartagena blessed you, now pay homage

Yo fuck movin mountains, I move planets and you be Earthless
Terror Squad the worst that hurt shit, split you to verses
Joey Crack the world in half, Punisher punish em
Til they lose the hopes and dreams they had
Then Armageddon finish em
Yo I'm bout as braze as Satan, no exaggeratin
My crew is radiatin, shinin while you playa-hation
Cartagena hit em like the Red Army invasion
Operatiion lace em show em what they facin, what?
I've been down since the days of Flash
When it was fun and laughs, before hip-hop was based on cash
Let's blaze a sack and concentrate on coke inflation
You know the biggest asses in United Nations
Fuck the Federation, general population is hibernatin
But bear witness to information that'll rock this nation
I'm not God, but indeed, my mind's relatin
Better act now, before your life is wasted
Cause time is racin
Chorus 2X

Yeah, now do you hip-hop
Take Don Cartagena, as your lawfully wedded husband
Now by the power invested in me, by me
I pronounce you husband and wife

I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take

Lord forgive me for the killings in the past
All the corrupt business' and dealings that I had
All these pregnant ladies that I served up on the Ave
Have me feel like I'm Bishop when I held my first gat
They killed Tom right in front of his home
They even murked Skee in my MPV
So I dropped to my knees, why it couldn't be me?
Why you had to leave me here with all this ENVY?
Even though I got freedom I feel like I ain't free
Everybody dying trying to be something they can't be
A couple hundred million is something we'll never see
So we speeding crashing head first into a tree

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take

I paid niggas' rents, even paid niggas' bails
Gave niggas jobs so they wouldn't go to jail
Did so much dirt niggas knew I wouldn't tell
Paid for some funeral they probably went to hell
I don't owe nobody nothing man, I gave that bitch a mill
I ain't beating around the bush, I'm just speakin on what's real
I ain't talking on no bullshit man, I'm talking 'bout what's real
I ain't justifying beatings well she cheated on my nills
Cheated with his brother, goddamn this bitch ill
Probably the reason my nigga never left the will
Things you'd never know have mercy on his soul
Big Pun, one of the most realest I ever known

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take

When I die know they bury me a G
Don't cry for me just let a nigga be
In other words let your nigga rest in peace
I been going so hard and I barely got sleep
Lord, I know my mamma gunna take my passing hard
But let her know in these streets her little boy was God
Last of the Mohicans I was taking motherfuckers hearts
Many wars you can see it in the bullet scars
Lord, can you forgive me for my sins?
Let me fly with you help a nigga spread his wings
Azarya you forever be my Queen
Just know for now daddy had to go and meet the King

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-heavenly-father-lyrics

I keep my forty cal cocked cause these niggas on my block bang
Right up the street from where the cops hang
And in my head I hear Pac sang
And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man
Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die
That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'
My whole life's filled with danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys
And niggas fightin' for position
The demon has risen from out of prison

Cold, cold, world is the word that was given
As he see me fifteen with the burner out of prison
Gangster - fuck that, I'm 
GangStarr
Tell Nas hip-hop's dead now, my man's gone
As I rise to the top, knee-deep in the game I survived every shot
Back to life like 
Thriller
, back to reality
Flipped the light scoop, got everybody mad at me
Uhh, don't let nobody put the battery
Cause those things'll go 'pop pop' through your anatomy
I'm hungry nigga, I'll eat your flesh
I'm a butcher, chainsaw through your spleen and chest
There's a darkside of Texas too, word to syndicate
No matter how intricate shit gets, the hit you get
Joe Crack, yeah man on fire
Conversating with the devil, rocking diamond messiahs
Uhh, I seek the truth while the streets admire me
Killers across the world say it's me they inspire to be
Feds on my back from my ties to criminology
Can't look back now, tomorrow's never promised B
Where I'm from, for president we voted Eric B
Joe been crack way before my philosophy
Banned from TV, BET won't play me
Still we do it B.I.G., it's all Gravy
It's our reality, you call it crazy
But it's a darkside, it's what you made me
No more Mr. Nice Guy
 - pay me
What you niggas owe before I come for your babies

That nigga went double plat' on niggas
We was at the Grammy's with motherfucking fo' fifths in our waist nigga
Hahahaha!
So you know Pun passed, I had to carry on tradition nigga
Don Cartagena had to rise to the occasion
All by myself nigga!
Linked up with the R., linked up with Ashanti

You feel me? That Lean Back was number one song of the fucking decade
Check the fucking Billboard nigga! Shit!
Niggas wanna sleep on Crack
Niggas wanna front on Crack

Make it Rain, three million iTunes sold man

Hop out the motherfucking casket - brush the motherfucking dust
Off my shoulders nigga!

Boom bip, BAM, here I am
Even fans in Japan, be tellin me I'm the man
Fat Joe, a.k.a. the woman fucker
Beat you down to the ground, stomp your face with my Chucker
So niggas back up, yo I'mma set it
Fuckin with me, you won't live to regret it
I don't fake moves, I break peeps
I'm takin niggas gold chains, they cash and the Jeeps
See I don't give a fuck about a niggas rep
We can go Glock for Glock or tec for tec, sheeeeyit
I heard a motherfucker wants to turn snitch
I cut the niggas head off, and sent it to his fuckin bitch
I ain't lettin a nigga take the stand
Play Sammy the Bull, be one dead man
See suckers can't hang with the slang
And if they bring the whole gang
Well then they'll all catch a bang-bang
I come from the Bronx and not the Boogie Down
Niggas don't ever come and front in my part of town
See everybody knows my pedigree
There ain't another motherfuckers that's better than me
I could make em pump, I could make em jump
But I'm mostly known for givin other niggas lumps
So niggas better chill and maintain
I'm blowin motherfuckers out the frame
And if a nigga try to flex
Fuck around, and catch a motherfuckin suplex
I wet a motherfucker like a shower
Don't test the Puerto Rican power
Fat Joe in the year of ninety-three
Peace to Grand Pu', and my man Diamond D
So _Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down_
Yeah, but for now watch the sound
""Watch de sound when I tim-berr"" (4X)

Check it
Yo Fat Joe, it's time to fuckin flow
Niggas know the game
It's time to blow the bitch-ass niggas out the frame
Guess who comes to represent?
If you motherfuckers don't know, well here's a hint
It's the God and I still bag chicks
Make the girls feel hot, be like a faggot with the bag of dicks
So come on cause I'm comin for the basket
Say goodbye to your friends, and start headin for the casket
So Doogie make the daquiris; and light the chocolate
That you got from Willy Wonka in the Chocolate Factory
Let's squeeze a trigger for the nigga
See I flipped to the 'lo, cause I'm through with the Hilfiger
Cause I flips the flavor-loo
It's good for a fuck or two, you couldn't see this
No matter what the fuck you do
I smash that ass like a block of hash
Then I rob you for cash, you little bitch ass
""Watch de sound when I tim-berr"" (4X)

Niggas know the flav, I don't have to take a step
I earn my respect then quiet as kept
Yeah, guard your grill if you try to catch wreck
Smack the back of your neck, and take your youth corps check
I make more dough than Gregory Peck
Never have to raise a fist, I keep my stunts in check
I play a nigga out, like a Las Vegas dealer
Living in the light, just like Karen Wheeler
So back up, and take a good look, because you should look
At what a good cook, can do without a fuckin cookbook
I don't sniff coke, and I don't smoke coolies
Even Italians say I'm one cool moolie
But niggas call me JoJo
I'm quick to stick a chick, cause I kick the Willie BoBo
On the Northside, on the Southside, on the Westside
You can't budge me nigga, even the best tried
To pull a fast one, but you know what happened to the last one?
(What?) He got his motherfuckin ass done
(Yeah!) So step up, front, I'm not a bitch-ass chump
Chicks by the clicks, cause my pockets got the mumps
See I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Don't try to play yourself, cause you'll be stuck with
A motherfuckin ice pick right through the cheek
I'm leavin crab niggas, layin in the street
I won't 'fess, walk around with a vest
Knockin niggas off, cause I could care less
You want a fair one, FORGET IT
And your girlfriend, yo I let my man hit it
So save the bluff, you know you ain't tough (yeah)
I pull your card cause you're soft like fluff kid
I never ever did a bid
I punch a nigga down a Row named Skid

If you took what you got, lick a shot (Pump pump!)
When the dough is low, we go (Stick up, stick up!)
You get knocked on the block, we say (Big up, big up!)
Check the misfit, time to rip shit
Time to get with the nitwit lyrical lunatic
In the street I stay strong cause I'm armed
With a nine, what up nig? You must be out of your fucking mind
I'm much more than you expect, kid
To identify your ass they'll have to use your fucking dental records
So step up, come come, don't be bashful
I got a steel toe and you can get an assful
Cause if it's me you think you're better than
You'll need a sniffly, sneezy, coughing, stuffy head, get your ass with medicine
You can feel, shit is real, my mind can set me free
So I can continue my MC killing spree
The police, they try to keep me in the clink, yo
I got 'em ducking and bucking, so I don't think so
I bust your whole shit if you're not kind
Stomping comp? You must be out of your FUCKING mind!
""You must be out your fucking mind, man""
""I'm a kick your ass"" ""Hey you, come here"" (Repeat 2x)

Chitty chitty bang bang, I'm coming like a chain gang
From outta Sing Sing to make your motherfucking brains hang
Try to diss this, then you'll enlist for the stiffs
Snatch your bitch up at Crystal and then I fuck her with a pistol
A nigga with heart, walk through a park in the dark
Fuck the drug marks stomping me, I'll play your fucking heart, so be smart
Cut all that bullshit and clown, I'll be the only nigga laying down
When everybody else is sitting
So who's the next man to hit? I slip in a banana clip
And I hit, come and get your bandana split
Shit, fuck, bitch who's the snitch?
You may be down with Mikey and Ikey, but you're laying in a fucking ditch
With motherfucking maggots with the rest of them faggots
Cause your license to kill was from Tagget's
I warned a brother of another brother's Glock
And I said ""What's up, duck?"" And I had my motherfucking gun cocked
So be a sport, another lesson drug
Holding down the fort and a stupid-ass nigga got caught
So he made prime time cause I had the nine
Yeah, you must be out of your FUCKING mind!
""You must be out your fucking mind, man""
""I'm a kick your ass"" ""Hey you, come here"" (Repeat 2x)

Sucker back up, a real motherfucker's on stage
I shoot the gift like a motherfucking 12 guage
Niggas know I'm versatile
No question I'm buckwild, I'm killing rappers executioner style
Hanging motherfuckers with a mic cord
I'm a rap lord, suckers always get me bored
Saying that they that and this
Ayo they get me pissed, cause motherfuckers ain't jack shit
I'm here to represent the Boogie Down
Making niggas leave town before sundown
And if you don't listen, G
I'll stick a knife up your ass like ""American Me""
I'm serving motherfuckers like Wimbledon
I shock a crowd like a bottle of insulin
And niggas always get me vexed
I'm sick and tired of motherfuckers trying to sound like Das EFX
You'd better hold your own, child
Cause I'm laying suckers like rugs and tiles
This is the bigger nigga with the mad lines
You step to me? You must be out of your FUCKING mind!
""You must be out your fucking mind, man""
""I'm a kick your ass"" ""Hey you, come here"" (Repeat 2x)

Yeah, now you motherfuckers know the flav, East Coast style
Fat Joe, G. Rap, and Apache
You step to us, you must be out of your FUCKING mind!

(Nah, that must be some nondescript niggas, not nobody I run wit'?)

(Yo, fuck them niggas, word to mother!)

Yo, yo, one's for the cash, two's for my faculty
Three's for all the M-3's
Racin across the Tappan Zee
?Matchin C's? followed by the white Lincoln
Drivin like I ain't thinkin
Wit my hazard lights blinkin, let the lah sink in
On the way to home BASE
First clown in my face is gettin thrown out the place
We run shit, untouchable Don shit, that's nothin new
Sets with stone arms just to muscle you, enough of you
That had a bad case of Joe, some even had to go
Gangsta walk and nines, at times I be the last to know
We laugh and joke, while we baggin the coke
My yay done make the worst things out the cast of Different Strokes
I'm addicted to street life, although it doesn't seem right
Many criticize but yo we 
all go to eat right
?
And who's to say that I'm to blame(blame)
We only pawns in this game(game)
The streets don't grow cocaine
I don't want no cure for this, you switch
, I pour the Cris
And just, stay rich, and reminisce, while I count my chips
Chorus

Yo you scared to death, misery need company
These crab slackers, niggas actin like they mad rappers
Even wit a record deal, our guns still peal
Break a piece of your brain off, wipe the stain off
Throw the Range off, police-iano
Watch for 
hondo
, they lookin at our poster now, playin us closer now
The funds follow us, what, these bitches swallow us
And you wonder why you can't find us

Attended dinner wit millionaires, gave a million stares
Made a million scared, my peops was locked
For what seemed like a million years, yea
This illegal life I can't avoid, 
I take the feds everywhere I go
That's why I'm paranoid
, but still I choose to ignore the fact
I got the flawless Acs wit gats to get that enormous stack
Joey Crack, the Mack without the hat
And all our hoes that'll ride in the back seat of my Cadillac
I bet you hate it cuz we paid and floss, nigga we laid and lost
T.S.'ll make the baddest crews take a loss
Break your balls like Bahondo, call me Don Joe
Coke slash ready rock, niggas drop a dime dough
Booked the nine o'clock, flight to Alando
So-called killers turned snitches like 
Gravano
That nigga Gauno up in M-C, is bein' friendly
Everytime I see his wife and kids the shit tempts me
My heart is empty, never feelin remorse
I got a sniper one building a cross ready to kill your boss
Chorus

Yo, yo Jose Luis, smoke lah like the reverend
Look in the skies, clouds look like coke 'n heaven
Like whoever sittin' on pies too, gettin' high too
Mad fly too, a thug too
Yo we praise those, however you make your pesos
Keep your shit tight just like, Jose Canseco's
Batting stance, a majorly we glance
And gotta yell ""What, What!""
Cuz thug niggas don't dance yo
I told niggas, that you did it for show
But niggas thought you was ill, yo
Even your ho, yo for real youngblood I'm really afraid so
Your colors got revealed and now you buy dough
Impost-o's, locos, morenos, go-golos, boriquas, Latinos

You know how that goes, DE's light it up though
We stay smokin it, Tone Loc'in it

It's my life, my money, my world
My girls, TS electrify the sky like the 3rd rail
Want us to fail cuz you on our dick
But as long as every song is rich you can't tell me shit
We been doin' this since Prince was the bomb
Before he changed his name and started making wack songs
Before the trigger talk and the heat wit chalk
Was our last resort and niggas took it to the streets

I live the plush life
Nothing on my wrist but crushed ice
Bumpin' the heist in the GS wit the bug lights
Just the life that the playa portrays
Lookin' laced in my FJ560's
It's many ways that we gon get it
Look how many years we don did it
Cop land and build a home in it
That's all I ever wanted dreamed of
Create a mean buzz
Slick C.R.E.A.M. and show my team love
You see us on B.E.T
Rockin' ice blue suits pardon the jewlery
Is the same fat kid from the Ave of Trinity
It's been around three years since my last LP
But it gets no better than this
Consecutive hits
You on some Jealous Ones Envy shit
Conpetitive bitch
I got my enemies mapped out
No doubt
Take the leer jet to Cali theres a party up at Shaq's house
You don't wanna compare counts pull ya stash out
The ultraviolet from my ice will make you pass out
My niggas force black outs
Shoot up ya skate key
You love to hate me
Pushin' the dope ass ride doin' a hundred-eighty

Pile high to the top of the Empire State

I'm here to raise the stakes this time it's ten mill
Supply the sink ill, ship five and then build
And I'm - Joe Crack BX finest
Do rewind this Terror Squad behind this

I'm from Misery Boulevard, right across the street
From I Hope You Die Place, in school study the crime rate
That's when it became apparent to me
That the pimps and hustlers be apparent to me
I plead innocent your honor
I'm just a product of the streets, product of some beef
Product of that Cappadonna Armani three piece
Problem is when I win, my team eats
But wait, just think the opposite of that
You'll be starin down the opposite side of them gats nigga

I got the streets on smash, niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying!
""Once again back is the incredible"" (dammmn right!)
""The incredible - the incredible""
I got the heat on blast, love the seats reclining on that mean G4
Cause down in New York they saying!
""Once again back is the incredible"" (dammmn right!)
""The incredible - the incredible""

Yo! Now have you ever felt the metal to your melon, it just cock back
Ask for the money and drugs, say you ain't got that
Where the cops at? prayin that they comin
Just a few seconds your brains be layin on your stomach
On my waist you know I got keep that oven
For ya ginger bread pie ass niggas the heat's running on high
Joe Crack I - bake the cake and serve you niggas humble pie

I got the streets on smash, niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying!
""Once again back is the incredible"" (dammmn right!)
""The incredible - the incredible""
I got the heat on blast, love the seats reclining on that mean G4
Cause down in New York they saying!
""Once again back is the incredible"" (dammmn right!)

Still Real,Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.),2001,"It's so depressing, uh..
Be the realest shit I ever wrote (Money and cars bitches)
Shit Is Real Part 2.. (drugs) modern day.. (society yaknow?)
See what it's like to walk in my shoes
It ain't all fun and games (ya heard?)
Yo yo
I'm sick and tired of stressin, every days a different lesson
I'm free-fallin tryna leave this deep depression
My son Joey still slow, my moms got cancer in her throat
My big brother sniffin dope
Lemme know how many motherfucker wanna be just like me
Screamed at and treated like shit by your wifey
This hot bitch be sweatin the coke cash
My baby mother think I grow dough out my ass
It's like, how much fight I got left in me?
Niggas won't be happy till they bring the fuckin death of me
But you never see Joe look weak or flow off beat
And Charlie sees the board in four more weeks
 2x
You gotta walk where I walked
Bang where I bang
Slang where I hang
To get where I'm going to
Stay where I stay
Blaze who I blazed
Pay dues how I payed
To get where I'm going to

Uh, yo, the South Bronx, nine years later
Ain't nuttin changed, niggas still playa haters
T.S. the best that's done it, forever live and never front it
Reminisce of when I used to hold heat and tell niggas ""run it""
Now we flooded with jewels, hundreds of dudes
Crowd the Coliseum to hear they favorite tunes
Then at the time of our prime we caught a sick one
The angels came down, took my twin Big Pun
Shit were unbalanced throughout the whole world
All I could do was try to provide for his seeds and his old girl
Hope your listenin, tell Ton' that we still missin him
I'm like a prisoner in jail with no visitors
 2x

Yeah, uh, aiyyo the third verse is dedicated to you
Even though you switched teams, I'm praying for you
We used to stay up all night countin dollar for dollar
You was my son's godfather, where the fuck is your honor?
Can't even rap the shit we did together
You'd probably have me shackled locked down doin bids forever
You broke the first code
I'd like to twist ya wifey till it roasts gold
Snitch nigga, turned state to sold ya soul
How could a nigga that was clappin in the streets
Start yappin to the deez, like what I rightly should believe?
Like ever verse is a charge, for every hurt there's a scar
I never once tried to hurt cha'll
I'm just tryna do me, sell a few CD's
Buy land in Miami and cop a new B come on!

Motherfuckers think it's sweet
Think a nigga got money and a nigga don't feel pain
You ain't never feel my pain
You don't know what the fuck I'm goin through
Niggas lookin at me like, ""He got it made""
Like I ain't lose Pun, my grandfather a week later
My aunt a month later
Like my fuckin sister ain't in a coma right now!
You motherfuckers don't know pain!
Let's get one thing clear; money'll never buy you happiness
My true niggas walk with me now!

Kilo,The Darkside Vol. 1,2010.0,"All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams, easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand, but can you remember?
When we measure kilograms (?)

Yo Joe, what up?
It's ya neighbourhood Pusha
See my man, my man May May locked up for like 25 years
He in the Feds right now, right
He said he locked up with this old Spanish man
And they was sitting down watching TV
And you popped up on the screen
The man said, ""hey, what's Joey doing on TV?""
He didn't even know you rap, haha
[Verse 1: Pusha T & 
No Malice
]
K-I-L-O, the king saying hello
From my Sugar Hill Ray Nathan he's Romello
I plays it like a cello, I pull them strings
To make them scales teeter totter like balance beams
It's everything it seems, the guns and the glamour
The re-compressed birds broked down with sledgehammers
Smile candid camera, goddess in zoom lenses
Unclaimed taxes, sitting in new Benzes
Champagne drenches, the loafers of bosses
Lord forgive me, it's blood diamonds in these crosses
Suffered major losses to repeat the past
Guess I never learned a hard head makes a soft ass
Ugh, and soft white makes for hard cash
And Continental GT's with the soft rag
Like soft batch, cookies out the oven
Getting 13 at a time, now that's a baker's dozen

All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams, easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand, but can you remember?
When we measure kilograms (?)

It's Coca baby
Krills mania, BX, TS nigga!
Ayo, it's blood on the cocaine, a scene out of 
Psycho
Dope so pure, fiends cling to the light pole
Wet purer than holy water, your wife know
And she ain't gotta fly to Columbia for that lipo... (Darkside)
Cut keys like a locksmith
Blasphemy, but it feels like it's God's gift
One sniff'll have you kneel down and praise me
Nodding out, holding onto your babies
A new connect means a few more dreams
Now watch a nigga flood the streets like New Orleans (get it?)
Blow like trumpets, snorting on the second line
Fucking with that white bitch'll have you on the borderline
Penthouse in the city got the scenic view
And maybe you can fuck Madonna like you Peter Shue
Snowcaps dripping off rock mountains
Crack in Wonderland got coke dripping out the fountains

All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams, easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand, but can you remember?
When we measure kilograms (?)

Okay baby, got you Crack, Killa!
I said a kilo is a thousand grams, but can you remember?
Check my agenda, snow like December
Coke, I'm a emperor, go head and taste it numb up your dentures
Moving in renters, probably a sentra
No I won't serve you, don't mean to offend ya, 'fend ya
Roundtable, glass up, all hail us
Toast the life, one they told me will fail us
We prevail from the corner, now (?)
Still got wet, they on water like a sailor
Me and Cook Coke (Cook Coke), cook coke (cook coke)
No fracture, but damn you look broke
Know my pedigree ready is what you better be
(Better be) put two holes in yo' ass like the letter B
My parameter homie is where you need to be
Gambler? Nah, Janitor, I keep the keys... Killa!

No blackjack no dope deals, no nothing
A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in
You guys got fat while everybody starved on the street
It's my turn

You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money, you fucking hump?

Stay frontin, like you wild and'll spray somethin
Come to find out, you ain't never slanged nothin
Think it's the game, gon lose the sport
I seen dude's get bruised through fort
Then choose the court, a new's report
They just pursed the court
If you even think of bustin, they ass'll sooth your thoughts
A damn shame, I'm from the streets where it's fair game
Niggas will ift you off your feet wit the Can-yan
Three in the chest and one in the part
For disrespect you, get left right in front of ya moms
Joe is the Don, you clean, then show me your arm
For these track's, I'm a fiend like a soldier in 'Nam
Only the Bronx will blow your ass outta ya Lugz
Fuck love, here we believe in nothin but slugs

Always you see him in the club frontin wit the ice grill....
Be like, he's alright, but he's not real
Actin like he got a money, cause he never hold steel.....
Be like, he's alright, but he's not real
Always see him wit bodyguards and rap like he kill
He's alright, but he's not real
So if the feds ever indict him, you know he gonna squeal....
Be like, he's alright, but he's not real

Yo, I squeeze of gats and spit facts when I breath on tracks
Got that hot shit, that make you ease on back
I'll make you leave the game like Ma$e, and get ya name erased
Walk threw from place to place, and change the chase
I'm givin him terror, for the new millenium era
Automatic Semi's wit the fully clip and the leather
Poppin' champagne like we celebrating whatever
Switch to the chin, shoot top, hair and a feather
Versatile, walking threw the aisle, hurtin the crowd
Even got the god in the cloud, observing this style
He love the way I do this, leavin niggas clueless
It's Prospect, it's off wit ya head, you should've knew this
My twin????, cock and squeeze, we stoppin G's
You better follow up, these niggas can't rock wit these
Straight up, I speak life threw the mic though
Sprayin the town, and layin it down like whoa!

Always you see him in the club frontin wit the ice grill....
Be like, he's alright, but he's not real
Actin like he got a money, cause he never hold steel.....
Be like, he's alright, but he's not real

A-yo what about all the young ladies, the positive young ladies
(Like I said this is dedicated to the hoes and bitches)
Speak on it man

This ain't for the intelligent civilized divas
For all the hoes and bitches who swallow nut by the litres
Two months pregnant madd dick pokin' the fetus
But she don't give a damn still suckin' dick for sneakers
You know the type, Damn dirty is right she even did it wit dice
And made a dildo of ice

Move ya phat ass to gain
And if you love me baby girl give my friends some entertainment (Yo that's
Foul Joe)
Hey yo I treat 'em how they act yo
Behave like a hooker and played like a madd ho
Rumor has it that you take it in the asshole
And wrap ya lips around my dick like a lasso
I love the way you hold that
Joe Crack bozak
While niggas bone that
My stomach's where ya nose at
Just another ho in the midst
That does more than kiss when we start pourin' the 'cris

All you bitches be fuckin' for money
Playin' niggas but they can't get shit from me
You ain't smokin' my lye
Pushin' my ride and if you ain't fuckin' just walk on by
All you bitches just walk on by

I once knew a girl by the name of Savannah
Met her backstage at a show in Atlanta
Seemed like a nice girl, class and well-mannered
When I took her to the hotel the bitch went bananas
Did my eyes decieve me
Was she suckin' three pee-pee's
Caught it all on tape so I could watch it late on T.V
Couldn't wait to beep me
Started in the car shorty caught the quick train from the Trinity stars
Big Joe'll railroad
Any frail ho
Have a bitch scream and yell throwin' elbows
Now who the hell knows
Why these girls fuck for cell phones
Turnin' tricks for material shit
Now bust it, You wanna hit it gotta pay top dollar
These chics is hott rodders
Wit grips like Rottwilers
But why bother
Picture me payin' a fee
I'll just play like Akinyle and fuck these hoes for free


Picture B-More on the floor on all fours
Mind must've lost yours
Never been tossed
Tour thats what I do for ones
Not whore baby thats what I do for fun
Now I dread that I gave you head
All because them four double A duracells went dead
My vibrator....Huh!! playa hatin' on me
Thinking you can hit this and get away scott free
Now you boomeranged....All I wanted was some ac-tion
Brought my own Branton
Got my own mansion
Now you off tryin' to front to yo niggas
Cuz I blew ya back out and got my own figgas
Please, you was just something to do
Had a camcorder too
How you like that boo
You madd cuz I hit that and vanished
Or cuz you on tape screamin' ""CHARLI BALTIMORE"" in spanish

I can become President, without elections

Back in ninety-three, when everything was fine and dandy
I was the nigga puttin razors in your kids candy
Mad connivin, it don't get any worser
Best reverse them thoughts DISPERSE
Even if you get loud and curse
You don't put any fear in my heart
Don't even start, you get torn apart

Yo I get trife, and do a number on that ass
With the butcher knife - slice after slice, yea
Causin more destructional horror, than the AntiChrist

Who wanna spaz out? Crunchtime, blow ya abs out
Leave you in the fetal position, witcha ass out
Ready to mash out any crew actin like
They the true facts of life, frontin through the camera lights
Despite, we hold it down regardless
I got Def Jam suckin me like, ""I wish you was my artist""
For starters, who's the largest cat?
Get a hundred grand from my most garbage rap
Now how hard is that? Everything we spit be hot
Whether it's live on Flex or in front of the chicken spot
Grimed out, we really live whatchu rhyme 'bout
See me posted up in the Tunnel, with my shines out
Ice cold like Alaska when I pass ya
Got girls shakin, losin they breath, as if they catchin asthma
Headed to the bar to pop some bottles
Now we in the car headed home to rock some models
All I hear in the background is Gucci and Prada
But I'm tryna gas these bitches to screw me for nada
We the best that done it, confess you fronted
Anybody wanna test how much straps, you want it?

Aiyyo the gangsta's back
Stop it right where you at
Let a real nigga rock real murderer rap
Tell them thug niggas, listen to that
Gotchu feelin it hard like Joe the God's really bringin it back!

I'm from my days and legends, since age eleven
I was the cause of dope fiends catchin AIDS infections
Most of us are dead, but the rest is locked
Runnin in the rec room and check me out on the box
A CEO could get optioned tryna change the channel
It's like tryna take the flesh outta the mouth of hungry cannibals
Joe the God, the flow is hard
Known for packin two dozen birds like Noah's Ark
I'm the realest of 'em, make you feel the pressure
Catch you at a club, smack you up, steal ya leather
You niggas soften me, beat you out of the mix
Tough talk, tough walk, but you cry like a bitch
I see you downin the Cris', I'm not hatin, I'm just aggrevated
I ask myself every day, how these faggots made it?
Fuck around with the Don and get decapitated
I'm sick of hearin 'em (?) for all the cats that made it


Aiyyo the kid is back
Leave it right where you at
Let a real nigga hold that, you probably won't clap
Tell them thug niggas, move it on back
I'm feelin tight and I'm hot
Ready to pop the crack right through your back

That's how Kenny rocks, I'm more advanced than how your learnin
I'm like the force of space balance and planets while they churnin
Poppin rosary beads, piss on ya candle while it's burnin
Rush ya widows crib and pop ya baby while he's burpin
Now I know you can feel the heat I generate
Imagine when I penetrate ya stomach, and make ya body's center bake
We can argue for days, whether it's faster to drop five shots
In ya astronaut before you cloud the stash box
Splash ya brains on ya birds' laps
Swerve you on the curb, crash the Range, and push the front skirt back
And murk after that, blurtin curse words
Yo I popped that nigga's son one before we catch the first
I'mma kill any murderer, leave a nigga burpin up
Blood, chokin on chunks of his lung interior
Every verse that I spit's a personal riff
I mean a ill key frontin, I'm a murder you shit
Niggas play me while distrubin the Bricks
I'm like the feelin of the first time they ever held a bird in they grip
Motivator thug, scrape 'em, shoot the bolts in his butt
Energizin 'em up, make 'em wanna open 'em up
Actin like I can't happen till I smack him in his Adam's apple
Death to rappin, I don't wanna battle
I'd rather rush your studio session and shatter the booth
Clap at ya face, give the mic feedback the goof",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-murder-rap-lyrics

Whattup Big March? K-O-J
Yeah...
This is the ice cream, yeah the ice cream man
Ha, the ice cream, I'm the ice cream man
Uhh, T.A. all day
You don't need that watch, yo, yo

I went from Jackie to Janice, Trina to Tameka
She had the fattest ass if my niggas woulda seen her
See a nigga on, before you know it I'm gone
Front of the coliseum watchin girls eyes roam
Just a throwback nigga, with the Motorola phone
Hopped in the spaceship, whole 'nother zone
We outta here; back to the Bronx where the real stay
Every last Sunday of the month call it Krillz day
Every other week I hear somebody tryin to kill me
But I be out of town, gettin money where the bills lay
Ice cream, ice cream, she wants ice cream
Says she's on a diet so I hit her with the light cream
I got the sweetest love, you know that rock thick
Shorty you can lick lick, suck on this big dick (AOW~!)
Hold up, shit, you better get your wet wipes
You know Joey G'd up, I got every stripe
I got houses on the side of mountains
I'm more fearless than every one of my killers
If your girl leaves with me, she gon' keep comin
She gon' keep cummin, keep cummin, she gon' love me (ow)

Ice cream, ice cream, who wants ice cream?
Hey - everybody screamin for that ice cream
When she screams, I scream, I scream, she screams
Hey - everybody screamin for that ice cream
Ice cream, I'm the ice cream man
Yes the ice cream, I'm the cream man {*3X*}

I'm feelin like the Bronx most wanted, how they all want it
When it come to pretty women fuck them womens by the hundreds
I'm a stunner, a sunner, you can call me what you wanna
I'll, take yo' bitch she'll be ""Gone 'Til November""
I, got so many hoes some names I can't remember
It was Tonya, Wanda, movies, made 'em
Two time Johnny, two freaks when I slay 'em
Always get new ones, old ones might play 'em
Bumpin ""Maybach Music"" and I'm in the Maybach
Come and get your ice cream, lil' mama lay back
(Where at?) On the lap of Crack
Cause we be trizzin, hit you from the front and the back
My time is money, better have my money ASAP
I done came up, I can bet them niggas hate that
If your girl leave with me, she gon' keep comin
Comin keep cummin, keep cummin, she gon' love me


Yo, aiyyo
Who smelled the fragrance? It was Chanel mixed with YSL
Flagged in burgun', serpent know well
We at a large brunch, discussin the God's punch
Kayla with Bartles & Jaymes, shorty kept starin at my shell son
And my velour was rugged, my whip was 400
Gangsters I was with flashed all hundreds
Gucci couture to store shit
Let me get the number love the worker exhausted, I forced it
(That's right) Paragon style, I'm fly with it, might be what'chu want
With good taste, put you in a good space
Sat back, check her shape, good shape
Plus she vegan, I'm fiendin for you like Swiss cake
My medicine is you and me in love, the plug was a match
Gats on the center, Irish pub
She kept laughin, lickin her lips, listen to flicks
Clean Aston, now I got my hand on her tits, but uhh


Yeah! Hustle super fly shit, y'knahmean?
On that A.C.G. shit, that fly Pelle
Jumpin out that brand new whip on my own tip
Little Dominican mami you feel me?

Crush Tonight,Loyalty,2002.0,"1 - 
Baby, if you wit' it, just clap yo' hands
Stop playin' girl, back that ass up and
Spend that cash dog, drink the Henny and
Freak that girl like you tryna have a baby cuz
Everybody's out to fuck tonight
The fine women, they out to fuck tonight
My niggas, they down to fuck tonight
Ladies, fellas, the won't stop players

Came through the door, seen it before
Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor
You ever felt good to the point you so sure that
All the attention in the club is yours
Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior
Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws
Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more
And your crew's all but know it's a horse
Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'
Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin
Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin
I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again
Repeat 1
Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind
And to let you know, you just as good as gold
It's like we got our own little private party goin' on
And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan
It's so intimate, we so into it
Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent
Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'
Laughin' cuz I'mma kidnap you for the weekend
Now we at the pad about to crack a case
Playin' the couch like Ceasar's, she feedin' me grapes
Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great
But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next
Repeat 1

If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me
Cuz it's on, it's on
Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed
It's on, it's on

Now mami, let's get serious, cuz by the looks of it
It seems your sexuality is just a little curious
You got a friend, we could gather then split
If not, I got a girl for every girl I get
There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast
We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat
Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer
She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer
She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us
No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us

Fat Joe, a.k.a. Da Fat Gangsta
I'm no joke, and I'm far from a prankster
I got skills, aiyyo word life
Suckers is scared, because they know I live trife
As I troop down the streets of a ghetto
Skins are jockin, and always screamin hello
But I keep drivin in my jet black Beamer
I'm not a daydreamer, but I'm known as a scheamer
I'm dead-ass, when it comes to this
And if you fuck around, your moms'll reminisce
Thinkin of the good times she spent with her son
Somebody shoulda told you that I wasn't the one
Yes I'm known to get nuff respect
And if you face Fat Joe, well then you face your death
Now in ninety-three, it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin, I'm a bad, bad, man

Niggas know the flav

Check it
All the old folks, hate my guts
Cause I be hittin all they daughters and they big fat butts
Cause I'm the papi chulo when it comes to rap
And if you fuck with me, then you leave handicapped
I don't give a fuck, don't care who you are
I gotta say peace to my peeps GangStarr
Some real motherfuckers from around the hood
When I chills with them, we be up to no good
Hittin skins, makin ends
Loungin with my friends in my fat BM
Whether Uptown in the Boogie Down
Or checkin out stunts in the Polo Ground
See just like Mel, I'm internationally known
And I'm mob related, like Al Capone, check it
Too hot to handle, blow you like a candle
You never catch Joe in the middle of a scandal

Everybody knows the flav

One day I was chillin, caught a buckshot
The nigga was butt, so then he gets no props
Word spread fast around town
I was layin six feet deep underground, check it
Niggas wished the worst, but spoke too fast
Cause here I am and I'm ready to blast *gunshot*
The cops must have missed, takin me for a bitch
Because they tried to gas me, and make me turn snitch
But I'm not the one for peace
So I turned around and said, ""Fuck the police!""
I'm the type to handle this on my own
Pack two joints and pass one to Tone
There's no shame in my game, I do what I gotta do
See I'm rollin with a crazy live crew
Now in ninety-three it's time to take a stand

Wet the whole block, sip Grey Goose in the jet

Backpack rappers they should have a plaque in the Boogie of me~!!!
You know why? Number one hustler

Shit, heard he sells cracks on the block caught a body
Listen to his raps, he calls himself John Gotti""

Don't you know all of us rappers are great liars?

Sensationalize bringing packs 'cross state
And y'all niggas lying cause young niggas dying

To meet your doom, mornin night or the afternoon
Harassin the mic, with a verbal assault of rap
Stick lyrics back to back, that'll pack, to keep myself on wax

If you spread any rumors sayin you took me out, you're lyin
A human beat is struck I know when it really sounds trunk
I'm never ever buck I don't give a fuck if you think that I'm a sucker
Parties that I've made, people wonder how long it lasted

Does anybody know... Joe...

This is death to Fat Joe, birth of Cook
Sing to 'em niggas

Does anybody know, how I can get in touch with Joe

Definition of a Don, ""Jealous Ones Still Envy"" - CRACK!
Yeah, it's '05 and we ridin', we still ridin'
Touched the down, and he's down
See the God in the hood, Dade County, BX, wherever

Can you hear that? Niggas that's the winds of change
Blowin through your city, here comes the pain
They say, the more things change, the more stay the same
So I, grip on that same 9 I held in '88
My momma askin' - {""where did he go""}
She up the block frantic - {""where did he go""}
Cops combin' the streets harassin' - {""where did he go""}
But little did they know - {""where did he go""}
That I was on that Greyhound watchin' white turn green
Renegades, we don't wait 'til the light turn green
We just, break the rules and live a life obscene
I been Crack, way before the shit hits the scene
You couldn't even imagine what my eyes done seen
But now it's - I'm a thug, I'm a killer
I'm a drug dealin' nigga from the hood, God dammit I'm good
I'm out, I swear after this disc I will quit
Pun if you listenin God you truly been this

Does anybody know, how I can get in touch with Joe

Yeah, hahahaha
All my niggas locked down, all my nigga BX niggas we ridin'
Uhh, blap blap blap! Guess who? Yeah

Imagine some old foe with no fire
The God done ran off and retired
No ""Lean Back"", ""New York, New York"" anthems
No rappers these ladies, call handsome
Me I'm just dancin, velvet LaPelle
In the Phantom slow rollin' watchin' Dave Chappelle
I blow smoke now, the stress done got me
Runnin' in the sand like a scene from Rocky
{""where did he go""} I'm tryin' to find myself
It's hard when you the only one supplyin' the wealth
And if I fall off, who can I ask for help?
Not a damn soul, my mind is outta control
It's like the Hammer story stands out; can't walk through the Bronx
Cause e'ry muh'fucker got his fuckin' hands out
Every day somebody new 'sposed to blast me
Changed my phone number, got everybody askin'

Does anybody know, how I can get in touch with Joe

Yeah, hahaha
More money more problems
Yup, it's Cook!
Yeah

Joseph Carter, that's who I be
I'm still runnin' the Carter, that's how we eat
Niggas, don't even bother 'cause that's when we meet
In the middle of the projects, clappin' them heats
There's never been a rapper this credible as Joe
Dropped The Incredible, I'm better with the flow
And e'rybody's askin' where did he go
Real simple, stop askin' for Joe, it's Cook Coke

Does anybody know, how I can get in touch with Joe

Yeah, Cook motherfuckin Coke!

Sell coke to Pablo

Show you how the iron is slung
Now I could play like Kanye and let me chest hairs show
Put on them Kool Moe Dee glasses
But that just ain't Joe
Play shots and then I switch up the flow
Like what the blood clot, Boomba clot
You ain't fuckin wit Joe
Now Mamma love me

Jealous cause they boyfriends ain't me

Yeah, wave hi at the bad guy
And you can ice grill when I drive by
See if I be givin a fuck
My hands on the woodgrain, fat ass tucked
Ha ha, shit a nigga just came off tour
Mister Mister Rainman, I'm makin it pour
I 'member when I used to have to play that hard
Apartment 5B, Forrest Projects y'all
A nigga too fat, so I couldn't play ball
So I hit the strip, started flippin that raw
My pants would sag, now they callin me Crack
Used to love graffiti, so I made it my tag
Me and Tone Montana we was bangin them hammers
Before New York niggas, ever wore bandanas
Got so much money, a nigga would abuse it
Then I left the streets alone for the love of the music

You know I never dreamed that I could be perfect
Cause that's the only thing that I've ever been, ohh
And when I look back on my life it's all worth it
Because I know I know my people believe me, I do it for love

Yeah, yo
They say Joe too selfish, he won't let us in the door
I say shit I could have left Pun in front of that store
Could have left Remy Ma ass in Castle Hill
Where every other day another nigga get killed
They say what's Cool without Dre?
I say shit, what if them niggas never met Jose?
Hell 'Ve was a great DJ
Now he produce Roc Boyz, headed for a Grammy
What if I would have told Khaled to stop buggin me?
He'd probably never be President of that company
Shit you probably woulda never heard the movement
I ain't gotta talk, I ain't gotta prove shit
Scott Storch is the best, they kept sleepin on him
Cause he's a white boy, he kept ghostbeatin for 'em
Dropped ""Lean Back,"" then that shit hit and guess what?
I made the nigga rich cocksuckers!


I was never into girls, I was just into my music
Dropped so many hits, still them niggas just confuse it
Went to my old school, gave 'em some computers
And the niggas in the hood still be sayin I don't do shit
Bein they ain't got no love in they hearts
I just moved to Miami, copped a crib and a yacht
I bought my little daughter an equestrian park
Now she's ridin horses, tell me that ain't hot
Sade, Luther Vandross
Stephanie Mills, El DeBarge
I used to look at them like Gods
Now tell me why a nigga wouldn't go hard?
Bye {?} boricua, why you hatin on me papi?
It's been sweet 16, still them haters can't stop me
In fact man I'm just like Rocky
Lordy we did it baby, you keep goin shopping


Yeah, man I did it for the music!
I did it for the love
Ha! I mean Mother's Day I'm performin for your mother
And your girl... can't even be with my family man
You know what? Be careful what you wish for
Joe Crack's here to let you know the workin man is not a SUCKER
9 to 5 man you get to go home and be wit'cha kids man

Yeah..
The Fat Gangsta..
Here comes the nigga from the East
Who just been crowned for most hated by police
The public enemy, rapper at large
Who's known throughout the industry for pullin niggas cards
You know the situation, Zulu Nation
Never forget the Bronx because the Bronx the foundation
Fat Joe, a.k.a. Joey Crack
Niggas be like he's fat, bitches be like he's all that
Motherfuckers know my rep, I never fronted
Niggas be talkin mad shit, but they don't want it
It's the realer MC, the drug dealer MC
If a nigga fake jax, I'm gonna kill a MC
Yeah, you can't handle the truth
Fuck around and get thrown off the project roof
Mad lives have been lost and forgotten
Niggas better watch they back, the Big Apple's gone rotten
Microphone check, one two one two
Shouts to the East and the West coast crew
Whatever you do, keep this hip-hop shit true
{""That's all I ask of you..""}
When I step in the jam all eyes are on me
Sold out crowds, with curiosity
Everybody wants to know, could the man still flip it?
Microphone gifted, unrealistic
Comin with the bomb bass for the underground heads
Flex got the most, Serge got the landspread
Keepin shit real, niggas know the deal
Just through trial and comin down on appeal
Microphone Joe I own it, bitches wanna bone it
Blowin out the tweeters in your musical component
It's your man Fat Joe, oh, is that so?
You remember me from, ""You know ya got to Flow""
One time for your mind off the top of a dome
Never leave for home without the motherfuckin chrome
Word to Tone
, Big Daddy, I know he's chillin
Peace to all the villains out of state makin millions cause ah

Never lost a gram on any eighth that I cooked
Fat Joe, army fatigue and black chuckers
Hardcore lyrics to all my real motherfuckers
I'm tryin to see cream, in the millions, retire
And go play golf with Russell Simmons
That's the type of mission that I'm on
Aiyyo my word is bond, I keep a army just as deep as Farrakhan
You.. can't.. deal with the man
Who be holdin down the fort with the gauge in his hand
I know you love the way I grab the mic and spark it
You hookers'll NEVER get your hands inside my pockets

Recognize my presence, this rap game specialized with legends
I drop shit niggas try to memorize in seconds
You criticize me, still visualize the lessons
And when I wish to put aside the questions
Before they find out, who's the realest
Who done spoke without one joke about the illest
Shit that ever happened, in this rappin beyond rappin
Joe the God it ain't so hard to start clappin
But I lay low, create flows, for the pesos
Now we got extra hoes, wantin to chase shows
I take foes, and break em down to minerals
We went from street corner thugs to white collar criminals
Individuals, with no peace on the quest
The iced out, piece on my chest, from the East to the West
Never sleep in a sweat, keep the heat with the vest
Ready for the 'casian blazin gettin deep with the best
The police wanna test my strategy, got half of the world
Mad at me, but very few challenge me

Ask your peeps if I ain't have the beast soundin Japanese
Coughin blood, that's what you get for talkin thug
Run up on your preacher with the sweeper feature coughin slugs
Once a thug always a thug, hallways and drug dealers
Fillers, killers, they wanna chill all day with us
They love the Don, these words are more than just another song
If I said I slit your neck, your jugular's gone
Ain't nothin artificial, Joe the God, the Terror Squad official
Got a lot of pistols with missiles,

She threw it on me, I ain't expect that
She a dancer, she can make it clap
I'm in the zone now, I think it's a wrap
She's windin on me, she's windin on meee
Windin on me, she's windin on meee
Windin on me, windin on meee
Windin on me, she's windin on meee

Now I can throw it up, watch it fall on her head
Or I could drop it on the floor and watch her crawl in the bread
Them niggas ain't Crack (Crack) I been shakin the feds
Them niggas ain't Crack (Crack) now you can take it in lead
She's windin on me, grindin on meee
Momma see I'm tryin to fuck, so what's it gon' be?
Got me in my zone now, I'm sippin slowly
You could bet the whole house, she gon' blow me
Maybe cause she know me and I'm lit up like the flares on the bottle
See you been in {?} by the size of them goggles
Keep dumpin cash right out of the Louis bag
If I could bottle it up, I'd sell you my swag


Hah~! It go oooooh, girl, I love you so
But I put money way above you though
Nasty by nature, human vibrator
Just hope that I don't spit you out as soon as I taste ya
I'm cool as lemonade at a sunday picnic
I'll break your girl off and you are not Mr. Fix-it
Huh, so she called me to make it juicy for her
And I'mma beat it, like I produced it for her
Hot as Lucifer, make that thing right juicy for us
Gimme 'bout a week I'mma have a prostitute named Boostin for us
So many women be like ""Weezy please seduce it for us""
Then after I do they be like ""Please play that acoustic for us""

And if she backed up I am Joseph the Plumber

And since she love my teardrops she be windin on meee

I hear somebody tryin to speak on Crack (Crack)

Burnin down that turnpike, puffin on that Marley

Shit if his momma seen him wouldn't even know
Joe, I'm a don, the son of a God
One of the hardest to ever yell out the Terror Squad

(""How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto"") Yeah
(""How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto"") Ka-ka-ka-ka-kill 'em
(""How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto"") Uhh, street shit right here
(""How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto"") Kill 'em, Street Runner

Uhh, yo, yo
Joey don't know never seen never heard shit
Niggas is harassin me, tryin to get the murders kid
I don't know them birds flew/flu, I don't know them killers went
Mug shots you showin me these niggas probably innocent
These live niggas turned coat, now witnesses
They'll even tell on they moms, what the business is
We even got some right here in the business kid
And I ain't even gotta say no names, you know them niggas is
Coca, movin blow down to Villanova
Up to Poughkeepsie, got some new birds for Newburgh
I don't know if you got the news, I'm a shoot-er
And if that bitch ever get to talkin I will shoot her
Come with them dogs, go to war with the true birds
My moms on my mind, keep yellin I'm a loser
Word to my nigga Pun, and his Honda scooter
I lay a motherfucker down and throw away the Ruger

Brrap, brrrap brrap {*gunshot*}

Kill 'em, spill 'em, hang 'em off the ceiling
Fuck it throw him off the building watch him land on his children
I am just a man but the plan is to fill 'em
Hundred rounds and better if he shut up he'd be chillin
Got a can like a frying pan, hotter than a skillet
Give a nigga his life, now he got his name on a bullet
Pull it~! Pull it~! Nigga don't hesitate, levitate
Anybody soul who cooperates
Feds right on top of me, duck 'em like Apollo Creed
If you wanna find me well I'm anywhere the dollars be
Killer shit is outta me, give it to whatever nigga wanted me
In the Bronx River where the bodies be, fuck-boys!

I'm the realest nigga in here, you already know it
A lot of you's fuck boys, you already showed it
Use a straw to sip the Moët, diamonds on the Cuban
Where the fuck have you been? I'm producin' Rick Rubin
Some of you call it Britney, rest in peace Whitney
But when you live your dreams, nightmares could turn to tricky
Chase until your heart stops, some niggas don't make eighteen
I was pitchin' hard rocks while you was watchin' A-Team
Rocky Balboa, hard white ain't a mystery
And I'm rockin' more gold chains than Mr. T
I love strippers like 2 Chainz
In that new mousseline bumpin' New Slaves, uh

A pair Timberlands and a hoodie on
They wanna strap me to the same bed they put Tookie on
Fuck 'em, though
I'm screamin' TS is aboard the flight
Six people on a twelve-seater for the night
Now that's six niggas with straps, six figures to match
On our way to Vegas with yo bitch rollin' the craps
Put it all on crack and watch the money show
A pair of Christians have your bitches catch the Holy Ghost, uh

Went from Sergio to Kenny
To moving them Lamborghini's
Got you sick to your stomach
Now you ask yourself why
Nigga, Crack was the first
You seem em in red monkeys
And I bet you didn't k now that they came in my size
Now its highly controversial if you find me in commercial
And you know that G five's the only way that we fly
Now I'm feeling like Pharrell and Snoop
The world beautiful
Brazilian, Columbian chicks
You know the usual
Them niggas over there please send them some bottles
Cause they lookin' like some haters
I don't really need the problems
Cause these niggas here
We love to give ketchup
We bloody up the whole damn room
If you let us
And I ain't tryin' to steal
I'm just tryin' to chill
And like up this Kush with this hundred dollar bill

Why you get so jealous
Why you take the stand

Please don't be mad
Don't talk to them boys
Bring up my past
Don't tell em bout the Macks that I stashed in the grass
And that ten mill terror squad
Start up cash
I'm a law abiding citizen
I barely smoke blunts, now
We into real estate
We fuckin with Donald Trump now
When you know who
Told them boys what
I been rappin for years all of a sudden I'm hot
Cause the only time you see me is probably when I'm on TV
Smokin the cohiba on the deck of my yacht
Nigga you could never be me, though I make it seem easy
Only Nigga from the Bronx
Though Miami's my block
Now you got us fucked up
Nigga we don't rat
We don't talk to them boy's
All we do it clap
All we do is spill Crys
Got that on tap
Look at all the shit I accomplished
Not bad for Crack


I'm feeling like Christ at the tabernacle
Stones are thrown at me
Record labels is hiding
Nigga's disowning Joey
And still I throw rocks at tanks
The poor peoples champ
Go against locks with shanks
Yeah I walk the middle of the streets with no body guards
Stick up kid salute the hard body god
My jail niggas they love this shit
Yeah they sharpen up they shanks while they bumpin' this shit
And my niggas on the table
Yeah they listen to this
Little Coca
Little soda
Yeah they whipping up shit
And I know it sounds eerie but my niggas better hear me
If you speaking on the phones it won't be secret to the jury
They hit you wit that Rico
I'm not meaning PR
I'm talking full scale riots
Whole lot of triage
And I know you not scared but please be cautious
Cause these jealous ass niggas could be walking amongst us

To my jail niggas
To your street memories

Makin the fifth scream, rockin older niggas to sleep
Make a fiend strip naked cuz he owed for a week
Now the Squad's getting recognized, supplyin connects with pies
Pumpin pounds of weight, nigga like exercise
Joe been over quarter five dope and homicide
Long before Charlie got knocked, until Madonna died
Young and not givin a fuck
There ain't a nigga I ain't hit when I buck and left 'em shit outta luck
I'mma gangsta like my daddy was, hittin number spots
Sendin me to my room while he was puffin pot
Still I use to peak from the door, couldn't believe what I saw
Stacks of money on the bed and the floor
It wasn't long til I did what he did
I was an innocent kid and got exposed to the life that he lived
I went from grams into O's, pounds to bricks
On the strip pimpin hoes on some goldie shit
I'mma gangsta by destiny, OG's selected me
I earned my spot, my whole team elected me

But 'less we rhyme time we see her do it again
She started out fuckin dudes that resembled her father
Mom knew shoulda schooled her but the bitch didn't bother
You couldn't blame her cuz she got it from her
She was a rider from jump, her pop's died in the hands of a chump
Now she's mad at the world, no more daddy's little girl
Now she's rockin bandanas, no more Shirley Temple girl
Now she be runnin wit some scramblers that be down in Alabama
Packin twin hammers, screamin ""Life doesn't matter""
It's a vicious cycle, her game is pretending to like you
Thinkin you getting head but she's just duckin so they can snipe you
Movin from state to state, runnin everything from guns to trains
And pushing packs from eight to eight
You know I can't say her name but she was a looker
Pretty thing, such a shame how this life has took her
Now she's raising hell in the cell, no more his are hollering
You might suffer the same fate if you repeat the following..

I can still remember shovels spillin dirt above (this bastard?)
I waited for an answer, but God ain't call
I'm hearing demons and the devils and the shots they call
They want Crack... I hopped up out the casket, that's it
Time for some action, consequence is very tragic
I call my crew the Darkside, we all ride
Keep them other crews running running like The Pharcyde

Walking through the desert conversating like it's you and me

To capture niggas for the deeds we do

Put you where the spare tyre be at: trunk space
Can heaven be just a distant memory?
They say you live a fast life and death'll come eventually
Maybe in my past life I wasn't listening

I can't get played, cause I roll with Baby Chris, nevertheless
Niggas be tryin' to front the role
When everybody knows, I'm gonna go gold
At least, kickin' the funky styles that you wanna hear
Joe is bigger and better, so have no fear
I'll be rippin' the mic, clockin' dough, stickin' the hoes
After every single show, you know (Know)
One of the best to grab the mic so don't try to front
Ain't nuttin here yours, so what the fuck you want?
When I step on stage, I'm second to none
Makin MC's run, without the use of a gun, yeah
Talkin' about the way I rock a party
Niggas must be thinkin' that I'm high or drunk on Bacardi
I be hippin' and hoppin', rockin' and shockin', the whole rap scene
I'm mean, my favorite color is green
I guess that's why they call it the blues
Your money you lose 'cause you choose to disrespect and neglect
The skills of the Fat one, but I'm all that, son
Gimme the microphone and I'ma show you how it's gonna be done
So don't fake moves 'cause I never fall

While I be rippin' the microphone and all my records are hits
The name is Fat Joe, I'm on the down low
I chill with Lord Finesse, you know I got the flow
I be freakin' the funk, not fakin' the funk, you're facin' a punk, yeah
Fuck around and you'll be layin' in the dumps

Most niggas that really know me got life as bids
The trife as kids, this ain't no Scarface shit
These niggas really will kill you, your wife, and kids
I walked through many blocks niggas couldn't stand on
Had shit locked before I had a Glock to even put my hands on
Before I had the dough to put my fams on
Before I had rocks sealed in pink tops, tryna get a gram off
A wild adolescent, raised by the street
Mesmorized by the dealers and the places they eat
And when they blazed the heat, I was the shorty to take the handoff
Run upstairs, tryna sneak the gat past grandmoms
This is how it should be done... my life...
Is identical to none, son tryed to duplicate but I knew he was fake
Cuz everytime I walked by he turned blue in the face
I'm like heavy on the leg when I pop
All my change is like heavy on the weight when I cop
It's just the way it's done
Niggas tell me they respect the way I blaze them guns
On hold it down for the Bronx in the name of Pun


Yeah uh, my name ring bells like a P.O
Put the pressure on a nigga like I'm right atcha do'
With the muzzle out, nigga can't shoke with my dough
I'm at his mothers house
Beat up his pops, put the pistol in his brother's mouth
Wave bricks, whips... jerked a few coke and next play the strip
With chrome knowin that they won't forget
And on the weekends we shut down clubs
You know them crazy Peurto Ricans always fuckin it up!
If I can't afford it, I'mma extort it
If I can't cut it, I'mma bake it
Strip you niggas butt-naked, I'm a thoroughbred
Carry guns and pump heroin
Never went O.T. I'm too light for Maryland
I'd rather play the streets of New York
Where the fiends are guarunteed to keep the meat on my fork
I'm just a hustler - feds put the tap
On our phones in hopes of cuffin us

Playin' Russian Roulette, never lost a bet yet
Bluffin, ain't my style, niggas ain't sayin nothin
Cause I'm buckwild without frontin
Raw to the core, I grew up poor
Once I hit the door, I began to explore
Curiosity killed my cat, but not me
Because I learned how to kill with agility
I grew up in the South Bronx, punch you in your mouth punk
I know these streets like Fred Sanford knows junk
In the trunk of a car lays a body
Head decapitated, bust him with my shotty
Stabbed the mug, to make sure, he wasn't comin back
Now police, can picture that, with a Kodak.. huh!
They can't stop me with a homicide investigation
Cause if they do my crew is hittin up the station
Your best bet, is to let me jet
Cause I bring war, like a vet, when I'm upset.. huh!
I'm not the one you wanna play out in a program

""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell em who the hell I am
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta""

Now on the hip-hop tip, I'm no joke
Get live at a jam, and leave a system broke when I spoke
MC's froze, but I never said freeze
Hopin I don't hit em like a fucked up disease
Fall up in the club, Mr. Hype for a night
Choke a rapper with a cord, hang him from the lights.. huh!
Now you do wanna mess around with the Fat Man
Cause you see my face in every newsstand
Every other magazine from Billboard to Spin
Pick it up and read Fat Joe strikes again
How true, I'm not about weed and brew
I'm just another papichulo like the rest of my crew
So give me the microphone
This jam is dedicated to my main man Tone
Cause he flips, and I flip, and we flip the script
And you know, you don't wanna get your ass WHIPPED
Party over here, another in the hospital
Lincoln, Memorial, notice that's how I sent you, hah
I was the one who played the shoot 'em up games

Or in the Benz, hurtin enemies and makin new friends
They shake my hand, smile in my face
The nine's in my waist, so there won't be a chase
That's it, the situation is blown out of proportion
When you leave, you must use caution
Look over your shoulder, even on your block
When I come to visit, you know you're in shock
So don't say who is it, act like you know
Kickin down doors is the Gangsta Fat Joe
And I got no time for games

Rappers wonder, where I been since _The Real_
I been plannin my strategy for the next kill
Ninety-five for the real live
Only the strong survive, that's why I pack a four-five

Yeah, (YO), uh, (oh God), haha
Haha (feedin you, feedin you)
Yo (feedin you, feedin you)

Yo, uh, yo, call me the JV artist
That means I own two joint ventures and two different labels, niggas that pay me homage
Been in this game for nine seasons
That's nine reasons why I'm expired the rhyme beefin
Ya'll niggas is rappin ass backwards
I left twenty spots since beginnin this rap shit
All yo papi lo que pasa contigo
Mad cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin like they wanna go hard
Spittin venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""
Bitch niggas, nothin but snitch niggas
Today you on my dick, tomorrow you on his nigga
Got deported from the Squad, can't afford another car
Where's your house at? I heard your livin with your moms (livin with your moms)
Blane nigga better stay in your place
Keep talkin, burst a flame in your face, motherfucker

Yo, yo, with this comparison the Geddy is God
Cause even though you never seen me, I been put fear in your hearts
And I'm smooth like a Mulo it theme
Skip bullets of your Coogi beam
Before you knew you were seen
Yeah I'm nice and I don't care if you know
Cause all you really need to understand is how hard I'm rulin with Joe
And the streets is no place for late bloomers
Just gangsta niggas, snakes and bitches that meant to spread rumors
Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost
Cause I move at night, plus I'm the type to play a live nigga close
I'm the ultimate, high consulted, rhyme vocalist
I write dope, spit dust and shit cocoa bricks
This is what you dicks need to act-knowledge
Or get the shit smacked outta ya fat cabbage
Don't ask why we act violent
We just killas and thugs
Niggas wit mad talent, that still dabble in drugs
I only rap now to speak to the streets
They say the Squad gotta feed 'em the beef
So we gonna feed 'em the beef

My nine milly blaze, and hit hard like Willy Mays
Since my kiddy days, grew up with thugs who were really crazed
Ain't no silly games, right here be the truth
150 proof, whoever, I'm talkin to you
They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin like I carin whats left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin at your best rebel, who runnin to test medal
Let me get settled, lay my mom down in this game
For niggas kinda refain, I push 'em down in the train
Bout it the same, my three cousins up in the Benz
Big, G Psycho and E, ya'll know what this is

Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a R a, a R a, O, R Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin 'til the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin 'til I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar

Yeah, uh infamous Terror Squad nigga
Loyalty, what does it mean to you
How many a ya'll niggas is loyal?
All these Benedict Arnold niggas
Switch sidin niggas, ya heard?
Nigga I throw this whole rap shit out the window in a sec, ya heard?
Joe Crack the Don Diggler
The savior, Caesar, the streets is mine nigga
We ride, who wanna test the record launcher, ya see 'em?
Uh, haha, feedin you, feedin you, feedin you
Make your move baby, c'mon
Step up baby
They're all gonna laugh at ya

Yo, Check my philosophy - Happiness ain't all about monopoly
I put aside the guns & robberies, see good guys copyin' me
The good times is here, rainy days is clear
You wanna go where everybody knows your name like ""Cheers""
Where problems is all the same and we got stories to share
Where you don't have to look for joy in a bottle of beer
See what I'm sayin? Stop feelin' sorry for yourself
Besides, those shots of Jack Heed's bad for your health
Understand tough people last, tough times don't
Some get up off they ass, and nigga, some just won't
Take the bad with the good, cuz the good ain't far
This is the stuff dreams are made of - shoot for the stars
The good times


Big Celebration, we havin' a big celebration
We havin' a big celebration
Celebration,  celebration, big celebration
Hey we havin' a celebration

Havin' a wonderful day
Rememberin' the good times
And the niggas who ain't here for the celebration
We roll up a blunt, and pour out the liquor
Whateva you want, we got it
It's probably in there, plenty reefer
Smoke is blowin' in the wind yeah
Just inhale, exhale...
Feel it whateva your problem is, it won't be one no more
And if you're laid off 
Sit down and take a load off
You deserve it, fuck what you heard, fuck the world
And let the Buddah soothe ya, ooh ya
Better not let the quicker system ""Boo"" ya
Krayzie makes the world. I thenk God for my good times




Yeah, uh, Now I'm 25, and It's a brand new scene
I'm makin' rap pits straight flossin' on the TV screen
Know wha' I mean, life's sweet to me
In times we used to front, now speak to me
I'm feelin' all right, keepin' them girls happy all night
Baby hold tight, when Joey takes you for a long ride
What was once a dream is now reality
And I'm glad I never listened to haters thet said it'd never be
Remember me? the fat kid from Trinity
Who was once a public enemy is now a loved celebrity
If Joe could do it, It could happen to you
Set goals, and keep your weight up

Pranksta wanksta-ass niggas
You know roses on caskets of those that oppose the squadus
Fuck tri-borough, we reppin five borough
Get at these niggas straight music!

Yo, Friday night, woke up in a cold sweat
I can't believe niggas schemin on Jo-seph
Nah man, this ain't the way it's goin down
Niggas talk too much shit, and I jump like the sound
They fear my presence like the rest of them
Jose's the bettin informer, flesh-n-blood like the president
Now maybe I'm a target on the pedastal
Got a little fame now, niggas wanna harm me for my revenues
Start ya little beef, that's the shit I love to eat
I been a soldier, you a son, be a humble seed
My own niggas let them hoes make 'em envy
Posin like they friendly when I'm knowin they resent me
That's the shit that get me aggrevated
It be the same niggas in ya face talkin bout ""I'm glad ya made it""
Fake niggas.. Jers' State niggas..
Funny how cake can make ya learn to hate niggas
You've now tuned in to the sounds of Jose
Where we push sex, money, drugs, and violence all day
Mostly heard in penals and project hallways
And by niggas blowin trees out the back of O.J.'s

(O) The ones that get knocked is bound to turn snitches!

Baby you bad as fuck, but when I'm done you be lookin so clean

High heels, the chrome wheels, and you standin up
Better clothes, from head to toe, the stiletto
Got the stereo, I see your trunk

Let me put you in the game (let me put you in the game)
And mami you already know, I'm spendin dough
And you gon' be the baddest thing, on the road

She said she never seen a car, with the seat in the middle
She tried to bite my chain, she thought it was some Skittles
I don't be runnin game, I just be runnin riddles
Have her hittin high notes, like my dick comes with a fiddle
Now I'm twenty-fo' inches on the grizzound, grizzound, uh-oh
Anything you want to touch I tizzown, tizzown, uh-oh
Puffin on that haze I'm talkin pizzounds, pizzounds, uh-oh
Gotta get that money that's how we get down, get down, ya!
Suicide doors, I'm so Kobain
Louis camou' jacket, the bah is the same
Jesus Joey Crack you must be sellin cocaine
Cause they don't make no money like that in the rap game
Mister Mister Rainman, yeah I can make it rain
Top blown off, and I ain't even aim
Yankee hat back, the seats on lean
And no that's not a car, that's a fuckin airplane

Party with two - wait I guarantee I'll have you smillin

Crack, nigga!
Darkside, yeah, yo

Tryin' to cut the top off the Porsche
Put a bitch in the front
Better yet hundred sticks for the niggas that front
I got a steel in them packs, got 'em right in the trunk
Shoot the snap back off your muh'fuckin' head if you want
I got a guardian angel, yeah she stay in the hood
And she pop up whenever I touch the grain on the wood
I got a bitch from Atlanta, she remind me of Pebbles
Got a hell of an ass, this redbone is a devil
She call me Marty McFly, Nike Back To The Future
10 racks on my feet, but that's somethin' I'm used to
I put my team on the map, you other niggas is fake
Worse than Oregon, you switch a different jersey a day
I'm in the beach somewhere foreign
I'm in your bitch while you snorin'
A million cash off the tour, then I'm back in the mornin'
I'm fuckin' sick of you niggas, I'm about to throw up a million
Doctor oz in the kitchen: cook a perfect prescription

Yeah, gold prezzie, gold prezzie, rollin' in Bugattis
I got that Ringo Starr
I'm slingin' Paul McCartney
Bitch I'm in the kitchen with that Arm & Hammer
Whipping George Harrison, John Lennon
Dopeman! Dopeman!
Dopeman bitch, I'm the dopeman
Bitch I'm in the kitchen with that Arm & Hammer
Whippin' George Harrison, John Lennon

Of course I could get 'em
But do you know what to do with 'em?
60 for the brick even if you cop a few of 'em
Talkin' about that diesel: the root of all evil
You could use your nostrils, or you could use a needle
I need a hundred more, and I want it pure
'Cause when somebody die off it
Then they want it more!
The hustlers we surrounded by niggas that hold the hammers
Oxys got generic, switched it to Opana's
When you give 'em a 9 or better they go bananas
Make a million dollars a month: that's what the plan was
Now to catch the mornin' shift
'Cause they need that mornin' sniff
Thousand bundles finished by 11, then I'm blowin' a spliff
Show you how to get right, crib right, whip right
Ten dollars a bag, but it's 20 after midnight
Pill man, weed man, stove man, coke man
You know who I am motherfucker: I'm the dopeman

Yeah, gold prezzie, gold prezzie, rollin' in Bugattis
I got that Ringo Starr

Bitch I'm in the kitchen with that Arm & Hammer
Whippin' George Harrison, John Lennon

Yo, cut the man off the middle, I want it all off the top
'Bout to yacht me a nigga, run him off of the block
I'm takin' all of the profit, purchasin' more of the product
Invest in killers and dealers to take my company public
I got a thing for them strippers, got a pole in the mansion
White hoe, (?) Marilyn Manson
This for all of my niggas doin' time up in prison
For getting caught with the burner, you know a rider's ambition
I'm 'bout to gamble with life, take a trip out to Vegas
I'm 'bout a Zionist mic prayin' the Lord to forsake us
Remember times I was broke, how it run in your pocket
Spend my money on dope, then I tripled my profit
Now I'm a multi-millionaire, head off in the lair
Take bitches on the private, than set off in the Lear

""What you say nigga?""
""I said I'll suck yo dick!""

A face gets bashed in for street crews clashin
Forever be forever great
It's the same shit tomorrow, eulogies of sorrow
Nonstop dramas, chumps think they hard smokin ?
It's all for steel my son, light as a tongue
The connections I got, I can lamp while you get done
Remember that, I dismember cats that act
A plain and simple fact is I react on impact
I'm plenty versatile, wild
Have you screamin like your head short a few vials
No more slabs and dollar cabs
Strictly Lexus Coupes with my troops feel the Alpine blast
Extra dark tints, for sticky events
Suspense makes the lead dispense
A baby oil massage when I'm feelin intense
Fly mami's with ki's taped to their bo-ties
Transportin through a airport securities
In cahoots with the San Juan authorities
Hated by majorities, loved by minorities

While you suckers havin limousine dreams

Give her some growth
Waited till I touch the cat
Told she going have to work if she going get ahead
Then she drove me berserk when she game me some head
She told me that she learnt that from the porno flicks
I said Mami stop talking
Just suck on this dick
I ain't say her name yet so let's say she nothing
Now watch me turn this nothing into something
Get it
Mami, Get in that kitchen
This is free base
Just cook it till its hard then cut it in eighths
Take the trip cross town to see True
Just get the money don't listen
That Nigga think he cute
See all this money we got we going shopping

We get it poppin
We hit the club on some clico shit

I knew she had her own
She was pushin' the bubble X
Type of eye candy that you see in the Double X
Fat Ass, Long Hair
Short like Nia Long
I knew she was a victim from the start
My G is strong
And then she said she ain't felt this good in ten summers
Gave me credit card and debit card with pin numbers
I'm lookin' at receipts
She spent G's on the kid
I'm pushin' her V
Even got keys to the crib
If I needed to bag up
I bought G's to the crib
I got knocked - What she did
Put up the deed to the crib
Now she got a new gig at Chase Manhattan
Look my niggas is wit Ma
Let's make it happen
So I burst through the door bout a quarter to four
Told every nosey bitch
Get the fuck on the floor
Then she opened up the bag
And started to fill 'em all
Making sure that she left the marked money in the drawer
Told security if you move
This goin' be your last night
I'm working with this Mack ten
You workin' with a flash light
I'm walking backwards
Nobody moved word to mother
Tryin' not look - cause I don't want to blow her cover
That's when this bitch winks and blew a kiss at me
I don't believe this bitch took all them risks for me
That why

Can a gangster go to heaven

I call it survival you call it a sin

I got a story to tell
Yeah, I got a story to tell

Yeah I'm right here
Gun in my right palm
Nigga tried and trap me and cage me like my san
Oh shit this mic on
I'm speaking my thoughts Nigga
You catch a hundred if you speaking in court
I'm feeling like Michael
Just before the verdict
Sweat on my forehead
I'm anxious and nervous
These streets ull eat you if you let em
Cop ull beat you
You pumping diesel then them Jack boys ull beat you
I try and listen more and speak less
Cause all that Barber shop talking ull put a Nigga to deep rest
You on the corner and I'm flying buy
Some foreign exotic mo' fucker
You know we flying buy
Oh you got nine lives
I got a pine box
You might as well hop your ass in it cause my iron popped
And I ain't lying Ac
Yeah I'm lionheart
Run up on anybody that's supplying my block


I know this Nigga named Shaheim
An old school cat
Did Football numbers
And never once rat
Now he back on the block got em slinging them packs
And his rep's kind of crazy
Known for slinging them Macks
Got a baby with Sandra
Names him K-Sacks
Cause that's where he did his first bid way back
Now this Nigga Sha' got like a memory lapse
Basically you give him work and he ain't payin' back
Now with some connects you could away with that
But he must of fucked wit the wrong Columbian cats
Now these niggas comin' strapped they want they money back
And you can't tell the difference cause some of them look black
Now Sha on the block thinkin' life's a joke
And his Mama just had a dream that he might get smoked
But he don't give a fuck he been through the best wars
Knife to knife
The yard to mess halls
And these niggas here have something else in mine
Like a hundred shots fired at a pretzel less spine
Uh huh, you guessed it
Just a matter of time
Another soldier down he got hit with a nine
Dang


Nah I ain't a rapper
Motha fuck rap
They snitched on Kim
How lame is that
This game ain't shit
But snakes and rats
Fighting each other for loose change and scraps
My Nigga kicked you right on your back when you down
No life preservers
They wanna see you drown
Pull the trigger myself
They don't want know help
Now the only Nigga tell on myself is myself

TS Piece,Loyalty,2002.0,"Yeah uhh.......
You know what this is.....
The fat gangsta!!!

Maybe its the TS chain (I got em right)
Maybe its that Escalade (Come get em right)
Maybe its the way I do (Keep mammies like)
Joe I wanna fuck wit you (Keep saying that)
I dont know what it is
All I know it that this chick
Is gon leave wit me
Gon creep wit me
Gon freak wit me
Gon leave wit me


I know it seems every song, is about like the same old thing
But when you rich, ain't nuthin to do but fuckin hang
Eat good, spend money, count chunks of change
Keep mah ladies lookin good, when they touch the Range
Never fuck wit a bitch, if she can't be trained
Never live wit a chick, if she dont give brain
We could leave on trip, I got a private plane
I dont fly, but we could park it up and blaze
Joe's the God
And I know you need somethin to praise
Just have a lil faith, and you could be saved
Uhh, it's not mah fualt if they love the kid
It might be the chain or the whip
I dont know what it is



Umm, I dont mean no harm
But their ain't a chick sicka then Remy Ma
And all the hot boys wanna fuck wit Rem
And I dont turn em away
I'm like, I'm the bomb now
Wheres your gurl, dont matter to me
I'm way out of her league
She can't keep up to mah speed
Shes weak, she dont need to smoke weed
And wherever shes at
Is where she should be
Now, wheres your wife, I dont care
I'll be at the crib, when she ain't there
Baby do mah nails, and lace mah hair
Take me out on trips and pay the fare
Maybe



Damn, look at all the rocks he got
Ferrari drop 360,hard to top
The party's hot,all white linen affair
Im doin the suit thang, white Nike Airs
I'm in the middle of the crowd, like the Don is here
Shorty whistlin in mah ear
Told me what she wanna hear,she said
""We thuggin
Smokin on sumthin
Down to leave wit ya'll, As long as ya'll fuckin.""
Woo, thas how you do that there
See me wit mah boys, bring ya crew bak here
We ridin,she drivin
On our way to the crib, long fish arrivin

Maybe its the TS chain (I got em right)
Maybe its that Escalade(Come get em right)
Maybe its the way I do(Keep mamies like)
Joe I wanna fuck wit u(Keep sayin that)
I dont know what it is
All I know it that this chick
Gon leave wit me
Gon creep wit me
Gon freak wit me
Gon leave wit me
Gon leave wit me
Gon creep wit me

""Got another hit, of fresh air!!""
""Oooooh, got another hit!""

Platinum chains, down to my dick
I'm so sick, like flames, light up ya bitch
Get it hot like 'dro, and firin and pink slips
You at the club alone now she hidin in my whip (But kick it)
I know just what you need; you need to fuck with me
Cuz when you ballin with Joey you in another league
Somethin like Doji, Chloe diamonds, and better weed
I'm four-wheelin through roads you mighta never seen
Take you on trips, you know the minimal shit, the basic
Long as your dip is official, if we're twistin you lace it
Spit it amazin when I'm layin the mack game
I could, put 'em in chains and give 'em blings and cashy rings
Like delicious, thug passionate candy cane
Know you could, stay witcha mayne and just live plain
I ball with the best of them, flossin the emblem
First playa front get applause from T.S. and them (Clap my niggas)

 I know what bitches like (What?)
They wanna live it live
They want a nigga with eight figures that can give 'em ice
They wanna chill up in Villa with me every night
 Yeah pa you got it right
That's what my bitches like
But I know what niggas like (What?)
They wanna hit it right
They want a chick that's willin to strip on the first night (True)
The type of chick that'll make you forget about ya wife
 Yeah ma you got it right
That's what my niggas like

I pull up to the club in the truck
Like what, the FUCK, IS UP!
I stay out with the blunt, cuz I don't give a fuck
With, L-I-D niggas, know who I be
And I know what niggas like, niggas like me
Pretty Remy on the rocks in the V.I.P
See, niggas like menages and overnight parties
Butt naked bitches in the hotel lobby
I plays the bar cuz they don't charge me
Plus niggas like dogs to broads in white T's
Outside it's a fight over me
Cuz I'm with niggas like, ""Yeah, you better get it right""
""You know my shit is tight""
If you live we'll be fuckin today, as long as you ain't
Touchin my pay, this shit is nothin to me
I got my mind right, my money right, I'm pushin a Benz
Plus I'm a dime like (Whoa!) Got niggas lookin for Rem'

 I know what niggas like (What?)
They wanna hit it right
They want a chick that's willin to strip on the first night (True)
The type of chick that'll make you forget about ya wife (C'mon)

That's what my niggas like
I know what bitches like (What?)
They wanna live the life
They want a nigga with eight figures that can give 'em ice
They wanna chill up in Villa with me every night
 Yeah pa you got it right
That's what my bitches like

You know a lot mama
How be take a nice cruise to the Ba-ha-mas
With ice daquiris and jewels, picture
Just me and you under the palm trees
Up on the beach in your bikini and we feelin the breeze

But baby, I know just what you need
You need some Hennessey (Uh-huh)
And in a minute we'll finish it with a little me
Sex into sleepin on bedsheets outta Italy
Then send yo' ass back home without no energy

Yo, after I take you on a night on the town
We could, slide to the telly when nobody's around
The next-door neighbors complainin because they hearin the sound
 It's goin down da-down da-down, da-da-da-da-da-da down

 I know what bitches like (What?)
They wanna live it live
They want a nigga with eight figures that can give 'em ice
They wanna chill up in Villa with me every night

That's what my bitches like
But I know what niggas like (What?)

The Wild Life,Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.),2001,"Yeah, uh, dat gangsta shit!
Shout to my homies out west
The hoo-bangers!
Mack Deezy for Sheezy
All my niggas in the Bronx
Holdin them corners down
Ya heard? Get it right!

Joe crack's back, been a long time comin'
No mean to disrespect but a lot of y'alls frontin
Shook niggas, me and the Squad done took niggas
Flex drop bombs but you seem to overlook niggas
We the nicest in the game, even lifers know the name
Throwin blows like Tyson when he rained
Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin to get stock
Generate mills so I can buy back my old block
It's like the rap game's far from the crack game
Niggas is mad lame (How come?) They act tame
You can tell from my scars life is hard
Shot down in broad day light in front of my Mom's
And the feds never give up, they tryin to kill us
I'm stressed drinkin VSOP tearin my liver
Livin my life like I don't care
I'm out to take the throne
My mom's in the window hopin I'mma make it home
The streets is funny peeps'll kill you over decent money
'specially if you sleepin the do' keep it gully
I'm from the Bronx
Home of niggas that'll stomp you senseless
Don't resent this, I'm knowin that you comprehend this
It's the wild life, niggas done lost they mind
It's the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine
But could you blame them?
Niggas is brought up with anger
Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up by strangers

Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin, fight to eat
The enemies and the D's lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin up like ""Yo, why me?""

I never really had a pops
But who the fucks to blame
He did 13, and wonder why the steets my name
And heat's my game, cause I'm the type
To leak your frame, give you a slap
With the gat, so you can meet my pain
Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know
I ain't a killer but I still might clap at you though
You for real here, niggas be followin with steps
I made my own moves, so the talkers could swallow they breath
Acknowledge the best, and do what I did
Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma
This is life after death
I'm in it to win, ya heard?
From beginning to end, you could get shot
Even though you was considered a friend
Sometimes my minds driven to win
Tryin to scare society
But can't slip again cuz my lil' man rely on me
Everyday I put through a test
But still progress
I'm tryin to climb hills
And tryin to make me kill for less
Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin, fight to eat
The enemies and the dee lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin up
Like ""Yo, why me?""

Yo it's the wildlife
Straight kidnappin and carjackin
Yo it's the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin, we all packin
I'm a smash on anybody disrespectin the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin in work

I make it all go down right
In front of your face
Another life goes to waste
For names sake of the paper chase
It ain't safe here, the bright lights can blind you
Mix sedica, swallow you whole
They can't find you
Worst thing is walkin these streets
I need clarity, peace and prosperity
Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef
Niggas bumpin they gums and teeth
Straight to the police
Tryin to plant us six feet deep
But I ain't goin for that
My shit clap through your starter cap
Pull your socks back, we ain't runnin from nothin
Comin from nothin, makes you struggle harder for somethin
Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin
The wild life! Colder the nights
You niggas ain't nice, put yo money where yo mouth is
And roll the dice, puffin cannabis sativa
With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga
When I say, dont make me have to spray ya
Yo it's the wildlife
Straight kidnappin and carjackin
Yo it's the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin, we all packin
I'm a smash on anybody disrespectin the turf

Life Goes On,Loyalty,2002.0,"Yeah, uh, yeah, Loyalty, haha
She was sixteen maybe seventeen, uh
Who you gonna trust?
And Life Goes On (2002)
The timin ain't me, it's like, please goin through wrong
Speak the truth, haha, speak the truth, yeah, yo, yo

She was only sixteen, when I met her I was playin the corner
Had to scream one of her niggas, like get up off her
She was a diamond in the rough, real neighborhood jewel
You would never see her out, 'less she comin from school
At first we started out like sisters and brothers
'Till we finally let it out, and started kissin and huggin
And your moms always dissin me, tryin to get rid a me
I guess she figured out, I had taken your virginity
She was right, sexin all day
When they wouldn't let me in, we be playin the hallway
Talkin all day, bout the stupidest shit
Like if we got rich, what would we do with our chips?
And who was our favorite rappers, it was Nas at the time
We would memorize every single bar of his rhymes
Summertime, kids is playin in the park
I might just ride by, let 'em sprinkle the truck
And Life Goes On

She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
(was she a little more), haha ..
Yeah, huh, but Life Goes On
She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
Hahahaha, yeah, yeah, woof, uh, yo
But Life Goes On

This shit got deeper, you was havin my seed
I couldn't wait to see this little nigga look like me
Sure enough a little fat guy named D'Ryan
Kept us up all night, always bitchin and cryin
I was still slingin fast, when ""Flow Joe"" came out
Things changed, wasn't the same, wanted to hang out
The groupies was chasin me, rudely awakened me
No longer safe for me, this new world is takin me
You deserve much more than to be mistreated
I was a fucked up nigga, but at least I admit it
Just to be cool, I helped you through school
So you can have your own career, and don't depend on no fool
Life seems crazy when you look back
I pray to God, that you hook up with a good cat
We can't look at, who's right or who's wrong
But I thought I'd let you know through this song
That Life Goes On
 - w/ variations

So I moved on to the next phase a my life
I finally met the women I would make my wife
It was love at the first sight, in the worst way
Shorty kept holdin out, had me thirsty, mercy
Mi shari amor, whisper in my ear
Tell me baby girl is it me that you adore
Used to stay up all night, just bumpin and grindin
Makin plans for the future, how to hustle my rhyme in
Used to drive cross state for like a G a show
A well known famous rapper, but my pocket's is broke
But we kept grindin
Slowly but surely, kept climbin
Pun broke in the doors, now we headlinin
I'm lettin everybody know your my sweetest possession
How you kept me real strong through the deepest depression
Paid no mind to your friends, cause their words is trife
I hold you down for the rest of your life
Cause Life Goes On",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-life-goes-on-lyrics

You confused man, that shit don't even seem right
How you cats on your album only three mics?
Like 'Pac shit is funny to me
All you niggas livin bummy wasn't fuckin with me
Now nigga get it on, soon you be dead and gone
Shorty got a bubble all she need the silicone
Love my A-T-L bitches, pay my bail bitches
Type to let you fuck but never tell bitches
Down-ass hoes that'll grind that dough
Catch me with another chick and beat 'em down to a pulp
It's the F-A-T, to the, J-O-E
Drink Cris' with the Feds when they come for me
No cuffs, no guns, they respect a G
Number one with a slug, what you expect from me, huh?
Are you serious?

If you see a nigga frontin fake shit on his wrist
Walk around all night, same bottle of Cris'

Might get a little wheeze and a salty throat
So get the hell on with that, don't you even feel it
Get the hell on with that, I'm aight I'm chillin
Chicken neck-ass bitch tryna palm the dough
Should've charged me at the door, I woulda let you know
Coulda saved you a mouth full of head y mo'
Coulda made you a thug from the guy with the mo'
But yo, I ain't never met a chick that was innocent
They all fuck some, eat some, never kiss
I know a lot that got skeed on and that was it
See me in the video like, ""Bitch is suckin dick!""

You let him in at one time cause you thought he was fly
Now you see him at the clubs, he don't pay you no mind
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?
Yo, every time you smoke, dude puff your 'dro

Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?

Ludacris be the number one street - clown wishin 'em luck
Cause I'm bout to make 'em break a leg thinkin I'm givin a FUCK
And you catch a beat - down, bottles is breakin, craniums crack
Chairs thrown when the heat is attacked
And you hear the street - sound, hitters and runners
Killers and gunners, winter to summer the niggas that want us
Are headed East - bound, trouble in West other than South
Cover your chest, they cover your mouth
I'm goin deep - down Dirty indeed, birdies in need
Thirty degrees and you heard it from me
But I'm bout to reach - 'round grabbin my gun
They scatter and run but I'm handlin and havin some fun
They gotta keep - rounds up under the bed, up under the spread
If it ain't then it ain't, no wonder you dead
So go to sleep - now, throats is splitted
And folks that get it they gotta get the hell on widdit, BIATCH

Yo, yo, all these niggas that claim thug like they're the type
But when it's time to go to war they runnin for dear life
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?

That's my life without you girl
I'm so lonely I'm so blue
Without you girl my life is through
Maria
This song is dedicated
Maria - Don't you hear me calling
Maria To the most beautiful woman on the planet earth
Maria
That would be my mother Maria Cartegena

Ay yo, she's the best sister
One man love her
And if she died her tombstone would read
The world's greatest mother
August nineteenth she birthed me
I came out
Put her through hell but still in all she couldn't help but smile
I resemble my mama to be truthful
And I ain't got to describe her
You know she beautiful
Shit, I always love my mama
Blow holes through a Nigga if he touch my mama
You did whatever it took to keep the supper hot
And I remember when you worked at the number spot
Once the cops caught you I skipped school
Yeah I guess the cops was cool
They let me feed you
I cryed for hours till they finally freed you
Drop to my knees and screamed Mama we need you
Then you went back to school and got a job that's legal
Maria

Yeah Mami, I love you so much
For this pain, this love, you've been through so much
And I thank you for everything you done for us
You've been a survivor and we love you so much
I had to dedicate this song to you Mami
I had to tell the world how much I love you

Ay yo, yo yo
I never forget the night that changed out life
A neighbor was screaming Maria come out side
Something's wrong with your son I think he's getting high
Then you replied not my son he don't be getting high
Then you bathed him and tucked him to sleep
Yeah I knew from that day life wouldn't be sweet
He got in trouble with the law
Then you bailed him out
I got in trouble with the law then you bailed me out
It was one July the fourth
They tried to take me out
Shot me right in front of my mother
By Tracy's house
Now its time to change my life I think Rap's the answer
Same day I got signed you was diagnosed with Cancer
Doctor said it'd be a miracle if you survived
Then you looked in my eyes and said
Joey I don't want to die
I pray to god that he show us a sign
Now its fourteen years later and you still alive
Thank you God


God I thank you so much
My Mother has so much to see
So much to do
She's had such a painful life
Many nights I argue with you in my prayers but I know you're the boss
You kept her alive for a reason
Mama I'm a ride for you
I swear
Yo, I bet you proud of your son
He's a rap star now
Took you out of them projects and bought you that house
Got you that housekeeper to manicure the grounds
And I bought you that car that breaks the barrier of sound
You take care of Joey and I love you for that
And you raising John John and we love you for that
I guess Lisa was an Angel
God wanted her back
Damn I really miss my sister
Guess she's better where she's at
Mammy I love you
I want the world to know I love you
And every chance I get I'm a kiss you and hug you
Life wasn't easy everyday is a struggle
But like my niggas from Chi town say
It's all bubbles

Hoping my real mo'fuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
It's that shit right here
Took me like ten years to do
You know I cried doing this song
Man, so much pain
Mami you such a good woman
You a classy woman
I know you a private person
You don't want the world to know all your business
But I had to let them know how strong you are
I love you so much
This song is also dedicated to little Maria
One of my best friends on earth
Get your shit together girl I love you too
Juju what's up, you my nephew I love you for life

Aiyyo I said yes yes y'all-n, to the beat all-n
Always been no peace so I never like to ball in
But I maintain and keep a grip on the mic
And say a punchline that'll get the crowd hyped, RIGHT
I never could determine who's the best
It was either KRS or that nigga Lord Finesse
But now I maintain that's with my own career
Joe gettin gold dough or somethin wrong in here
Cause everybody knows I got the skills to pay the bills
Plus I got the flow cause you know +The *Hit is Real+
What? Top notch, I give you nuttin but the raw talent
But don't fake jax and make me have to get violent
You wouldn't like it when I flip the script
Cause when I flip the script, my Glock can have an empty clip
Yeah, straight from the Ave of Trinity
I hate it when a juvenile tries to prove his masculinity
I got the whole vicinity locked down
Police hate it, look what they done to 2Pac now
You make me wanna blast or somethin
But for now I keep infiltratin these crews that be frontin
And all these other MC's be hatin it

Otherwise I live the real live back in the BX
Known for transformin on rappers like I'm Jesus
You didn't know I order hits and what not?
Don't make me have to let the dogs loose
And hear the two-per shot, BOO-YA
Ain't it funny how nobody really cares
One minute you're here, the next minute you're under there
Word to Christ, I put out your lights
Every stripe's precise, K.O.'s in all fights

Boy you keep on turning me..
Love the way you turn me on
When you got me singing this song
Love the way you turn me on

Yo, push your seat back, ma feel who you rolling wit
Relax, and let Crack take control of this
Have some 'Gnac, Hennessy and Coka Cola mix
To stop at 1-6-5 for that potent shit
So now we rolling this, it's nine fifteen
I'm sure you know where we going but time is the key
Let's smoke a lil, climb high in tha trees
Choke a lil while my hand rub your thigh and your knees
You know that silly shit, and now it's ten on six
We in the village jus a lil ripped
Pumping Jodeci while a nigga whip
And watch you marinate, feel free to sing along while I navigate
This is your song ma, crackalate
So when it's time to get it on she gon know that it's wrong to procrastinate
Steady saying that I'm turning her on, I'm like ""I know""
Didn't your friends tell you that you fucking wit Joe? Oh boy


Yo, smooth cuz I don't get upset
If she ain't wit it then cool, I can go without sex
I ain't gotta spend big for a girl at Mya
We could, go to Papayas and, talk the night up
Tell me bout yourself, your hopes, your dreams, your struggles
I'm tryna ta front but I'm feelin ta touch you
I got the heat on blast, I bet you thinkin like ""He want ass""
But still you thinkin that you might
Playin the rules, pretendin to be a fool
When you ask silly questions like ""What we gon do?""
I'mma leave it your hands, let you make your move
Now you want me to stay over, games over

 Oooh, you sex it baby, ahhh, jus shake it mama
 Yeah
 Bag it up, sing this song
 Love it when you turn me on

Yo, now it's on, shorty's strippin in the living room
My heart racing cuz I know I'm gon hit it soon
Pop that ass, sit it on my lap
Don't stop like that, put it on Crack
Let me beat it from the back, now I'm pounding it right
Wearing a thong on my head cuz you know I'm wild for tonight
When we done talk a lil bit to keep her in the groove

Got crates full of bass, got pills, got ones
And everybody knows that, Joey got a gun
I got that ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper, yes I'm a hustler
A to the K with the motherfuckin muffler
Heed when the God speak, when I squeeze my palm squeak
Drop more shells on your block than Palm Beach
Don't do it, don't do it, shit Joey don't do it
I said fuck it I'mma push this shit back to the future
Niggas call me German so I hit 'em with the Ruger
Bullets like Easy Pass, they run right through ya
Got the supersoaker for superjokers to supertorch ya
Stupid is what stupid does, now move it Coka
I'mma prove it's over, you ain't got a chance
And I don't even need a gun, I know how to dance


Yeah, uhh
Joey got a gun, and everybody know
That black kitted car stash box where it go
Fo'-fo' long, told Curtis he could hold that
Run in your hotel room, and take yo' gat
Got old guns for new niggas, my throwback
And I ain't talkin 'bout music, get your soul clapped
Canons so big, bounce, they exit
Play Superman, fuck around, get your S split
42 shots to the chest, where your vest went?
No more passes for niggas, no exceptions
Got the goons with me and them niggas kinda desperate
Give a nigga a job like Tony, do reception

Lord forgive me temptation to kill
But I gotta give these crackheads the definition of real
Motherfucker die - don't look in my eye
Take this wit'cha nigga, tell the devil I sent ya

Yup! Death ain't sweet man
But it's a fact that one day ya breath gon' cease
Some niggas get cremated, others rest in peace
You can get shot tomorrow if you test these streets
Go against Crack - hehehe - that's a problem
I'm a driveby, stabbin, napalm kinda problem
Choose one, the AK or revolver
I'll leave your body leakin layin on the carpet
Yeah, this nigga don't care
Have your head spinnin like that chick Linda Blair
I'm the Exorcist, niggas don't know when they exit is
But I keep a K that cause a mass exo-dus
You don't want no problems, problems
Fuckin with these frauders {?}
I had the ambulance racin the street
Have your poor momma raisin the sheets, muh'fucker


Let me tell you 'bout myself, you can find me alone
On the streets of the Bronx, that's the county I own
Well at least that's the one I'm claimin
You know a muh'fucker that's realer then name him
Damn near a decade done passed and we still on top
My nigga Pun died, niggas thought the shit gon' stop
I'm not concerned with the rumors and the small talk
Thought a nigga learned when he caught it and he walked off
Shoulda put the burn to a nigga so he'd slow down
Niggas won't be thinkin, that's it rap, when it go down
In L.A. we got Bloods and Crips, in Chi-Town the Kings
Got other mob bosses kissin my ring
Don't confuse me wit'cha favorite MC
Difference is this mans'll kill him as a favor for me
Until then it's just...


Yo - wake up in a cold sweat
5:15 in the mornin, hear my phone ring
It's my nigga Ant speedin, slow down dog
You actin like the po-po chasin ya, be easy
He tellin me, ""Crack where the fuck is you at?""
I'm at the hotel Radisson, hour ago
I did a show out in Patterson, took the bitch home
Nigga you know she was the baddest one, as was the Fattest one
This nigga Ant yell, ""Crack what's her name?""
Carmen, why you stallin, why the fuck you callin
He said, ""Joe they tryin to set you up
Put you six feet deep tryin to wet you up
You know that nigga Pablo from... Ave
Now he push pounds of blow, niggas swear he bad""
Yeah, Mr. Friendly, he's pussy I bet'cha
Nah he sent his sister to the club to come get'cha

All we do is speak the truth
Shit is realla then real
Shit is realla then real
My true niggas walk wit me, yeah
They ride wit me, cook pies wit me, ya heard?

Lord I keep hollering, I hope you listening
How come I'm still stressed and even though the squad's glistening?
Why you had to take Pun, someone so young
Had so much more to live for, as real as they come
Dead man can't talk that's why your hearing one side of the story
But did they tell you how he provided for forty
Family members, grandmas to shorties
Even my seeds ate off the big homie
How could you deceive your kids like that?
Make 'em believe they dad wasn't worth jack
Listen to the facts as The Don pours his heart on this track
How could I jus stand there and not react?
And I'm jus about sick of all you side line niggas
You know, do anything for the lime light niggas
I'm defending your honor, my brother from anotha momma
I never thought I'd see the day they tried to send you byna

Shit is realla then you think, man you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Jus a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed
The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you, will end up with your wifey
I've seen it all that's why I've picked up the pen
To keep your boy from serving life in the pen, ya heard?

Fuck, the flu season, nowadays it's sue season
Can't even go to the clubs and show my people love
Cuz soon as shit pop off niggas knuckle love
Niggas accusing me of fuckin 'em up!
I'm like ""hold up, ain't they supposed to be dogs?""
Part time live niggas dabbeling drugs
See a rapper think of a lucrative deal
But youse a bitch if you choosing to squeel
It's more than obvious you don't know a thing about honor
But what goes around comes around, you'll soon learn about karma-
As for me I stay being the realest
Admired by politicans, street thugs and killers
I keep feeding the street but the street feed back
Is that police tryna see Joe back in green slacks
But never that, see I keep long money
And if you looking for that you'll never see a cent from me
Motherfucker!


Yo, unh, I stay grinding, everybody counted me out
Now I'm rewinding in my summer beach house
If I'm not in the studio I'm out on tour
Busting my ass to make my fans future secure
Nowadays everybody want somethin for nothin
All of a sudden niggas talkin like ""Joey be frontin""
The hood screaming Crack done changed, he don't holla
I know now B.I.G., Mo Money Mo Problems
Jealousy's a muthafucka
Who'd a thought the same niggas you be feeding be the muthafuckaz coming for ya
I'm not stressin, I was born a warrior
Plus I'm too big, too strong, too wise for ya
When it's all said and done I follow my dreams
Could have ended up dead or in jail given the scheme of things
To let you know I'm the reason you still walking
If I said something it was me, not the liquor talking",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-shit-is-real-pt-iii-lyrics

Kilka, kills mania
Get used to this one

Oh yeah I'm back on that shit
And I say right about now New York City
They say is life and death, there's no future fronting
I see a mac and a tec keeping duz coming
Coka
Joe is a fake Cartagegna
Nice with the hands better with the banger
Guns I'm no stranger
Keep an A.K when I battle probably throw a fake nigga parade. I'm known!
But who gives a fuck I don't care
Don't lead them let the welfare feed them
Niggas had me thinking that Joey is fucked up!
Skiddles with the maybachs banging rooftops
Life sucks for you maybe the Jew is crazy
In the stay pieces to death thanks to who baby

Stay cleaned up on a preacher on a sunday morning, I got cake but I need more ice and alle
I say off the streets I'm a symphony, niggas want my sympathy presiding official remedy
Stay cleaned up on a preacher on a sunday morning
King of New york, King of New York, but we don't ever see these niggas up in New york
Can anybody tell me where's St. Tropez
All these so called killers try their best to dress gay
Everybody beefing it's the same old day
All these mixtape rappers now want to claim king
Everybody saying they are bringing New Yor back
But we the only niggas you pitch back the back(crack!)
You hear the echo, son of a nesto I'll let the tec blow
You should feel sky plenty like pistol, fuck a phone call I barely got a whistle, nigga

Coka, there's no one harder
Get off your knees get a job at the carter
Throw a banks and invite your friends
Yougarentee to see a couple of ends
See I've been getting money since who knows when
These other niggas just all pretend
You've been bamboozled diz duzu say thugs
Love at madison square they givin group hugs
Now let me take you to the streets of darkness, where I keep your favourite mc underneath my armpit the bronze kid
I'm only speaking the truth

Hustlin’,The Fast and the Furious (Soundtrack),UnKnown,"Uhh, T.S.!
None better (Bronx niggas, uhh)
Life of a hustler (ha-hah, what'chu know about that?)
Yo, yo, yo
Yo the mind of a hustler be trained to count money and lies
Supplying customers and keepin' peace suspended in time
Pop another thug that's tryin to scream but they dimes
Hoppin all the clubs in town, they don't need to wear shines
They got that energy, confident and always aware
Who's watchin them, bitches on top of them, they don't just be near
Probably spot poppy and them they robbed last year
And just, nod and stare and show no fear
Cause nine times out of ten this bitch connects this kid to shoot you
They too hot so catchin a body's too crucial
If you a hustler, I know you relate
Whether you home base or go out of state
This shit is real
And you better recognize when you see 'em, these niggas kill
A whole 'nother drug dealer keep 'em with steels
So be creepin so it's real on the deal, with the F-E-D
Some of them sleep in six feet cause they skrilled

Fuckin with hustlers - you see us in the clubs
Everybody wanna be us, wife beaters and flip drugs
We them hustlers - a little thug's role model
Where the snub full of hollows tryna earn a little power
He a hustler - some of us locked for eternity
Get shot down and murdered in beef or turnin for police
Hustlers - yeah, you know what the sparks done
You know where we evolve from, you know when the heart's pump
Hustlin

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
See life a style, now it's rappin, how you push packs in large amounts
And never spend a day in life movin them cats about?
That's not what crack's about; I cooked it, cut it and lift it
From Brooklyn to one-sixty fifth, I took bricks and flip shit
Clips I sit 'em even whip some women from runnin they lips
And gettin me in the middle of shit with other niggas
And real dealers don't be yappin on the phone
What you think, father born?  Don't be caskets and clothes
C'mon y'all know niggas slip, speakin a joke
There go the dial tone, click, now you steamin with holes
Y'all motherfuckers couldn't fathom what's about to go down
Like a year from now, when the bears get out
From a ten-year stretch down to air shit out
Make him a man, show your heart when I tear it out
They say hustlin is the key to success, and on that note
I can feed you niggas for less, I got mad coke


Yeah, it's for all my hustlin niggas
All my liquid dime niggas
All my niggas flippin bricks out there, yeah
All my niggas in the Columbia brother suits
In the pourin rain, tryna get your shit on

Suckers better duck, buck buck buck buck!

Yeah, and the Bronx is my territory
Suckers getting sprayed, end of story
Whether one deep or with my crew
I pack a .45, my girl packs a .22
Huh, so you know I'm all right
If niggas want beef, then I give 'em a hell of a fight
Yeah, I'm quick to blow a nigga out the frame
I'm insane, pushing punks in front of a train
Cause I don't have it up to here
Talking about skins, I have more than Richard Gere
Yeah, cause I got it like that
It ain't hard to tell that Joe is living fat
How I last and surpass any nigga who shows his ass
Is gonna end up getting blast
Run for jewels and give me the cash
Everybody knows I got this in a smash
Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) (Repeat 4x)
Aw shit, another brother hit
This time it's Tone, life is a fucking bitch
It really hurts when the shit hits home
Early in the morning, they calling me on the phone
Telling me my man caught eight to the chest
Nah, this couldn't be, Tone always wore a vest
But that's the way the story goes
Today you're here, and tomorrow who knows?
Man I'm gonna miss him, I love him to death
Charlie's in jail and I'm the only brother left
It's time to get strong, forget about the sorrow
But like Ike said, no one is promised tomorrow
Fuck the bullshitting, it's time to get cash
Don't fuck with me cause I got this in a smash
Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) (Repeat 4x)
Well it's the F-A-T, Gang S-T-E-R

525 and I'm crazy live
Not all the loot in the world could make me take a dive
Fucking mad bitches on the first date
Straight to the telly, hit the skins, I gotta skate
See, I got no time for a stunt
Because a 40 and a blunt, that's all she really wants
Yeah, so dough keeps collecting PC
Knocking out punks with my man Diamond D
Cause everybody knows I'm the man
And if you fuck with me, then shit'll hit the fan
I took mad flicks since '76
Robbing every other brother for their motherfucking kicks
I once heard a kid say he's his brother's keeper
His brother turned around and bust him with a street sweeper
Everybody wants the cash
But don't fuck with me cause I got this in a smash

Fresh pair of J's and some P.R.Ps, you know?

Mink flow in the wind that'll move PETA
Give me a pot and a stove and I could move pieces
Thirty six of them O's, I bought a Mona Lisa
Got more white chicks than a sorority house
While Fox News quick to point minorities out
I got a Mexicana chick, bad Dominicana
Pointed her out the crowd and her son's a punta cana
Put her in some pumps and designer Chanels

Born in the Ghetto,Loyalty,2002.0," - *Lamajic talks & harmonizes in background*
Yeah, it's time baby
It's time to speak the truth, maturity
Huh, niggas gotta evolve to let niggas know the real
Ya call yourself real, ya gotta start speakin about the real
This is Joe Crack The Don, and this is what I'm bringin to you

Uh, yo, nowadays, I'm flirtin with uncertain death
Lord I gotta be dyin, cause after all this cryin, how much more hurtin's left?
When will the pain stop?
This depression and anxiety, is gonna make me show another side of me
My niggas ride with me cause I'm the truth
There's benefits to rollin with this clique, don't nobody fuck with you
Still they label me a tyrant and a backstabber
But study the facts of crack, the shit don't add up
I'm bringin opportunity to my community
Probably the only rapper that cares, but still you out to ruin me
Who you foolin B? I'm for unity, latins and blacks
Could you fathom the strength, we have of the two it attach
Born together, voted alike
These uncle charm politicians ain't holdin us right
How could the same nigga be 20 years in office
When it's clear the only thing that's risin is unemployment
Abortion, little kids havin kids
The school system is failing us, now ain't that some shit
While the rich keep gettin richer, the poor keep dyin young
I can't hide no more, the time has come
 - w/ ad libs
I was born in the ghetto
Tremblin, tryin' a stay alive
Cause when you're born in the ghetto
No one seems to hear your cry

Brown skin, you know I love my bra-ha-own skin
Everyday I'm confronted with racism
These motherfuckin coppers, wanna bag us and have us shackled up in state prisons
After all the taxes I pay
You would think when they stop us, they would have something nicer to say
Than ""get the fuck out the car, where the drugs at?
All the jewelry you wearin, where the fuckin guns at?""
Once they search the car clean and find nothin
The same crooked cops try to act like they know us or somethin
Laughin, tellin jokes by the thousands
Two seconds ago they tried to send us to the mountains
Leave my son without a father, my wife without a husband
The more I think about it, man it's just disgusting
Still we live amongst 'em, everybody wants out
That's why we rap like we got silver spoons in our mouths
Like we ain't grow up on welfare
Nigga don't even go there, you probably wore Pro Players
We need to educate the youth, tell our seeds the truth
Too much to share, the bare minimum will exceed the proof


Oh, yeah, so much pain
Tryin hard to stay alive, stay alive
Out in these streets, oooh (*harmonizing*)
Man sometimes in can get so tough
Oh yeah, yes it can
Yes it can, yeah
It can get so hard, so hard, so hard",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-born-in-the-ghetto-lyrics

Peace to my brothers on 163rd
Hold your head and stay strong
My main man Roadie got it going on
So now you know the time
Bust how I flip it, check the rhyme
I kick the hits even with the big belly
Cause I freak the funk like my man R. Kelly
So give me that honey love
You know what I'm thinking of
Joe's the man with the master plan
I got more rhymes than the beats got fans
Peace to Greg Nice and Smooth B

That I'll be the last to survive
I won't fake the funk, I won't take a dive

Peace to the whole Zulu Nation
I'm so bad, call the cops
I got props, I'm gonna rule hip-hop
Cause I'm the only real rap monster
I love eating shrimp and lobster
City Island is my favorite place
Step in Sammy's and dog my face
Losing weight, that must be a joke
Cause I eat four steaks and drink a Diet Coke
Although I'm big I won't take a swig
Of the Moet, it makes me a much worse poet
And you know that's not the mood, black
Diamond always hits me with the crazy fat tracks
So now you know what's up
I make the crowd bounce, get on up

They'll have a Fat Joe tour
Coming to your town with the brand new sound
Representing for the whole Boogie Down
So don't grab the mic or you'll get hurt
If you come in a Bez then you'll leave in a hearse

Misbehave and you'll dig your own grave

Screamin fo' they life

Gotta funny feelin that
They teamin on the heist
Scheemin on the ice
Won't get you nothin but killed
Front if you will, get chopped up
Stuffed in the quill
Back to the lab, got these niggas
After my math, these hoes try to play it off
But they captain is back
They must have teamed up
With some niggas thinkin they sweet
Like I just rapped and
I got a ho waitin in the street
I'm playin for keeps, I see 'em
Creepin on the moniters
Got my temperature risin faster than thermometers
I burn banana clips, make all
My victories unanimous
I'm accurate, once I catch a peak
Hey man, yo ass is hit!
Now I see 'em creepin through the front door
I think not! We exchange shots
Like cops into getting blocked{*gunshot*}
He busts, I bust back{*gunshot*}
He caught one in the chest
The other two got hit up
In the stomache and neck{*gunshots*}
I'm under the desk, freeloading
Puttin slugs in the rest
Wonderin what possessed these niggas
To come in my rest!{*gunshots*}

I’m a Hit That,Represent,1993.0,"Baby come and see me, I know you want to see me
The brothers out there fronting that only want to be me
They don't really have it, yo missy you can grab it
So open nice and wide so I can start to stab it
Before I do my duty, really knock the booty
I want to let you know you're a real hot cutie
Baby it's time, I gotta go for mine
We can rub a dub or wine wine wine
I can take you up or be very gentle
Whatever you want, cause it's all in the mental
See, I'm a pour silver, all over your body
Get you real freaky, I know you love it, hottie
Baby, I'm a lick you, tell me does it tickle
I won't hit the skins if it smells like pickle
Smooth like butter, though I won't stutter
Sit on my lap if you really wanna
Get with the man who really knows how
To knock the boots, God bless the child
So don't try to front and give me your back
Cause you and I know I'm a hit that
""Skins, you got 'em"" ""Hit it!"" (Repeat 4x)
Man I really love it, yo I really need it
I have a fat jimmy and I have to feed it
Sometimes I'm filled with humor, I know a girl named Zuma
We hit the sack once, then she started rumors
Telling all the chicks that I was really good
I'm big like a train, but I'm the man that could
Give you what you need, give you what you want
I guess I'm like Kenieval, cause yo I love stunts
We could get together, whatever is clever
I used to watch Dynasty just to see Heather
That was then, and now is now
And if Heather ever sees me, she'll scream ""Wow""
The big man of rap, and even more nosey
I'm gonna flip, but yo I got hoes
Don't try to front and give me your back
Because you and I know I'm a hit that

Me? I gotta get it, I gotta get money habit
I grew up livin' savage' ain't no need in goin' backwards
Unless you talkin' Biggie and Hypnotize, that's a classic
My life story nothin' short of monumental
The way I work the max I got a golden M emblem
Some would say a legend, I'm aight with movin' kilos
Three on the neck, a couple more for my amigos
Trap jumpin', Michael Jordan, Carolina Tar Heels
Pumpin' Action Bronson shit'll you doin' cartwheels
Different kinda bounce, slayed niggas might not recover
Face of death row, I ain't talkin' Vibe covers
But since you talkin' 90's, that was me with the chainsaw
I'm just tryna see if the beef would remain raw
I just want the pussy and please don't say more
And quit askin' question 'bout what the AK for
I stick it out the window, start blastin' it
Bullets flyin', niggas duckin', like it's classic shit
Speed off right after I heat up your girl's car
Last thing you wanna hear is, ""Worldstar""

So I'ma drop this gem to let these rappers know it's time to change they game plan
Supply the bass plus I'm the flame man
The catalyst that sparks you for it's visions
Making use this thing more passionate
Paper advocate, dawg
Ain't it crazy how through many acts of savage sacrilege I got The sand man let it go from all the bad I did, then come up on a thing of sacrament?
That's an omen, so your boy on Terror Squad ain't no accident
Cannabis got me chasin' after mo' bread
Young nigga, 20, with the knowledge of an old head
Infrared beams get your dome fed
Mass looks for actin' up, watch you fade away for not backin' up
I crack a dutch every hour on the dot
When my minions is we plot, more methods of collectin' to the day I cop the spot
On an island with a model that can't stand to wear a top

The truth is you be talkin shit with no proof
Still pussy after all that loot
Smack you right in front of your troops
You know how we do, pakinamac in the back of the coup
You loose, that's why you gon get it
Me and my squad is known to set it
Front guard and get ahead of this
It's pathematic how you run the streets
I bring guns to beef, while you send your son to speech
We a hundred deep and stay bustin the heat
Puttin niggas to sleep, in six feet sweaps
Joe the Don, ready for war when it's on
Come on, tell me who can hold it down this long
I'm strong that my name will live on when I'm gone
Word bond, I conquer shit like Genghis Khan
You been warned by the Terror Squadrans, ghetto sergeant
Next time I see that ass in carter the'll be no pardon
Chorus 2X: Armageddon
Terror Squad pop, ain't nothin thicker than blood
I sware to God all my thugs die quicker than love
But life flex again, I'll be back livin it up
And If drop, you don't stop, keep lickin ya slugs

Aiyo, it started off since 1979
A young nigga that was born and destined to shine
I've been thru ups and downs, cash tellin cracks
Bustin rounds, I saw buyers get hit up in crossfires
Bosses retire, expired by hitmans for hire
Wines strictly for bitches, suckin dicks to get higher
In this world the more that you lust
Fake ones that do fake shit, only a dummy you trust
How can I have love walkin on this earth with dust
Hence the birth it was bug, I fiend search for the drugs
And being punched supply the guns, when we curse you with slugs
But fuck it, everything ain't goin to work for you cuz
I got to make these pesos in case lobes, niggas ya make fold
Like envelopes and take notes
Had an ash runnin the dash like JJ Stokes
When the gun smoke, I quote another Murder He Wrote
It's thug emotions that I'm lettin off my chest
Turn of the leader, tress and jess be the best like T.S
I'm in for life, ready to fight, my twins is hype
Better get it right, or get dented on sight
Chorus 2X

I'm just tryin to figure what right
Kinda hard to pull a trigger polite
Scriptures of right can't discribe how I'm sick in this life
Pick up a mic and end it all in a session
Blow my brains out, and let the kid sour the rezin
I told ya niggas my brain was way above ya heads
Niggas be slumpin dead, so snappin they spines
Tryin to see what I fed, peep what I read in the eyes of my rival
It might surprise, but jealously sometimes is the only way for survival
Don't get me wrong, I'm still a piece of shit
Street fires increased a bit, I might body a nigga for at least a nick
Quipin the forty power, 24 hours of Armageddon
The fly terrorist, chapter of sporty cowards
Holy sours, clense my sins thru repentence
A center of attention when the name of my enemy is mentioned
A nigga inchin, must be but stinkin how my squad run
Cuz I ain't dyin till my fam straight, sware on my godson

I Am Crack,The Darkside Vol. 1,2010.0,"(You know what you gotta understand is that it's a drug
That affects the brain chemistry of the user
And it causes things like paranoia, euphoria, insomnia, loss of appetite
And this really insatiable craving for more cocaine
People who smoke crack, they get this immediate
And intense release of dopamin in the brain
And once those dopamin levels plummet after just a few minutes
The smoker feels compelled to take another hit
Just to ease the feelings of depression and sadness)

We're reporting live in the streets of the Bronx today
Chronicling a deadly epidemic sweeping the nation
A wave of violent crimes have been linked to chronic addiction
To and distribution of a drug called)

CRACK...
They heat me up, I can see the top bubble waiting for me
Investigators sending snitches for me, uhh
Sold out, lines around the block
Niggas waiting for a whiff of that base and that rock
Chicago Bulls fitted, they calling me red top
You can find me in Humboldt Park soon as it gets dark
Or even in the daylight, even though it ain't right
I'm outside the church preying on some saved lives
Or sitting on a scale good enough to taste
I'm better than a protein shake, you lose weight
Nigga, no doubt I'm the hardest in the game
It's the rock, I ain't talking Jay, Biggs or Dame
I'm talking bling-bling, crack pipe and a collar
I make bums fight, wash cars for a dollar
A glass dick in the mouth of a model
Take your time, baby, don't spit, just swallow
BASE... ROCK!!

(Downtown Miami we've described on the scene
A intense gun battle between police and known drug dealers
From both the local area and New York City
The shooting's been ongoing since early this afternoon
And sources report that so far as many as
Nine people have been killed or wounded
This is just another chapter in what has been
Miami's epic struggle in the war against...
...I - I'm just a reporter!)

In the 80's I made so many premature babies
Put niggas in Mercedes, strapped with .380's
Uh, who you think made Nino smarter?
If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't be no Carter
Down in DC, yeah, shit got scary
Almost lost my political connect with Mayor Barry
They mix me with embalming fluid, it's unreal
And Jada said he cooked me on a Foreman Grill
Turn a happy home into a stash house
They can smoke me all night until they pass out
I'm cool with pops and I'm cool with moms
But they don't know that we cool, me and you share a bond
Franklins, Jacksons, get me to acting a fool
I transform into a bird on the move
Down south, yeah they on me, kid
I'm the shit letting base heads and zombies live
BASE... ROCK!!

Is increasingly penetrating every part of our social strand
Classified as a Schedule I substance by the DEA
Crack is wreaking havoc on a nation both in the inner city and the suburbs
With the war on drugs reaching a fever pitch

Their communities of this destructive drug)

From the cracks we slinging and the keys we flinging
Keep iron on me, niggas on the streets keep eying me
Til I Stuart Scott a nigga, trying to peep me sideways

It's good money, thick broads on big boats
Big business, big Benzes
26 rims lead to never ending sentences
I'm looking clean in a box
With a fresh line-up, nigga, your time's up
The dumps where they find you mangled and tied up
50 keys in the stash case the streets dried up
Short a few guns, need a couple of pies

Once he get money and fame, everybody starts aging
Shit ain't no longer the same, your own niggas be hatin'
Can't see another brother succeed
So you backstab 'em just to see how long he'll bleed
But I'm a strong man, pops always told me never fear no man
That's why I'm scarred up on both hands
And never love a bitch, hell naw I can't trust a bitch
Fuck 'em and leave 'em, that's the way you thug a bitch

Stop your facing, shank you with knives
You're missing a born soldier, operation declined
I'm like a optician, with a vision to shine
A hundred steps ahead of y'all, ain't no getting behind
Say what I choose cause I done payed my dues
Came from an error of pain and terror, alot of rainy weather
I learned to survive through the hatred and lies

And I ain't got to describe her
You know she beautiful

Blow holes through a Nigga if he touch my mama
You did whatever it took to keep the supper hot
And I remember when you worked at the number spot
Once the cops caught you I skipped school
Yeah I guess the cops was cool
They let me feed you
I cryed for hours till they finally freed you
Drop to my knees and screamed Mama we need you
Then you went back to school and got a job that's legal

Yeah Mami, I love you so much
For this pain, this love, you've been through so much
And I thank you for everything you done for us
You've been a survivor and we love you so much
I had to dedicate this song to you Mami
I had to tell the world how much I love you

Ay yo, yo yo
I never forget the night that changed out life
A neighbor was screaming Maria come out side
Something's wrong with your son I think he's getting high
Then you replied not my son he don't be getting high
Then you bathed him and tucked him to sleep
Yeah I knew from that day life wouldn't be sweet
He got in trouble with the law
Then you bailed him out
I got in trouble with the law then you bailed me out
It was one July the fourth
They tried to take me out
Shot me right in front of my mother
By Tracy's house
Now its time to change my life I think Rap's the answer
Same day I got signed you was diagnosed with Cancer
Doctor said it'd be a miracle if you survived
Then you looked in my eyes and said
Joey I don't want to die
I pray to god that he show us a sign
Now its fourteen years later and you still alive
Thank you God


God I thank you so much
My Mother has so much to see
So much to do
She's had such a painful life
Many nights I argue with you in my prayers but I know you're the boss
You kept her alive for a reason
Mama I'm a ride for you
I swear
Yo, I bet you proud of your son
He's a rap star now
Took you out of them projects and bought you that house
Got you that housekeeper to manicure the grounds
And I bought you that car that breaks the barrier of sound
You take care of Joey and I love you for that
And you raising John John and we love you for that
I guess Lisa was an Angel
God wanted her back
Damn I really miss my sister
Guess she's better where she's at
Mammy I love you
I want the world to know I love you
And every chance I get I'm a kiss you and hug you
Life wasn't easy everyday is a struggle
But like my niggas from Chi town say
It's all bubbles

Hoping my real mo'f**kers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
It's that shit right here
Took me like ten years to do
You know I cried doing this song
Man, so much pain
Mami you such a good woman
You a classy woman
I know you a private person
You don't want the world to know all your business
But I had to let them know how strong you are

Its like I'm always out to prove somethin
Everytime I stop on the block
I set up shop and try to move somethin
And I'm talkin about kilo's and pounds
Fuck a desert eagle
I got shit that spit over 300 rounds
Can tell by the scar on my neck
I spar with the best
Joey boombay-ay, hit hard with the left
Sharp with the right, I dont know why I bother
Y'all not retarded
Man ya know what the squadron is like
And he can get it too
But I let him die slow death I probably just collectin his food
I'm deadin ya crew
To tell ya the truth we not stoppin
I'm like lil' lease from b-street man I keep poppin
The streets knockin my shit, the d's watchin my shift
We can do this however, east Glock or the fifth
I leave you chumps to frame, right where you standin
Daughter slaughtered and maimed you should have paid the ransom

Its the T E R R O R squad, nigga get it right
Its the nigga Joe the Don
And the kid flow hard, ask the clique
Niggas be like you crazy, he got classic shit

Its the killa kid from the bronx
Holdin down to the death
You can hear the squad comin
By the sound of the techs
A hundred rounds in a sec
Leave you on front page
You would think I was down with the ROC
The way I ""Just Blaze""
I puff haze to keep my mind at ease
Can't wait for the day to see Shyne released
This hip hop shit is unjust, who you gon' trust
When most of these record label execs is dumb fucks
I keep a gun tuck under my belly
Only nigga on the island makin calls from the celly
We watchin belly on the DV, 60 inch TV
Flat shit attatch to the back of the CP
This game need me, I'm like gotti once I'm gone
All you gonna have left is a bunch of fake dons
Champagne with the women, run a game for the puddin
Its all the same, still runnin trains with my hoodmen
A bunch of goodmen, but dont get it confused
We like dinero in heat nigga, nothin to loose
I know you seen the shoot out scene
Dont make us reneact, cuz I rather be layed up in ?? with a featured actress

Yo, Nick, let's just go off on this bitch right here, man, classic shit

Go in, no punches no, nothin', man 
(No type of shit like that)
Let's go! Uh! 
(Cypher style)
 Yeah!

Now check it out, I'll kill your baby in your baby carriage
Bust a shotgun at your wedding that's a perfect marriage
Pray to God a nigga catch your G in his ride
Hit 'em with that (BRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!) Cracker, stand your ground
This is that cocaine rap, blood on the dope
I see zombies in the trap next to Phantoms and the ghost
Pussy on the pole, prophesies an option when you grow up on the stove and your pops is never home, uh
We miss the heroin with the tranquilizer, nigga
All that's missin' is the thrill of synthesizin', nigga
Junkies hobblin' back like like a Clydesdale
Throwin' niggas off the boat like crime fell
I'm on the top deck on the coast of Tropez
Spendin' coins, chasin' tail just to drop heads
High times, pull the mag fully loaded chrome
Rollin' stones on the cover of the Rolling Stone

Yo, Nicky Shades!

(Hey! Hey!)
Diamond D on the track! 
(Yeah!)
Ahhhhhh! 
(Hey!)

Hey
First of all wanna thank my connect for putti'n me on game and always bein' on deck
Young Cuban, so I had to get the link up on my neck
Then I link the homie Crack to make this money manifest
Architect the many schemes with the intent to dividends
To come direct in my direction type of shit when shit come in
My formula is immaculate, net worth the 
Slangin' shit the masses want while gettin' lifted by the hemp
My niggas always packin' pistols, wanna trip? Then be my guest
Blaow! And then we disappear with pure finesse
And bitches like Montana tryna end up more like Sosa
So I gamble with the coke until my cash flow runneth over
Got so many stash spots, my G, more weight than a boulder
Rather cliché to save a homie, fuck how you feel
And I'ma keep stackin' the stack and make this paper for real
From Dade County to The Bronx, I'm tryna come up for real
We'll score some bomb piff to reach to way higher conscious
Use the ruby from what's blazin to enlighten the darkness
[Outro: Fat Joe & 
Nick Shades

Aight, aight
Yo, Nick Nick Nick, chill chill, man! 
(Oh!)
Chill Nick!

Moving turkeys up til Christmas

Tried to hit her with conscious shit, she giving me brain in the alley
Leave the curtains open on purpose to let a bitch see
If she curious I'll put her on the work to lick be
Most of these rappers is actors buyin they entourages
Writing scripts to the judge just to duck a few charges
Tom Ford suits, slinging them pies
Try hang me out to dry for my criminal ties
Uh wettin yay way before I ever made the tape
Closed caskets, them ghetto bastards still an open case
Crocodile tears, you niggas never bust a gun
As long as you picked your last and you give her a son

Uh, yo, uh-huh, what, yea, uh... woo

Yea, mami jus like that bend down grab ya ankles, do it for crack
Damn should be illegal how that ass so fat
The way you shake yo shit make me wanna cop back
Is it ya motion causing all this commotion?
Forget niggas you even got bitches approaching
Who am I? I'm just a kid from the Bronx
If you love hip-hop you might of heard my shit once
Or maybe twice or like thirteen thousand times
I'm sick of it myself I'm loving the shine
Who else could it be but the squad's O.G?
Be laid up Wit chicks that resemble  ?
Half black, Japanese n something
Ménages, orgies believe me its nothing
The girls want tha facts got to feed 'em the lies
Who else can have you swimming in wealth the blink of an eye?

Big trucks, gee rides, we fly, twenty-fo' won't you sit in them tires
Believe me its nothing
G-4 ? Just won't mix with my ride keep a strap on my side
Believe me its nothing
Fast women, bad bitches, down hoes, hood rich, pitch up in Daddy's hooood
Believe me its nothing
Big trucks mean rides we fly t-squad our time
Believe me is nothing

Drop from Harlem even, more for Brooklyn
Still got my Name covering the walls in central Brooklyn
Haters want me, they love to slut me
Mad because my fat ass stay - living comfy
Down in d-r on the landing strip
When record sales get low we back to advancing bricks
Jack-of-all-trades we do that too
The only rapper get the Suge Knight effect when he come through
When pun died, half of y'all cried
The other half wanna See my demise
It was inevitable the sqaud'll reach new heights it's unforgettable
Follow the don is all we kept telling you
Once you down with the squad you can never give up
No need to get ya jewel's back, let them other crews do that
It's so ironic that I'm under fire I'm like 'mine'll get better one time' you dick blowers


No ya, not dreaming, it's not a visage
It's just another platinum plaque to add to my garage
Ten years in the game - and still going hard -
Fuck a club we flood the studio wit broads
Uhh, my whole life never been more focused
Joes the don ask Jennifer Lopez
What the hell in the world did they do to provoke this?
The newspaper reported the scene was atrocious
And still find the time to please girls
Even get hit on by the chick on Cenas world
We beens about it, y'all dudes is frontin'

Nigga's will ift you off your feet wit the Can-yan
Three in the chest and one in the part
For disrespect you, get left right in front of ya moms

Thug type, ""Set It Off"", like Jada
And this chick go both ways, don't hate her
Back in the block, they use to try to play her
Till the Don out her to the qualities much greater
Net Worth, put the tool in the skirt
Which you fools know about gettin head in reverse
About, clockin grips, and coppin whips
You muthaf**ker's stay frontin, stop poppin shit
Let's not forget, who be gettin robbed wit the choker

And you know Joe stay wit tha mack

Reaganomics pushed our backs against the wall
We was only payin' homage to the ones that came before us, like
Lucky Luciano, and Al Capone
Originators of sellin' raw, no liquor stores
Talkin' Cobain, cocaine, that hard white
Pumpin' Coltrane, the go wings, that's all white
Hustle my way to the top, I took flight
Haters try to pull the ladder to stagger this crook's life
Sittin' in my castle surrounded by naked dancers
And fully automatic sticks deadlier than cancer
No answer for this life, we just live it
The only question now, is you with it?
Travel so much, you swear a nigga move his pivot
Centurions of G5's, skies is the limit
It's no Biggie, I does it in my sleep
Darkside 2, yeah, we do it for the streets, muh'fuckers

Fast cars with bad broads
Every day we be about that dollar
Champagne poppin' now
So you can't stop us, we on our hustle
So fly... yeah we live the fast life (the fast life...)
We hustle, yeah we 'bout that life

Yo, niggas spit bars, while my niggas sit behind 'em
Servin sentences ever since Jordash was designin'
Gazelle frames bringin' shade to my environment
I made my bread already, and I'ma lie on it
Pull off the lot, and every bitch got they eye on it
Tuxedo, black Phantom, nigga put a bow tie on it
Married to the game, glass shaped pools
Swimmin' in the champagne, every day's a honeymoon, woo!
Invisible settings all in the bezel
From Rolex to the treatment, the suites is all presidential
No safety on the plastic
The Glock got, 40 ways to put you in a casket, choose one
And never push the pedal 'til the shoes come
Supplyin' is a habit 'til they put yo' ass on News One
You got one life to live, go 'head and prove somethin'
I know niggas ain't comin home 'til two thousand two somethin'

Fast cars with bad broads
Every day we be about that dollar

When the cops rush, niggas had to run, stash the cracks in the pay phone nigga!
Damn, Mr. President, triple gold diamond bezzled it
Heavy is the head that wears the crown in the tub screamin' fly pelican
In the rooftops flipped pigeons, niggas losin' their religion
Gold, lots of those over Coca-Cola, sweaters pitchin' what was stitched in

What you know about pain?

Yeah, uh!

Against all odds, Phil Collins, hear her callin' In The Air Of The Night
That sound of crack fiends in tag teams suckin' air out the pipe
Down the block from where it began took his last breath, dirty mattress, uh
I feel like Al Capone how they did him dirty for them fuckin' taxes, uh
Rest in peace Cato, that Chi-Raq, I sling that bitch

Suede top, mink floors, outside sunny dew
Rims like 26, wrist watch extra chip
And fuck ya baby momma, she can suck a nigga dick
This ain't the past, the present, I'm the future
They size me like I'm super but maneuver like a cougar
Joe bazooka, I-E-D with the flow
And I can show you how to get knee deep with the coke
This that genocide talk, they killin' babies again
And there's lines around the block like it's the 80's again
Yeah, The Darkside and you don't wanna go to this place
Where I got special powers, I could punch a hole through ya face
More coca to taste, more bitches to beat up
Got lips like Meagan Good, and a ass like Vita
Most niggas'll go down if she tell 'em to eat her
But she don't love no more, she seen my episode of 
Cheaters
I'm too high, whole 'nother zone, I'm far-fetched
They put me on the back of that yellow bus like Artest
But R. less, that's that sexy music
Yeah we playin' the background when I shoot it down like cupid
Tell shorty, ""Get the balls,"" the other two on the dick
The triple play is the deal, damn my life is the shit
And this ain't about money, it's 'bout who's real and who's fake
Who's really a gangsta? Who's fuckin' with Jake?
I throw bodies in the lakes and the others I burn 'em
Stuff a apple in his mouth, and over fire I turn 'em

According to you I'ma speed crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more then a scene
I adore you my wife my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray I'm on it everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)


Yea how I'm supposed to start this
First and first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that

Haha
This is going out to you, you and you and you

To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and
Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me

The scent of weed got me thinkin I remember the time
1979 they planned a biological test
The doctor said I'll be fine and planted a mic in my chest

So what's next? a bomb gold at the back of my neck
I'm in the U.S. everyday still got shit in check
Elly Yel crying freedom while he's facin the teck

Ain't no changin what's left

Cause I know the true fiends

You fuckin with the wrong guys
You won't like it when you call Lah
And that's six feet hit you with twin piece
Double desert man it's pleasant when the grim reaps
Shit's deep but you gotta love it
I put the shot into your stomach catch your body if you feel for nothin

(Why me)
Why these motherfuckers watchin me
(Why me)
Why they actin like we got the keys
(Why me)
Why these homies and clowns going around
Cloning the town down tryin to throw me with Gotti
Under the ground
(Why me)
Why my life had to be so rough
(Why me)
Why the fuck I had such bad luck
(Why me)
Why the judge wanna lock me up
Throw away the key and watch me rust

On this beat nigga, uh
Once again back is the incredible
The incredible
Stop the presses, I'm back, cook Coke, that is
Crack, ain't been gone before a week
And still the fiends line up for blocks till it ain't no space
Pile high to the top of the Empire State
Crack once again so you know it
Ain't been this much hype since that Nas and that Hov shit
Coke spit, the fo' fifth chrome spit
Doe getter since I was small, no better than yours
Truly just check the suicide doors
Thirty inch grill and that black mink floor
Lookin' back I did the shit to death
I guess I ain't killin' it this rhyme, I'm here to raise the dead
I'm here to raise the stakes this time it's ten mill
Supply the sink ill, ship five and then build
And I'm Joe Crack, BX finest
Do rewind this Terror Squad behind this
I got the streets on smash
Niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right
(The incredible, the incredible)
I got the heat on blast
Love the seats reclining on that mean G4
'Cause down in New York they saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right

Dope man, dope man, I got that coke man
Brother Joe, man the king of the streets
TS, we incredibly credible like Stun said
It was inevitable the metal was 'gon bump heads
And you know that K go chop, chop, chop
In broad daylight right in front of the One Stop Shop
I'm from Misery Boulevard, right across the street
From I Hope You Die Place, in school, study the crime rate
That's when it became apparent to me
That the pimps and hustlers be apparent to me
I plead innocent your honor
I'm just a product of the streets, product of some beef
Product of that Cappadonna Armani three piece
Problem is when I win, my team eats
But wait, just think the opposite of that
You'll be starin' down the opposite side of them gats, nigga
I got the streets on smash
Niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right

Love the seats reclining on that mean G4
'Cause down in New York they saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right

Yo, now have you ever felt the metal to your melon, it just cock back?
Ask for the money and drugs, and you ain't got that
Where the cops at? Prayin' that they comin'
Just a few seconds your brains be layin' on your stomach
On my waist you know I got keep that oven
For ya ginger bread pie ass niggas

Bake the cake and serve you niggas humble pie

I'm the type of brother to beat you down then fuck you up
Grabbin the mic to rock on tonight to see if the crowd will care
Step to the Gizzy you dare, you get lit up like a flare
From the, Bronx the Boogie Down battleground, Uptown
Turn smiles to frowns as I smack clowns around
Shorts I don't take em, bones I fracture and break
So make not one mistake, or you get eat like steaks at Frank's G
Jack in June, gettin swept, with a broom soon
To meet your doom, mornin night or the afternoon
Harassin the mic, with a verbal assault of rap
Stick lyrics back to back, that'll pack, to keep myself on wax
Hot like an iron, to defeat the kids you gotta keep tryin
If you spread any rumors sayin you took me out, you're lyin
A human beat is struck I know when it really sounds trunk
I'm never ever buck I don't give a fuck if you think that I'm a sucker
Parties that I've made, people wonder how long it lasted
Lyrics that are so hardcore, it'll leave you flabbergasted
Gasp for air, inhale it hold it in
And just wait for the rest of the posse to begin
I'm the human beat magician with the bag full of fun
Ammunition's the addition to the sawed offfff!

So act like you know or get ate-n like stew, chief
I hold my own yet don't stand alone, I'm well known

It's a stick-up, which proves, my getaway is butter smooth
I'm not the Smooth Operator with the ladies
But I get kinda crazy if you let me pick the daisies

I never ran, cause in my hand, I keeps a gun
Representin where I'm from in a bumrush
Roll up, flip, then be out on the hush-hush
Don't touch or feel, it's real, showin mad skills
Hotter than heat, yet colder than the Catskills
Don't play the yard, fake Gods ain't got nuttin for me
I'm loungin with Tone and Corey
On one-six-oh, then I go and check Fat Joe
On Trinity, the South Bronx vicinity
Smokin up your favorite MC like a dread smoke skunk
Cause I'm another wild nigga from the Bronx
Hittin em up, settin em up, splittin em up, gettin em up

Rollin over niggas like a truck

My rhymes are homicidal, I take your title

I get you open on the freestyle tip
Now are you hip to the way I flip the script? Hah

We pull quick and leave ’em choking
Soakin’ in his own blood with his chest open
This last hope and ain’t no comin’ after that
All the shit the nigga was talkin’, he should of packed the gat
Sex money and drugs, sex honeys and clubs
Niggas talk, but don’t want it with us
Uh, niggas packing, but don’t want it to bust
To tell the truth, niggas get scared straight on the bus
We the truth, ain’t no changing us
Niggas hating away, we be raking the bucks in
I’m still in the projects, man, still flippin’ powder man
Still mr. Knee cruisin’ Holidan

If any nigga try, then every nigga die
They slip up, this G shit ain’t easy

Don’t get set up, nigga, ask a muthafuckin’ loo
No algebra how i break you down to pieces
Then sprinkle the town with some pounds of ether
Errbody know nothin’ less than a knot
Half the beef ain’t censored just to keep ’em in line
Extortion, never understood man it’s crazy
How niggas selling crack is paying niggas for safety
Lately this rap shit goin’ the same way
If ya know that nigga ass, then that nigga gon pay
It’s cooked coke, Joe hard, whatever you call it
Just know a nigga going hard at whoever want it
Flown and it’s snookin’, even in central bookin’
Errbody sleepin’ on the floor when Joe’s in the buildin’
Not hatin’ black, don’t know why they take it a-crack
I don’t exaggerate, I’m just statin’ the facts
Terror error the squad, most identic
If I ain’t present, I’mma make sure the streets know who sent it Nigga! Y’all know what the fuck this is!

'Cause I got shooters on the corner guaranteed to hit the shot
Jesus Shuttlesworth, you know we got it for movin' turkeys all through Christmas
Bricks, we caught 'em by the balls
Stunt on y'all, rose gold Rollie. Presidential
Hunnid racks on me, that's the bare essential
Don't tell the Feds though, they got me for a ticket
But when I touch the town, I'm droppin' 50 on the strippers

Darkside 3
Lord. provide me With a couple real niggas that'll hold it down
That'll bust some rounds, yeah, yeah
Darkside 3
Lord. provide me With a couple real bitches that'll hold it down
They gon' be around to lay it down, yeah
Yeah, uh

I'm boardin' up Knox this bitch to the Trayvon rally
Hit 'em with conscious shit, she givin' me brain in the alley
Leave the curtains open on purpose to let a bitch see
Is she curious? I put her on to what the lick be
Most of these rappers is actors buyin' they entourages
Writin' scripts to the judge just to duck a few charges
Tom Ford suits slingin' them pies
Try to hang me out to dry for my criminal ties, uh
Wet and yay way before I ever made the tape
Closed caskets, a ghetto bastard's still an open case
Crocodile tears, you niggas never bust your gun
Elementary, bitch, picture your last  to your son

Darkside 3
Lord, provide me with a couple real niggas that'll hold it down
That'll bust some rounds, yeah, yeah
With a couple real bitches that'll hold it down
They gon' be around to lay it down, yeah",https://genius.com/Fat-joe-darkside-lyrics
